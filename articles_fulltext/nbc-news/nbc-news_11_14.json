He was booked into jail but released on $50,000 bond Wednesday evening.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said in a tweet later on Wednesday, \"We can confirm that today LAPD Detectives arrested Michael Avenatti on suspicion of domestic violence.\"\n\nThe department said it was \"an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available.\"\n\nAvenatti released a statement Wednesday denying the allegations.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank the hard working men and woman of the LAPD for their professionalism they were only doing their jobs in light of the completely bogus allegations against me,\" he said in the statement. \"I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke to reporters after his release, saying he has been an advocate for women's rights his entire career.\n\n\"I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing,\" Avenatti told reporters Wednesday evening. \"I am a father to two beautiful, smart daughters. I would never disrespect them by touching a woman inappropriately or striking a woman.\"\n\nAvenatti did not take questions and went to his car.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday morning, Avenatti seemed to blame Trump supporter and conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl for his arrest.\n\n\"First Mueller and now me. When we are fully exonerated I am coming for you Jacob Wohl aka Surefire,\" Avenatti tweeted about the former hedge fund manager who has been accused of playing a central role in a smear campaign against special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAvenatti did not have a court appearance set yet. The LAPD's West Los Angeles Division, which took the report, will take the case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to decide the next steps.\n\nTMZ and BuzzFeed News had first reported that Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Early reports indicated the incident involved Avenatti's estranged wife, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, but her lawyer released a statement to NBC News denying those accounts.\n\n\"Ms. Storie-Avenatti was not subject to any such incident on Tuesday night,\" the statement said. \"Further, she was not at Mr. Avenatti\u2019s apartment on the date that this alleged incident occurred. My client states that there has never been domestic violence in her relationship with Michael and that she has never known Michael to be physically violent toward anyone. My client requests that the media respect her privacy and that of the parties young son.\"\n\nThe LAPD did not disclose the identity of the reporting party or the exact nature of the injuries.\n\nMichael Avenatti, shown here last month, was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles for alleged domestic abuse, which he denies. Willy Sanjuan / Invision/AP\n\nAvenatti became a well-known fixture on cable news for representing Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She claims she had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006, which he has denied, and was paid hush money to keep silent.\n\nThe Vermont Democratic Party said in a statement late Wednesday that it was canceling events over the weekend at which Avenatti was to speak and would refund all ticket sales.\n\nBlankstein reported from Los Angeles, Clark and Madani reported from New York."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Family offers warning to travelers after son killed on trip to Mexico", "description": "27-year-old Taylor Meyer was stabbed to death while visiting Playa del Carmen for a friend\u2019s birthday.

At the time, it was in the throes of a financial crisis, owing billions to creditors without the cash to pay off the debt.\n\nSome 3,000 people are estimated to have died from the hurricane and its aftermath. The hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico's electrical grid and infrastructure and forced some businesses to close for months or shut down completely, wreaking more havoc on the island's already gasping economy.\n\nTrump\u2019s request was first reported by Axios, which said he had apparently misread an article in The Wall Street Journal and believed the island's government would improperly use relief funds to pay down its debt.\n\nThe president had also claimed in an October tweet that the island was using restructuring and recovery money to pay its debt.\n\nBut neither Puerto Rican officials nor the fiscal board overseeing its financial recovery have ever publicly said they plan to use federal money to directly pay bondholders, and any such plan would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nTrump's plan has drawn angry rebukes, with critics saying his charge about the debt is not based on any evidence, while others have scoffed at his understanding of the government process.\n\n\u201cThis may be a constitutional lesson for the president, but it\u2019s Congress that allocates funding and through oversight power can make sure (Puerto Rico\u2019s) using it for disaster relief,\u201d said Rep. Darren Soto, D.-Fla.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said he wasn\u2019t going to comment on \u201crumors,\u201d the Puerto Rico newspaper El Vocero reported Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf there is something concrete to say about Puerto Rico then he can say it,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 told the newspaper. \u201cIf not, we keep working.\u201d\n\nRossell\u00f3\u2019s office did not respond to an NBC request for comment.\n\nThe White House, responding to NBC's request for comment, said it had allocated $91 billion in aid to Puerto Rico, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There was no comment on whether the president requested an end to spending on Puerto Rico.\n\nA congressional aide for the House Appropriations Committee said the committee had not received any \"such instruction or information.\" The aide said the committee is working \"to determine what may be needed for all disasters and emergencies, to determine if and when more funding is necessary.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees said they had not been informed of such a request from Trump beyond what had been reported by Axios.\n\nTrump has stumbled a few times when it comes to Puerto Rico. His administration has been criticized for its slow response to the island after the hurricane. Trump was ridiculed for throwing paper towels to Puerto Ricans during a visit to the island and for denying the death toll was 3,000.\n\nPuerto Rico experts said the president appears to be confused about what is happening with Puerto Rico\u2019s attempt to restructure its debt and the role played by the federal investment in the island\u2019s reconstruction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he really understands what is going on. I think he is mixing two different things,\u201d said Federico de Jes\u00fas, a consultant at FDJ Solutions who has worked on Puerto Rico issues. \u201cHe\u2019s engaging in the same victim blaming. Either he doesn\u2019t know the need or doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nDavid Ferreira, a consultant at Ferreira Strategies, said that the money Congress appropriated for Puerto Rico's reconstruction could only be diverted by Puerto Rican officials for something else with the approval of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.\n\nFurthermore, Ferreira said, if Republicans decided to comply with Trump's request to withhold money from Puerto Rico, it would \"come \"at a great cost\" because Democrats will control the House in January.\n\n\"Is hurting Puerto Rico really a priority for the Republicans in Congress? I don't think it is,\" Ferreira said.\n\nTo help Puerto Rico out of its financial crisis, Congress set up a fiscal control board in 2017 to deal with the island's debt, implement spending cuts and oversee its budget.\n\nPresident Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters file\n\nThe board's fiscal plan, updated after Maria, assumes what some say is an overly rosy picture of how much money Puerto Rico will have to cover debt service and has made a deal with bondholders based on the assumptions.\n\nThe board\u2019s projection, which was lower before Hurricane Maria, takes into account the expected economic effect on Puerto Rico\u2019s economy of the investment of the federal restructuring and relief money, according to Hector Cordero-Guzm\u00e1n, a professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York system.\n\n\u201cYou take a dollar and use it to buy equipment and supplies and to hire personnel, that person has to pay payroll tax, that goes to the Puerto Rico treasury,\u201d Cordero-Guzman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not, take a dollar and give it to a bondholder. When it goes into the local economy, it makes it seem there will be more available resources for the government of Puerto Rico to pay its debt.\u201d\n\nWork on the road to El Yunque Rain Forest on Sept. 19, 2018 in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Jonathan Allen and Hallie Jackson\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump pledged his support for a major overhaul of sentencing laws and prisoner re-entry programs at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's backing for the package, which is still being drafted in the Senate, has been seen as a key factor in providing political cover for Republicans and Democrats to vote for an overhaul that would diminish criminal penalties for some offenders and make it easier for former inmates to find work.\n\nTrump framed a planned reduction in certain mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and other proposed sentencing provisions as a bid to fix President Bill Clinton's 1994 anti-crime law.\n\n\"It rolls back some of the provisions of the Clinton crime law that disproportionately harmed [the] African-American community,\" Trump said at a White House event.\n\nAt the same time, he praised a bipartisan push for re-evaluating criminal justice issues \u2014 even though none of the lawmakers who joined him at the White House were Democrats.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who attended the event, and Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who did not, released a joint statement praising Trump's position following his remarks.\n\n\"President Trump\u2019s endorsement of the bipartisan criminal justice reform compromise is an important step in our shared effort to promote safe communities and improve justice,\" they said. \"By preparing inmates bound for release to become productive citizens, we can reduce crime and the social and economic cost of incarceration. And by ensuring that punishments fit the crimes, we can better balance the scales of justice.\"\n\nThe House passed a piece of the proposal earlier this year with 360 votes \u2014 including 226 Republicans and 134 Democrats.\n\nThe deal emerging in the Senate would include a retroactive application of a 2010 law designed to create greater parity in sentencing for crack and powder cocaine convictions.\n\nTrump thanked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been the White House point person on its delayed criminal justice reform efforts.\n\n\"He feels very deeply about it,\" Trump said.\n\nKushner wanted to push the effort forward in September, according to a White House official, who said the senior Trump adviser met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then to try to see if the Senate could \u201cjam this in\u201d before the election.\n\nMcConnell, per this official, essentially asked the White House to \u201clet this go until after the election,\u201d and in return promised to whip the vote. He suggested Kushner \u201cfinalize your language, shore up support\u201d and then McConnell would check on the vote count and try to take it to the floor if it had enough backing.\n\nDespite the fact that former attorney general Jeff Sessions had opposed many of the suggested sentencing reforms, this official said it was \u201ccoincidental\u201d that they had happened so soon after his departure, and \"no correlation\" between his exit and the announcement; before his exit, they said, Sessions had appeared to be on board with most of the elements involved.\n\nAnd despite the president's repeated nods Wednesday to the bipartisan nature of the push, there were no Democratic lawmakers appeared at Wednesday's event. And despite the president's endorsement, it\u2019s still not clear how involved he plans to be in working the phones to try to sway votes.\n\nStill, the White House official pointed to behind-the-scenes talks between administration aides and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, predicting the package would \u201cway more than clear 60 votes\u201d in the Senate."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Corky Siemaszko", "title": "Pacific Gas & Electric stock price tumbles ahead of lawsuit by California fire victims", "description": "The admission by California's biggest power company that it may be to blame for at least one of the deadly fires ravaging the state sent company stock prices tumbling Wednesday by as much as 30 percent.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pacific-gas-electric-stock-price-tumbles-ahead-lawsuit-california-fire-n936336", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2642691/1811120paradise-fire-mc-9333_5e41a489cdb322357ba191b03cf796f6.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:52:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The value of utility's shares were about $25 on Wednesday. The stock closed at 25.59, down 21.79 percent at the bell, according to CNBC.\n\nThe steep decline on Wall Street came after PG&E admitted in a document filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its equipment may have sparked the Camp Fire that\u2019s burning in Northern California \u2014 and that they might not have enough insurance to cover the expected cost of the damage.\n\n\"While the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation, if the Utility's equipment is determined to be the cause, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage,\" the company said in the document, which was obtained by CNBC.\n\nThat would \"have a material impact on PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\"\n\nNot long after that, a trio of law firms who refer to themselves as the Northern California Fire Lawyers filed suit Tuesday in San Francisco County Superior Court alleging that PG&E failed to properly maintain, repair and replace its equipment and that \u201cits inexcusable behavior contributed to the cause of the \u2018Camp Fire.'\"\n\nA volunteer search and rescue crew from Calaveras County comb through a home destroyed by the Camp Fire in Paradise, California on November 13, 2018.

More than 237,000 acres have been consumed by the blazes, and virtually the entire town of Paradise, California, was reduced to ashes.\n\nIn anticipation of the expected lawsuits, PG&E has already drawn down $3 billion from its credit line, CNBC reported. But even before the admission, the utility was taking steps to protect itself.\n\nCEO Geisha Williams told stock holders on Nov. 5 that she would once again try to change a state policy called \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d which holds utilities responsible for any damage done by their equipment even if they have done nothing intentionally wrong.\n\nPG&E is still dealing with 200 or so lawsuits from the deadly 2017 wildfires.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection blamed PG&E equipment for starting at least 16 of those fires, which could cost the utility up to an estimate $15 billion in damages."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Anna Schecter", "title": "Exclusive text messages show Roger Stone and friend discussing WikiLeaks plans", "description": "Roger Stone exchanged text messages with friend about WikiLeaks in the days before the site released emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/exclusive-text-messages-show-stone-friend-discussing-wikileaks-plans-n936371", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646486/181114-roger-stone-se-341p_2633c0357d0e2831ce47e43424b55814.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:44:46Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Anna Schecter\n\nSix days before WikiLeaks began releasing Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails, Roger Stone had a text message conversation with a friend about WikiLeaks, according to copies of phone records obtained exclusively by NBC News.\n\n\u201cBig news Wednesday,\u201d the Stone pal, radio host Randy Credico, wrote on Oct. 1, 2016, according to the text messages provided by Stone. \u201cNow pretend u don\u2019t know me.\u201d\n\n\u201cU died 5 years ago,\u201d Stone replied.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Credico wrote back. \u201cHillary\u2019s campaign will die this week.\u201d\n\nText messages from Oct. 1, 2016 provided by Roger Stone to NBC News.\n\nCredico turned out to be wrong on one count \u2014 nothing incriminating about Clinton came out that Wednesday. But two days later, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released its first dump of emails stolen from Podesta, altering the trajectory of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nStone, a confidante of then-candidate Donald Trump and notorious political trickster, has denied any collusion with WikiLeaks.\n\nBut the text messages provided by Stone to NBC News show that Credico appeared to be providing regular updates to Stone on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s plans in the days before the hacked emails were released. In the texts, Credico told Stone he had insights into Assange's plans through a longtime friend, who was also Assange\u2019s lawyer, according to the text messages.\n\nReached Wednesday, Credico downplayed the text exchanges. \u201cThere's absolutely nothing there that I had any knowledge of anything that Assange was going to do because I didn't,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\n\"Where's the smoking gun?\" he added.\n\nNew York radio host Randy Credico appeared before the grand jury hearing evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election on Sept. 7, 2018, in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin / AP file\n\nStone said the messages support the story he's been telling all along. \u201cThese text messages prove beyond dispute that Randy Credico was the source who told me of the significance of the material that Julian Assange told CNN he had and would publish in June 2016 and that Credico\u2019s source was indeed a woman attorney who worked for WikiLeaks,\" Stone said. \"If Randy said anything different to the grand jury, he perjured himself under oath.\u201d\n\nStone\u2019s lawyer Grant Smith said the messages vindicate his client.\n\n\u201cThe texts provided to NBC News demonstrate that my client, Roger Stone, has been consistent for the past two years in his assertion that Randy Credico was the person who was providing him what limited information Mr. Stone had regarding WikiLeaks,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating whether Stone had any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to publish Podesta's emails, according to people familiar with the investigation. Nearly a dozen Stone associates have been summoned by Mueller to appear before his Washington grand jury, the sources said.\n\nThe text messages obtained by NBC News appear to show that Stone and Credico exchanged messages about Assange having damaging information about Clinton at least as early as Aug. 27, 2016. The texts show that at 6:07 p.m. that day, Credico wrote to Stone, \u201cJulian Assange has kryptonite on Hillary.\u201d\n\nStone did not appear to reply to that particular message but the conversations ramped up over the following weeks.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s on for tomorrow,\u201d Credico texted Stone on Oct. 3, 2016, according to the messages obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe message is time-stamped 2:42 p.m. About 40 minutes earlier, Stone fired off a tweet suggesting he had intimate knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. It\u2019s not clear if a time zone difference meant that Stone had already received Credico\u2019s message, or if there was another reason behind the timing of his tweet.\n\n\u201cI have total confidence that @wikileaks and my hero Julian Assange will educate the American people soon #LockHerUp,\u201d read Stone\u2019s tweet.\n\nLater that day, Credico texted Stone asking, \u201cWhy can't you get Trump to come out and say that he would give Julian Assange Asylum[?]\u201d according to the texts obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe texts appear to show that Credico sent another message less than three hours later: \u201cOff the Record Hillary and her people are doing a full-court press they keep Assange from making the next dump\u2026That's all I can tell you on this line\u2026Please leave my name out of it.\"\n\nStone responded with a question: \u201cSo nothing will happen tonight?\u201d according to the texts obtained by NBC News.\n\nCredico responded: \u201ctuesday\u2026.There is so much stuff out there\u2026 There will be an announcement but not on the balcony.\u201d\n\nCopies of text messages from Oct. 3, 2016 provided by Roger Stone to NBC News. Roger Stone\n\nCredico followed up five minutes later: \u201cAnd by the way your friend did not have a meeting with Julian Assange that's a complete lie.\u201d\n\nStone replied: \u201cHow would u know, rummy?\u201d according to the texts obtained by NBC News.\n\nAccording to Stone, the \u201cfriend\u201d the men were referring to was blogger Charles Ortel, who Stone mistakenly thought had met with Assange.\n\nCredico responded to that message: \u201cBecause I'm best friends with [Assange's] lawyer and leave it at that and leave it alone.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer Credico referred to is Margaret Ratner Kunstler. Kunstler declined requests for comment.\n\nThe next day, Oct. 4, Assange announced that his organization would publish emails related to the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe email dump actually came three days later, only hours after The Washington Post released a recording of a lewd conversation between then-candidate Donald Trump and TV host Billy Bush."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Trump gives support to legislation overhauling sentencing laws", "description": "President Trump makes statements supporting  to legislation overhauling sentencing laws and prisoner re-entry programs", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-gives-support-to-legislation-overhauling-sentencing-laws-and-prisoner-re-entry-programs-1370722371953", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_trumpprisonreform_181114.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:41:38Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump says troops will use 'lethal force' at the border 'if they have to' 01:31"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Angel Torres", "title": "Pregnant mother shot dead with a crossbow, but her unborn child survived", "description": "Sara Muhmmad, who was eight months pregnant was shot and killed with a crossbow, but her baby was saved through an emergency C-section.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pregnant-mother-shot-dead-crossbow-her-unborn-child-survived-n936271", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646276/181114-sana-muhammad-se-116p_ae9cf785f6fd1d11305e30983dea31a7.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:31:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Clark praised the accused shooter, Robert Bowers, on social media as a \u201chero\u201d and said the victims \u201cdeserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said it believed there was a connection between Clark and the shooting. In an affidavit, the bureau said it found a posting showing that Clark called the Pittsburgh attack \u201ca dry run for things to come.\u201d Clark, 30, was arrested on gun charges on Tuesday, and a federal complaint explored potential connections between Clark and Bowers on the social network Gab, where white supremacists have made a home in the last two years after being banned by more mainstream sites.\n\nBut according to an NBC News analysis of Clark\u2019s social media posts, the claim that Clark had insider knowledge of the shootings is incorrect. A look at Clark\u2019s posting history shows that he was referring to a different alleged terrorist \u2014 the man accused of sending pipe bombs to Trump critics \u2014 and that Clark posted the comment about a \u201cdry run\u201d before the Pittsburgh shooting took place.\n\nClark\u2019s profile has been removed from Gab. The archives of his posts were viewed by NBC News via pushshift.io, a social media analysis tool operated by data scientist Jason Baumgartner.\n\nThe claim of a connection between Clark and Bowers came in an affidavit in which FBI Special Agent Michael Bauknight wrote that Clark\u2019s account \u201cshows a picture of Robert Bowers, armed with a gun, splattered in what appears to be blood, followed by the following post by Clark: \u2018Nah he was BASED! Get used to it libtards. This was a dry run for things to come.\u2019\u201d (Based is a term of approval and praise among extremists on the far right.)\n\n\u201cThis statement implies that Jeffery Clark did know more about the attack in the Tree-of-Life synagogue, and that there was more to come,\u201d Bauknight wrote.\n\nBut Clark made the post referred to in the FBI affidavit on Oct. 26, a day before the Pittsburgh shooting, NBC News found. In the post, Clark was replying to another Gab user complaining about Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man who allegedly mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. \u201cThis Sayoc guy is a f---ing idiot. How tiresome. We have to get saddled with this s--- and blamed for it? F---ing hell,\u201d user \u201cArthur Frayn\u201d wrote.\n\nClark replied by praising Sayoc as \"based\u201d and suggesting \"libtards\" get used to the violence.\n\nAnd the photo that the FBI claims Clark shared of Robert Bowers, splattered with blood, is actually an alt-right meme, which was posted on an article about the attempted pipe bombings on a popular neo-Nazi website one day before Clark\u2019s post, and two days before Bowers\u2019 shooting.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office\n\nIn the meme, a bearded man in a fisherman\u2019s hat is holding a gun. Along with splattered blood, the words, \u201cThey cut off our social security so we cut off their heads,\u201d covers the main image and a stamp reading \u201cBoomerwaffen Division\u201d is fixed to the bottom, a portmanteau of a term for older Americans and the Atomwaffen Division, a national socialist terrorist organization.\n\nNBC News found the image through a reverse image search on the Russian search engine Yandex of Clark\u2019s post, which was provided to NBC News by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. During Clark\u2019s hearing Tuesday, prosecutors acknowledged they were looking into questions about the FBI\u2019s analysis of Clark\u2019s posts in the charging documents. Clark\u2019s lawyer, the FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nClark was charged on Tuesday with transporting a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high-capacity magazines.\n\nHe was a prolific user of Gab, which briefly shut down in October after its web host and support services abandoned the site following reports that Bowers had posted anti-Semitic comments there before the shooting.\n\nClark and Bowers both followed each other on the site, according to an archive of Bowers\u2019 removed account, viewed by NBC News. They were among each other\u2019s hundreds of followers, but a review of their thousands of posts shows no actual conversation between the two.\n\nUnder the username @PureWhiteEvil, Clark posted over 3,700 times to Gab. Clark explained in August that he had moved to the site after multiple failed attempts to evade Twitter's ban on his neo-Nazi content. \"I used to be DC Stormer, DC Death Squad, then DC Bowl Patrol (which preceeded BOWL GANG) before giving up on being able to stay on Twitter after which I retired here.\"\n\nOn Gab, Clark idolized Dylann Roof, the man who shot and killed nine black people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, and obsessed over \"cultural marxism\" and baseless conspiracies involving vast pedophelia rings. He also posted hate speech and threats, including over 60 calls to throw Jewish and black people, journalists and perceived political enemies \"feet first into a woodchipper.\"\n\nFollowing the Pittsburgh shootings, Clark posted defensively against outrage over the killings and railed against calls for Gab to self-censor users.

Learn more at NoGays.org.\u201d\n\nThe billboard is part of a new campaign that aims to draw attention to the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, which has been labeled an anti-LGBTQ \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a designation the group disputes. Since its founding nearly 25 years ago, ADF has been linked to efforts seeking to criminalize homosexuality, restrict transgender people\u2019s access to sex-segregated facilities and permit businesses to deny service to LGBTQ people.\n\nCaleb Cade, a spokesman for Citizens for Transparency, the advocacy group behind the campaign, said the powerful nonprofit law group has fought for years to undermine lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer rights, often behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cWe want to remind people that there are still really insidious forces at work against our community,\u201d Cade told NBC News. \u201cADF has been leading that war for a long time, with tens of millions of dollars to do it.\u201d\n\nThe Times Square billboard, which went up Tuesday and is expected to remain through February, directs viewers to the campaign\u2019s website, which provides information about ADF\u2019s past works and links to news articles about its efforts to \u201cmake LGBT people second-class citizens.\u201d\n\nIn response to the newly launched campaign, ADF\u2019s senior counsel, Jeremy Tedesco, shot back at Citizens for Transparency, calling it \u201can anonymous group that simply copies and pastes false claims\" of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\u201cADF is one the nation\u2019s most respected and successful Supreme Court advocates, working to preserve our fundamental freedoms of speech, religion and conscience,\u201d Tedesco wrote in an email to NBC News. \u201cADF is not litigating any cases, pursuing any legislation, nor supporting the passage of any laws domestically or internationally that criminalize sodomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRELENTLESSLY EXTREME\u201d\n\nADF was founded in 1994 by a group of influential Christian leaders, including Alan Sears, co-author of the 2003 book \"The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today,\u201d and James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and author of the 2004 book \u201cMarriage Under Fire,\u201d which claimed same-sex marriage would \u201cdestroy the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood and gender.\u201d\n\nHeidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, said her organization first became aware of ADF in 2013, when it discovered the nonprofit was advising anti-LGBTQ organizations overseas \u2014 in places including Belize and Jamaica \u2014 on how to keep anti-sodomy laws on their books.\n\n\"If there\u2019s an outrageous and ill-founded lawsuit happening against trans people, it\u2019s usually the ADF.\"\n\nTheir efforts to criminalize same-sex sexual activity, however, go back much further than 2013. In the landmark Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down the remaining anti-sodomy laws in the U.S., ADF (then known as the Alliance Defense Fund) submitted a friend of the court brief in support of keeping the laws on the books.\n\n\u201cThere is no fundamental right \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and traditions\u2019 to engage in same-sex sodomy,\u201d the brief concluded.\n\nADF also contributed to friend of the court briefs against expanding gay rights in other landmark Supreme Court cases, including same-sex marriage cases Obergefell v. Hodges and United States v. Windsor.\n\n\u201cThe majority of their work lately,\u201d according to Beirich, \u201chas revolved around religious freedom cases to basically allow certain businesses not to have to serve the LGBTQ population.\u201d\n\nIn one of its most recent and high-profile cases, ADF successfully argued a Supreme Court case on behalf of Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, the Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding because he said it would violate his religious beliefs.\n\nIn a case filed last week, ADF is representing a professor who is suing officials at his small public university in Ohio after receiving a warning for violating its nondiscrimination policy by not addressing a transgender student by her preferred gender terms.\n\nIn what could be another high-profile case, ADF is urging the Supreme Court to consider a case out of Michigan in which a funeral home fired a transgender employee due to the owner\u2019s religious beliefs. The 6th U.S. Circuit of Appeals sided with the worker, ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects transgender workers. The funeral home appealed.\n\nMara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, called ADF \u201cthe most relentlessly extreme anti-trans law group.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an outrageous and ill-founded lawsuit happening against trans people, it\u2019s usually the ADF,\u201d Keisling told NBC News.\n\nIn addition to its work in the courts, ADF has also been linked to so-called transgender bathroom bills that have been introduced in recent years in state legislatures across the U.S. aimed at restricting trans people\u2019s access to sex-segregated facilities.\n\nAccording to an in-depth NBC News report published in April 2017, many of these \u201cbathroom bills\u201d filed across multiple states resemble one another \u2014 and that\u2019s because they used language strongly similar to the model legislation called the Student Physical Privacy Act, which was drafted by ADF.\n\nADF operates on a budget of over $50 million, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ rights group. Like any 501c3 nonprofit, ADF is not required to disclose its donors, and many of its 3,200 allied attorneys do not publicize the pro bono work they do on behalf of the organization, which makes the group\u2019s efforts difficult to track, according to Beirich.\n\nFRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES\n\nDespite what many would consider its \u201cextreme\u201d views, ADF has not been relegated to the margins. In fact, Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, spoke at an ADF event this summer.\n\nDuring the speech, he thanked the group \u201con behalf of the president\u201d for its \u201cwork and commitment to religious freedom.\u201d He also defended the organization against the Souther Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201chate group\u201d label.\n\n\u201cYou and I may not agree on everything \u2014 but I wanted to come back here tonight partly because I wanted to say this: You are not a hate group.\u201d\n\nBeirich said many people don\u2019t realize the influence the ADF wields. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t understand that this is the legal arm of the social conservative movement,\u201d she explained.\n\nCITIZENS FOR TRANSPARENCY\n\nWhile the No Gays Allowed campaign is dedicated to shining a spotlight on ADF, details about Citizens for Transparency itself is not very transparent. The group does not have a website, and when asked about the people behind it, Cade, its spokesman, simply described them as \u201ca group of concerned queer folks that want to fight back against ADF and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nCade said the organization is a \u201c501c3 operating under a fiscal agent\u201d and added that the billboard was paid for with $90,000 raised from individual donations.\n\nA statement released about the campaign lists a number of prominent LGBTQ activists that Cade described as \u201callies\u201d of No Gays Allowed. They include Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry; Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights; Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN (formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network); and Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council.\n\nQuinn, an out lesbian, told NBC News she hopes the billboard and broader campaign will spur awareness around ADF\u2019s efforts to curtail LGBTQ rights and the challenges the community still faces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to lead people to ask questions,\u201d Quinn said of the campaign. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really important, to start a conversation, and to have that conversation be in response to this billboard, not the messaging of the ADF.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Claire Atkinson", "title": "Beware of tech money in entertainment, Liberty Media execs warn", "description": "The head of Liberty Media, one of the biggest long-term investors in the media business, has sounded the alarm about Silicon Valley money that has flooded the entertainment industry.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/beware-tech-money-entertainment-liberty-media-execs-warn-n936326", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646526/181114-greg-maffei-se-406p_6a07ba11331256605825fdadf7ab9598.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:45:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Liberty Media has stakes in music, sports and entertainment companies, and its assets include music streaming company Pandora, satellite radio company SiriusXM, ticketing company Live Nation, Formula One racing and the Atlanta Braves. It also owns stakes in Viacom, food-focused digital media company Tastemade and AT&T, as well as a position in iHeart Radio's debt.\n\nMaffei was joined by John Malone, the Liberty Media Chairman who is considered the architect of the modern cable industry. Malone personally holds stakes in companies including as Discovery Communications, Lionsgate and Starz.\n\nMalone said that as tech companies crowded out traditional media players, others companies could find opportunities in being purely content suppliers.\n\n\"Not everybody is going to be able to do a global direct-to-consumer platform, so many will be trying to move into that space as a supplier, in some cases branded and in other cases as part of the food chain.\"\n\nMaffei also noted that money from tech companies had not just meant pricier productions \u2014 it also meant more content and places to consume it, highlighting in a slideshow presentation that online content has grown 680 percent since 2012, while the number of over-the-top services has shot up to around 200.\n\nJust about every major media company either has or is working on its own streaming subscription service, with a wide variety of smaller niche offerings catering to particular consumers tastes.\n\nMaffei said he did not expect them all to survive.\n\n\"I have a full expectation that we will see an RIP for video platforms,\" he said ominously, when drawing a comparison to streaming music startups that were winnowed in recent years to a few players.\n\nMaffei said that most people will pay just $38 per month for streaming services, which he said would be fine for deep-pocketed tech companies but could be a problem for the current pay-TV ecosystem that relies on consumers paying in excess of $100 per month in long-term contracts. Maffei also noted that piracy and discounting is rampant in the streaming world.\n\nMaffei praised Netflix for becoming the \"king\" but questioned how long its run of success could continue.\n\n\"What does winning look like?\" Maffei said. \"You have to ask a few questions.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most common medical emergencies \u2013 an inflamed or ruptured appendix. It usually ends with a trip to the operating room and the removal of the organ.\n\nBut some patients can do just fine with infusions of antibiotics, and more doctors have considered non-surgical treatment of what\u2019s called uncomplicated appendicitis: an inflammation of the appendix that\u2019s not immediately life-threatening. The thinking has been that it must be safer and cheaper if the skin isn\u2019t cut open and a piece of the body removed.\n\nA new study out Wednesday contradicts this idea. People who got antibiotics instead of surgery did not fare better, and they ended up racking up higher medical bills. They were twice as likely to have to come back with a flare-up, a team at Stanford University found.\n\n\u201cPeople treated with antibiotics alone have a higher chance of coming back needing further treatment for appendicitis-related problems, such as abdominal abscesses,\u201d said Dr. Lindsay Sceats, who led the study team.\n\nSceats and colleagues studied the issue because patients often prefer skipping the scalpel if they can. \u201cMore and more patients in the Stanford emergency room have been asking about whether they can just take antibiotics when they come in with appendicitis instead of having surgery,\u201d Sceats, a surgeon at Stanford Hospital, said in a statement.\n\nThey looked at the medical records of more than 58,000 people with uncomplicated appendicitis. Most had their appendix removed, but just under 5 percent of them, about 2,600, opted for infusions of antibiotics instead.\n\nMost patients in both groups did fine but those who got antibiotics alone were twice as likely to have to come back and 42 percent more likely to develop an abscess, the team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association\u2019s JAMA Surgery.\n\nMost of the patients treated with antibiotics alone were cured. Only 4 percent needed appendectomies later, the researchers found. But their risk of a new flare-up of appendicitis lasted for as long as four years, the team found.\n\n\u201cEven if the initial hospitalization is cheaper, when you look at long-term cost, which our study did, it ends up being more expensive,\u201d Sceats said.\n\nAppendectomies are very common. An estimated 5 percent of the U.S. population will suffer acute appendicitis at some time in their lives.\n\n\u201cDue to sheer volume, appendectomy is the sixth leading cause of morbidity and mortality owing to emergency general surgery in the United States,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nAn inflamed appendix can rupture and cause gangrene. \u201cAs such, urgent appendectomy has historically been considered the mainstay of treatment,\u201d the researchers wrote. Any kind of surgery can cause problems and appendectomies are no exception. Up to 23 percent of patients have some sort of postoperative complication.\n\nBut using antibiotics alone did not reduce the rate of problems.\n\n\u201cPeople treated with antibiotics are more likely to come back and be hospitalized for any sort of belly pain,\u201d Sceats said. \u201cDoctors may also be more cautious when the appendix isn\u2019t removed.\u201d That may mean patients get hospitalized fast, just in case it is a new flare-up of appendicitis.\n\n\u201cThese results tell us that, in most cases, surgery is still the best strategy,\u201d Sceats said. \u201cFor your average, healthy 30-year-old, the alternative treatment is no cheaper, and it\u2019s easier to have the surgery. You also no longer have an appendix, so you\u2019re no longer at risk of having appendicitis again.\u201d\n\nThe appendix is a small pouch found near where the large and small intestines meet. For decades it was considered to be of no use at all, but doctors now believe it\u2019s important to the immune system and may serve as a reservoir for \u201cgood\u201d bacteria."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "David Ingram", "title": "In Silicon Valley, security firms offer tech giants an edge \u2014 and leave the rest playing catch-up - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com In Silicon Valley, security firms offer tech giants an edge \u2014 and leave the rest playing catch-up NBCNews.com SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ever since Facebook disclosed last year that Russian operatives had covertly run a disinformation campaign on its network\u2026", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/silicon-valley-security-firms-offer-tech-giants-edge-leave-rest-n930246", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/2616756/18124-fireeye-sandra-joyce-mn-0830_b76c1e2943a8c6c53049fcf82d7a877f.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:32:05Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy David Ingram\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ever since Facebook disclosed last year that Russian operatives had covertly run a disinformation campaign on its network, tech companies have pledged to work together to root out examples of government-sponsored information warfare.\n\nIn one episode this summer, it didn\u2019t work that way.\n\nFacebook and Google disclosed in August that they had spent two months investigating a network of accounts they found were tied to Iranian state media. The companies took down the accounts, pages and groups, which numbered in the hundreds and pushed divisive political messages in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere.\n\nOther tech companies were behind on the news. On services including Twitter, Reddit and Pinterest, researchers found posts similar to what Facebook and Google reported, but those companies didn\u2019t have the luxury of a two-month head start.\n\nThe difference, according to interviews with people at those companies and in the industry, was that Facebook and Google were clients of a cybersecurity company named FireEye, which found some of the accounts and tipped them off.\n\nThe divide between threat-intelligence haves and have-nots has caused some grumbling in Silicon Valley. An executive at one tech company said it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d not to receive a warning about a significant threat when FireEye, Facebook and Google knew about it for months. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize professional relationships, said it would be better if companies collaborated.\n\nThe episode illustrates how little-known security firms originally built to detect computer viruses and respond to hacking attempts are now taking on a growing role in the hunt for disinformation on social media at a time when tech companies are trying to work together to address foreign influence campaigns.\n\nHaves and have nots\n\nFireEye is just one of many threat intelligence firms offering similar services, making it a challenge for tech companies that may not want to pay a variety of companies to keep on the lookout for disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe annual cost of threat intelligence services generally varies from $50,000 to $250,000, according to the research firm Forrester. Sometimes it is sold as a supplement to other services, and some clients have special projects that can push the cost higher, Josh Zelonis, Forrester senior analyst, said.\n\nCompanies generally try to avoid overlap in security vendors, so if they\u2019ve already hired one that does research into, for example, threats on the internet\u2019s dark web, they are unlikely to hire another with seemingly similar capabilities.\n\n\u201cAny organization is generally going to prefer a single-vendor solution,\u201d Zelonis said.\n\nA FireEye information analyst works in front of a screen showing a near real-time map tracking cyber threats at the FireEye office in Milpitas, California, in 2014. Beck Diefenbach / Reuters file\n\nFireEye, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and employs around 3,000 people, declined to disclose how much it charges for its threat-intelligence services, but said it is aware of the frustrations of non-clients.\n\nSandra Joyce, FireEye\u2019s vice president for global intelligence operations, said that the company was testing a new product for smaller clients to buy \u201cexpertise on demand,\u201d a potentially more affordable option for companies that do not have the security budget of Facebook or Google.\n\nToo big to surveil\n\nTech companies like Facebook and Google are relying on FireEye and other vendors in part because they grew so quickly over the past decade that they did not anticipate how people might misuse their services \u2014 or they did not act on warnings. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in April that the company hadn\u2019t taken \u201ca broad enough view of our responsibility.\u201d\n\nSiva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, said that companies like FireEye have an advantage because they focus on hiring people with language and cultural expertise in contrast to Silicon Valley\u2019s approach of trying to solve problems with large-scale software.\n\nThe headquarters of FireEye in Milpitas, California. Kris Tripplaar / Sipa USA\n\n\u201cThey seem to be two steps ahead of Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think that Facebook, one of the highest capitalized companies in the world, would have enough people in-house imagining all the worst scenarios, but Facebook has a habit of outsourcing some of its most important work.\u201d\n\nFacebook said in a blog post that it has contracts with \u201cvarious\u201d cybersecurity research firms and academic institutions. \u201cWe\u2019ll often turn to these groups when we suspect a threat from a certain actor or region,\u201d the social network said. \u201cAt other times, these groups identify suspicious activity on their own, without guidance from us.\u201d\n\nFireEye said it has an advantage because it can see threats across industries, not just against one company, and its analysts speak more than 30 languages.\n\nThe company does make some threat intelligence public. After tech firms beginning with Facebook disclosed their takedowns of accounts they linked to Iran, FireEye posted a 38-page report on its website, detailing its work.\n\n\u201cWhen we put something out publicly like this, it\u2019s certainly to warn and equip the security community, but also the public,\u201d Joyce said.\n\nIn the spotlight\n\nFacebook and Google, in their public statements about the takedowns, shared credit with FireEye, fueling a publicity bonanza for the firm. Joyce said FireEye had \u201cdefinitely seen a pick-up\u201d in its intelligence business since August, though she declined to say by how much. FireEye isn\u2019t profitable due to slowing growth in other services it offers. It reported a net loss of $304 million last year.\n\nFireEye said its employees have drawn on experience looking into \u201chacktivists\u201d \u2014 ideologically driven hackers such as the group Anonymous whose tactics, the company said, foreshadowed what Russians did in the United States during the 2016 presidential election when they disseminated stolen emails through online personas such as DC Leaks.\n\nBesides Facebook and Google, FireEye serves an array of clients with services often unrelated to information warfare, such as investigating breaches. The Defense Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are clients. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2014 that the CIA had been a client, and one of FireEye\u2019s early investors was In-Q-Tel, an investment firm whose partners include the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\n\nFireEye\u2019s work on the broader rise of private intelligence services have caused concern among some privacy advocates, who say these companies could turn their methods on domestic American subjects, quelling dissent on behalf of powerful clients while escaping strict oversight.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no accountability there, except to the company and its shareholders,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nFireEye said its focus is the subterfuge carried out by governments, not local protests.\n\n\u201cWe specialize in identifying inauthentic accounts and online behavior, tied to nation-states, that is intended to surreptitiously manipulate target audiences for geopolitical purposes,\u201d the company said in a statement."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Mike Wall, Space.com", "title": "Ancient 'super-Earth' exoplanet discovered orbiting nearby star", "description": "Astronomers discover icy 'super-Earth' exoplanet, Barnard's Star b, orbiting nearby Barnard's Star", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/ancient-super-earth-exoplanet-discovered-orbiting-nearby-star-ncna936396", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646491/181114-exoplanet-eso-earth-cs-341p_f233f00838164d30c51200d9dba7690b.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:32:00Z", "content": "SUBSCRIBE Nov. 14, 2018 / 9:32 PM GMT The nearest single star to the sun apparently hosts a big, icy planet.

[Barnard's Star b: What We Know About the \"Super-Earth' Candidate]\n\n\"After a very careful analysis, we are 99 percent confident that the planet is there,\" Ignasi Ribas, of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, said in a statement.\n\n\"However, we'll continue to observe this fast-moving star to exclude possible, but improbable, natural variations of the stellar brightness which could masquerade as a planet,\" added Ribas, the lead author of a new study announcing the detection of Barnard's Star b. That study was published online today (Nov. 14) in the journal Nature.\n\nAn artist's impression of the newfound \"super-Earth\" world and its host star, the red dwarf Barnard's star. M. Kornmesser/ESO / EPA\n\nBarnard's Star b, if confirmed, will not be the nearest exoplanet to Earth. That designation is held by the roughly Earth-size world Proxima b, which orbits Proxima Centauri, one of the Alpha Centauri trio.\n\nNASA's Kepler space telescope showed that small planets are common in the Milky Way galaxy at large. Together, Proxima b and Barnard's Star b strongly suggest that such worlds \"are also common in our neighborhood,\" study co-author Johanna Teske, of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., told Space.com. \"And that is super-exciting.\"\n\nA near solar neighbor\n\nBarnard's Star is named after the American astronomer E.E. Barnard, who in 1916 discovered the speediness Ribas mentioned. No other star moves faster across Earth's sky than Barnard's Star, which travels about the width of the full moon every 180 years. [Gallery: The Strangest Alien Planets]\n\nThis unparalleled apparent motion is a consequence of the proximity of Barnard's Star and its high (but not record-setting) velocity of 310,000 mph (500,000 km/h) relative to the sun.\n\nAnd Barnard's Star is getting closer to us every day: In about 10,000 years, the red dwarf will take over the nearest-star mantle from the Alpha Centauri system. At that time, just 3.8 light-years will separate Barnard's Star from the sun.\n\nBarnard's Star is about twice as old as Earth's sun, one-sixth as massive and just 3 percent as luminous. Because Barnard's Star is so dim, its \"habitable zone\" \u2014 the range of distances where liquid water may be possible on a world's surface \u2014 lies extremely close-in. Indeed, researchers estimate that zone to be a sliver that lies 0.06 AU to 0.10 AU from the star. (One AU, or astronomical unit, is the Earth-sun distance \u2014 about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.)\n\nThe habitable-zone concept is a tricky one, of course. Gauging a world's true habitability requires a strong working knowledge of its atmospheric composition and thickness, among other characteristics. And such information is hard to come by for exoplanets.\n\nA long search\n\nBarnard's Star has long been a target of exoplanet hunters, but their searches have always come up empty \u2014 until now.\n\nAnd the new detection wasn't easy: Ribas and his team analyzed huge amounts of data, both archival and newly gathered, before finally digging up Barnard's Star b.\n\nThey used the \"radial velocity\" method, which looks for changes in starlight caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. Such tugs cause a star to wobble slightly, shifting its light toward red wavelengths at times and toward the blue end of the spectrum at others, as seen from Earth. [7 Ways to Discovery Alien Planets]\n\n\"We used observations from seven different instruments, spanning 20 years of measurements, making this one of the largest and most extensive datasets ever used for precise radial-velocity studies,\" Ribas said in the same statement. \"The combination of all data led to a total of 771 measurements \u2014 a huge amount of information!\"\n\nNever before had the radial velocity method been used to find such a small planet in such a distant orbit, study team members said. (Big, close-in planets tug their host stars more powerfully and therefore cause more dramatic, and more easily detectable, light shifts.)\n\nThose seven instruments were the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) La Silla Observatory in Chile; the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, at ESO's Paranal Observatory in Chile; HARPS-North, at the Galileo National Telescope in the Canary Islands; the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, at the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii; the Carnegie Institute's Planet Finder Spectrograph, at the Magellan 6.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile; the Automated Planet Finder at the 2.4-m telescope at the University of California's Lick Observatory; and& CARMENES, at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.\n\nThe researchers also detected hints of another possible planet in the system, orbiting farther out than Barnard's Star b \u2014 way farther out, with an orbital period of 6,600 Earth days. But this second signal is too weak to be deemed a planet candidate, Teske said.\n\n\"There's not enough data,\" she told Space.com.\n\nA frigid super-Earth\n\nBarnard's Star b is at least 3.2 times more massive than our own planet, making it a \"super-Earth\" \u2014 the class of worlds that are significantly larger than Earth but smaller than \"ice giants\" such as Neptune and Uranus.\n\nThe newfound planet candidate lies 0.4 AU from its host star and completes one orbit every 233 Earth days, according to the new study.\n\nThis orbital distance is similar to that of radiation-blasted Mercury in our own solar system. But, because Barnard's Star is so dim, the potential planet lies right around the system's \"snow line\" \u2014 the region where volatile materials such as water can condense into solid ices.\n\n\"Until now, only giant planets had been detected at such a distance from their stars,\" Rodrigo Diaz, of the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics at the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research and the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, said in an accompanying \"News and Views\" article that was also published today in Nature.\n\n\"The authors' discovery of a low-mass planet near the snow line places strong constraints on formation models for this type of planet,\" added Diaz, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nBarnard's Star b, if it does indeed exist, is not a very promising abode for life as we know it, at least not on the surface. The potential planet is likely very cold, with an estimated surface temperature of about minus 275 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 170 degrees Fahrenheit), study team members said.\n\nConfirmation of Barnard's Star b is unlikely to come from additional radial-velocity measurements, Diaz wrote. But super-precise measurements of star positions, such as those now being made by the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft, may do the job in the next few years, he added.\n\n\"Even more excitingly, the next generation of ground-based instrumentation, also coming into operation in the 2020s, should be able to directly image the reported planet, and measure its light spectrum,\" Diaz wrote.\n\n\"Using this spectrum, the characteristics of the planet\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 such as its winds and rotation rate \u2014 could be inferred,\" he added. \"This remarkable planet therefore gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail.\"\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT EXOPLANETS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Agnes Constante", "title": "UC Berkeley law dean recommends de-naming building named after racist lawyer", "description": "The wing  was named after John Boalt, who was influential in catalyzing support in California for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/uc-berkeley-law-dean-recommends-de-naming-building-named-after-n936376", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646531/181114-berkeley-campus-cs-409p_e84f4de12cd969956190f1e1e7d5eeef.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:23:07Z", "content": "Nov. 14, 2018 / 9:23 PM GMT The dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law on Tuesday said he would recommend de-naming a wing of the law school's building that honors a lawyer who held anti-Chinese views.

The committee received comments from more than 2,000 individuals \u2014 nearly half in favor of eliminating the use of the name Boalt \u2014 and held a town hall earlier this year before issuing recommendations that Chemerinsky released in September.\n\nChemerinsky received more than 600 messages in response to the committee's report, he noted in a public letter on the school\u2019s website. About 60 percent were in favor of dropping the name.\n\nIn the public letter, Chemerinsky wrote that he changed his mind on the issue several times.\n\n\u201cI find this a very difficult question,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am reassured, though, that ultimately this is about a symbol, not the substance of the law school. Berkeley Law is a terrific, very special place whether we officially use the name Boalt or not.\u201d\n\nChemerinsky also encouraged organizations within the law school to stop using the name. Lecturer positions named for the Boalts will also be renamed after recent deans.\n\nThe law school will next submit a formal request to de-name Boalt Hall. The decision to drop the name is ultimately up to UC Berkeley's chancellor.\n\nCharles Cannon, senior assistant dean and chief administrative officer at Berkeley Law, said he expects it would take until summer 2019 before the chancellor makes a decision.\n\nReichmann in an email said he was happy with Chemerinsky's decision.\n\n\u201cWhen racism or other objectionable behavior is discovered in a namesake, it is necessary to weigh and evaluate the entirety of the namesake's career,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn Boalt's greatest public 'accomplishment' was to promote the exclusion of Chinese people from the United States, and he didn't attend or teach at the law school that bears his name. His sole legacy to the law school was his money. I didn't think this was a person the Berkeley Law School of the 21st Century should continue to honor.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Take a tour of one of El Chapo's underground drug tunnels", "description": "Video shown in court during El Chapo\u2019s trial in New York City shows one of his underground drug tunnels between Mexico and Arizona.

They\u2019re opening up on 44th Road. My barber shop is on 44th Road,\u201d said Shawn Dixon, the owner of Otis & Finn, which has been in the neighborhood for the past four years. \u201cThe rent goes up, and it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d\n\nDixon held a sign that read, \u201cWelcome Amazon! But first: Fund schools and infrastructure, pass small business protections, local businesses on the Amazon campus. Or stay the helipad out!\u201d\n\nThe warning is a reference to the helipad Amazon allegedly asked for \u2014 in addition to the $1.7 billion in performance-based tax incentives the retail giant procured from the state of New York. Amazon has also said it will apply for a subsidy program that would give property tax abatements for up to 25 years, along with other tax incentive programs for which it may be eligible.\n\nProtesters gathered Wednesday in Gordan Triangle near Amazon\u2019s future headquarters listened to local politicians who said they weren\u2019t given a seat at the table during negotiations and demanded transparency and a say before Amazon breaks ground in Long Island City.\n\n\u201cWhy can Google bring 20,000 jobs here without any public subsidies but Amazon needs $3 billion?\u201d asked state Senator Mike Gianaris. \u201cWhat is so special about Amazon?\u201d\n\nCongresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district is in Queens, was at freshman orientation in Washington but sent a representative to the protest, who said Ocasio-Cortez opposes the current Amazon deal.\n\nFor more than an hour, several local politicians and community activists spoke to a crowd holding signs and offering a chorus of boos every time the helipad and billions of dollars were mentioned.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even have heat and hot water in Queensbridge!\u201d one protester shouted. The Queensbridge Houses are the country\u2019s largest housing project and will be Amazon\u2019s new neighbor.\n\nWhile there were plenty of protesters, not everyone from the area is anti-Amazon. Jim Dillon, who said he has lived in the area for 65 years and lives in a rent stabilized apartment, carried a small sign that read, \u201cWelcome Amazon! And I live in L.I.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no dog in this fight. I\u2019ve never even ordered anything from Amazon,\u201d Dillon said.\n\n\u201cI want jobs for working class people,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously most of the jobs at Amazon are technocratic and will pay a lot of money, but there will also be jobs for people who are janitors, security guards.\u201d\n\nStill, he said he believed New York Gov.

There\u2019s no two ways about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon's decision to select Long Island City for one of its newest office complexes was only made public on Tuesday, but Gianaris said the fight is just beginning.\n\n\u201cWe are not giving up until we scuttle this deal, scrap it, throw it in the garbage and start the conversation again,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Suzy Khimm, Laura Strickler, Hannah Rappleye, Stephanie Gosk", "title": "Under Ben Carson, more families live in HUD housing that fails health and safety inspections", "description": "The number of HUD apartments cited for unsafe, unhealthy and physically deteriorating living conditions has been on the rise under the Trump administration.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/under-ben-carson-more-families-live-hud-housing-fails-health-n935421", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2633601/181105-hud-matos-family-mn-1723_525fd06d6b8909bc87090b53dcd57fd9.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:17:00Z", "content": "A slow response by HUD, while not uncommon in government agencies, can have serious repercussions for the children, elderly and disabled who make up the majority of those living in taxpayer-subsidized housing.

Low-slung houses, corner stores and abandoned lots still surround the Infill apartments, where residents live in two-story units covered in brick and white siding.\n\nOn paper, they are the kind of privately owned, publicly subsidized properties that Carson has championed as the solution to the country\u2019s affordable housing crisis. Under the Section 8 affordable housing program, tenants typically pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and taxpayers make up the rest. Infill\u2019s landlord is guaranteed over $700,000 in rent for the entire property each year, according to documents released through the Freedom of Information Act and obtained by NBC News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the private-public partnerships that work because there\u2019s almost unlimited money in the private sector,\" Carson said in April 2017, shortly after becoming HUD secretary. \"There\u2019s very limited money in the government.\u201d\n\nBut relying on private landlords still requires HUD resources and staff to ensure owners are delivering what they promised to taxpayers. And HUD officials have acknowledged that even when these buildings fail physical inspections, HUD is slow to cancel contracts or impose fines on delinquent landlords \u2014 reluctant to force tenants out of their homes and fearing that landlords will pull out of the Section 8 program altogether. Instead, HUD generally tries to accommodate landlords who promise to make fixes, even if they are slow in coming.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pull levers to send shockwaves into the landlord communities. We need housing \u2014 we need the units out there,\u201d said a HUD official, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about the department. \u201cWe need these landlords.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Infill, though, HUD acknowledged that the landlord failed to deliver. \u201cThe owner provided certain assurances to our field folks that, in the end, did not happen,\u201d Sullivan said in an email. That hasn't stopped the federal subsidies. \"It's a flow of money that continues to come,\" said AJ Johnson, a local pastor who has helped the tenants organize.\n\nLong delays, little action\n\nLiving conditions at the Infill apartments deteriorated after new owner Blima Isaacson and manager Eli Fish took over the HUD-subsidized buildings in the summer of 2016, more than a dozen tenants told NBC News.\n\nErica Pierre's 9-year-old daughter has asthma that is triggered by mold and mice. Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nPierre, who works full-time for Hartford\u2019s education department, said she tries hard to make a home for herself and her 9-year-old daughter, filling the space with family photographs and houseplants. Upstairs, her daughter\u2019s room is decorated in pink and purple, matching her favorite toy \u2014 a Barbie dream house. But, Pierre said, she feels powerless against the mold that grows in the basement and across the ceiling of her bathroom.\n\nThe previous landlord had kept the mold at bay by spraying the walls with bleach, Pierre said. That\u2019s what her daughter\u2019s medical provider had recommended after determining that the girl's asthma was triggered by mold and mice, medical records show.\n\nBut Fish, the new property manager, has neglected the problem, Pierre said. \u201cThere's been times when I've done a half day at work and waited for him to come,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one showed up.\u201d\n\nThe property dropped from 91 points in a November 2014 inspection to 27 points this year, according to HUD records. This should have set off a tight timeline of responses under legislation Congress passed in 2017 and renewed in March, prompted by grim conditions in other Section 8 buildings.\n\nInstead, HUD and the landlord missed one deadline after another. HUD began the process by issuing a failed inspection report to Infill\u2019s owner on Feb. 2, according to records released through the Freedom of Information Act and obtained by NBC News. HUD was then required to follow up within 15 days to notify Infill\u2019s landlord that he was in default of the contract and give him a deadline for correcting all problems. But HUD didn\u2019t issue that notice until early May \u2014 96 days later.\n\nWhen it finally sent the notice, which was addressed to Fish, HUD informed him that he had 60 days to \u201ccorrect all physical deficiencies\u201d at Infill, or else face further action by HUD. But Fish took more than twice as long \u2014 131 days \u2014 to certify that he had fixed all problems, according to HUD documents obtained by NBC News.\n\nHUD says Infill\u2019s owner moved more quickly to fix exposed wires, missing smoke detectors and other serious violations, according to a HUD visit in mid-February. But in June, July and August, city inspectors found rampant infestations of bed bugs and mice, according to inspection reports obtained by NBC News that detailed dozens of violations. The city also cited Infill for missing smoke detectors and electrical hazards \u2014 the types of urgent safety violations that HUD claimed had been fixed months earlier.\n\nFish finally told HUD the buildings had been fully repaired in mid-September, which should have prompted HUD to follow up with a top-to-bottom inspection \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d according to the department\u2019s latest guidance. But HUD only came in to re-inspect the Infill apartments after weeks of questioning by NBC News. The department declined to release the new inspection score or report from its Nov. 6 visit and told NBC News to file a Freedom of Information Act request. (HUD said the score was not final and the department needed to give the owner time to appeal if he chose to do so.)\n\nHUD characterized the delays as typical. But they fly in the face of legislation that Congress passed to speed up and toughen HUD\u2019s response to failing properties \u2014 changes that HUD has inserted in its official guidance. The worst cases are handled by HUD\u2019s Departmental Enforcement Center, which can use everything from monetary penalties to the replacement of property managers to get delinquent landlords in line.\n\nWhen pressed to explain the protracted delays, HUD said that cases like Infill\u2019s can often take more time, not less. \u201cAs always, when the DEC becomes involved, more time is needed to determine an enforcement approach,\u201d said Sullivan, the HUD spokesman, referring to the Departmental Enforcement Center.\n\nIn the meantime, tenants say they\u2019ve been left with damaged windows, vermin, mold and faulty heat. One tenant said she had been complaining about a leaky kitchen ceiling \u201cfor months\u201d to Fish before it collapsed completely in July, terrifying her family. The landlord finally patched up the hole. But water continues to leak throughout the Infill properties, tenants say.\n\nDuring a recent downpour, Ashley Matos rushed into her son's bedroom to mop up the water that had leaked in through his window. She called the landlord but says it took weeks to get a response. \"We have to go chase him,\" Matos said.\n\nAt another Section 8 property in Hartford, Fish repeatedly failed to comply with HUD requests to clean up a building where a child under the age of 6 had tested positive for lead poisoning under a previous owner, according to documents obtained by NBC News.\n\nWhen approached by NBC News at one of his Infill buildings, Fish waved off questions and drove away in his car. Isaacson, who shares a Brooklyn home address with Fish according to public records, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u2018We just don\u2019t have the staff\u2019\n\nHUD officials have admitted that they don\u2019t have the resources to keep close tabs on the tens of thousands of subsidized properties they oversee.\n\nIn Hartford, just up the street from Infill, a Section 8 property run by another landlord passed inspection in February despite holes in the ceiling, rampant mold and other serious problems. Meeting privately with irate tenants in early October, HUD officials blamed an inspection process that can result in inflated scores from contract inspectors, despite recent reforms.\n\n\u201cThat's how you get a passing score with mold, vermin and a falling down bathroom ceiling \u2014 the system is broken,\u201d said one HUD official in a recording of the meeting with tenants provided to NBC News on the condition that the participants not be identified. (HUD verified that the recording was authentic.)\n\nWhen tenants asked at the meeting why HUD hadn\u2019t followed up sooner, the HUD official said the department didn\u2019t have the capacity. \u201cWe just don't have the staff for it,\u201d he said, according to the recording. \u201cThere are 432 properties in Connecticut alone and I have \u2014 I have five staff,\u201d his colleague added.\n\nSarah Wheeler cries in the living room of her home in Hartford's Infill buildings. Wheeler says both her landlord and the federal government have ignored her pleas for help in fixing the conditions in her family's apartment. \"We're tired of having to make phone calls,\" Wheeler said. \"We're tired of people coming out, like HUD and the city, and nothing is still getting done. Nothing.\" Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nInstead, HUD says that it relies on the vigilance of outside advocates like Cori Mackey and AJ Johnson of the Christian Activities Council, as well as organized tenants and media reports to prompt action on properties that have fallen through the cracks. That\u2019s what led HUD to take the rare step of canceling its contract with another Hartford landlord, Emmanuel Ku, in May, for repeatedly failing to repair his Section 8 apartments. (Ku did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\u201cWhen something is brought to our attention through Cori or you all, we can say, \u2018Wait a minute, we need to take a look,\u2019\u201d the first HUD official told Hartford tenants, according to the recording.\n\nHUD\u2019s staffing shortfalls extend well beyond Connecticut. HUD has shed more than 480 staff members since the end of the Obama administration, according to government records, in part due to the hiring freeze Trump implemented when he took office.\n\nThe department\u2019s enforcement office has been losing staff for years, but it\u2019s reached a two-decade low of 90 employees under Carson, according to data provided to NBC News by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe watchdog also found that work completed by HUD's enforcement office dropped by 25 percent since 2016 and criticized HUD for failing to keep track of its caseload. When asked for enforcement data that HUD is required by law to provide to Congress \u2014 totaling the actions taken on failing properties \u2014 HUD said it could not provide reports before November 2017 because it had never compiled them.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s indifference or incompetence, the Trump administration\u2019s failures in Connecticut and around the country cannot be excused. Someone must be held accountable,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who led previous efforts to strengthen the HUD inspection process. \u201cSecretary Carson owes it to these families to present a concrete plan for how he will make this better, and how he\u2019ll make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in HUD\u2019s regional offices \u2014 which are on the front lines of monitoring troubled properties \u2014 current and recently departed officials say that they have struggled to fill positions and that caseloads have spiked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge vacancy problem,\u201d said Ellen Lurie Hoffman, federal policy director at the National Housing Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \u201cWe know from hearing from them that many of the field offices are overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nHUD admits that \u201cwe are leaner than we used to be\u201d but Sullivan, the spokesman, said the department is in the process of bringing on 77 staff members to the Office of Multifamily Housing, which oversees the contracts for multifamily rentals, and is recruiting for 48 vacant positions. The department added that it is conducting a \u201cwholesale re-examination\u201d of the inspection process and recently released new guidance meant to strengthen its oversight of HUD-subsidized apartments.\n\nBut HUD issued its first news release on the inspection overhaul and its new guidance only after weeks of questions by NBC News. Carson, meanwhile, has other priorities: He recently suggested rolling back inspection requirements, rather than strengthening them, to encourage more landlords to participate in the Section 8 voucher program and has stressed the need to encourage \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d by raising rents on all Section 8 tenants.\n\nThat includes Pierre, who pays $371 a month for her three-bedroom. (HUD covers the rest of the $1,120 rent.)\n\nPierre is grateful for a place that she can afford while she works as a speech therapist and earns her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology. Her plans for the future include getting a master\u2019s and, one day, owning a home. But she worries constantly about how the mice and mold will affect her daughter\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cI don't want her to think that this is OK,\u201d Pierre said, in tears. \u201cI don't want her to become an adult and live her life like this.\u201d\n\nInfill\u2019s owner, meanwhile, is set for years to come. In July 2017, just seven months before the failed inspection, HUD renewed its contract with Isaacson for 20 years \u2014 a deal worth over $14 million.\n\nDo you have a story or tip to share with NBC News?

And not only that, I am participating in a time-honored tradition of the newly engaged: bringing the families together. Yes, for the first time ever, my parents and brother will be meeting my fiance\u2019s mother and sister over Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 in the tiny two-bedroom apartment where we live in New York City.\n\nAs thrilled as I am to be hosting (and therefore not to have to deal with one of the busiest travel days of the year), I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m a little stressed out. Not because I think our families won\u2019t get along \u2014 they\u2019re all great people, it should be swell! \u2014 but because I\u2019ve never cooked a holiday meal, let alone one featuring a meeting of future in-laws. And as much as I know they will all love the meal regardless, I\u2019m starting to feel immense pressure to make sure it goes perfectly. I\u2019m doing everything I can to make sure my home looks the part, that we plan ahead for the food and that everything goes as smoothly as possible the day of the feast.\n\nBut, of course, I also don\u2019t want to go overboard when it comes to Thanksgiving Day spending. We have seven total people to feed, and on top of food and drink costs, we\u2019ve already found ourselves stopping at HomeGoods to check out the tablecloth and festive placemat situation. In order to plan ahead as much as possible, I decided to reach out to a few cooking and finance experts to get the best possible advice on budgeting for the holiday. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n1. Think like a chef to plan how much meat you need\n\nThis seems like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s something I could definitely miscalculate: planning the right amount of food for the people you\u2019re hosting.\n\nRick Camac, the Institute of Culinary Education\u2019s Dean of Restaurant & Hospitality Management, says to be sure to consider people, portions, and yield, especially when it comes to getting your turkey:\n\nYield means what useable product you get after the bird is cooked down and ready to serve.\n\n[Assume you need] 8 ounces of protein per person. This is a lot, but who doesn\u2019t overeat for Thanksgiving, and who doesn\u2019t want leftovers? If you\u2019re serving more than one protein (such as a ham and a turkey) obviously cut numbers in half, meaning 4 ounces of turkey and 4 ounces of ham...Assume a 50% yield on average. You\u2019ll likely get a tad better, but this is a good estimate. So, for 10 people, being served 8 ounces each, you need 5 lbs. of yield. That would call for a 10-lb. turkey. Personally, I\u2019d order 12 lbs. to be sure but, that\u2019s me.\n\nBuying too much turkey isn\u2019t the end of the world, especially if you can use the leftovers to make something delicious (my favorite is turning it into a shepherd\u2019s pie). But over-buying also means you have a bigger chance of letting your turkey go to waste \u2014 and losing money because of it. Use Camac\u2019s yield rule to make sure you get the right amount.\n\n2. Don\u2019t supply every single side dish\n\nOf course, as the host, you probably won\u2019t be simply buying a turkey. But Cherie Lowe, a personal finance blogger at Queen of Free and author of the book Slaying the Debt Dragon, says the one of the keys to saving money on Thanksgiving is to avoid the \u201cside dish trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetermining a Thanksgiving menu plan is so difficult because there is oh-so-much to choose from,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when you do determine the dishes you\u2019ll be having, hitting the grocery store is still difficult because you remember how many other things you wish you were fixing. Tough Love: You shouldn\u2019t be eating or buying all of those foods.\u201d\n\nBut how do you go about deciding what to make? \u201cIf you are dining with extended family, have everyone bring a side,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cIf you are just feeding your immediate family, focus in on one side dish each family member loves. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew financially or physically.\u201d\n\nWhile you may feel pressure to please everyone \u2014 as I certainly do \u2014 try to let that feeling go as much as possible. Plus, taking care of sides potluck-style means everyone has a better chance of eating their favorite sides, and you get to save money on food costs.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re like me and have family coming in from several states away, throwing a potluck Thanksgiving is easier said than done. But don\u2019t try to bite off more than you can (literally) chew.\n\n3. Plan ahead for Wednesday\u2019s meals, too\n\nHave you ever resorted to Chinese takeout the night before Thanksgiving? I certainly have \u2014 and now I know I\u2019m definitely not alone.\n\n\u201cI once read that pizza deliveries are the highest on the night before Thanksgiving,\u201d says Lowe. To avoid becoming a part of that expensive statistic, she suggests building Wednesday night\u2019s dinner into your Thanksgiving meal plan. Even if you\u2019ll be too busy prepping to cook anything for that night, you can still avoid an expensive delivery meal.\n\n\u201cBuy a deli pizza from the grocery store and throw it in the oven while you chop foods,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cOr make sandwiches with chips. Keep it simple and if at all possible light. Just don\u2019t let that Wednesday evening meal sneak up on you as you prepare for the big day and save the room in your tummy for the big feast.\u201d\n\n4. Order online as early as possible\n\nCamac suggests buying online, and buying early, is the best way to get the best price. \u201cYou should be able to order a good quality, organic turkey for $5-6.00 per pound,\u201d he says. And to keep costs down, he suggests to stick to simple sides that please a crowd \u2014 and stretch your dollar. \u201cPotatoes are ridiculously cheap, and string beans and salad reasonably priced as well. And, potatoes are more filler! Of course, add one or two pies for dessert. All in, you can feed 10 people less than $10 per person.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll probably stick with the online-ordering option at Whole Foods, which my family has done for years to great success. If you want to do a little cost comparison beforehand, poke around the internet for testimonials on mail-order turkeys.\n\n5. Plan ahead for that \u201cone last thing\u201d\n\nFinally, even if you\u2019ve never hosted your own Thanksgiving, you probably know you\u2019ll forget something. To avoid this, Lowe suggests doing your actual shopping as early as you can.\n\n\u201cIf at all possible,\u201d she says, \u201cpurchase your goods DAYS before you plan on cooking. You\u2019ll want to give items like your turkey plenty of time to dethaw. Plus, you do not want to be out in the hot mess that is last minute Thanksgiving shoppers. As the days draw nearer, the crowds grow thicker.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget: grocery stores take full advantage of last-minute holiday shoppers. \u201cRunning out at the last minute will up your stress but more than likely cause more impulse buys, too,\u201d Lowe reminds us. \u201cHoliday items are marketed front and center to grab your attention and dollars from your bank account. The odds are, you\u2019ll also be more likely to visit a higher priced grocery or convenience store (due to hours) and end up paying more and buying more, too.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve taken away from all of this, it\u2019s to plan ahead for everything.

At the end of the day, I\u2019ll be able to be sworn in the Arizona Legislature on January 14th,\u201d Ter\u00e1n told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cI now have the opportunity to work for my constituents from District 30, for better schools, better jobs, instead of focusing on a baseless lawsuit.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent phone call with NBC News, Ter\u00e1n said she thought the lawsuit was part of a larger pattern of discrimination that other Hispanics in the state have experienced.\n\n\"Kids are going through this type of harassment in their schools, [and] playgrounds, and workers have to go through this with their bosses,\" she said. \"These are things you might experience as a candidate knocking on doors. Sometimes it's subtle, but sometimes it's as direct as this lawsuit challenging your status. It is important that we denounce this.\"\n\nThis was not the first time Novoa, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona secretary of state as a Republican write-in candidate, sued Ter\u00e1n and challenged the state representative-elect's citizenship.\n\nNovoa filed a lawsuit in 2012 when Ter\u00e1n ran for the same state office seat. The judge in the case also dismissed that lawsuit.\n\n\"I was born in Douglas, Arizona. The courts know it. I had gone through this before. I had to prove it to the same person and she knows it because she was also at the court,\" Ter\u00e1n said during a press conference in Phoenix last week when the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe challenge to Ter\u00e1n's citizenship is similar to the questioning of Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship before, during and after his presidency, which was initially pushed by fringe groups but gained traction after it was promoted by now President Donald Trump. In her recently published memoir, former First Lady Michelle Obama said she would never forgive Trump for endangering her family by pushing this conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cWhen we see this type of harassment, we can\u2019t stand on the sidelines,\u201d Ter\u00e1n said.\n\nTer\u00e1n ran on a progressive platform such as protecting women's reproductive rights, preserving the Affordable Care Act and investing more in public schools.\n\nFor over 12 years, Ter\u00e1n has been part of a group of community organizers and advocates that have worked to counter the state's recent history of hardline immigration policies.\n\nShe was part of the successful recall of Russell Pearce, who riled the anger of the Latino community with his sponsorship of the infamous \u201cshow me your papers\u201d bill, SB1070. Since the recall, politicians have laid off the anti-immigrant legislation, Ter\u00e1n said.\n\n\"As the anti-immigrant sentiment and the attacks kept coming out of the state Legislature, people were starting to become more conscientious about us needing to participate,\u201d Ter\u00e1n added.\n\nNicole Acevedo reported from New York and Stephen Nu\u00f1o reported from Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "New Jersey woman charged after 44 dead dogs found in plastic bags stored in her freezers", "description": "Donna Roberts, of Shamong Township, New Jersey, was arrested Tuesday and charged with animal cruelty after police found 44 dead dogs in freezers in her home.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-jersey-woman-charged-after-44-dead-dogs-found-plastic-n936311", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2646321/181114-donna-roberts-ew-141p_8958ea33c3b2bcc1bed2a18e286c51d5.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:37:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The room is silent as her classmates watch the student leave and the professor head toward the front of the auditorium.\n\nStudents who were there in the classroom said the professor had confronted the girl on Monday based on an incident she had with her on Friday, when she asked young woman to put her feet down during a lecture. The girl, according to a joint statement issued by the students on Twitter, \"complied\" but allegedly forced the professor to end the lecture early saying the class was \"disrespectful of her.\"\n\nYasmine Lane, one of the students who was there, confirmed the account and told NBC News that the professor had come in Monday with student conduct guidelines in hand seeking to talk to the student.\n\n\"We personally didn't understand the magnitude of getting her exported,\" Lane said, adding that she could overhear the teacher talking to the student about what had happened on Friday before the teacher pulled out her phone to call the cops.\n\nRawal said he felt something needed to be done about the student\u2019s ousting after witnessing the whole exchange.\n\n\u201cI was inspired to share this video because I believe an abuse of power of this magnitude deserved to have a spotlight shined on it in order for justice to be served,\u201d Rawal said.\n\nBut Lane, who knows the student and is also black, said that even though the circumstances were \u201cunwarranted,\u201d she doesn\u2019t believe the incident had to do with race.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been very irritable lately \u2014more toward the semester,\u201d Lane said. \"She\u2019s just been very stressed and that's what led for her decision to have her escorted by cops.\"\n\nThe university's president, Taylor Eighmy, issued a statement to students Monday saying the school is looking at the incident though an investigation into \u201cpossible discrimination\u201d and \u201cacademic management of the classroom.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, Eighmy said that those conducting the investigation had met with the escorted student and with Moss and will allow another professor to teach the class for the rest of the semester.\n\n\u201cNo matter the outcome of the investigations, the incident shows issues that extend far beyond the events of yesterday,\u201d Eighmy wrote.\n\n\u201cThe reactions expressed through social media, emails, phone calls and group meetings I\u2019ve attended confirm that feelings of marginalization on the part of some students\u2014especially our African American students\u2014are real and profound.\u201d\n\nUTSA had wrapped up its investigations by Wednesday night and revealed that the teacher was only found liable for classroom mismanagement and displaying \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report\u2019s summary, it was decided that racial bias was not a factor \u201cbased primarily on the opinion of the student\u201d who chose not to file a formal discrimination complaint.\n\nClasses for the Anatomy & Physiology 1 students are set to resume without Moss on Friday, according to the university. Moss, however, will be allowed to return to the school for the Spring 2019 semester after taking classroom management training, according to Eighmy's Wednesday memo to community members.\n\nMoss did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith", "title": "Democratic Sen.

Sherrod Brown of Ohio said Wednesday that should Democrat Stacey Abrams lose her tight race for Georgia governor, Republicans \"stole it.\"\n\n\"If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it,\" Brown said, speaking at the National Action Network conference in Washington. \"It's clear. It's clear. I say that publicly and it's clear.\"\n\nBrown, who called on officials to count all ballots in Georgia and Florida, two states where high-profile contests remain unsettled, said the GOP \"can't win elections\" fairly because there are \"way more of us than there are of them.\"\n\n\"They win elections by redistricting and reapportionment and voter suppression and all the ways they try to scare people, particularly people of color,\" added Brown, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nGOP gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who did not resign from his job as Georgia's secretary of state until after Nov. 6, was accused during the campaign of trying to suppress the vote through his role overseeing elections, including his own. Kemp denied those accusations, saying he was simply following the law.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kemp's campaign said it was Abrams and her \"radical backers\" who were conspiring to \"steal\" the governor's race \u2014 and again called on Abrams to concede.\n\n\"Since Election night, hardworking Georgians have watched how the 'new' Democratic Party behaves,\" said Cody Hall, Kemp's press secretary. \"Stacey Abrams and her radical backers will stop at nothing to undermine democracy and attempt to steal this election to be Georgia's next governor.\"\n\n\"After all of the theatrics, the math remains the same,\" Hall continued. \"Abrams lost and Brian Kemp won. This election is over. Stacey Abrams needs to concede. It's time to move past the campaign and work towards a safer, stronger Georgia.\"\n\nNBC News rates the contest between Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp too close to call more than a week after Election Day. Kemp holds a lead of 55,000 votes as of Wednesday.\n\nCivil rights groups sued in October after an Associated Press investigation found that Kemp's office had placed 53,000 voter registration applicants in limbo, 70 percent of whom were African-American. Abrams, who is black, said it amounted to voter suppression. In early November, a federal judge sided with the civil rights groups and ordered Kemp to allow more than 3,000 people whose voter registrations were put on hold over proof-of-citizenship issues access to a ballot.\n\nAfter the election and under pressure from Democrats, Kemp resigned as secretary of state and removed himself from any role in overseeing the vote count, which is ongoing.\n\nAbrams hopes to narrow Kemp's lead to force a mandatory recount or a runoff \u2014 the higher of the two hurdles. State law requires a candidate to have more than 50 percent of the vote in order to win outright, and Kemp currently has 50.2 percent of the overall vote.\n\nKemp declared victory immediately following last week's election, but Abrams has not conceded the race."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Suzanne Gamboa", "title": "Latino early voting increased 174 percent over 2014, Democrats say", "description": "Rep.

Every Latino, every African-American, every Hispanic vote in the country, regardless of the number of Latinos in a district, mattered this cycle and that's ultimately what has led to our success,\" Sena said.\n\nFor the election, several Democratic political fundraising committeescommissioned the polling firm Latino Decisions to conduct polling and focus groups and try out some messaging of Latinos.\n\n\"Latinos showed up to the polls because we talked to them, we listened to them, our candidates connected with their personal stories, we knocked on their doors we reached out online,\" Luj\u00e1n said.\n\nThe Latino Decisions polling found Latinos strongly rejected Trump's and Republicans' attacks on immigrants and more than two-thirds felt angered or offended by something Trump had said.

And while there are many reasons \u2014 they worked hard and we built a great process \u2014 they made clear that getting me to look like an anime character or Stanley Tucci from The Hunger Games was part of what drove them.\n\nHumor relieves stress and builds teams\n\nThere are a few reasons this idea worked. First, injecting some humor and playfulness into the atmosphere of a high-stress job can be very helpful.\n\nSales in particular can be very tough, since it means facing constant rejection. It\u2019s one of the careers with high rates of depression. When things got tough for our team during that first month, someone would crack a joke about my future look. We\u2019d laugh, and the team would push forward.\n\nThe willingness to do silly things can also help build a sense of teamwork, that we\u2019re all in this together. Richard Branson discussed this in the book \"The Mind of the CEO\", saying that as the top executive, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be the first into the swimming pool with your clothes on or whatever, the first to let your hair down, first to make a fool out of yourself on the stage singing karaoke, to break the ice so that everybody else knows how far they can go to have fun.\u201d\n\nRisking embarrassment can inspire\n\nThere\u2019s also something more to it. I wasn\u2019t just offering something fun, I was offering to humiliate myself in a way that would last months.\n\nThe desire to see people willing to make fools of themselves for a good cause is also the thinking behind the viral ice bucket challenge that helped raise money for ALS research.\n\nThat speaks to a philosophy I\u2019ve developed about work in general. I\u2019ve found that many people are willing to work hard, but few are willing to risk personal embarrassment to achieve a goal. When someone is willing, other people admire that as a form of courage. And they want to see it play out.\n\nThis helps explain why a United Way chapter and SignUpGenius have recommended fundraiser incentives like \u201cGet the Boss\u201d or \u201cEmbarrass the Boss.\u201d Options include dunking them in a tank of water, getting them to shave their head or doing an old fashioned pie-in-the-face. The desire to see people willing to make fools of themselves for a good cause is also the thinking behind the viral ice bucket challenge that helped raise money for ALS research.\n\nPulling through\n\nWhen our sales results came in, our team celebrated. No one brought up my hair, and some of them weren\u2019t sure whether I would do it.\n\nBut that weekend, I found a stylist who spent hours putting together a concoction. He bleached my brown hair bright white to get rid of any color, then used a unique mixture to make it the most obnoxious, bright blue he could muster. It took hours and cost $250.\n\nHeading to work that Monday, I was self-conscious and very nervous. But I decided to own it. Everyone who saw me laughed \u2014 but also loved it.\n\nI also posted about it on LinkedIn. Soon, my new photo and post explaining the hair got thousands of views. It\u2019s a kind of attention I wasn\u2019t used to getting, but have found it to be a good opportunity to share ideas. In fact, I\u2019ve decided to keep my hair crazy blue for the time being.\n\nI wear it as a badge of honor. As a sign to my employees that I will pull through for them, no matter what, if they give it their all. And as a message to everyone: It isn\u2019t easy to make a fool of yourself. But if you can cross that line, one very few people are willing to cross, there is a lot of opportunity on the other side.\n\nTAKE YOUR CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The former U.N. diplomat accused of helping steal and distribute Republican fundraiser Elliot Broidy's emails is entitled to diplomatic immunity, the U.S. government tells NBC News.\n\nIt's the latest blow to Broidy's legal campaign against Qatar and the individuals he says hacked him on its behalf. Several other defendants in lawsuits filed by Broidy including Qatar itself have already convinced the court to dismiss them from the case, which criss-crosses the murky worlds of cybercrime, the Persian Gulf diplomatic crisis and pay-to-play politics in Trump era.\n\nBroidy, the Republican National Committee's former deputy finance chair, is suing Jamal Benomar, a British citizen born in Morocco. Broidy accuses Benomar of being a \"key player\" in a Qatari scheme to hack Broidy's emails and distribute them to U.S. journalists. The stolen emails exposed how Broidy tried to parlay his access to President Donald Trump into lucrative contracts for his private security company with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's chief rivals. Qatar denies involvement in the hacking.\n\nThe complex civil case took an unexpected turn earlier this year when Benomar, who left the U.N. before the alleged hack, claimed that he is now a Moroccan diplomat, posted to the North African nation's mission to the U.N. Benomar's lawyers argued that he therefore has diplomatic immunity, and sought to have the case dismissed.\n\nBut Broidy's lawyers have said Benomar's immunity claims are \"without merit.\" They argued that Benomar only claimed to be a diplomat after Broidy sued him \u2014 and that even if he is, his immunity would only cover \"official acts\" as a diplomat, not unrelated hacking of an American citizen.\n\nNow the State Department is weighing in \u2014 and recognizing Benomar's claim to immunity.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, whose office oversees recognition of U.N. diplomats, says it reviewed Morroco's accreditation of Benomar and its request for immunity to ensure it met requirements in U.S. and international law.\n\nThe U.N. secretary-general's special adviser, Jamal Benomar, at a news conference on Oct 13, 2016. Albin Lohr-Jones / Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images file\n\n\"Based on this information, we have registered Benomar with diplomatic privileges and immunities,\" Haley's office, known as the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said in a written statement.\n\nThat determination about Benomar's immunity was also conveyed in writing Wednesday to lawyers on both sides of the case.\n\nA U.S. official, describing the official U.S. position, tells NBC News that Benomar's immunity is not limited to his \"official acts\" as a diplomat. Rather, the official says the U.S. is recognizing Benomar as having \"status immunity\" \u2014 which means he's protected from civil suits even for conduct unrelated to his service as a Moroccan diplomat. That's because the Moroccans have now accredited Benomar at the rank of \"minister plenipotentiary\" \u2014 a high-level title just below that of an ambassador.\n\nIt's unclear whether Benomar has had that rank since becoming a Moroccan diplomat sometime this year, or whether the Moroccans upgraded his status more recently to ensure he'd have full immunity. In court filings, lawyers for Benomar and Broidy have wrangled over his exact rank and when exactly it took effect. The U.S. government says it registered Benomar with diplomatic immunity as of Tuesday.\n\nThe Moroccan Mission to the U.N. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBenomar's attorney, Abbe Lowell, provided the court Wednesday with emails from Haley's office showing that with his new accreditation in hand, he'll be getting a new diplomatic passport and diplomatic ID card within the next few days.\n\n\"The case must be dismissed,\" wrote Lowell, who frequently represents high-profile clients including Jared Kushner.\n\nElliott Broidy and Robin Broidy in 2012 Alex J. Berliner / ABImages via AP Images file\n\nBut Broidy's lawyer, former Ambassador Lee Wolosky, has provided documentation to the court alleging that Benomar, at the same time as he claimed to be a Moroccan diplomat, was also performing \"for-profit work for Qatar.\" Broidy's lawyers say that allegation, along with Benomar being a permanent resident of the U.S., make him ineligible for legal immunity regardless of what the State Department says.\n\n\"The record before the court, and not the statements of spokespeople, will determine how the court will rule,\" Wolosky tells NBC News. \"The record demonstrates that Mr. Benomar, who is alleged to have participated in a hacking conspiracy against a U.S. citizen, is not entitled to status immunity.\"\n\nBut for months, Broidy's lawyers had argued before the court that the State Department's assessment of his immunity would be the final word. His lawyers cited multiple past cases in which courts ruled that \"a person's diplomatic status is established when it is recognized by the Department of State\" and that \"a determination of the Department of State is binding upon the court.\"\n\nJulian Ku, who teaches international law at Hofstra University and isn't involved in the case, says that ultimately, it's up to the judge in the civil case to determine whether the immunity claim is legally valid. But he says that because diplomatic immunity claims are so rare, the courts generally follow the lead of the U.S. government.\n\nJamal Benomar, then the U.N. envoy to Yemen, in 2011. Benomar is being sued by Elliott Broidy, a former RNC deputy finance chair. Mohammed Huwais / AFP/Getty Images file\n\n\"Most courts will defer to the State Department's views on a question like this,\" Ku says. \"It's not binding, but it's super persuasive.\"\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the U.N., which is part of the State Department, wouldn't comment on Broidy's civil case. But it said that before making its immunity determination, it checked with the Justice Department and is \"not aware of any pending criminal charges against Mr. Benomar.\" In the statement, the mission also said that Haley, who is stepping down as U.N. ambassador later this year, \"played no part in reviewing this case.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has little discretion in deciding who should or shouldn't get immunity, but merely reviews the law and documents submitted by the foreign country to see whether the criteria are met. The U.S. generally has to defer to foreign countries to accredit whoever they want as U.N. diplomats because of the United States' obligations as the host country for the U.N. headquarters in New York.\n\nBenomar's claim to be a Moroccan diplomat was particularly surprising given that decades ago, after voicing opposition to Morocco's government, he was arrested there and tortured. He later became a U.N. diplomat who rose through the ranks to become the U.N. special envoy for Yemen.\n\nAlthough Qatar denies involvement in hacking Broidy's emails, it had an obvious potential motive for trying to embarrass him. At the same time that Broidy and Lebanese-American businessman George Nader were seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Broidy was orchestrating an extensive lobbying and public relations campaign against Qatar in the United States, emails later published by various U.S. news outlets showed.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE accuse Qatar of funding terrorism and fomenting dissent throughout the region and have been boycotting the tiny gas-rich nation since last year, in a diplomatic crisis that has roiled the Persian Gulf."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Elisha Fieldstadt", "title": "St. Louis Ballerina reported missing after car found near lake - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com St. Louis Ballerina reported missing after car found near lake NBCNews.com Authorities in Missouri spent a second day on Wednesday searching for a missing ballerina whose car was found unattended near a lake.

CNN had sought the order to recover Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which granted him access to the White House.\n\nJustice Department lawyers including Joseph Hunt, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's civil division, submitted the filing Wednesday morning, hours before a 3:30 p.m. ET hearing on the lawsuits.\n\n\"The President and White House possess the same broad discretion to regulate access to the White House for journalists (and other members of the public) that they possess to select which journalists receive interviews, or which journalists they acknowledge at press conferences,\" the filing says.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, Judge Timothy J. Kelly did not issue a decision on the restraining order and said he would return at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday with a ruling.\n\nAcosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, was denied access to the White House on Nov. 7, hours after Trump verbally berated him as a \"rude, terrible person.\" Acosta at a news conference had questioned Trump about a group of migrants traveling north toward the U.S.-Mexico border and entered into a contentious exchange with the president and refused to give up a microphone when the president tried to move to a different reporter.\n\nCNN sued, saying that Acosta's rights had been violated and that the network wanted to \"ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department argued that Acosta's actions provided the White House with a clear reason to revoke his hard pass.\n\n\"The stated rationale for the revocation of Mr. Acosta\u2019s pass \u2014 that he was disrupting press proceedings \u2014 is evident from the video he has proffered, is entirely viewpoint- and content-neutral,\" the filing says.\n\nThe Justice Department also argued that Acosta was still able to do his job and that CNN has \"roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex.\"\n\nMedia outlets have broadly supported CNN's lawsuit.

But the eruption from my physician colleagues on social media was startling. Responding to the NRA\u2019s central point \u2014 that doctors should \u201cstay in their lane\u201d on the topic of guns \u2014 medical professionals created a viral hashtag, #ThisISMyLane (also #ThisISOurLane), sharing vivid stories of their clinical experiences with gunshot wound victims, arguing that, despite what the NRA might believe, the issue falls unavoidably into the laps of medical practitioners.\n\nPhysicians appeared on NBC and CNN, wrote editorial after editorial, and crafted an open letter to the NRA which read, in part: \u201cphysicians, nurses, therapists, medical professionals, and other concerned community members want to tell you that we are absolutely \u2018in our lane\u2019 when we propose solutions to prevent death and disability from gun violence.\u201d As of this writing, the letter \u2014 which concludes with an invitation for the NRA to \u201ccollaborate with us to find workable, effective strategies to diminish the death toll\u201d \u2014 has been signed by over 30,000 health professionals, an uncommon display of solidarity.\n\nWhy was the response so impassioned? Because the medical community has been censored on this issue before, and it was to our shame and regret.\n\nOver the past 30 years, physicians \u2014 working in concert with epidemiologists, social workers, basic and clinical scientists as well as a wide variety of health workers, communities and industries \u2014 have helped achieve major public health victories, including reductions in cigarette smoking and motor vehicle accidents, as well as life-saving treatments for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.\n\nBut we have stood by helplessly on firearm safety as politicians and lobbyists blocked us from applying standard scientific approaches to gun violence. We weren\u2019t admonished to stay in our lane, exactly \u2014 instead we were told to ignore a health crisis unfolding right in front of us, squarely in our lane. And for the most part, we did.\n\nHealth professionals have realized we can no more neglect searching for solutions to gun violence than we can decline to resuscitate a patient dying of sepsis or heart failure in front of us.\n\nUltimately, however, health professionals have realized we can no more neglect searching for solutions to gun violence than we can decline to resuscitate a patient dying of sepsis or heart failure in front of us \u2014 or to refuse to work toward preventing the next case. We don\u2019t stand at bedsides categorizing health problems as \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d or \u201ctoo hot to handle.\u201d We care about them all, and this is never truer than when harm is preventable, as with most injuries. The healthy toddler who fell out of an unsecured window, or into a pool with a gate left ajar. The suicide in which the most accessible means of self-harm was a particularly effective and irreversible one.\n\nWhile doctors want to prevent harm as a general concept, the trauma of gun violence is accompanied by a specific experience. As signified in the #ThisIsOurLane hashtag, caring for trauma victims does not allow us to forget our responsibility to mitigate suffering. And now the country is witnessing what happens when the burden of this cumulative horror is borne by a new generation of physician-advocates increasingly uncomfortable with inaction.\n\nToday, the notion that physicians should be restricted to bedside caregiving is hopelessly antiquated. Advocacy training is now a standard component of residency curricula. The roles of physician and public health advocate grow more intertwined with each passing year. Many of our healthcare leaders have been outspoken about the necessity of physicians to advance health through advocacy.\n\n\u201cIt is chilling to see the great institutions of health care, hospitals, physician groups, scientific bodies assume that the seat of bystander is available. That seat is gone,\u201d wrote Dr. Donald Berwick, the former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a 2017 commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTo try to avoid the political fray through silence is impossible, because silence is now political. Either engage, or assist the harm. There is no third choice.\u201d\n\nSitting in silence while we treat gunshot wound after gunshot wound is no longer possible, unless we wish to be complicit in perpetuating the problem.\n\nThe rising generation of physicians is more wired to this message than any before, and it is their voices that moved me most this week. Sitting in silence while we treat gunshot wound after gunshot wound is no longer possible, unless we wish to be complicit in perpetuating the problem.\n\nIs it difficult to fight the status quo? It is. But those who have been in a trauma room, soaked to the skin in the blood of a child who was healthy an hour ago, watching his eyes dilate to black and knowing all is lost \u2014 well, we have received a clear, strong directive.\n\nFew physicians can tell you how a carburetor works. But we can tell you, with impressive accuracy, how every beer you consume affects the possibility that you will be in an accident if you drive afterwards. There is a tremendous amount of literature on this topic. And note: We don\u2019t argue for universal abstinence from either drinking or driving. We can be both deeply interested in mitigating the established harms of alcohol, while still at peace with the six-packs of beer in the fridge and the cars in the driveway of homes across the country (including our own).\n\nThe same goes for firearms. Like swimming pools, hang-gliders and airway-sized chunks of hotdog, guns are not going away any time soon, and we hope to coexist with them while minimizing their potential to rip away the lives of our loved ones.\n\nDoctors and other healthcare workers are not looking to be extreme in our approach to firearm injuries.

At 19, she won a pageant organized by her hometown\u2019s baseball team and became a goodwill ambassador for the squad.\n\nBut Diaz\u2019s career changed course in her twenties as she moved to Panama and then Mexico for modeling jobs, which are now scarce in crisis-wracked Venezuela. Three years ago she settled down in Chile, where most of her family has also relocated.\n\n\u201cI represent the new Chile,\u201d the 26-year-old said as she was training at a local gym in Santiago for the upcoming competition. \u201cThis is an inclusive country where immigrants come in search of opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs thousands of people leave Venezuela each day to escape food shortages and an inflation rate that is expected to surpass 1 million percent, dozens of would-be beauty queens are also taking flight and finding work as models and media personalities overseas.\n\nSome are even representing their adopted homelands in international beauty pageants.\n\nNext month, Portugal will be represented at the Miss World competition in China by a former Miss Venezuela participant. And the recently concluded Miss Earth Contest, held in the Philippines, featured two Venezuelan models who competed on behalf of Peru and Spain.\n\n\u201cMy dream of being a beauty queen was not going to stop just because I arrived in a new country,\u201d said Jessica Russo, who represented Peru in Miss Earth, just a year after moving to that country.\n\nShe failed to make it into the finals but said she will now train for more pageants, where she hopes to win a crown for Peru, the country where her mother was born.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still young,\u201d said the 22-year-old. \u201cAnd I want to be a global spokeswoman for good causes.\u201d\n\nBeauty pageants are followed almost as closely as baseball in Venezuela, which has long been obsessed with glamour and good looks. The South American country is a world leader in international pageants, with seven Miss Universe crowns and six Miss World titles.\n\nWhile critics have described the pageants as misogynous and antiquated, they are defended by many Venezuelans who say the events have helped hundreds of women from all social classes launch careers as models, actresses, TV hosts and news presenters. One former Miss Venezuela winner even served as a mayor of a district in Caracas and ran \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 for the country\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn this Oct. 11, 2018 photo, Venezuelan born Jessica Russo, representing Peru in the Miss Earth 2018 beauty pageant, parades during the media presentation in the Miss Earth 2018 Beauty pageant in Manila, Philippines. Bullit Marquez / AP\n\nBut as Venezuela\u2019s economy plunges, the country\u2019s many pageants no longer offer a direct path to employment. Live fashion shows have ground to a halt, TV productions have slowed down and companies such as fashion brands increasingly refrain from spending money on advertisements.\n\nGiselle Reyes runs four modeling schools for young women in Venezuela that she touts as the \u201cuniversity of beauty.\u201d She estimates around 70 percent of her graduates have left the country over the past decade to seek modeling jobs in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and other countries.\n\n\u201cI even have a tough time finding modeling instructors now,\u201d Reyes said at a studio in Caracas that is lined with photos of celebrity Venezuelan pageant winners. \u201cPeople always tell me they will work for me for a few months while they find a way to leave the country.\u201d\n\nEven Venezuela\u2019s most competitive beauty pageant no longer seems to guarantee its graduates a job in their own country.\n\nThe nationally televised Miss Venezuela contest chooses 24 participants each year and puts them through a grueling six-month academy that includes daily gym routines, modeling lessons and pep talks from instructors who sometimes coax their pupils into having plastic surgery.\n\nBut at least 17 members of the Miss Venezuela class of 2015 appear to be working abroad in Mexico, Colombia, Turkey and even as far away as India, according to a web search of their social media profiles. The number of 2014 contestants working overseas is similar.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, participating in Miss Venezuela virtually guaranteed you work in modeling or in TV,\u201d said Rafael Briceno, a Caracas-based radio host who has given public speaking classes to dozens of Miss Venezuela participants. \u201cNow the local market for models is very small.\u201d\n\nMany of the Venezuelan beauty queens who have gone abroad credit their rigid preparation in Venezuela with helping them to succeed. But they also are relieved to be free of the demanding, cookie-cutter beauty standards imposed by pageant organizers at home.\n\nDiaz said that while she was still living in Venezuela, she went to a skin cleansing session that went wrong and left small scars and reddish blotches on both her cheeks. Modeling agencies in Venezuela then started to reject her.\n\nIn Chile, Diaz was able to win the national beauty contest despite the rashes, which can be easily hidden with makeup. She was able to participate because her father is Chilean.\n\n\u201cChile accepted me as I am and helped me to regain the confidence I had lost,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nNow, as she readies for the Miss Universe pageant next month in Thailand, the model hopes that the jury doesn\u2019t just focus on her physical attributes but sees her as a cosmopolitan woman who has moved around the world in pursuit of her goals. She says that she dreams of becoming a motivational speaker working with youth on self-esteem issues.\n\n\u201cA beautiful woman is not just a woman with perfect skin,\u201d Diaz said, \u201cbut someone with a heart, with ideas and a sense of purpose.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dartunorro Clark and Ali Vitali", "title": "Rick Scott says he will recuse himself from certifying Florida election results", "description": "Republican Gov.

On the contrary, election observers and law enforcement have said that, so far, there is no evidence of widespread fraud or forged ballots in the state.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida and Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to remove Scott from any official role in the electoral process.\n\nScott's campaign, however, noted that the lawsuits are insignificant because he also recused himself from certifying his 2014 re-election as governor, as did fellow board members who were also on the ballot.\n\nScott has the authority to appoint someone to take his place on the commission.

The annual report showed there were 7,175 bias crimes in 2017 involving 8,828 victims. Victims targeted due to their sexual orientation or gender identity comprised 1,470 \u2014 or nearly 17 percent \u2014 of all victims.\n\nThe 1,470 victims were involved in 1,249 separate bias incidents. Nearly 60 percent of these incidents targeted gay men, 25 percent targeted a mix of LGBTQ people, 12 percent targeted lesbians, 3 percent targeted heterosexuals, 2 percent targeted bisexuals and 1 percent targeted transgender and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nThe number of hate crimes motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias has remained relatively steady, from a high of 1,256 in 2010 to a low of 1,097 in 2014. Since 2014, the total number has increased every year. But what has also remained constant is the portion of overall hate crimes that are motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias: between 17 and 21 percent. (Note: data on trans and gender nonconforming-related bias incidents starts in 2013.)\n\nThe lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is estimated by Gallup to comprise 4.5 percent of the U.S. population, yet according to the FBI\u2019s newly released report, they make up more than 16 percent of federally reported hate crime victims (subtracting those targeted due to their heterosexuality from the 17 percent figure above). The Jewish and black communities also shoulder a disproportionate percentage of federally reported hate crimes: Jewish people comprise an estimated 2 percent of the U.S. population but make up 11.5 percent of hate crime victims, and the black community is an estimated 13.4 percent of the U.S. population but makes up 28 percent of hate crime victims.\n\nFrank Pezzella, a criminology professor at New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the increase in this year\u2019s number of federally reported hate crimes is alarming \u2014 but still likely a gross undercount of the total number of bias incidents, because many \u2014 perhaps most \u2014 hate crimes go unreported.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge difference between the annual [FBI] hate crime report and the 252,000 hate crime victimizations that are reported each year,\u201d Pezzella explained, referring to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).\n\nThe annual FBI hate crimes report is based on \u201cUniform Crime Reports,\u201d which are statistics reported to the FBI by state and local law enforcement agencies. However, Pezzella said only 75 percent of the approximately 18,5000 police agencies participate in hate crime reporting, and of those who do participate, nearly 90 percent \u201creport zero hate crimes every year.\u201d\n\nFor a better overview of the scale of bias crimes, Pezzella pointed the NCVS, which is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and asks victims directly about their exposure to crime. Pezzella said the NCVS is a better gauge of bias victimization, in part, because it allows victims who are part of marginalized groups \u2014 like undocumented hispanics, blacks and LGBTQ people \u2014 to bypass law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe LGBT community,\u201d Pezella explained, \u201cdo not report hate crimes, and we argue because of the strained relationship with the police,\u201d he said. He also added that the most common answers to the NCVS question about why respondents don\u2019t report crime are \u201cpolice apathetic, police bias\u201d and police ineffective.\u201d\n\nDespite what Pezzella perceives as flaws in the FBI\u2019s hate crimes data, which has been published in some form since 1990, he said it still provides useful information.\n\n\u201cThere are obvious holes in the data,\u201d he lamented. However, he added, \u201cit does provide us 30 years of baseline figures.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Maggie Fox", "title": "Expensive, name-brand medications drive up drug spending - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com Expensive, name-brand medications drive up drug spending NBCNews.com Pricey, name-brand prescription medications continue driving up drug spending even though more patients are getting cheaper generics, according to a study released Wednesday.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nPricey, name-brand prescription medications continue driving up drug spending even though more patients are getting cheaper generics, according to a study released Wednesday.\n\nAnd the spending is not necessarily driven by the hugely expensive but startlingly effective cancer drugs that are grabbing headlines. Most money goes to three exclusive drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other autoimmune diseases, the analysis shows.\n\nFederal health officials and the health insurance industry have been encouraging doctors to prescribe more generic drugs in the hope of saving money, and they are. But new data from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association shows that its insurance company members are paying out more than ever for specialty name-brand drugs.\n\n\u201cExpensive branded prescription drugs accounted for only 17 percent of total prescriptions filled, but 79 percent of total prescription drug spending ($79.5 billion),\u201d Blue Cross Blue Shield said in its report.\n\n\u201cMore expensive branded prescription drug spending is up 4 percent since 2016.\u201d\n\nDrug prices are a major target of patient groups and Congress. Although drug spending makes up only 10 percent of the $3.3 trillion spent on U.S. healthcare in a year, the sometimes eye-watering prices charged for new cancer, hepatitis and immune therapy treatments regularly attract criticism.\n\nMost Americans get their health insurance coverage, including coverage for prescription drugs, from an employer\u2019s provision of private health insurance. Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s analysis looks at drug spending from the perspective of a major private insurer.\n\nThe company\u2019s researchers analyzed medical claims from 41 million clients, and extrapolated them to the 88 million people covered by BCBS.\n\nThe company shells out $100 billion for prescription drugs, or 20 percent of all its spending.\n\n\u201cTotal prescription drug spending increased 10 percent annually since 2010,\u201d the report found. And most prescriptions \u2014 82 percent \u2014 were for cheaper, generic drugs.\n\nBut most of the spending went for brand-name prescription drugs. \u201cExpensive branded drugs accounted for only 18 percent of total prescriptions filled, but 78 percent of total spending,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cCosts for single-source drugs with no generic alternatives increased at more than double the rate of average annual drug spending.\n\nAlthough new cancer immunotherapies and hepatitis drugs grab the headlines with their $100,000-plus price tags, the biggest costs came from three top rheumatoid arthritis drugs: Humira, Remicade and Enbrel, the analysis showed.\n\nA quick-acting insulin, Novolog, was the fourth-leading cost-driver and Neulasta, an immune-boosting product for cancer patients, came in fifth.\n\nHumira, an anti-inflammatory drug that tamps down the immune system, is currently the best-selling drug in the world. It costs about $38,000 a year, according to SSR Health. The spending is high in part because rheumatoid arthritis is so common, affecting 1.3 million to 1.8 million Americans.\n\nThe analysis does not include the effects of drug rebates, which companies often cite as a way to reduce the costs for their products.\n\n\u201cSteady annual increases in branded patent-protected prescription costs drive the majority of spending in the branded drug space, growing 5 percent in the past year alone,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nIn 2017, the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that targeted treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were highly effective but probably cost more than they were worth."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Erik Ortiz", "title": "Activists concerned after wildfire ripped through nuclear research site", "description": "Testing conducted at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Ventura County found 'no discernible level of radiation in the tested area.'", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/no-toxin-risk-after-california-wildfire-burned-former-nuclear-research-n936126", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645831/181114-santa-susana-file-mn-0840_9b4de3cc14a6f2544d9ddd8f0716a2b6.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:37:37Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

U.S. Government\n\nThose tunnels \u2014 and his success delivering drugs quickly with airplanes \u2014 earned Guzman the nickname \"El Rapido,\" prosecutors said during opening arguments Tuesday.

Zambada remains on the loose in Mexico, Lichtman claimed, because of bribes that \"go up to the very top,\" including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.\n\nIn a court filing overnight, prosecutors urged Judge Brian Cogan to throw out Lichtman's statement, saying he made wild allegations he could not prove.\n\nThe judge didn't go that far, but he did admonish Lichtman for having gone \"far afield of direct or circumstantial proof.\" He said he would instruct the jury to focus on the evidence.\n\n\"Your opening statement handed out a promissory note that your case is not going to cash,\" the judge said, calling Lichtman's opening misleading.\n\nLichtman said his client was not the real leader of the cartel - he was just someone who enjoyed having an oversized reputation.\n\nJeffrey Lichtman, attorney for Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, arrives at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse on Nov. 14, 2018.

He described the government's witnesses as liars seeking a break on their own jail sentences - the \"sneakiest, slimiest people.\"\n\n\"These are people who have lied every day,\" he said. \"They're here because they want to get out of jail by any means necessary.\"\n\nOne of those cooperating witnesses took the stand at the end of the day \u2014 Jesus Reynaldo Zambada, the younger brother of \"El Mayo.\" Zambada testified that he'd been a member of Sinaloa Cartel for over 20 years, and worked with both \"El Mayo\" and \"El Chapo.\" Guzman, he said, \"was one of the most powerful drug traffickers.\"\n\nZambada quoted his brother as telling him he and Guzman were \"half and half.\" He is expected to testify all day on Thursday."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Elisha Fieldstadt", "title": "Cleveland reporter Nikki Delamotte died of multiple gunshot wounds", "description": "Cleveland.com culture reporter Nikki Delamotte died of multiple gunshot wounds, while her uncle died of a single gunshot wound.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cleveland-reporter-nikki-delamotte-died-multiple-gunshot-wounds-n936131", "urlToImage": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2644881/181113-nikki-delamotte-cleveland-cs-152p_b074e4f042b395d491adb4c94b6c840a.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:07:39Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday vigorously defended the appointment of Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general, saying that the selection was entirely legal and that the White House was given that advice beforehand.\n\nSteven Engel, assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, said in a 20-page opinion that his office told the White House \u2014 before Whitaker was appointed \u2014 that the president \"could designate a senior Department of Justice official, such as Whitaker, as acting attorney general.\"\n\nThat advice was offered \"after the White House asked what the president's option would be in the event the office of attorney general was vacant and who might be eligible to serve,\" a senior Justice Department official said.\n\nThe opinion came the day after the state of Maryland urged a federal judge to rule that Whitaker's appointment violated the Constitution and a federal law. The judge has yet to act on the state's request for expedited consideration of its motion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump named Whitaker acting attorney general under a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows a president to fill a vacant cabinet position with a senior employee of the affected agency. Whitaker had been the chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, who was forced to resign as attorney general last week.\n\nBut Maryland said a separate federal law governs what happens when the office of attorney general is vacant. It provides that the deputy attorney general takes over, which would be Rod Rosenstein.\n\nWednesday's Justice Department legal guidance said courts have previously held that the president has the option of either using the Vacancies Reform Act to fill a vacant cabinet-level job or allowing the deputy to take over.\n\nThe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has weighed in before on the president's legal authority to use the Vacancy Act to bypass the department's normal order of succession and pick someone not in line to move up. But that opinion, written in 2007 after the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general, assumed that the president's pick already held a Senate-confirmed job.\n\nMaryland also argued that the appointment of Whitaker violates a provision of the Constitution that specifies that top positions in the government can be filled only by someone who has been confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker's appointment bypassed that process.\n\nBut Engel's opinion said the Justice Department has identified over 160 times throughout U.S. history when presidents appointed non-Senate confirmed government officials to serve in high level positions. In recent years, the opinion said, such appointments were made by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe opinion said that while courts have held that the Constitution requires principal officers to be confirmed by the Senate, \"it does not follow that Acting Attorney General should be understood to be one,\" because the person appointed to serve in that capacity is not in a \"continuing and permanent\" position.\n\nMaryland's motion came in a lawsuit over the future of Obamacare, seeking a ruling that the Affordable Care Act remains enforceable despite attempts by the Trump administration to shut it down. It named several defendants, including Sessions, who was attorney general when the case was filed in September. With Sessions gone, Maryland said, the judge overseeing the lawsuit should declare that the attorney general defendant cannot be Whitaker.\n\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe called the Maryland lawsuit entirely legitimate.\n\n\"They're saying that since Jeff Sessions is no longer the attorney general, they can't be expected to engage in this battle against a kind of cloud that might just go pop the moment someone concludes, as they should, that Matt Whitaker is not constitutionally qualified to play that role,\" Tribe said.\n\n\"If they're right about that, and I think they are, this is the way to have it declared.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Minyvonne Burke", "title": "'Black-ish' celebrates milestone 100th episode with Prince tribute", "description": "The achievement typically means that a TV show is ready for syndication, which could lead to bigger audiences and a more lucrative deal.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/black-ish-celebrates-milestone-100th-episode-prince-tribute-n936106", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645866/181114-blackish-purple-rain-mc-1357_a8866cb3cffe740b7abda0e2873f4c15.1200;630;7;70;5.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:16:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Lawahez Jabari and Saphora Smith\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned Wednesday in protest over a ceasefire agreed with Gaza militants, calling the truce a \"surrender to terrorism.\"\n\n\"We are buying short-term peace at the price of long-term national security,\" he said in a press conference announcing his decision, which could weaken Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative coalition government and increases the chances of early elections.\n\nLieberman has called for a stronger response to Palestinian militants' most intense round of rocket fire against Israel since the 2014 Gaza war, according to The Associated Press. The two days of deadly violence raised fears of an all-out war.\n\n\"What happened yesterday, the ceasefire, combined with the entire process of arrangement with Hamas, is a surrender to terrorism,\" he said, referring to the Palestinian militants that control the blockaded and desperately poor Gaza Strip and are considered terrorists by Israel and the U.S.\n\nLieberman added that he also fiercely objected to Israel's allowing Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza last week.\n\nThe resignation withdraws Lieberman's far-right Israel Beitenu party from Netanyahu's coalition, leaving the prime minister with control of just 61 of the 120 seats in parliament a year out from Israel's next election.\n\nLieberman was born in the former Soviet Union and is popular among fellow Russian-speaking immigrants as well as Israeli Jews suspicious of the country's Arab minority or who oppose the religious authority and power of ultra-Orthodox rabbis.\n\nThe leader of Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, described the resignation news as a \"political victory for Gaza.\"\n\n\u201cThe resignation of Lieberman is a recognition of defeat and helplessness in the face of the Palestinian resistance,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Ammar Awad / Reuters\n\nNetanyahu, who will take over Lieberman's position on an interim basis, said Hamas had \"begged for a ceasefire.\" The Israeli leader has come under intense political pressure for not delivering a more decisive blow against Hamas.\n\nSpeaking at a memorial service for Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, Netanyahu responded to criticism saying \"leadership is not doing the easy thing; it is doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe latest round of fighting appears to have been triggered by a botched Israeli raid into Gaza Sunday that ignited clashes and left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli officer dead.\n\nMilitants then fired some 460 rockets and mortars into Israel in a 24-hour period, after carrying out a missile attack on an Israeli bus that wounded a soldier on Monday. The Israeli military said its airstrikes hit 160 targets in Gaza, among them Hamas government buildings and its television station.\n\nSeven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed. In Israel, a man was killed in a rocket strike and three other people were critically wounded.\n\nThe violence follows months of heightened tensions. Since March, thousands of Palestinians have held sometimes violence protests on the fence that separates Israel from Gaza, demanding an end to the blockade and the right to enter Israel to reclaim homes their families left after the country was founded in 1948.\n\nSome 220 have been shot dead and around 24,000 wounded, according to Gazan health officials. Israel maintains many of those hurt and killed on the fence are in fact militants masquerading as peaceful demonstrators.\n\nAt the same time, thousands of acres of Israeli nature reserves and farm lands have been burned in fires caused by hundreds of incendiary kites and explosive balloons sent from Gaza. On Wednesday, Israel's military that it had shot at and captured a Palestinian who approached the Gaza perimeter fence and hurled grenades into Israel.\n\nThe incident marked the first unrest since Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza accepted the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.\n\nThe military said it spotted the assailant with a knife and wire cutters. The grenades failed to explode.\n\nLawahez Jabari reported from Tel Aviv; Saphora Smith from London."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Family of four arrested for murdering Ohio family on pot farm", "description": "Four family members have been charged in connection with the murders of eight members of another family, seven adults and a teenage boy, who were shot execution-style at four homes on a marijuana farm in 2016.

Volusia County Sheriff's Office\n\nChitwood said that Coburn, who told police that he was trying to make homemade fireworks, was savvy enough to create the chemical and not blow himself up.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to move this to our range to detonate, we're probably going to detonate it in a field over here,\" Chitwood said of the highly volatile substance on Tuesday night.\n\nCoburn told police that he began making explosives when he discovered a passion for model rockets and began to experiment with other types of explosives when those model rockets weren't exciting enough, according to a police report. Coburn said he used YouTube videos to \"progress his knowledge,\" the report says.\n\nChitwood said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were at the house to help them move the substance, adding that police would use a robot to move and detonate the chemicals.\n\nLater in the night, police tweeted: \"If you heard a boom in Lake Helen, that was us detonating one of the items. All good. There will be more booms, so don't be alarmed!\"\n\nSome of the items recovered by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office at the home in Lake Helen, Florida, on Nov. 13, 2018. Volusia County Sheriff's Office\n\nCoburn has been charged with making or possessing explosives and two counts of making or possessing a destructive device, according to police records.\n\nPolice said they were grateful for the tip that led to Coburn's arrest.\n\n\u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t have gotten that tip, who would know if we would\u2019ve ever found out. Or it may have been after the fact, a very volatile situation would have taken place and somebody could\u2019ve gotten hurt or, God forbid, killed. So we\u2019re very grateful for that anonymous tip,\u201d Volusia County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad Lt. Lou Marino said.\n\nThe \"Mother of Satan\" is a chemical that is supposed to be ignited in order to detonate but is so unstable it can detonate on its own, officials said. Coburn made the substance out of household materials like nail polish remover and hair dye, police said on Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Allan Smith", "title": "'Should be ashamed': ACLU rips Mississippi GOP Sen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats face a dilemma when it comes to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s quest to regain the speaker\u2019s gavel next year. On the one hand, she remains incredibly unpopular \u2014 her fav/unfav rating in last week\u2019s national exit poll was 31 percent positive, 56 percent negative (-25).\n\nOn the other hand, top Democrats are adamant that she\u2019s the only House Democrat who could do the job. \u201cWe need the strongest general that we have. We need the best tactician. We need the best organizer,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last Sunday. \u201cAnd that's her.\u201d\n\nAnother problem for Pelosi as speaker: Twelve incoming Democratic freshmen who won last week say they won\u2019t support her for speaker. That number could jump to 16 if Gil Cisneros (in CA-39), Jared Golden (in ME-2), Andy Kim (in NJ-3) and Ben McAdams in (UT-4) eventually win their races. If Democrats end up flipping 38 House seats, they can afford only 15 defections to keep their majority. And we\u2019re not even mentioning the current members of Congress who\u2019ve said they won\u2019t support Pelosi.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem for Pelosi\u2019s opponents: There is currently no other House Democrat stepping forward to take her on. \u201cAsked about how the Pelosi defectors could beat somebody with nobody, [Rep. Seth] Moulton seemed undeterred, saying there was plenty of talent in the Democratic Caucus,\u201d HuffPo\u2019s Matt Fuller writes. But no one from that talent has accepted the challenge to compete against Pelosi.\n\nSo Democrats are stuck \u2014 between the option of an unpopular Pelosi who\u2019s problematic for many of the House freshman who just won, and the option of no real Plan B.\n\nBy the way, NBC\u2019s Alex Moe reminds us that, for Pelosi, there are some ways around the current Democratic opposition to her regaining the speakership. For one thing, some new and old members might vote against Pelosi in the closed-door caucus meeting on Nov. 28 \u2014 where she needs only a simple majority from her own party \u2014 and still vote for her on the floor on Jan. 3, when she needs a majority of ALL members to become speaker.\n\nAlso on Jan. 3, Pelosi opponents could vote \u201cpresent,\u201d reducing the magic number she needs to capture a majority.\n\nStill, none of this is easy for Democrats.\n\n12 incoming House Democrats who say they won\u2019t support Pelosi\n\nCO-6: Democrat Jason Crow to the Denver Post in July: \u201cI won\u2019t be supporting Nancy Pelosi \u2026 I want new leadership to set up and move this country forward.\u201d\n\nCT-5: Democrat Jahana Hayes in an August debate: \"I would not vote for Nancy Pelosi.\"\n\nMI-8: Democrat Elissa Slotkin, to the Washington Post in May: \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that on both sides of the aisle, people are seeking new leadership, and I\u2019m going to be looking for someone who best represents my district and what we care about here. And I believe that\u2019s a new generation of leaders.\u201d And in November: \"I'm not about to just flip my principles now that I'm elected.\"\n\nMI-11: Democrat Haley Stevens in November: \u201cAt this time, Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t have my support.\"\n\nMI-13: Democrat Rashida Tlaib to CNN in August: \u201cShe doesn't speak about the issues that are important to the families of the 13th Congressional District, and they are a priority for me.\u201d\n\nMN-2: Democrat Dean Phillips has called for a \u201cnew generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nNJ-2: Democrat Jeff Van Drew said in a statement in June: \u201cAfter more than a decade of leading House Democrats as Speaker and Minority Leader, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi will not have my support as leader in the next session\u201d\n\nNJ-11: Democrat Mikie Sherrill in May: \u201cI won\u2019t be supporting Nancy Pelosi for leadership either, because we know that the next 50 years aren\u2019t going to look like the last 50 years, and we need a new generation of leaders who are going to bring forward fresh ideas as to how we move this country forward.\u201d\n\nNY-11: Democrat Max Rose said over the summer: \u201cIf the Democratic Party is going to earn back the trust of the American people then we need to show them that we are serious about changing our politics \u2014 and that means we need a change in leadership.\u201d\n\nNY-22: Democrat Anthony Brindisi said this spring: \u201cI believe it's time for new leadership on both sides of the aisle.\u201d And in his first ad: \u201cI think it\u2019s time for new leadership on both sides of the aisle in Washington and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t support Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nSC-1: Democrat Joe Cunningham said on Twitter: \u201cThe Democratic Party needs new leadership now. If elected, I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. Time to move forward and win again.\u201d\n\nVA-7: Democrat Abigail Spanberger, in a July statement to NBC News: \u201cWe need new leadership in Washington, on both sides of the aisle, and at every level, from first-term members to Congressional leadership, and for this reason, under no circumstances, would I vote for Nancy Pelosi to again be Speaker of the House.\u201d And on \"Morning Joe\" on Nov. 12, she said again: \u201cI have tremendous respect for everything that Leader Pelosi has been able to accomplish thus far in her very distinguished career within Congress. But I do think that it\u2019s a time that as we have, just such an incredible level of divisiveness in our political rhetoric and discussions, we need new leaders driving the conversation. So I will be voting for someone else.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans hold their leadership contests Wednesday\n\nSpeaking of leadership elections, NBC\u2019s Alex Moe reports that House Republicans are holding their closed-door contests Wednesday afternoon starting at 1:00 p.m. ET. Only a simple majority of the conference is needed to be elected.\n\nHouse Republicans will hold their elections in this order: minority leader, minority whip, conference chair, NRCC chair, policy chair, vice chair and secretary.\n\nAn on-camera press conference with the new leadership team is expected around 3:00 p.m. ET to 4:00 p.m. ET, Moe adds.\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (1)\n\nFL-SEN (Scott leads Nelson by 12,562 votes as the contest heads to a manual recount)\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (1)\n\nGA-GOV (GOP candidate Brian Kemp remains at 50.3 percent)\n\nThe uncalled House races (10)\n\nCA-10 (The AP called this race for Dem Josh Harder; NBC News has yet to call it)\n\nCA-39 (GOPer Young Kim leads Dem Gil Cisernos, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nCA-45 (Dem Katie Porter leads GOPer Mimi Walters, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent)\n\nCA-48 (Dem Harley Rouda has declared victory; he leads, 52 percent to 48 percent)\n\nGA-7 (GOPer Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nME-2 (it appears the race is headed to ranked choice to determine the winner)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans; Dem Xochitl Torres Small is ahead, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nNC-9 (GOPer Mark Harris is ahead, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nNJ-3 (Dem Andy Kim is ahead, 49.9 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nUT-4 (Dem Ben McAdams is ahead, 50.3 percent to 49.7 percent)\n\nWaPo: 'Five days of fury' inside the Trump White House\n\nIt really seems like President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t taken the midterm results very well.\n\n\u201cAs he jetted to Paris last Friday, President Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst. Trump berated May for Britain not doing enough,\" the Washington Post writes.\n\n\u201cFor Trump, that testy call set the tone for five days of fury ... During his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u2018big victory.\u2019 He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I. The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism.\u201d\n\nFirst lady calls for firing of national security aide\n\nHere\u2019s more chaos inside the White House: \u201cIn an extraordinary move for a first lady, Melania Trump\u2019s office on Tuesday publicly called for the firing of a senior National Security Council official,\u201d per NBC\u2019s Carol Lee, Kristen Welker and Hallie Jackson. \u201cStephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s communications director issued a statement around 2:30 p.m. saying the official, Mira Ricardel, should no longer serve as the NSC\u2019s No. 2.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u2019 Grisham said.\u201d\n\n\u201cMelania Trump conveyed the incidents to President Donald Trump, people familiar with the disagreements said.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans in Congress elected a new slate of leaders Wednesday as the party braces for the new reality of divided government.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy of California overcame a conservative challenge by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to become the House minority leader while Senate Republicans re-elected Sen. Mitch McConnell as their leader.\n\nSoon to be in the minority, House Republicans will head into the next congressional session with a smaller, more conservative and less diverse caucus. And they will find themselves with much less power, a new experience for House GOP members who have been in the majority since 2010.\n\n\"Let\u2019s face it, when you are in the minority, your job is just to vote no on what goes on,\" said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who was re-elected last week despite facing federal charges of insider trading. \"You don\u2019t control the hearings, you don\u2019t control the legislation. So it is going to be a different world for all of us.\"\n\nWith Speaker Paul Ryan leaving Congress after not seeking re-election, McCarthy, who is his deputy, will take the top spot against a Democratic majority intent on investigating the president and maintaining their grip on power beyond the 2020 elections. House Democrats will hold their leadership elections on November 28.\n\nMcCarthy beat Jordan with a vote of 159-43. Jordan is a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose bid for leadership represents a show of conservative force. McCarthy has been the heir apparent, however, since Ryan announced his resignation last year.\n\nMcCarthy told reporters after a GOP conference meeting Tuesday night that his goal is to \"continue to move America forward.\"\n\nHe said GOP members talked about the Democrats' agenda that he said centers on \"trying to impeach the president\" and investigating the administration. \"I just think America is too great for such a small vision, so we will continue to work to make America move forward, and our second goal is to make sure we win the majority back,\" McCarthy said.\n\nOne demand from members of the new leader is to come up with an alternative to the Democrats' online fundraising platform, Act Blue, and to commit to raising more money than they did last cycle where Democrats vastly outraised them, even with a $30 million cash infusion from GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.\n\nMcCarthy is set to lead a more conservative conference after many of their more moderate, suburban members lost their seats in the midterm elections.\n\nAnd it will be a less racially and gender diverse conference. Fewer Republican women will serve in the next Congress despite record-breaking numbers of female Democrats who will serve. All but one of the 31 Republican freshman, whose races have been decided so far, are white men, resulting in a conference that is nearly 90 percent white and male. That is a stark comparison to House Democrats, where fewer than 40 percent of their House members are white men.\n\nThe GOP leadership ranks will still have one woman, however, after Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming was unanimously elected to become the GOP conference chair. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who currently holds that position, did not see it again.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s always good to have as many women as possible to have as much diversity as possible represented, but I think at the end of the day what really matters is our policies,\" Cheney said. \"I\u2019m really looking forward to having the chance of being able to talk about why those Republican policies are the right ones for both women and men.\"\n\nHer father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, attended the closed-door leadership election.\n\nSenate Republicans, who retained their majority, are also holding leadership elections on Wednesday. The GOP caucus will see far fewer changes in leadership structure and will have at least one more seat as a result of the midterm elections, perhaps two depending on the final outcome in Florida.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ran unopposed for majority leader and was re-elected Wednesday morning, extending his record-breaking rein as the longest-serving Senate Republican leader.\n\nBut there has been a shake-up down the ranks as all the other leadership spots are subject to term limits.\n\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota was elected as party whip, the second-ranking leadership post. He replaces Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., was elected to Republican conference chair. And Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., will be chair of the Republican Policy Committee chair.\n\nThe fifth-highest spot in the caucus, vice chair, was the only contested position. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa beat out Sens. Deb Fischer of Nebraska Ernst is the first woman to serve in the GOP leadership since Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska left that post in 2010.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., will be the new chair of the Senate's campaign committee, the NRSC.\n\nSenate Democrats also held their leadership elections Wednesday with no changes. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will continue as leader with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as whip. Assistant Democratic Leader Patty Murray of Washington remains in her position.\n\nThe Democrats maintained a large leadership group to encompass all voices, ranging from moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nOne thing that could get complicated for Democrats, however, is as many as three members of leadership are considering running for president, which often pits senators running for re-election against those with presidential ambitions.\n\nHere is the rest of the Democratic leadership:\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.: Chair of Policy and Communications Committee\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass: Vice Chair of Conference\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va.: Vice Chair of Conference\n\nSen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Martha C. White\n\nAlthough growth in the housing market is slowing, the number of million-dollar homes in the United States is on the rise, creating pockets of affluence in a housing market experts say is becoming increasingly unaffordable.\n\nNew research from real estate site Trulia found that roughly 3 million homes across the country today are worth $1 million or more. This amounts to around 3.6 percent of the entire housing market; just six years ago, only 1.5 percent of all homes had million-dollar price tags.\n\nTrulia found that the number of seven-figure homes and the highest rate of increases are overwhelmingly concentrated in California. In San Francisco alone, four out of five homes crack the million-dollar threshold. Outside of the Golden State, Honolulu, Seattle and Long Island, N.Y., also saw major increases in homes worth $1 million or more.\n\nAt just over 14 percent, San Jose had the highest year-over-year increase in million-dollar homes, according to Trulia\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe areas I\u2019m concerned about are the areas that aren\u2019t responding where prices are still accelerating, like San Jose,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign that these areas have such constrained inventory that there are hardly any properties just sitting vacant. That\u2019s continuing to put upward pressure on prices,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nThese kinds of increases aren\u2019t sustainable, Blomquist suggested. \u201cThat seems to defy reason a little bit and those are\u2026 red flags there.\u201d\n\nIn the rest of the country, it\u2019s another story. \u201cThe tax law changed the benefit of various deductions for housing \u2014 that\u2019s hurting certain markets,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nThe average home price in August rose by an annualized 5.8 percent, the fifth month in a row in which price appreciation slowed, and dropping below the 6 percent threshold for the first time in a year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\n\nPrice gains are slowing, but this isn\u2019t making houses any more affordable \u2014 because mortgage rates are rising, which is cooling demand for homes. \u201cThe survey's 30-year fixed-rate, at 5.15 percent, was the highest since April 2010,\" said Joel Kan, associate vice president of economic and industry forecasts for the Mortgage Bankers Association, in a recent report. The MBA\u2019s weekly survey found that mortgage applications for both purchases and refinancings fell by 4 percent for the week ending Nov. 2, a nearly four-year low.\n\nZandi also said Trump\u2019s tax policies were acting as a brake on the market. \u201cHousing is already being affected because of all the fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said, because the massive amount of short-term stimulus injected into the economy by the deficit-funded tax cuts is pushing up borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last year the benchmark 30-year, fixed mortgage rate has climbed more than one percentage point,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cThere is a very pronounced impact on affordability. A year ago, for somebody who was approved for a maximum loan of $250,000, at today\u2019s rates \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 they\u2019d only be approved for a loan of $220,000,\u201d he said.\n\nBut although mortgage rates overall are rising, the richest homebuyers are insulated to a greater degree than other borrowers. That\u2019s because so-called jumbo loans \u2014 those above $453,100 in most of the U.S., or above $679,650 in high-priced areas like New York City \u2014 are generally held in-house by banks rather than packaged into securities and sold off to investors. \u201cJumbo mortgages are not dependent on the secondary market,\u201d Bankrate\u2019s McBride said. \u201cIndividual lenders have a lot more flexibility on pricing.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "SEC subpoenas Snap amid probe into 'growth hacking' and misleading investors", "description": "The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have subpoenaed Snap Inc for information about its March 2017 initial public offering.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/sec-subpoenas-snap-amid-probe-growth-hacking-misleading-investors-n936051", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_17/2413466/180427-snap-inc-wall-street-ew-105p_0db790b9e0b92a8474215b0bbf5aa55c.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:35:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Instead, researchers led by Olivier Sulpis, a graduate student at McGill University in Montreal, simulated seafloor conditions in a laboratory. The simulations showed that the mineral, a form of calcium carbonate known as calcite, is being replaced by murky brown sediments.\n\nCalcite is made of the skeletons and shells of marine organisms laid down over millions of years, and its loss would represent more than an aesthetic matter. The mineral acts as a chemical buffer, neutralizing the carbonic acid that forms when carbon dioxide seeps from the atmosphere into the ocean. The reaction helps prevent runaway acidification of seawater.\n\nBut with cars and factories spewing so much carbon dioxide spewing into the atmosphere, the scientists say, the calcite can't keep up. As a result, the oceans are becoming more acidic.\n\nOcean acidification is bad news for sea creatures. Roughly 250 million years ago, during the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, unusually acidic oceans drove more than 90 percent of marine species to extinction. \u201cIt seems that we are at the dawn of one of these catastrophic events, and we don\u2019t need to look far to find the cause of it,\u201d Sulpis told NBC News MACH in an email.\n\nNot everyone is particularly worried about the depletion of calcite.\n\nWallace Broecker, a Columbia University climate scientist who was not involved in the new study, said in an email that it \u201cgreatly overplays\u201d the calcite problem. The dissolving of calcite \u201coccurs naturally on a large scale in the deep sea,\u201d he said. \u201cA tiny bit more will have no consequence.\u201d\n\nSulpis said the slow depletion of calcite matters, in part because it's unlikely to end anytime soon. Even if emissions of carbon dioxide ended today, he said, it would take centuries for the excess CO2 to stop dissolving the seafloor.\n\nThen there's the stark realization that humanity's effect on our environment is disturbingly pervasive. As Sulpis put it, \"Even at places on our planet where we have never set foot, or that have never been seen by human eyes, such as the deep sea, there is a trace of human activity.\"\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Dareh Gregorian", "title": "Mom accused of murder in Ohio family's slaying once said victim was 'like a daughter'", "description": "Angela Wagner said one of the victims was \"like a daughter\" to her.

Angela Wagner, 48, told the Cincinnati Enquirer last year that her husband, George \"Billy\" Wagner, 47, was \"best friends\" with Hanna's father, Christopher Rhoden, Sr.\n\nDeWine said the Wagners used their familiarity with the Rhodens to plot their murders, studying their routines and the layouts of their homes.

Often called \u201cESG investing\u201d (environmental, social and governance), \u201cSRI\u201d (socially responsible investing), \u201cCSR investing\u201d (corporate social responsibility) or simply \u201cimpact investing,\u201d the concept has been around for years, but millennials are charting new territory when it comes to doing good with their money.\n\nToday, 43 percent of millennials are more likely to consider making impact investments versus only a third of Generation Xers and a quarter of Boomers. When those surveyed were asked what\u2019s more important \u2014 making money or making an impact \u2014 the majority of all investors (67 percent) said they would prioritize having an impact. \u201cThey aren\u2019t saying, \u2018I\u2019m willing to lose money,\u2019 but they are saying, \u2018Even if I have to get a slightly lower return, I\u2019m okay with that to improve social issues and company governance,\u2019\u201d says Lule Demmissie, managing director of investment at TD Ameritrade.\n\nThe Global Impact Investing Network reported that nearly $140 billion was invested in impact investment strategies, up from just $10.6 billion in 2014 \u2014 a staggering increase.\n\nExcept that, they often don\u2019t. Impact investments have outperformed the benchmark for eight out of the last 10 years, according to the MSCI ESG Leaders Index. During the same period, impact investments also showed they were better protected from the downside in the market. That\u2019s why even people who aren\u2019t so passionate about saving the world may want to get on the bandwagon (and why the bandwagon is turning into quite the parade.) In May, the Global Impact Investing Network reported that nearly $140 billion was invested in impact investment strategies, up from just $10.6 billion in 2014 \u2014 a staggering increase. Additionally, impact investment network Toniic reports that its members now have $2.8 billion total in impact investments, up more than $1 billion since 2016.\n\n\u201cAs the industry continues to grow and mature, we believe that over time, there will be no 'impact' investing \u2014 it will simply be investing,\u201d says Michael Tiedemann, CEO/CIO of Tiedemann Advisors.\n\nHuman Rights Is Leading The Way\n\nSo, where are people putting their money? Human rights was the most popular cause category for investors, followed by the environment and diversity, according to the survey. Millennials favored environmental impact and human rights, women tended to opt for gender equality, while men leaned toward diversity. Nearly half of millennials \u2014 47 percent \u2014 felt so strongly about impact investing they said they would move their brokerage account to gain broader access to socially responsible investments.\n\nOf course these conscious choices aren\u2019t just impacting portfolios \u2014 publicly traded companies are starting to realize that it\u2019s good for their business to give a more critical look at which suppliers they\u2019re using, or how much of an environmental impact their operations may make. \u201cIn some cases, companies are changing their behavior, and you can give investors the credit for the rapid momentum of those changes,\u201d Demmissie says.\n\nA Contributing Factor in the Disappearance of Straws\n\nCompanies seeking to ensure long-term success may need to take a hard look at some of their policies, says Jordan Farris, Head of ETF Product Development at investment services firm Nuveen. \u201cStarbucks is a good example of a company adjusting its business model,\u201d he says. \u201cAs concern regarding the increase in ocean plastic has grown, Starbucks has made the decision to eliminate single-use plastic straws by 2020.\u201d\n\nFor investors looking to ensure their money supports the \u201cbest\u201d companies, Farris cautions that the definition of what makes a company responsible can vary widely. Overall, it\u2019s any company that is incorporating \u201cpositive environmental, social and governance practices into its core business model,\u201d he says. But investors can also have an impact simply by choosing not to invest in companies that are involved in major controversies, that pollute, or that manufacture tobacco or firearms, etc.\n\nHow Do You Do Well By Doing Good?\n\nInvestors looking to do their due diligence on a company before they invest need look no further than the internet, explains Nick Kovacevich, CEO of KushCo Holdings, the parent company of several cannabis industry firms. \u201cInformation is so ever-present today, and it\u2019s not difficult for someone to do 30 minutes of research on a company and come to a determination if they are socially and environmentally conscious.\u201d\n\nIf millennials have proven nothing else over the last decade, it\u2019s that they\u2019re willing to push boundaries, even when \u2014 perhaps especially when \u2014 it means a break with convention, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing with impact investing, Tiedemann explains. \u201cThey\u2019re questioning the traditional view of making investments to create wealth, and then once they've made money, donating it to their charity of choice.\u201d They\u2019ve decided they want to get the double investment benefit of a social and a financial return, and they\u2019re demanding that the marketplace provide it.\n\nAnd while it may be the millennials leading this charge now, they\u2019re really just the thin end of the wedge, Kovacevich says. \u201cMillennials are going to teach their children the same ethics and values that they have,\u201d he says, and the impact investment train is only going to build momentum as it chugs along. Tomorrow\u2019s companies will either choose to hop aboard, or find themselves left at the station.\n\nWith Kathryn Tuggle\n\nHOW TO SAVE MORE MONEY\n\nWant more tips like these?

But a few residents have begun to ask why notice did not get out to more people about the fire, which has killed 48 and destroyed an estimated 7,600 single-family homes, both records for California.\n\nWe were trying to move tens of thousands of people out of an area very rapidly with the fire coming very rapidly. And no matter what your plan is to do that, no plan will ever work 100 percent when you are dealing with that much chaos.\"\n\n\"They definitely didn't do enough,\" said Christina Taft, whose 67-year-old mother has been missing since the fire. \"She didn't expect it to be that bad. She expected someone would be calling, or something, if it got bad. But they didn't.\"\n\n\"They were negligent. They just let them go,\" said Taft, who has had no word from her mother, Victoria, since last Thursday. \"There is a reason all these people are dead.\"\n\nA resident of Magalia, about 8 miles west of the fire\u2019s starting point, confronted Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea and other officials Monday about why he and his neighbors could not find any information about the dangerous blaze, a full three hours after fire crews first responded to the ignition point, near Highway 70 in Plumas National Forest.\n\n\u201cWe use the emergency broadcast system for a tornado warning. But this is a deadly fire,\u201d said the man, who was not identified by county officials whom he addressed at the meeting in Oroville. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any alert coming over my radio. ... People in the community are freaking out, you need to get some information up here.\u201d\n\nThe Butte County sheriff's office said it did deliver notifications about the fire danger: 5,227 by email, 25,643 via phone (to both land lines and cellular devices) and 5,445 by text message.\n\n\"I wish we had the opportunity to get more alerts out, more of a warning out, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t,\" Sheriff Honea told the public meeting on Monday.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday evening, Honea stressed that the fire\u2019s unusually swift progress south and west into Magalia, Paradise and other mountain communities made timely notification difficult.\n\n\"You have to keep in mind that this was an extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving situation. The fire started in a remote area. It takes awhile for our fire resources to get there and from that point, trying to determine the path of travel and whether or not that\u2019s going to effect populated areas, that takes time,\" Honea said.\n\nHe added that it's possible some people were warned and didn't immediately act to get out of harm's way. \"We were trying to move tens of thousands of people out of an area very rapidly with the fire coming very rapidly. And no matter what your plan is to do that, no plan will ever work 100 percent when you are dealing with that much chaos.\"\n\nHonea, who took office four years ago, also suggested that emergency officials have to be concerned not to over-burden people with excessive or unneeded evacuation orders. He said the region had already lived through evacuations from earlier fires and last year\u2019s threatened collapse of the Oroville Dam, which caused nearly 200,000 people to flee.\n\n\u201cSo that takes a toll on people,\u201d Honea said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever get into situation where people begin to stop paying attention because they feel like we are ordering evacuations for no cause or for very little cause.\u201d\n\nLike other counties, Butte has a system that allows residents to sign up for \u201creverse 911\u201d telephone alerts in times of emergency.\n\nSavannah Rauscher told The Sacramento Bee that by the time she got the 911 alert at 8:30 a.m., embers and dust were already flying around her family\u2019s Edgewood Lane home.\n\n\"We saw a wall of fire,\" she told the newspaper. \"Trees were glowing 50 yards away and it was probably moving like 10 yards every couple minutes. ... I had no idea it could be that fast.\"\n\nRausher and her husband soon found themselves in a long and unmoving line of cars. Her husband pulled into what normally would have been the oncoming traffic lane to escape, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to die like this.\u201d Rausher said she waved other cars to follow along to safety.\n\nHigh on the ridges above the Sacramento Valley, many homes do not have easy cellphone service, or access to WiFi. It\u2019s unknown how much that isolation may have prevented residents from getting word of the fire.\n\nRisa Johnson, a reporter for The Chico Enterprise-Record, said people in her newsroom also wondered how many residents might not sign up for the reverse 911 warnings because of concern about giving the government their personal information. The Sierra Nevada foothills are home to some who moved there precisely because they wanted to get away from intrusion by public officials.\n\nBut even signing up for the warnings was no guarantee they came through. Johnson said her aunt, Peg, applied for the 911 alerts, but received no notice at her Paradise home of the Camp Fire. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was friends and family calling, or neighbors coming by. That\u2019s how many people found out.\u201d\n\nTaft said she argued fiercely with her mother for more than an hour, trying to convince her to flee. But there were no sheriff\u2019s deputies demanding the neighborhood evacuate. Fire crews, busy on the front lines of the blaze, did not stop by. No one she talked to in her neighborhood was ordered out.\n\nShe said that when she reluctantly left her mother, the elder Taft was on the phone, talking to another elderly woman, both of them persuaded this fire would pass by, like all the others.\n\n\"Seniors expect an authority to tell them to leave,\" said Christina Taft, a business student at California State University, Chico. \"And they did not get the authorities to tell them this time.\"\n\nSheriff Honea was greeted warmly by much of the crowd at Monday's public hearing. And some fire victims said it was wrong to blame the government for the fire's toll.\n\n\"This was an act of God, if you asked me,\" said Bill Husa, 55, a long-time photographer for the Chico Enterprise Record. \"None of these officials have control over 50-mile-an-hour winds and a raging wildland fire. There is no way they had time to get everyone notified.\"\n\nQuestions about emergency notifications are becoming a more routine reality for emergency management officials nationwide, given storms, floods and wildfires made more potent as a result of global warming, said Rob Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Nationwide we are all feeling the trauma of climate change and the number of disasters we are facing over and over again,\" said Lewin. \"We have to build an emergency management system that is ready to handle the new situation we are dealing with.\"\n\nAfter firestorms last year devastated broad swaths of Sonoma and Napa counties and blackened a record number of acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, many people reported they did not receive emergency warnings.\n\nPatients were being evacuated from the Feather River Hospital as it burned down during the Camp Fire in Paradise on Nov. 8. Josh Edelson / AFP - Getty Images\n\nLewin said his county has beefed up its notification system as a result \u2014 sending word of evacuations over land lines, cellphones, social media and traditional news outlets. Still, the system is not foolproof. Just 12 percent of the county's residents have signed up to receive so-called reverse 911 notifications in emergencies, despite last year's fires and a subsequent debris flow that killed 21 people. Even a system designed to push warnings to all cellphones, tested recently by the Trump administration, did not reach everyone.\n\nLewin said he had two cellphones side by side during that test, both serviced by the same phone company, and only one received the emergency alert. \"And we don't know the reason why,\" he said.\n\nAn exacerbating factor in Butte County may have been the advanced age of many residents. Paradise and its environs are popular with retirees, some of whom are reluctant to leave home because of mobility problems. Feather River Hospital had to rely on private cars and trucks to get out many of its patients, just ahead of the flames.\n\nCourtney Wright, a medical assistant, said her 54-year-old father was not compelled to leave his Magalia home even as the threat seemed to escalate. \"We have had so many fires up there that it's kind of like it's nothing,\" said Wright. \"It's just on to the next.\" When the house behind his caught on fire, its propane tank exploding, Wright's father finally decided it was time to move on.\n\nResidents did not find an easy path to safety. The narrow mountain roads out of the communities quickly jammed, forcing some people to leave their cars and run for their lives. The incinerated corpses of others, still in their cars, provided ample evidence that the alarm wasn't raised in time.\n\nAs Honea was pressed for more answers at Monday\u2019s meeting, he acknowledged that thoughts of those who could not escape troubled him. \u201cI understand it was absolutely chaotic,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cI will probably never be able to give you an answer that satisfies you.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "NBCNews.com", "title": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama describes life in the White House", "description": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off her book tour with Oprah Winfrey in Chicago.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/video/former-first-lady-michelle-obama-describes-life-in-the-white-house-1370056771738", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201811/f_mo_la_michelle_oprah_181113.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:28:12Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Oprah interviews former first lady Michelle Obama copied!\n\nTo kick off her book tour, former first lady Michelle Obama was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in Chicago.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThe number of infections carried by ticks has hit a record high in the United States, according to a new report.\n\nNearly 60,000 people were diagnosed with a tickborne infection, mostly Lyme disease, in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. And that\u2019s almost certainly just a fraction of the true count.\n\n\u201cThe true number of cases is probably 10 times that,\u201d said Dr. John Aucott, director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center and chair of the federal Tick-Borne Disease Working Group.\n\nThe working group issued a report Wednesday saying states and the federal government need to spend more to track, prevent and treat these infections as they affect more and more people.\n\n\u201cThere are more cases. Every year, the geographic distribution expands,\u201d Aucott told NBC News.\n\nCongress told the Health and Human Services Department to set up the working group as part of the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. This is the group\u2019s first report.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that ticks are infecting more people as the bugs themselves spread, Aucott said. It\u2019s also clear that much more work is needed to keep track of these infections and to help people suffering from them.\n\n\u201cThere are so many questions out there that haven\u2019t been answered,\u201d Aucott said.\n\n\u201cWe heard comments from hundreds and hundreds of patients. It is obvious that this is a real problem, that people are really suffering.\u201d\n\nThe CDC said it\u2019s not entirely clear why the number of reported cases is on the rise. \u201cA number of factors can affect tick numbers each year, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and host populations such as mice and other animals,\u201d the agency said in its report on the number of new cases.\n\n\u201cTick densities in any year vary by region, state, and county. Numbers of reported tickborne disease cases are also affected by healthcare provider awareness, testing, and reporting practices. Finally, during any given year, people may or may not notice changes in tick populations depending on the amount of time they or their pets spend outdoors.\u201d\n\nLyme disease infected 42,743 people in 2017, the CDC said. That compares to 36,000 cases in 2016.\n\nOther diseases commonly spread by ticks include: Ehrlichiosis, spread by the Lone Star tick, which affected 7,700 people last year; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which affected 6,200 people; babesiosis, which affected 2,300; tularemia, which affected 239 people and Powassan virus, which affected 33.\n\nLyme is by far the most common tickborne infection and most cases probably are not even ever diagnosed. It likely infects 300,000 people a year, the working group said. \u201cThe number of U.S. counties now considered to be of high incidence for Lyme disease has increased by more than 300 percent in the Northeastern states and by approximately 250 percent in the North-Central states,\u201d the report reads.\n\nTests for Lyme are not very good, the report notes. \u201cThis leaves physicians without the tools needed to diagnose; and without an accurate diagnosis, it is challenging for physicians to provide early treatment,\u2019 the report said.\n\n\u201cPersistent symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease can be severe, yet their cause(s) remains unknown and debated. There are currently no uniformly accepted or validated treatment options for patients with these chronic symptoms.\u201d\n\nThis big gap in knowledge makes it possible for people to argue about how to treat patients, Aucott said. \u201cOne of the sticking points was how to even name it,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients with what they describe as chronic Lyme disease have been critical of medical groups such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which are skeptical of the idea that long-term antibiotic treatment can cure people of their symptoms.\n\n\u201cIf we knew more, maybe these controversies would go away,\u201d Aucott said.\n\n\u201cAmericans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a lack of attention at the federal level and by divisions within the field,\u201d the report says."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Adam Reiss", "title": "Christie's auction of American art sets records, hauls $318 million", "description": "An evening of intense and competitive bidding in New York set fifteen records for American painters at Christie\u2019s Tuesday night, bringing in more than $317,801,250.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/christie-s-auction-american-art-sets-records-hauls-318-million-n936021", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645231/181113-12b_hopper_chop-suey-ac-647p_692b41c1196c48faf367b7ea5f32a50d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T04:48:00Z", "content": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Adam Reiss\n\nAn evening of intense and competitive bidding in New York set fifteen records for American painters at Christie\u2019s Tuesday night, bringing in more than $317,801,250.\n\nThe artworks sold were all from the private collection of Barney Ebsworth, a former travel company executive and art collector who built what would become one of the finest private collections of 20th century American art.\n\nEdward Hopper's iconic 'Chop Suey' sold for a staggering $91,875,000, a new auction record for the category of American Art. Chop Suey, an oil on canvas painted in 1929, is believed by experts to be inspired by Chinese restaurants Hopper visited, both in New York and on his travels.\n\nIt was considered the greatest Hopper in private hands.\n\nA uniquely American place in the early 20th century, the chop suey joint personified the spirit of the modern melting pot. Hopper\u2019s painting portrays two women in conversation and, according to some art scholars, one striking detail is that its female subject is facing her doppelg\u00e4nger. While they are seated across from each other, they don't appear to be talking to each other. The brilliant effects of light on the canvas are uniquely Hopper.\n\nWillem de Kooning's \"Woman as Landscape\" Christie's\n\nA Willem de Kooning work, his tour de force, \u201cWoman as Landscape,\u201d set a record for the artist, selling for $68,937,500.\n\nOther artists setting records included Alexander Calder, for his standing sculpture woodwork, \u201cHen,\u201d which sold for $8,412,500,\n\nOther records went to artists Arshile Gorky, Francis Criss, Joseph Stella and George Tooker, for his \u201cA Game of Chess,\u201d which sold for $432,000. All the evening\u2019s sales were to anonymous buyers.\n\nMarc Porter, Christie's chairman, said Tuesday's auction was special for its irony. The reason Barney Ebsworth began collecting American paintings was because he was told European paintings were too expensive. Ebsworth\u2019s collection ended up as one of the top five collections ever sold at auction.\n\n\"There has been a groundswell of interest in American Modernism. One of the most interesting of this collection is that it explored all elements of American painting and sculpture in the 20th century from magic realism to abstract expressionism and beyond,\" Porter said.\n\nEighty percent of the works sold went to American buyers, according to Christie\u2019s. Porter said despite the high prices the market isn't overheated, \"it's exactly the right temperature.\"\n\nEric Widing, deputy chairman of Christie's, knew Ebsworth for decades. \"He was passionate about art, he was a student, he knew artists in depth. He bought low at times and he also bought high at times and sold high as we saw tonight,\" Widing said.\n\nA statement from the Ebsworth family read: \"We are delighted with the results tonight at Christie's which paid tribute to my father\u2019s eye and focused on quality. The works that gave him so much pleasure will now do the same for their new owners.\"\n\nEbsworth purchased a small travel company in 1959, which would grow into INTRAV, an international travel company. As an early pioneer in the cruise industry he founded and was chairman for Royal Cruise Line and Clipper Cruise Line. Ebsworth was named one of the World's 200 Greatest Collectors by Art News Magazine in 2012.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 14, 2018, 8:56 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the first name of the private collector whose paintings were sold at Christie\u2019s.

Clark Jr. with transportation of a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high capacity magazines intended for use with AR-15 weapons.\n\nThe case against Clark Jr., 30, was filed Friday but unsealed Tuesday. The Metropolitan Police Department assisted in the arrest in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and described Clark in its public incident report as a \"white supremacist\" involved in a \"suspected hate crime\" investigation.\n\nThe FBI affidavit, filed in support of the U.S. Attorney's criminal complaint, alleges that two family members called the FBI after becoming concerned about Clark's behavior, which they described as \"really riled up\" and \"agitated.\"\n\nThey believed he was \"heavily involved\" in the alt-right movement, according to the FBI.\n\nAgents said that Clark and his younger brother attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. The gathering of white nationalists and alt-right supporters ended in one death and much violence.\n\nFamily members told the FBI they believe the brothers had photos from the event with James Alex Fields, the man prosecutors say drove a car into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other protesters, the filing states.\n\nThe witnesses also told agents that the pair \"admired\" Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski, and Charles Manson,\" the affidavit staes. The two believed a race war was coming, \"and they wanted to expedite it,\" according to the FBI's account of what relatives said.\n\nThe bureau alleged that Clark once said he and his late brother fantasized about killing \"Jews and blacks.\"\n\nAdditionally, the FBI stated, Clark's adult younger brother committed suicide within three hours of the synagogue attack, which claimed the lives of 11 worshipers. After his sibling's death Clark told family members he believed Bowers was a friend on conservative social media platform Gab, according to the filing.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Bowers was a self-proclaimed white supremacist upset that a Jewish organization, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS, has long supported Central American refugees.\n\nThe violence came at the height of President Donald Trump's midterm election campaigning, during which he often raised the specter of an \"invasion\" of Central Americans participating in a migrant caravan headed for the southern border.\n\nThe legal document lists what prosecutors say are some of Clark's postings and musings, including a Gab rant that stated the victims of the synagogue attack, which federal prosecutors allege was a hate crime, \"were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse.\"\n\nClark said that the synagogue violence was justified because, he believed, \"a homosexual Jewish couple was having an adopted baby circumcised that week,\" according to the court filing.\n\nHe called Bowers a \"hero,\" according to the FBI.\n\nClark's family thought he was smoking marijuana and possibly methamphetamine. On Gab, the Washington resident described himself as a \"Meth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nConcerned that he could be a danger to himself or others, the family members made a failed attempt to take Clark's firearms sometime before alerting authorities, the filing said.\n\nDuring a search of Clark's home Friday, agents seized a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun \u2014 all registered to Clark and his brother \u2014 as well as an unregistered Colt .38 Special that a relative handed over, according to the allegations.\n\n\"In addition,\" the FBI affidavit states, \"agents recovered four high-capacity AR-15 magazines capable of holding up to 30 rounds of ammunition.\"\n\nWashington, D.C. outlawed such magazines.\n\nClark lives in Washington with his father and sister, the affidavit states.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Benjy Sarlin\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Indivisible, the grassroots movement at the center of opposition to President Donald Trump, taught its activists how to influence lawmakers from outside of power with an online guide in late 2016 based on the tea party's tactics under Barack Obama.\n\nNow the \"resistance\" group is looking to prepare its members for life under divided government.\n\nIndivisible's approach two years ago went viral, local chapters popped up around the country and its members helped fuel a Democratic takeover of the House in the midterms. The updated sequel, a guide to \"Indivisible On Offense,\" looks to instruct progressive members on the power that comes with Democratic control of the House and how they can maximize it.\n\n\"I was calling Indivisible leaders around the country to thank them this week and the dominant theme was 'Okay, but what are we doing next?'\" Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of Indivisible, told NBC News at a gathering in Washington for newly elected progressives.\n\nThe the new guide includes detailed advice on pressuring members to investigate Trump, but also on how to potentially confront Democratic leaders to secure concessions in what Indivisible calls \"must-pass bills.\"\n\n\"A small group of progressives willing to vote no on must-pass bills that Democratic leadership needs to pass gives them leverage, if they're willing to use it,\" the authors write.\n\nIn a preview of how the emboldened grassroots wing might operate, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined climate protesters in occupying Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office on Tuesday. The two exchanged kind words on Twitter, but Ocasio-Cortez's demands were more than symbolic: She pushed for a plan to combat climate change by 2020 drafted without input from Democrats who take donations from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, congresswoman-elect from New York, speaks to activists with the Sunrise Movement protesting in the offices of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Capitol Hill on Nov. 13, 2018. Sarah Silbiger / The New York Times - Redux Pictures\n\nIndivisible's goal, according to the book, is to \"pave the way to the post-Trump era\" both by stymieing the Republican agenda and by laying the groundwork for a more robust progressive platform if they defeat Trump in 2020.\n\n\"In 2017, they organized against Trumpcare, they made the Republican tax scam a liability,\" Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, said in an interview. \"In 2018, they registered voters, endorsed candidates and got out the vote. In 2019, they're going to be holding those same representatives accountable.\"\n\nThe tea party movement and its legislative bastion, the House Freedom Caucus, again figure prominently in the guide. The hope is to replicate their success in influencing legislation while avoiding some of the movement's stumbles after their own wave election in 2010.\n\nPart of that approach could mean standing up to Democratic leaders, but it also means managing expectations. The tea party frequently battled Republican leadership, sometimes forcing them to negotiate with Democrat members on spending bills, in part because activists became convinced they could repeal Obamacare with a Democratic president and Senate. Those tensions peaked in 2013 when conservatives forced a government shutdown in an unsuccessful attempt to defund the Democratic health law.\n\nThe new guidebook doesn't dwell on how high activists should aim, but it devotes a lot of space to distinctions between \"messaging bills,\" which are designed to build support for future policy goals and put Republicans on record opposing them, and must-pass bills like spending legislation, where members can withhold votes to force more modest policy changes.\n\n\"We talk to people realistically about what's going on, what we think is possible now, and what we think will take time to accomplish, and that's a core philosophy that animates the guide,\" Greenberg said.\n\nThere's plenty of material on the Democrats' new power to investigate the White House through subpoenas and hearings, which leaders say is likely to be a big driver of activist engagement. The authors write that members should \"demand nothing less than Democrats using their oversight authority on Day One to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns,\" while also pressuring lawmakers to investigate potential cabinet-level scandals in the relevant committees.\n\nOnce again, there are some notes of caution, with a section on impeachment warning that it's likely out of bounds unless Trump's political support collapses and investigations producer stronger evidence. While the guide says Indivisible supports opening impeachment proceedings on principle, it adds \"we also recognize that impeachment is not a matter of whether someone objectively deserves to be impeached; it's a matter of whether the votes are there.\""}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Phil Helsel", "title": "Death toll in Northern California wildfire climbs to 48, as grim search continues", "description": "The remains of six more victims in the Camp Fire in Northern California were found Tuesday, bringing the total number of known dead to 48, officials said.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-toll-northern-california-wildfire-climbs-48-grim-search-continues-n935656", "urlToImage": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645041/181113-camp-fire-destruction-ew-443p_438a01d856548005d5c51af1297948d7.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:50:31Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Phil Helsel and Steve Patterson\n\nThe remains of six more victims in a deadly Northern California wildfire were found by searchers on Tuesday, bringing the death toll in the Camp Fire to 48, the sheriff said.\n\nAll six sets of remains were found in homes in the area of Paradise, a town devastated by the Camp Fire which broke out Thursday morning and is considered to be the most destructive and deadliest fire in recorded California history.\n\nButte County Sheriff-Coroner Kory L. Honea said that he's requested 100 National Guard troops to work in conjunction with those searching for human remains in the fire, which as of Tuesday night has burned around 130,000 acres and was 35 percent contained.\n\n\"We want to be able to cover as much ground as quickly as we possibly can,\" Honea said, adding that even after a search is done and people are allowed to return to the community, it\u2019s possible more remains may be found.\n\n\"I know that that's a very difficult thing to think about, but that's the difficult situation that we find ourselves in today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Camp Fire is one of two deadly wildfires burning at opposite ends of California.\n\nIn Southern California near Los Angeles, the Woolsey Fire that broke out Thursday afternoon has killed two people near Malibu, burned more than 97,100 acres \u2014 an area around the size of the city of Denver \u2014 and destroyed an estimated at least 435 homes and other structures. A fire official said the number of destroyed structures is expected to rise significantly as assessments are done. The fire was 40 percent contained Tuesday night.\n\nThe Camp Fire broke out at around 6:33 a.m. on Thursday in Butte County, north of Sacramento, according to officials. An estimated 7,600 single-family homes and 260 commercial structures have been destroyed, and the town of Paradise, population around 26,000, was devastated by the blaze.\n\nThe Camp Fire is the deadliest in state history, surpassing the 1933 Griffith Park Fire that killed 29 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nAs the fire overtook Paradise as people were evacuating Thursday, Cal Fire Division Chief David Hawks, who is also the fire chief for the town, saw one of two ambulances transporting patients from a hospital to safety catch fire, and directed everyone inside that vehicle and in another ambulance to a cul-de-sac.\n\nWith embers raining down in what Hawks likened to snowflakes in a blizzard, they sought shelter in a house and prepared to ride it out. One of the four paramedics was able to get in the home\u2019s garage through a doggie door and unlock the door, and the four patients were moved inside, he said. There were also three nurses.\n\n\"What I told everyone: \u2018We\u2019re going to ride the fire out here and we need to protect this home,\u2019 Hawks said Tuesday. \"You know, this is our Fort Knox, basically.\"\n\nParamedics began clearing pine needles from around the home and from the gutter of the roof. If the house ended up catching fire, Hawk said they were prepared to enter the cul-de-sac which was an open area to ride out the fire.\n\n\"A couple of them were on phones with family members, talking with family members and what have you. And basically they asked me if I thought they were going to die here, or one of them did,\u201d Hawks recalled.\n\n\"And I told them, I don\u2019t believe that we are going to die here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very serious situation but I think if we follow my direction, we\u2019ll ride the fire out here.\"\n\nThey were joined by two members of search and rescue teams, who also took shelter in the house. The road eventually cleared enough for those seeking shelter to make it back to Feather River Hospital, which although was near flames also had a large parking lot which would have been a better place to shelter until they could escape the town.\n\nHawks, who joined Cal Fire right out of high school in 1984, said he doesn\u2019t consider his actions exceptional.\n\n\"I was doing my job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of lives saved by a lot of people that day \u2014 not only myself, but by a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThree of the dead in the Camp Fire have been identified and the next of kin notified, the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. They are: Ernest Foss, 65, of Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, of Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, of Magalia.\n\nThere have also been several arrests for suspected looting in the evacuation zone, Honea said.\n\nTwo men were arrested on Monday inside a home in Butte Creek Canyon, one of whom had a handgun registered to a home under evacuation in Paradise; two men were arrested Tuesday in an area under evacuation and they allegedly had a laptop that didn\u2019t belong to them; and a man and a woman were arrested in a stolen motorhome in Chico on Tuesday, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nWhile the Woolsey Fire is still burning, officials said the tide is turning.\n\n\"The risk has diminished significantly,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters midday in Thousand Oaks. \"When you think about this fire several days ago, it burned from Bell Canyon to the ocean which is approximately 30 miles. So our firefighters have gotten the upper hand.\u201d\n\nAnother fire burning in Southern California, the Hill Fire in Ventura County, was 90 percent contained Tuesday after burning more than 4,500 acres since it broke out on Thursday, according to Cal Fire.

The woman had been standing in the ticket line for four days and could only hope she would be able to make up the difference. Luckily, the police department said, the Times Square Unit patrol officer \u201cunderstood the magnitude of the emergency and pulled a 20 out of his pocket so she didn\u2019t have to throw away her shot.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the streets of New York City, a kaleidoscope of people from different countries said the world could use more days like these.\n\n\"It shouldn't be just a day,\" said 21-year-old Marianne Volichen, a tourist from Philippines. \"There should be kindness everyday.\"\n\nNew York resident Jacob Roscoe, who didn't know it was World Kindness Day, also agreed.\n\n\"I think we could definitely use more kindness,\" Roscoe said. \"I definitely think it comes from people being more thoughtful with their actions.\"\n\nFor 48-year-old Alberta Archie, looking toward the generosity of children may be the answer.\n\n\"Kids, in general, children really teach us,\" the Canadian tourist said, looking at the young girl playing next to her on a bench outside of Rockefeller Center."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Jasmin Boyce", "title": "Salesforce's Marc Benioff says it's time for tech to change", "description": "Marc Benioff, the Salesforce co-founder and co-chief executive officer, has a message for the leaders of big tech: You\u2019re thinking too small.", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/salesforce-s-marc-benioff-says-it-s-time-tech-change-n935921", "urlToImage": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2644991/181113-marc-benioff-se-351p_5490d4e4cfd0a26568d9313e5ec4275d.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:21:00Z", "content": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The New York Times reported that two executives who had been credibly accused of misconduct or harassment had received tens of millions of dollars when they left the company and a third executive had been allowed to stay, though he has since resigned.\n\nBenioff is ranked No. 259 on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index with a net worth around $5.8 billion.

Jerry Brown signed sweeping legislation aimed at fighting California wildfires which, among other things, eased the burden for the utility by allowing it to tap customers for a portion of the costs from the 2017 fires.\n\nBrown inked the legislation after PG&E reportedly spent millions lobbying state officials.\n\nCritics like Mark Toney of The Utility Reform Network blasted the bill as a bailout for PG&E.\n\n\u201cWe think that policy makers need to stand up to Wall Street blackmail and represent the interests of California customers over investor profits,\u201d he told the Mercury News in September.\n\nBut Brown defended the legislation as necessary.\n\n\"Wildfires in California aren\u2019t going away and we have to do everything possible to prevent them,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThis bill is complex and requires investment \u2014 but it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nMcCallum said PG&E has a \u201chorrible safety record\u201d and should not be rewarded by further loosening rules so they can escape from their responsibilities.\n\n\"We think we have something in place that will force them to be safer, and make decisions that will be safer for all Californians,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "nbc-news", "name": "NBC News"}, "author": "Nicole Acevedo", "title": "More Latinos own businesses but can't get capital to grow, report says - NBCNews.com", "description": "NBCNews.com More Latinos own businesses but can't get capital to grow, report says NBCNews.com Although one in four new businesses are Latino-owned and contribute more than $700 billion in sales to the U.S. economy every year, a new study has found that the b\u2026", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/more-latinos-own-businesses-can-t-get-capital-grow-report-n935966", "urlToImage": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_46/2645181/181113-sedanos-supermarket-se-626p_1ebebe0e1c0f0154fa866e34f4d85c72.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:13:42Z", "content": "Nov. 14, 2018 / 12:11 AM GMT Although one in four new businesses are Latino-owned and contribute more than $700 billion in sales to the U.S. economy every year, a new study has found that the businesses face significant barriers that keep them from increasing\u2026 [+4301 chars]", "fulltext": "By Nicole Acevedo\n\nAlthough one in four new businesses are Latino-owned and contribute more than $700 billion in sales to the U.S. economy every year, a new study has found that the businesses face significant barriers that keep them from increasing their revenues and building up wealth.\n\nAccording to a report titled Latino-Owned Businesses: Shining a Light on National Trends, three main hurdles hold back Latino business owners\u2019 economic growth: credit score problems, limited funding sources and a business knowledge gap.\n\n\u201cDigging into and understanding the causes of these issues and identifying possible paths forward is not only an imperative but an opportunity,\u201d said Jack Gutt, executive vice president of communications and outreach at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe report was researched and written by scholars and experts from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Interise, and the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI).\n\nNearly half of Latino-owned businesses were started during the past six years and many have relied on personal savings or seed funding from friends and family to start off. When seeking other sources of funding to finance their business growth, many owners either avoid taking on debt or are unable to meet the requirements to get a business loan.\n\nIn order to overcome the financial barriers, Latino business owners disproportionately rely on their credit cards and other financial methods to increase cash flow, including some that come with high interest rates but require less collateral.\n\nLatinos who take out a business loan are much more likely than non-Latino white business owners to use personal guarantees such as cash, real estate, and other assets to secure the loan. On average, Latinos have low credit scores or limited credit histories, hurting their chances of getting a business loan approved.\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, small business owners reported greater success at small banks when getting approved for a loan, line of credit or a cash advance.\n\n\u201cThis pattern appears to be even more pronounced for Latino-owned businesses, with 60 percent of applicants reporting credit success at small banks, compared to 34 percent of applicants at large banks,\u201d the report reads.\n\nJoel S\u00e1nchez, president of Premier Cleaning, a janitorial services company in Dallas and Tony Batista, president of Floors2Luv, a construction company in Houston, are part of that 60 percent.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who was interviewed for the report alongside Batista, has a line of credit that was approved by a small, local bank that helped him finance his company\u2019s payroll needs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very accessible, more personal, something that I can trust,\u201d S\u00e1nchez stated in the report. He said he has a good, working relationship with the small bank.\n\nIn Batista\u2019s case, several large banks denied his attempt to refinance the mortgage on the building where he operates his business. But he got the refinancing after developing a relationship with a small bank.\n\nThe study recommended replicating S\u00e1nchez and Batista\u2019s experience nationwide.\n\nFor the most part, Latino business owners tend to be much younger than non-Latino business owners and they are outpacing other demographic groups when it comes to starting new businesses, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThat, in turn, matters as Latinos are the fastest growing demographic in our nation and Latino-owned businesses are growing in number and importance,\u201d Gutt said. \u201cOn top of that, the Latino population is among the youngest of all demographic groups and its entrepreneurial class is equally young.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs and business owners featured in the report emphasized a need for more, stronger business networks to share each others' experiences taking advantage of available business support programs and to foster mentoring opportunities with Latinos running successful businesses in cities such as Miami, Chicago and San Diego.\n\nThe report said the networks and mentoring could help close the business knowledge gap that some owners reported in the study, while fostering a new generation of more financially knowledgeable Latino business owners.\n\nAlthough the report did not include recommendations for large banks, the authors said they plan another study on how to get large banks to lend more to Latino business owners and create partnerships for them with financial technology providers such as PayPal.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}]
