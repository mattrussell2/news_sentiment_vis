Grande has hit out at Piers Morgan with a series of tweets in defence of women who choose to show off their bodies.\n\nThe ITV presenter criticised girl band Little Mix for posing naked.\n\nHe mocked their \"feminist statement\" and accused the group of using sex to sell records.\n\nGrande, who Little Mix has supported on tour, then waded in to the spat: \"I use my talent AND my sexuality all the time because i choose to.\n\n\"Women can be sexual AND talented. naked and dignified. it's OUR choice,\" Grande tweeted.\n\nHow did the row start?\n\nPiers Morgan is known for being a provocateur on issues like this.\n\nDuring a debate about the image and Little Mix on ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, he said the girl band were using a naked photo shoot for attention and accused them of \"using sex to sell records\".\n\nThe photograph, which was used to promote their new song Strip, showed the band naked with insults written all over their bodies.\n\nImage copyright Rankin / Syco Image caption The lyrics to the song encourage fans to ignore negative comments on social media\n\nThe band told the BBC the image represents all of their flaws and \"how far they've come\" on a journey toward \"self-love\".\n\nThe lyrics of their latest song include lines like: \"Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident.\"\n\nBut Morgan made it clear he didn't buy their message of body positivity.\n\n\"Here's a great idea, girls - if you want to really empower yourselves, get naked and put the word slut all over your body,\" Morgan said on GMB, before showing a mock photo-shopped image of him posing with insults all over his body.\n\n\"Why don't we stop pretending that getting your kit off is feminist empowerment?\" he added, citing other celebrities who have posed nude including Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe row between the band and Morgan then escalated further when member Jesy Nelson told the BBC's Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1 she was not surprised by his comments before using an expletive to describe the TV host.\n\nShe then posted pictures of herself posing in underwear on her Instagram account.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The band photographed with Ariana at the 2013 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n\nThe next day, Morgan said on the programme: \"Oh Jesy, you've let yourself down, love\" before demanding a public apology from the band.\n\nHe also tweeted that the 27-year-old looked \"ridiculous\" and suggested the band had stolen the idea for the photograph from the Dixie Chicks.\n\nSo why is Ariana now involved?\n\nIn recent days, Morgan had also accused the Ellen DeGeneres show of hypocrisy for a segment where she \"celebrated\" images of handsome men, including some partially clothed.\n\nAriana Grande's mother, Joan, waded into the row by quoting Morgan's tweet about Dixie Chicks and saying: \"Didn't your mother ever teach you, if you have nothing nice to say, don't say it!\"\n\nThe presenter then replied, doubling down on his accusation that the band were using their nudity to sell records.\n\nJoan issued a scathing reply, saying: \"Trash talk for the sake of denigrating women doing their jobs is at best misogynistic and at worst undignified and ignorant!\"\n\nGrande then clapped back at Morgan with a series of tweets of her own about women's right to choose to show their bodies off.\n\nThe singer also accused him of hypocrisy while supporting the band, who have toured with her and performed at her One Love Manchester concert.\n\n\"i look forward to the day you realize there are other ways to go about making yourself relevant than to criticize young, beautiful, successful women for everything they do,\" Ariana added.\n\nShe ended the string of messages with (a slightly more explicit version) of her now-trademark phrase from her latest song: \"thank u, next\".\n\nEllen and Little Mix both shared their support.\n\nBut Piers Morgan remained defiant with tweets of his own.\n\nHe then asked if her screensaver was him posing naked, before asking her to come on his Good Morning Britain show to \"settle things\".\n\nWhile that's unlikely to happen, Morgan seemed very pleased with the outcome of the row.\n\nAs he probably intended, his name was trending worldwide on Twitter after her tweets."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null,

However, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin says such a plan could create \"many problems\".\n\nWhat time will the games kick off?\n\nFifa is yet to decide.\n\nQatar is three hours ahead of the UK, and kick-off times should be favourable for those watching on television.\n\n\"More than three billion fans across Asia and Europe will benefit from prime-time viewing during the tournament thanks to convenient kick-off times,\" Qatar's supreme committee for delivery and legacy (SC) said.\n\nHow hot will it be?\n\nHopefully a lot cooler than had it been held in the summer, when temperatures can reach 40C.\n\nThe SC says the average temperature will be 18-24C, and will be \"perfect\" for players and fans.\n\nCan fans drink?\n\n\"Alcohol is not part of Qatari culture,\" the SC told BBC Sport, and it is illegal to drink alcohol in public and be drunk in public there.\n\nAlcohol is available in hotels, and that will be the case at the World Cup. It will also be on sale in other \"designated areas\". What those areas are is yet to be decided, though organisers are planning fan parks.\n\nIt will be up to Fifa to decide if alcohol will be available in stadiums.\n\nHow easy will it be to attend?\n\nOrganisers are considering a similar scheme to the Fan ID that was used in Russia, which provided visa-free entry to the country.\n\nNationals from a total of 80 countries can already take advantage of visa-free entry.\n\nCan LGBT fans attend?\n\nThough homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, the SC said \"everyone will become welcome in 2022\" - but it is not clear how the current law will be applied.\n\nAn SC spokesperson said: \"Qatar has hosted numerous major international sporting events where every fan has felt welcome and safe. The World Cup will be no different.\"\n\nWhere are the stadiums?\n\nWith the longest distance between stadiums the 34 miles (55km) between Al Bayt Stadium-Al Khor City and Al Wakrah Stadium, organisers are considering offering packages enabling fans to attend two group-stage matches on the same day.\n\nThe shortest distance between stadiums is just three miles - from Al Rayyan Stadium to Education City Stadium.\n\nRas Abu Aboud Stadium will be the first fully demountable tournament venue in World Cup history. It will be built out of shipping containers and other modular building blocks that will be repurposed post-tournament into smaller sports and non-sports venues\n\nAre they finished?\n\nThe 40,000-seater Khalifa International Stadium, situated eight miles from Doha, has been redeveloped and is the only one open - it will host the World Athletics Championships next year.\n\nThe other seven are at various stages of construction, with the SC saying work will be completed by 2020.\n\nThe 80,000-seater Lusail Stadium will host the opening match and final\n\nWhat has been the cost?\n\nOrganisers say the total budget for the stadiums and training sites is $6.5bn (\u00a35bn).\n\nConcerns have been raised about the treatment of migrant workers building the new infrastructure, with human rights organisations condemning labour practices.\n\n\"Ever since Qatar was awarded hosting rights we've been pressing the authorities to clean up their act over the exploitation of migrant workers,\" said Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International's head of policy and government affairs.\n\n\"Promised reforms have been slow in coming and we remain concerned that 2022 will arrive and Qatar's hundreds of thousands of foreign workers will still be facing exploitation and poor working and living conditions.\"\n\nAmnesty International said in September that dozens of migrants working on the city that will host the final had gone unpaid for months.\n\nA spokesman for the Qatari government said the contractors involved, Mercury MENA, were not directly involved in the building of the stadium but in the building of the city.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino said the World Cup will \"leave a great legacy\".\n\n\"On the social side, it has had a very important social impact in the whole region,\" he added.\n\n\"When you think about all the debates on human rights and workers' welfare... without the World Cup, these debates would not have happened and the improvements which happened would not have happened either.\"\n\nThe tournament organisers said: \"The health and wellbeing of our workers is our top priority. There are currently more than 30,000 workers on our sites.\n\n\"The SC's worker welfare standards cover ethical recruitment, accommodation and working conditions. Regular audits support compliance, while contractors in breach of the standards are subject to enforcement measures, including contract termination and blacklisting.\"\n\nHow good are the hosts at football?\n\nThis will be a first World Cup appearance for the team currently ranked 96th in the world.\n\nThey recently beat Switzerland - the world's eighth best side - 1-0 and drew 2-2 with Iceland, as well as beating Ecuador 4-3.\n\nSpanish World Cup winner Xavi and Dutch legend Wesley Sneijder are playing in Qatar's top division.\n\n\"There were many fears about Russia, but it turned out to be a very safe World Cup, a very welcoming World Cup, in a country that made fans feel good,\" said Infantino.\n\n\"The whole population contributed to that and I'm sure the same will happen here in Qatar. The Russian World Cup was the best ever, and the World Cup in 2022 has to be even better.\"\n\nCan England win it?\n\nSpeaking in 2013, then Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said they should aim to.\n\nAnd, after their semi-final appearance in Russia this year, the vibe around the national-team set-up is certainly positive.\n\nThey have qualified for next year's Nations League finals, beating Spain and World Cup finalists Croatia along the way.\n\nBut only time will tell whether they can end 56 years of hurt in Qatar."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Los Angeles 'dine-and-dash' dater sentenced", "description": "Paul Gonzales gets 120 days in jail for unpaid restaurant bills and is barred from using dating apps.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46297540", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BA90/production/_103206774_paul-gonzales.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:10:23Z", "content": "Image copyright CBS Image caption Paul Gonzales pleaded no contest to defrauding and petty theft charges A US man nicknamed the \"dine-and-dash\" dater for asking women out to restaurants and leaving bills unpaid has been sentenced to 120 days in jail.

My mum calls me this. She was young when she had me so I was a friend, a confidant, someone she can rely on. Still now she calls me that because things will never change.\n\n\"What I remember is a young kid always with his mum and dad. My mum was 16 when she had me and my dad was working at the bank. My uncle was living in Europe and coming back and forth. I was curious to see what was happening on the other side of the world, he was always bringing sweets or footballs or shirts.\n\n\"The idea of leaving Ivory Coast when I was six came when my uncle and his wife came to Ivory Coast and she was playing with me and I got close to her. My dad wanted me to go to France to have a better chance to study, a better chance than he had.\n\n\"I was excited to leave Ivory Coast and go to France until I got to the airport. My mum was in tears, I could see sadness in her face. I realised this six-year-old would leave his mum and dad to go to a place he doesn't even know. As a kid I was sad too, everything changed.\"\n\n'Why are you playing at right-back?' - start of a career\n\n\"I was 11 when I started playing with a team for the first time in the north of France in Dunkirk.\n\n\"I started as a right-back. I was going up and down, scoring goals from set-pieces, coming inside and shooting. My uncle said 'why are you playing as a right-back? As a family we only have strikers'.\n\n\"When I moved to another city I introduced myself as a striker. Luckily enough I scored 40 goals that season and that's where everything started.\n\n\"Before joining Le Mans in 1998 I was writing letters to first division teams for a trial and I would never get a positive answer but I never gave up. When I had the chance to go to Le Mans I jumped on it.\n\n\"Moving to Marseille was part of my dream - I used to say to my friends when I was at Le Mans 'you will see one day I will play with this team'. In 2003 I moved to Marseille so my dream became a reality. It was the best dream I ever had in my life.\"\n\n'He changed my life' - finding Jose\n\nIn 2004, Drogba was signed by Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho for \u00a324m.\n\n\"When someone gives you the chance to buy one of the best players in the world and he says 'no, this is the guy I want' it makes you feel special. I always tried to give it back to him.\n\n\"He changed my life, he changed the story of my family. He told me if you want to be the best you have to come and play with one of the best teams in the world and one of the best managers in the world\u2026 no, the best manager in the world. Everyone was saying \u00a324m was a lot of money. People doubted. When I left I think the way everyone reacted, I think I covered the investment.\n\nFrom hospital to Champions League hero\n\nIn August 2011, Drogba was knocked unconscious in a game against Norwich and taken to hospital. Nine months later he would score the decisive penalty to secure Chelsea's first ever Champions League title.\n\n\"If it was a movie, I don't know if you could have written the scenario better. The last Chelsea game for me, last chance to play in the Champions League final.\n\n\"The season was not going so well for me, I had quite a few injuries and months before that I was at the hospital. To have the chance to be in the most important day of this club after this big incident that really scared me, that was the best moment as a player with a Chelsea shirt.\"\n\n'I would imagine fans celebrating' - coping in the big moments\n\n\"When I was in big games I was always reminding myself that when I was outside my parents' house, putting the ball on the ground and thinking about scoring a penalty in the last minute of a game - I was in a world where I would imagine fans celebrating. These dreams were so powerful that when I had a chance to realise them, I knew being in a final was a lucky part of my career.\"\n\nBringing peace to a nation\n\nMoments after helping the Ivory Coast secure World Cup qualification in 2005, Drogba sent an impassioned message for peace to his civil war-torn nation. Within a week there was a ceasefire.\n\n\"Before being a footballer, I'm a human being, I'm a man. I have a life to lead, I want to live in a peaceful country. My country was at war and tensions were there. I care for my country and I did what I had to do for my country. The country is divided and the only thing that unites us is football.\n\n\"When I decided to play for Ivory Coast I didn't know I would one day captain the team and lead them to three World Cups tournaments. I never imagined that, that I would play such an important role in the country's history. I had the opportunity to play for France, but what I achieved with Ivory Coast - and as a man - I don't think I could have done that for France.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "InSight: Nasa's Mars mission on target for landing", "description": "The American space agency says its InSight Mars lander is on a near-perfect Thanksgiving trajectory.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46298259", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3D43/production/_104438651_1200px-phoenix_landing.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:27:01Z", "content": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It takes 6.5 minutes to go from the top of the atmosphere to the surface The American space agency Nasa says its InSight Mars lander is on a near-perfect Thanksgiving trajectory.

If it can do that - and everything at present suggests it will - then it ought to come down right on top of a very flat landscape known as Elysium Planitia.\n\nThe task of atmospheric entry, descent and landing (EDL) is far from straightforward, however. Mission statistics show Mars to be unforgiving to the ill-prepared. Two-thirds of all landing attempts have failed.\n\nThe reason is simple: A probe will enter the atmosphere at six times the speed of a high-velocity bullet and then somehow have to slow to a controlled stop at the surface - all inside seven minutes. An EDL strategy has to be perfect.\n\nThe most recent effort in 2016 - from Europe - got it hopelessly wrong and slammed into the ground.\n\nThe Americans, though, have a pretty good record, and InSight will use the proven combination of a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to make its drop to Mars.\n\nJulie Wertz-Chen is part of the InSight EDL team: \"We've done everything we can to try and be successful but it's a really, really difficult thing to do, to land on another planet. We never want to go into it saying 'Oh yeah, no problem, this will work easily!', because you just never know what Mars will throw at you.\"\n\nInSight aims to be the first mission to take a detailed look inside the Red Planet. It will use British and French seismometers to listen for earthquakes, or rather \"Marsquakes\".\n\nThese vibrations will help trace the interior rock layers - from the crust to the core.\n\n\"An earthquake is almost like a little flashbulb,\" explains InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt. \"It illuminates the inside of the planet with seismic waves, and the seismometer is like a camera that picks up those waves and helps put together a picture. Pixel by pixel we get to put together a 3D picture of the inside of a planet.\"\n\nScientists know very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Pembrokeshire treasure hunter unearths Celtic chariot", "description": "The ritual burial could be linked to a huge previously undiscovered Iron Age settlement.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46294000", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16D85/production/_104437539_chariotwheels.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:16:01Z", "content": "Image copyright Mike Smith Image caption Preliminary excavations revealed the tops of a pair of Celtic chariot wheels A metal detectorist has found what is thought to be the first Celtic chariot burial to be uncovered in Wales.

On our arrival it rained on and off for three days, which resulted in a lot of wet people, as understandably no-one packed anything remotely waterproof!\n\nIt unfortunately meant our first game against Sri Lanka was a washout and the outfield at the Darren Sammy Stadium was the wettest I've seen in my career. It was a little bit frustrating, as we were obviously desperate to get our tournament going, but there was nothing we could do.\n\nAnya Shrubsole and Linsey Smith were the only cricketers to get some action, with a bit of 'Water Cricket' down by the pavilion. To top it all off I had to sprint across the field to the press box (barefoot!) to talk about the rain and then my umbrella was nicked. Not a good day.\n\nWe were lucky, in the end, that we only lost one game to the weather. Hats off to the groundsman and his team in St Lucia, they deserve a lot of credit.\n\nOur preparation and training following the rain was obviously affected too, but where there's a will there's a way! The coaches had to be quite inventive and we even ended up hitting balls in the concrete under the stadium.\n\nTammy Beaumont was among those to take part in a net session under the stands\n\nThe action\n\nWhen we got going it all came thick and fast. Firstly we had Bangladesh and we had the rare moment of giving out three debut caps in one game. We have a new tradition where we have this very lovely embroidered cap that debutants hold on to and then pass on to the next debutant.\n\nThe alphabet means that poor Sophia Dunkley had it for about two seconds before passing it to Kirstie Gordon, who then had it for a similar time. It's safely in Linsey Smith's keeping now.\n\nWe got past Bangladesh - with Kirstie very impressive on debut - before our big game against South Africa. The rained-off opener meant we had a pretty much do-or-die game straight away, but that's tournament cricket for you, and the girls' response and performance was outstanding.\n\nIt went our way and again our bowlers were brilliant. I was really pleased for Nat Sciver especially as she has put in some hard yards changing her action slightly in the lead-up to the competition.\n\nWe also had the rare beast of an Anya Shrubsole smile, but only after taking her hat-trick wicket (her non-reaction to the first two wickets was classic Anya). Anya's not one to crave the limelight, but what a finish to the South Africa innings!\n\nThe Windies game didn't go our way but it was a phenomenal game to play in as the sell-out crowd made it a brilliant atmosphere and a great occasion.\n\nThey outsang our family and friends for the first time this tour and certainly let us know we were in a game. It's great for West Indian cricket and it's great for the women's game - let's hope for similar crowds in Antigua.\n\nIt was a great learning experience for us, and although we didn't play our best cricket, I was incredibly proud of how we stuck in the game and fought to take it to the end. Hopefully that will stand us in good stead for the semi-final to come.\n\nShrubsole's hat-trick was only the second by an England player in a T20 international\n\nBad shirts and family barbecues\n\nOur supporters out here have been absolutely out of this world, and we owe them so many thanks. There are about 40-50 loved ones who have made the trip, and hearing their noise during the games has really pushed the team on. Their dancing in the carnival atmosphere of the games has also been a constant source of amusement!\n\nWe had a lovely evening to thank the friends and family for their support, everyone came together for a beach barbecue and our social committee of Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Winfield and Amy Jones gave a nice little speech to thank everyone.\n\nAnother fun bit of on-tour social activity was Bad Shirt Night. I picked up a nice little number from a charity shop in Bristol and I'm proud - I think - to say I came fourth. As in, my shirt was the fourth worst.\n\nIt's a weird prize but I'll take it. I had to catwalk around the restaurant with the night's other winners.\n\nA big surprise - and a proposal!\n\nAlthough I mention family, I was actually one of the tour 'orphans'. The 'orphans' are those who - for that particular tour - don't have any friends or family supporting. At least, I thought I was\u2026\n\nAfter the Sri Lanka game I was speaking to the press and Sophie Ecclestone came up to me on the pitch with a grin that meant she obviously had some info.\n\nShe made me come over to the fans and there - much to my surprise - were two of my best friends, Emily and James. It turns out they'd come out to surprise me, which I can't believe because Emily is normally not the best at keeping a secret. It was so nice to see them.\n\nThe surprises kept coming because a few days later it emerged that James took Emily up the Piton mountains and asked her to marry him. She said yes and I'm so happy for them. They even ended up being interviewed on the big screen during the South Africa game.\n\nThis is the same Emily who dressed in my full England playing kit at the World Cup final at Lord's last year and was signing autographs pretending to be me in a pub after the match. She and a few other friends also ended up on the back pages, so I think she's enjoying the attention!\n\nNat Sciver's family are among the loved ones in the West Indies - and Sciver took three wickets for four runs against South Africa\n\nOn to Antigua for the semis\n\nSo here we are in Antigua. One game away - hopefully - from the World Twenty20 final. It's going to be tough, India are a massively dangerous side and they're arguably the most in-form team in the tournament.\n\nThey have played some good cricket, but we can't focus too much on them. We have to believe in ourselves and get ready to go into a battle.\n\nI know it's going to be a tough game but we've got good players, we've got self-belief, and we've got history of winning big knockout games. We'll be doing our best to make it to the final.\n\nWe're one step nearer to that massive carrot of being double world champions but we've still got an awfully long way to go. We'll keep fighting every step of the way."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "At Thanksgiving, discordant Trump heads squabbling American family - BBC News", "description": "BBC News At Thanksgiving, discordant Trump heads squabbling American family BBC News The Thanksgiving holidays will provide little respite from rhetoric in a highly polarised US.

Given the prevailing mood of acrimony, however, and Donald Trump's role in stoking it, it came as no surprise.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A deadly white nationalist rally shocked the nation a year ago in the small city of Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nEven acts of sacred remembrance, such as the recent trip to France to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One, become needlessly controversial. Prior to Mr Trump heeding the advice of the Secret Service not to travel by motorcade to an American war cemetery when Marine One was grounded by bad weather, a decision seized upon by critics as a dereliction of presidential duty, the trip had already taken an ugly turn.\n\nHe arrived in France saying he planned to \"celebrate\" the end of World War One, a discordant choice of word. The moment Air Force One touched down in Paris, he also picked a fight with his host, the French president Emmanuel Macron. If ever there was a moment to observe a diplomatic ceasefire, surely it was the anniversary of the Armistice.\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nLong before Donald Trump arrived in Washington, the esteemed American political scientist James Q Wilson shrewdly observed: \"Once politics was about only a few things. Today, it is about nearly everything.\"\n\nThat dictum seems especially pertinent now. Politics comes to the war cemeteries of France, to American football stadiums on a Sunday afternoon, to the charred cul-de-sacs of Paradise, California, to the National Cathedral in Washington.\n\nWhen political leaders from both sides gathered there to remember the late Republican Senator John McCain, President Trump was deliberately excluded. John McCain decided before his death that a bipartisan coming together was possible only in the enforced absence of America's head of state, a view widely shared amongst those who packed the pews.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption McCain widow - I'll never get over Trump slur\n\nDivision, of course, is nothing new. From the country's fractious founding through to the modern-day, this great American experiment has always been explosively combustible. Just visit the Civil War battlefields of Gettysburg, Antietam or Manassas; or the trouble-spots of the civil rights and Vietnam era, such as Birmingham, Selma, and the campuses of \"Ole Miss\" or Kent State University. The past forty years, if anything, have been relatively peaceable if measured in urban violence, political assassinations or '60s-style mass demonstrations.\n\nBut what makes this era so unsettling is the ingrained polarity of the politics.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, when policy makers in Washington feared the country might be overwhelmed by the racial fury breaking loose in almost every major city, progressive Democrats and moderate Republicans joined forces to defeat segregationist Democrats and unsympathetic Republicans. The 1964 Civil Rights Act, which sounded the death knell for southern segregation, would never have been enacted were it not for bipartisanship.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption An incomplete history of protest\n\nLikewise during Watergate, Democrats and Republicans buried their differences to serve the national interest and to avert a full-blown constitutional crisis. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee joined Democrats in voting to subpoena those incriminating White House tapes. Moderate Republicans helped draft articles of impeachment - though Richard Nixon resigned, of course, before they were put to a full vote of the House of Representatives. The poser of the famed question, \"What did the president know and when did he know it?\" was not some liberal firebrand but rather Senator Howard Baker, a Republican from Tennessee.\n\nGone, it seems, is an era when moments of national mourning and commemoration, such as the Challenger space shuttle disaster or the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landings, were politically benign; when a US president could speak on behalf of all of his compatriots, as Ronald Reagan did so memorably on both occasions. But it is also important to point out that the politicisation of national tragedies and convulsions by no means started with Donald Trump.\n\nImage copyright Historical Image caption President Ronald Reagan at the memorial service for the crew of the Challenger space shuttle\n\nAlong with the soothing words uttered by Bill Clinton in response to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, when 168 people were murdered in a domestic terrorist truck bombing, came an attack on unnamed right-wing figures whom he accused of recklessly stoking anti-government sentiment - the \"loud and angry voices in America today,\" as he put it, \"whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible.\" It was a valid point to make, but also a highly political one at a time of national grieving. For a president then struggling for relevancy in the aftermath of the Republican Revolution in 1994, Clinton saw in the rubble of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building a partisan opportunity. The bombing marked the turning point of his troubled first term, and the start of a comeback that culminated two years later in his re-election.\n\nThe attacks of September 11th offer another case study. The national unity and patriotic bipartisanship - crystallised on the floor of a joint session of Congress when then-Democratic Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle hugged George W Bush - proved short-lived. In the run-up to the Iraq war, the White House pushed through a war authorisation vote ahead of the 2002 congressional mid-terms, seeking to tag Democrats who opposed it as soft on terrorism. President George Herbert Walker Bush, by contrast, had waited until after the 1990 mid-terms to seek congressional approval for the first Gulf War, a deliberate act of depoliticisation.\n\nImage copyright Douglas Graham Image caption Then-President Bush embracing Democratic Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle in the wake of 9/11\n\nWhat marks out Donald Trump is the speed and apparent relish with which he douses these moments of crisis and mourning with politics. Divisiveness is his default setting, conflict defines his presidency, and though he often pays lip service to national unity in scripted comments and formal statements, his authentic self usually finds quick expression on Twitter. His talent lies in being a partisan attack dog rather than a national consoler.\n\nThis month's midterm congressional elections, at which a divided nation produced a divided result, highlighted America's disunity. They reinforced a historic realignment where Democratic strength is now concentrated in the cities and their suburbs, and Donald Trump's America lies beyond.\n\nThe political map, rendered in deeper shades of red and blue, looks more partitionist. Almost the entire western seaboard and most of the northeast coastline is now Democratic. On a road trip hugging the Pacific Ocean, you could travel from the southernmost tip of California to the northern-most tip of Washington state and step foot in only one congressional district represented by a Republican. New York City no longer has a single Republican congressman or congresswoman.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Where does America go from here?\n\nConversely, the landlocked states of America look like a giant red sea, save for a few isolated blue archipelagos.\n\nThough it is an exaggeration to speak of political no-go areas for the Republicans and Democrats, large swathes of the United States resemble one-party fiefdoms. Texas hasn't elected a Democratic Senator since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988. That was also the year California last voted in a Republican Senator. It should come as no surprise that the new Congress convening in January will be the most ideologically polarised in decades.\n\nDonald Trump is not the cause of this disunity. His victory in 2016 was the culmination of a politics that has continually become more wilfully and aggressively partisan. Both Democrats and Republicans have accelerated this trend. His presidency, however, has widened and deepened the breach. His political business model, after all, has long been based aggravating points of cultural, economic and racial contention, whether on birtherism or immigration. At his rallies, he often looks and sounds more like the leader of a cult than the leader of a nation.\n\nAs he told rally-goers in West Virginia ahead of the mid-terms, in one of those inadvertently insightful sound-bites he delivers from time to time: \"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having ten thousand people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Can Obama or Trump supporters say one nice thing about opponents?\n\nThe problem for Trump is not the ongoing adulation of rally-goers. Even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, as he once famously boasted, some would probably not cast off their Make America Great Again caps. It is the wider audience outside. Though his blue-collar base remains solid, and his strength in rural states helped the Republicans retain control of the Senate, the mid-terms became a revolt of white-collar suburban voters. This was especially true of college-educated women, whose unexpectedly high support for him in 2016, even in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood comments, helped him beat Hillary Clinton. For all the polarity, moderates and registered independents can still sway presidential elections.\n\nThe mid-terms suggested that the America turned off by Donald Trump is more heavily populated than the America happy with his performance as president. Even in the Senate, where Trump interpreted the results as validation of his leadership, preliminary vote tallies suggest some 45 million Americans cast their votes for Democratic Senate candidate, as opposed to 39.3 million for Republican candidates.\n\nPresidents commonly rebound after mid-term setbacks, as Barack Obama did in 2012 and Bill Clinton did in 1996. Trump's three predecessors were all two-term presidents. The Electoral College means he could lose the popular vote by a heavy margin, as he did in 2016, and still win the White House. Also it would be an act of analytical folly to write him off, a repeat of the colossal mistake so many pundits made in 2016.\n\nHowever, as the respected political statistician Nate Silver noted earlier this week: \"His base alone will not be enough to win a second term.\"\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump benefited from the politics of division. But this avowed nationalist has struggled to be a truly national leader. The polarisation which fuelled his rise also has the potential to bring about his fall."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Great Britain's women beat Portugal to qualify for EuroBasket finals", "description": "Great Britain women thrash Portugal 83-42 in Manchester to qualify for next year's EuroBasket finals.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/basketball/46297494", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/0A7B/production/_104438620_rachaelvanderwal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:45:18Z", "content": "Rachael Vanderwal led GB's scoring with 21 Great Britain's women qualified for next year's EuroBasket finals with an 83-42 win over Portugal in Manchester.

A bump in the road perhaps, but a useful lesson from seasoned opposition.\n\nA goalless draw against Mexico in May offered encouragement that Wales could cope without some of their leading players, as Giggs gave debuts to Matt Smith and George Thomas as well as a first start for Chris Mepham.\n\nThen came Giggs' first competitive match, a spectacular 4-1 thrashing of the Republic of Ireland in their Nations League opener in September which showcased burgeoning young talents such as Ethan Ampadu and David Brooks.\n\nIf that caused some to get a little too excited, they were served a dose of reality four days later as Wales were beaten 2-0 in Denmark, paying the price for lapses in concentration which allowed the Danes' star player Christian Eriksen to control the game and score both goals.\n\nThere was a creeping sense that Giggs may have been neglecting Wales' defensive solidity in his pursuit of attractive, attacking football, and those concerns worsened the following month.\n\nA friendly fixture with Spain was moved to the Principality Stadium and, although the former world champions were expected to win, they benefitted from feeble Welsh defending to hammer Giggs' side 4-1.\n\nGiggs was happy enough to brush that defeat aside - albeit with concerns about some of Wales' defending - as he insisted the important match in October was the Nations League encounter with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.\n\nIt was nothing like the exhibition football of the reverse fixture but Wales' young players - led superbly by their experienced captain Ashley Williams - showed resolve to grind out a 1-0 win.\n\nSeven games in: some signs of promise, some worrying trends. A mixed bag.\n\nWales were beaten twice by Denmark in the Nations League\n\nWales' Nations Leagues hopes came down to their group decider against Denmark on Friday and, despite creating several chances, Giggs' side seemed na\u00efve at times as they were clinically dispatched by a more organised and well-rounded Danish side.\n\nIt appeared Giggs and his players had not learned the lessons of September's defeat in Aarhus as, once again, Eriksen and his midfield colleagues were given too much time and space, while Wales' congested attack lacked balance and purpose.\n\nTuesday's friendly in Albania was an opportunity for Giggs to experiment, making eight changes from the Denmark game and handing debuts to four players from the start and from the bench.\n\nBut despite some more promising build-up play, Wales failed to turn their early dominance into goals and became increasingly disjointed as they lost to an Albanian side ranked 60th in the world and thrashed 4-0 at home by Scotland just three days earlier.\n\nGiggs was furious, describing his players as \"complacent\" as he said they \"let themselves down\".\n\nBut was the manager culpable too? Did he not learn from his previous eight matches? And could he have done more to guard against his players' alleged complacency?\n\nGiggs recognises that he himself is a work in progress, a 44-year-old manager in his first permanent role learning on the job.\n\nHe also admits the defeat in Albania cast a shadow over his own assessment of his first year in charge.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Ryan Giggs: 'We got what we deserved' in Albania defeat, says Wales boss\n\n\"Without a shadow of a doubt,\" he said.\n\n\"You look at the teams we've been beaten by before - Uruguay, Spain, Denmark twice - that can happen. But [against Albania] we should have won that game.\n\n\"We were in total control and it's nothing to do with hard work or the ability of the players. Quite simply, it was concentration and complacency.\n\n\"We just turned up thinking we would win, someone would score the goal, someone would get us out of trouble.\"\n\nGiggs in numbers\n\n26.7 - Average age of side at the end of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers\n\n25.7 - Average age of side that played Denmark in the Nations League\n\n16 - Number of debuts since 2018 World Cup qualifiers\n\n0 - Number of players who have started all of Giggs' games\n\n36 - Number of players used\n\n4.7 - Shots on target per game under Giggs\n\n4.5 - Shots conceded per game under Giggs\n\n1.44 - Goals per game scored under Giggs\n\n1.06 - Goals per game scored under Coleman\n\n1.22 - Goals per game conceded under Giggs\n\n1.1 - Goals per game conceded under Coleman\n\n4 - Failed to score\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nBBC Wales Football Correspondent Rob Phillips\n\nIt's been a mixed experience watching Wales under Ryan Giggs.\n\nHis intentions have been crystal clear - to overhaul the squad by fast tracking young talent, something at times exhilarating, but also frustratingly inconsistent. Such is the privilege of youth.\n\nYet the high point of the 4-1 Nations League victory over the Republic of Ireland has been equalled by the demoralising 1-0 friendly defeat at the hands of Albania.\n\nWales are creating more chances these days. Giggs' approach is unashamedly adventurous, but has also veered into the na\u00efve, too. Certainly Wales' players need to be more streetwise than they have been.\n\nIt's a fast learning curve for the players and manager. He is an inexperienced manager with beliefs firmly engrained. The Wales team is a work in progress.\n\nSome doubting fans have used his mixed fortunes to berate him - though sometimes one wonders whether this is also for his perceived lack of commitment to Wales as a player.\n\nThe Nations League went according to the seedings. The acid test will be the Euro 2020 qualifiers where a top two spot will be expected.\n\nBe sure, Giggs' preparations will not relent during his winter break.\n\nFormer Wales striker Iwan Roberts\n\nWe scored ten goals in the two games against China and the Republic of Ireland - in the other seven we've scored three. That's not good enough.\n\nWe've got to work a lot harder on the attacking side of things. A few more combinations. At the minute we give the ball to David Brooks or Gareth Bale and expect them to beat five players, Harry Wilson the same. It's not always going to work.\n\nBut we do have a talented group of young players coming through and it will come.\n\nRyan won't be judged on an away defeat in Albania, he'll be judged on qualification.\n\nFormer Wales captain Kevin Ratcliffe\n\nThere's a lot of anti-feeling against him, but I think it's very unfair. You've got to give him time. He's learning his trade along with the youngsters. You'll have ups and downs.\n\nI think we're going to have to be pay patient and find a formula to suit. It's all about getting the balance. He's finding out about that and hopefully he finds it quickly.\n\nFormer Wales midfielder David Edwards\n\nThey've played some good sides over the year but if Wales want to be getting to major tournaments, and then going competing, these are type of sides they need to beat, especially the likes of Denmark.\n\nBecause he has been experimental with the players he's brought in, trying to blood young lads, perhaps Ryan has sacrificed results a little bit. You just hope that they have enough experience now to make the next campaign a success.\n\nWales' record goal scorer Helen Ward\n\nIt's been a tough year. Yes, they've played the likes of Spain, Denmark, teams doing well in world football, but if Wales are going to take themselves to the next level - as they did in the Euros - they have to start competing in those games and I don't feel they have this season.\n\nIt's been a learning curve for Ryan Giggs, he's tried new things out, but it's going to be important to start next year on much more positive note.\n\nOn to the Euros\n\nEuro 2020 qualifying draw - how does it work?\n\nGiggs' real test will come with the start of the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign in March.\n\nThe levels of hope and expectation will depend much upon the outcome of the draw on December 2 in Dublin where Wales find themselves among the second seeds.\n\nGiven that third seeds Serbia topped Wales' World Cup qualifiers and Wales made it to Euro 2016 as fourth seeds, perhaps not too much can be read into it all.\n\nNevertheless, the campaign is a congested one - a potential ten games squeezed into eight months between March and November 2019 - which means little room for error if Wales are to return to a major finals.\n\nThe top two from the ten groups (five groups of five teams, and five of six) are guaranteed a place in the cross-continent tournament in 2020.\n\nAfter a gentle introduction for Ryan Giggs , the real rough and tumble of management is fast approaching."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "B\u00e9ziers train poster: French court clears controversial ad", "description": "A court clears a controversial poster which critics argued encouraged violence against women.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46293151", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C06E/production/_104426294_gettyimages-890339620.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:53:53Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The ad was posted months after the real-life murder of a woman in similar circumstances A French court has ruled that posters showing a woman tied to train tracks did not promote violence against women.

Tumour cells consume even more.\n\nThe team, led by Prof Kevin Ryan of Glasgow University, fed mice with tumours another sugar called mannose.\n\nMannose occurs naturally in many fruits. It is also made in some cells in our bodies.\n\nIts molecular structure is very nearly identical to that of glucose but the tiny difference seems to hold a crucial key.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe mice had different types of tumours. Some were given mannose three times a week through a feeding tube. Others got it continuously in their drinking water.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature, Prof Ryan's team report the mice showed no obvious side effects from the mannose. More importantly, the sugar appeared to reduce significantly the growth of some kinds of tumours.\n\nThe process was repeated, this time with the widely-used chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin to see if mannose increased their effectiveness. In some cases, tumour growth appeared to slow and the lifespans of some mice actually increased.\n\nFewer tumours\n\nThe reason? The tumours, hungry for glucose, were being starved. Mannose seems to get in the way.\n\nThe experiments suggest that mannose does not so much block glucose getting to the cancer cells but rather affect how those cells try to use the glucose.\n\nA key sign that it is working is the presence of an enzyme called phosphomannose isomerase (PMI). Mannose is linked to lower levels of PMI in cancer cells.\n\nThe Beatson Institute researchers tested this aspect on human cancer cells in the lab.\n\nOvarian, kidney, breast, prostate and bowel cancer cells were among those tested.

from forced marriage did not cover the required ground.\n\nMr Hamilton mentioned Joan Blass, a 91-year-old with vascular dementia who married a man 24 years younger than her a year before her death.\n\nParliament heard Mrs Blass met Colman Folan in 2011, the same year she was diagnosed with dementia, and it was said he moved into her home within a month of them meeting.\n\nMr Hamilton said

her family knowing she had remarried, parliament heard\n\nThe Commons heard Mrs Blass' daughter Daphne Franks, from Gledhow in Leeds, told Mr Hamilton \"no family member or friend had been told about

Hamilton said.\n\n\"Colman now had complete control over Joan's estate, in spite of the fact that Daphne previously had Power of Attorney on behalf of her mother during her lifetime.\"\n\nIn a statement given to BBC Radio 4 on behalf of Mr Folan in March, his relationship with Mrs Blass was described as \"long, loving and caring\".\n\nIt read: \"I was not made aware by Mrs Franks, her family or Mrs Blass' GP of any concerns they had about her capacity or a diagnosis of dementia.\n\n\"The registrars who performed the marriage ceremony believed Mrs Blass had capacity to enter into marriage.\"\n\nIt added: \"Mrs Blass wanted to marry me and I believed at the time, and still do, that she has capacity to make that decision for herself.\"\n\nProposed changes\n\nMarriage should no longer revoke a previous will in every case\n\nBetter training for registrars to ensure robust procedures for safeguarding apparently vulnerable individuals are put in place\n\nThe 'capacity to marry' should be established via a simple questionnaire, with an option of a medical assessment also available\n\nNotices of intention of a marriage should be published on the internet\n\nConcluding the Ten Minute Rule Bill, Mr Hamilton said: \"It is not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in a marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given.\n\n\"Much of the anecdotal evidence suggests that Joan had no idea she had ever been married to Folan and that there was clear evidence her mental capacity was severely reduced in the last years of her life.\"\n\nHe believed the case \"has profound implications for many hundreds of other families who may find themselves in a similar situation across the country\".\n\nThe BBC has

Following Wednesday's amendment they will be able to return to work.\n\nChief justice Malgorzata Gersdorf, who was 65, refused to stand down, arguing Poland's constitution guaranteed her the right to serve a six-year term. She branded the reforms a \"purge\".\n\nNot that much of a defeat\n\nAnalysis by Adam Easton, BBC News, Warsaw\n\nThe government says it wants to resolve the protracted dispute with the European Commission over the substantial changes it has made to Poland's courts over the past three years. It is a victory for the Supreme Court chief justice, Professor Malgorzata Gersdorf, her retired colleagues and the European Commission.\n\nBut it's not much of a defeat for the governing Law and Justice camp's judicial reforms. It has already managed the appointment of the majority of judges to the Constitutional Tribunal, which has the power to veto legislation. The justice minister, who also serves as the prosecutor general, now has the power to appoint and dismiss the deputies and heads of ordinary courts. And the governing camp also now controls the National Council of the Judiciary (NCJ), the body that nominates all judges in Poland.\n\nPlus, by reinstating the Supreme Court judges, the government will avoid the possibility of having to pay hefty daily fines for non-compliance with last month's ECJ ruling. In a few years time, those reinstated judges will retire. In the meantime, dozens of new judges for two new Supreme Court chambers created by Law and Justice will need to be appointed and they will be nominated by the newly politicised NCJ.\n\nWhat did the EU say?\n\nThe European Commission - the EU's executive arm - argued that the reforms undermined the rule of law because they gave the governing party political control of the judiciary.\n\nIt referred the matter to the Luxembourg-based ECJ which in October ordered Poland to \"immediately suspend\" the application of its law.\n\nThe court ordered Poland to reinstate the judges who had been forced to retire.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Malgorzata Gersdorf, head of Poland's Supreme Court, refused to step down\n\nThe ECJ said its decision was an interim measure in response to the commission's request and a final ruling would be issued at a later date.\n\nAt the time, the head of the PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said the government would comply with the decision.\n\n\"We are members of the European Union and we will abide by European Union law,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Devin Lima: Singer with US boy band LFO dies at 41", "description": "Devin Lima was one third of the pop group, who had hits with Summer Girls and Girl on TV.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46291744", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F0B7/production/_104432616_gettyimages-156100579.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:06:22Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption LFO in 1999 (L to R): Rich Cronin, Devin Lima and Brad Fischetti Devin Lima of US pop trio LFO, who had chart success at the turn of the millennium, has died at the age of 41, according to multiple reports.

Instead, their reasoning challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal.\n\n\"For example, under the ICO's theory people should not be allowed to forward an email or message without having agreement from each person on the original thread.\n\n\"These are things done by millions of people every day on services across the internet, which is why we believe the ICO's decision raises important questions of principle for everyone online which should be considered by an impartial court based on all the relevant evidence.\"\n\nAn independent body, known as a General Regulatory Chamber tribunal, will consider the challenge.\n\nIf it is unhappy with the decision, Facebook can subsequently take the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\n\"Any organisation issued with a monetary penalty notice by the Information Commissioner has the right to appeal the decision to the First-tier Tribunal,\" said a spokesman for the ICO.\n\n\"The progression of any appeal is a matter for the tribunal. We have not yet been notified by the tribunal that an appeal has been received.\"\n\nThe appeal risks dragging out an affair that has undermined the public and politicians' trust in Facebook.\n\nHowever, the BBC understands that the US firm was concerned that the ICO's ruling would form the basis for decisions taken by other regulators, which could prove more damaging still.\n\nThe ICO has itself noted that the \u00a3500,000 fine would be \"significantly higher\" had the EU's General Data Protection Regulation been in force earlier.\n\nThe move has not, however, changed chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's mind about rejecting an invitation to be cross-examined by MPs.\n\nAnalysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/BBC Image caption The stakes are high for both Facebook's chief and the UK's Information Commissioner\n\nFacebook's decision to appeal against this fine is a move that Sir Humphrey, the civil servant in Yes Minister, would describe as \"brave\".\n\nAt a time when the social media firm is under fire and accused of using dodgy tactics to combat its critics, picking a fight with the UK regulator over an issue which was beginning to fade into the background seems reckless.\n\nAfter all, the social media giant admits that it got a whole lot of things wrong in the Cambridge Analytica affair, in particular allowing the data of friends of people who took part in a personality quiz to be scraped.\n\nBut Facebook feels that the Information Commissioner's Office moved the goalposts halfway through its investigation, deciding that one million UK users had suffered harm and then finding that the researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan did not pass their data on to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nSome data protection experts think the company has a point.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and his company appear determined to fight back against what they see as a flawed process but the appeal is a gamble.\n\nThe stakes are also high for the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. She made the unusual decision to go public with her intention to impose a fine before receiving representations from the company.\n\nIf Facebook's appeal succeeds, her authority as a regulator will be seriously undermined."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "NHS apology over miscarriage case 'distress' in Elgin", "description": "A health board is told to change its procedures following its treatment of a woman who had a miscarriage.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-46293557", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FBCE/production/_104426446_drgrays.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:23:53Z", "content": "NHS Grampian has been ordered to change its procedures and apologise for its treatment of a woman who had suffered a miscarriage.

It wouldn't, said Mrs May.\n\nThe pair repeated their attack lines before Mrs May brought their clash to an end with a declaration that \"the public gave us an instruction to leave the European Union\".\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nMrs May rejected a call from the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would \"frustrate the vote of the British people\".\n\nThe prime minister branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, \"absolutely ridiculous,\" saying the public had given this Parliament \"an instruction\" to leave the EU.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Caroline Lucas: \"Does PM think democracy ended on 23 June 2016?\"\n\nTory MP Bob Neill asked about Gibraltar.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: Gibraltar will not be excluded from Brexit talks\n\nEsther McVey, who quit the cabinet last week over the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement, asked whether the UK was definitely going to leave the EU on 29 March.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nTheresa May must have felt that she picked up today where she left off on Thursday, with another rolling interrogation on Brexit. And she quickly defaulted into her weary-but-resolute mode.\n\nBackbench Brexiteer Andrew Rossindell kicked off proceedings with a direct appeal for the PM to change course on Brexit, saying her plan was not the Brexit his Romford constituents voted for. Then Jeremy Corbyn piled in with a well-targeted question picking up comments from ministers that \"no deal\" was not an option, and asking if there were any circumstances where the UK would quit the EU without a deal - a question the prime minister didn't really answer.\n\nThe confusion deepened a little later, when the PM confirmed to her ex-colleague Esther McVey that the UK would leave on the appointed date of 29 March - which at least implied that this was possible without a deal, and also seemed to pull back from previous warnings that failing to back her proposed Brexit deal risked \"no Brexit at all\".\n\nAnother important moment came when the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds confirmed that his party's relations with the government remain in the deep freeze, when he asked a hostile question about the disappearance of a government promise that the people of Northern Ireland would have the final say on any divergence from the UK's single market.\n\nYou could hear the acid drip as he asked: \"Did she press the delete button?\"\n\nNo sign of kissing and making up there. And that matters because it is hard to see how the PM's deal gets through the Commons without Mr Dodds and his troops (now restored to full strength with the return from suspension of Ian Paisley Jr).\n\nIt was a noisy session but I was expecting it to be noisier still.\n\nPart of the reason may be that the big-name Brexiteers who have been trying to unseat the PM did not intervene, which would surely have produced cheers and jeers aplenty (Jacob Rees-Mogg was in the chamber, but did not attempt to speak and left before the end of the session).\n\nAnother factor is that neither of the two main players was able to sound a clear trumpet note to their troops.\n\nJeremy Corbyn was in an excellent position to call for a second referendum, but clearly had no intention of doing so, and his mainly-Remainer MPs were not, therefore, delighted.\n\nWe already know that Theresa May's deal has not exactly delighted Conservative MPs either (even the ones who support it) and a series of questions on the details (Bob Neill on Gibraltar, George Freeman on Northern Ireland, Neil Parish on agriculture) caught the wary mood on the Tory benches.\n\nIt seemed to me that the two leaders were both better at attacking each other than defending their own positions, which meant that a lot of time was taken up with accusations of \"more muddled than thou\".\n\nBut the bottom line is that it is now close to impossible - in the absence of any overriding mega-event - to talk about anything but Brexit at PMQs."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "School 'Gay Pride' event prompts Christian group complaints", "description": "A parent says her child was \"forced\" to take part in an event that goes against her Christian beliefs.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46289025", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B455/production/_96856164_hi040492846.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:02:53Z", "content": "Image copyright PA Image caption Pride is celebrated annually in various events across the country A school may face legal action after Christian parents complained to governors about a \"Pride\" event it put on for pupils.

Just when hope had been allowed to soar on the back of James Forrest's wonderful hat-trick and the elan of some of Scotland's attacking play, the whole shooting match was going to be obliterated by a bloke on loan at Queens Park Rangers.\n\nThirty-one different nations have qualified for the Euros since Scotland last made a major championship. Along the way, Latvia made it, Bulgaria made it, Albania made it. Uefa has not only expanded the tournament, but it's also sorted it so that some of the games are played in Glasgow.\n\nThe Nations League was Scotland's golden ticket to all of that and all they had to do to put themselves just two more victories away from qualification was beat Israel.\n\nAt 3-1, even though Hampden was cold and wet and half empty, it was still a pleasing place to be.\n\nForrest was on fire. His Celtic team-mates, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie, were playing intelligently. His former team-mate, Stuart Armstrong, had been the one who galvanised the team when they trailed 1-0 and he was being real leader out there. Ryan Fraser was a threat. Steven Fletcher was tying it all together with another substantial performance leading the line.\n\nInjuries and other withdrawals meant that McLeish had fallen into this formation and this personnel, but he wouldn't be the first manager in history to stumble on something that worked and he certainly won't be the last.\n\nThe weather was lousy at Hampden and the crowd was sparse, but the excitement of the game made up for that. A few more like this and the hard-bitten, disaffected, Scottish FA-loathing, McLeish-doubting fans might return, with the emphasis on the 'might'.\n\nA lot of work needs to done to rebuild the bridges that have been burned in previous doomed campaigns. And this might have been another one.\n\nAs soon you relaxed into the thought that, at 3-1, this was both enjoyable and stress-free, it flipped on its head, as if the footballing gods had suddenly realised that everyone at Hampden was having a nice time and then went about restoring the natural way of things.\n\nEran Zahavi makes it 3-2 and then big Tomer pops up and scares the hell out of everyone. He forces a magnificent reflex save from Allan McGregor, but even then, the ball is in the air and McGregor is on the floor and, from the back of the stand at Hampden, it looks for a second like it's falling in behind the goalkeeper and into his net. It looks like 3-3 and a post-mortem to beat all post-mortems to follow, the kind where you don't turn up with a scalpel, you turn up with an axe.\n\nMcGregor didn't just save a close-range attempt on goal - he saved everyone another round of weary introspection, he saved his manager yet more weeks of (valid) criticism as well as the usual invalid and hateful bile from those charmers on social media.\n\nThe Rangers goalkeeper also saved Forrest a lifetime of being reminded that, despite scoring a brilliant hat-trick, it still didn't stop Scotland plunging back down another black hole. Elite sports people talk all the time about the fine margins at the top level and, in the 88th minute at Hampden, we were reminded of the truth of it.\n\nForrest can enjoy the glory of becoming the first Celtic player since Jimmy Quinn 110 years ago to score a hat-trick for the national team and the first Scotland player since Denis Law to score two, or more, goals in consecutive internationals.\n\nThat's some serious company he's got, but Forrest has found some serious form. That's 12 goals in his last 11 appearances for club and country, including five in two for Scotland. Each of those five finishes were sumptuous.\n\nInstead of picking over the bones of a failure, there is a sense of liberation. McLeish is never going to change the minds of all of his critics, but what has to be acknowledged is that the first big job he had to do has now been done. Scotland topped their Nations League group.\n\nThey've given themselves a shot at qualifying for the Euros via the back door. There might have been hardship along the way, but McLeish has got them there with three wins out of four.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device James Forrest: Five goals in two games for Scotland is unbelievable\n\nHis team that played against Albania on Saturday, and Israel on Tuesday, had energy and self-belief and wit in attack.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would meet Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Saturday to highlight the budget's \"solidity and effectiveness\".\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nItaly's current government took office in June 2018 and is a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League.\n\nWidely seen as a populist coalition, the first national budget of new government was hammered out in September,\n\nThe problem for EU officials was its high cost for a country facing massive debts. The government planned to rack up a budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP to finance its plans.\n\nThe Commission had hoped for a lower budget cost as the previous government's plans were for a 0.8% deficit.\n\nItaly is the third-largest economy in the eurozone, but has more than two trillion euros in debt - which is 131% of the country's entire economic output.\n\nTo put that in context, it is second only to Greece (178%), and far higher than the UK (88%) or Germany (64.1%). The debt is equivalent to about \u20ac37,000 for every person in Italy.\n\nThe government argues that additional investment is needed to kick-start the sluggish Italian economy, which has still not recovered from the financial crisis of a decade ago.\n\nItaly's statistics agency Istat forecast on Wednesday that the economy would grow by 1.3% in 2019, and 1.1% in 2018.\n\nWhile it said the budget would help boost demand in the Italian economy, its 2019 estimate is below the government's figure of 1.5%.\n\nShortly before the League-Five Star government came to power, Istat forecast a growth figure of 1.4% for 2018, and it said on Wednesday that growth was slowing in comparison with 2017.\n\nWhy is Italy's budget so expensive?\n\nItaly's government hailed the budget as one that would \"end poverty\".\n\nThe draft budget included the fulfilment of election promises, such as reversing plans to raise the retirement age and a guaranteed basic income of \u20ac780 (\u00a3700; $890) for poor families. Those two plans alone were expected to total about 0.7% of Italy's GDP.\n\nIt also included tax cuts and reforms.\n\nRecent bad weather in Italy has also added major infrastructure projects to the government's priorities - including the aftermath of the Genoa bridge collapse in August, which raised concerns over the country's ageing public works."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Pat Nevin: Scotland have 'something to get excited about' after beating Israel", "description": "Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin is enthused by the \"youthful energy\" and \"vibrancy\" of the team that beat Albania and Israel.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46287375", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/33F7/production/_104430331_18124923.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:42:51Z", "content": "James Forrest (centre) scored a hat-trick in Scotland's win over Israel The \"youthful energy\" and \"vibrancy\" of the Scotland side that beat Israel is \"something to get excited about\", says former national team winger Pat Nevin.

What's going on, and what does it all mean?\n\nWhat's this all about?\n\nIt's about seaweed. Or a particular type of seaweed. Kelp, to be precise.\n\nIf there's one thing Scotland isn't short of, it's coastline. And off the coast lie fertile grounds for the production of seaweed, with vast forests of kelp off the Western Isles and Orkney in particular.\n\nKelp plants don't have roots; instead they anchor themselves to rocks on the seafloor before growing rapidly up towards the surface. Some species of giant kelp can grow by as much as 30 to 60cm vertically per day.\n\nTraditionally it has been harvested on the shoreline, by hand. Seaweed has been used in the production of things like soap and glass, and is also gathered by crofters for use as fertiliser.\n\nBut commercial firms are now turning their eye on the dense forests of kelp that grow off the coast, where much greater quantities can be harvested directly.\n\nThis already goes on in countries like Norway and Chile, where up to 200,000 tonnes of seaweed can be collected in a year.\n\nWhy would anyone need that much seaweed?\n\nImage copyright Marine Scotland Image caption Seaweed is abundant around Scotland's coastlines\n\nIt's not just useful for soap and manure. The number of potential commercial applications for kelp, particularly the nanocellulose which can be produced from it, is growing all the time.\n\nOne Scottish company, Marine Biopolymers Ltd (MBL), has applied to harvest up to 30,000 tonnes of a specific species of kelp - Laminaria hyperborea - off the west coast each year.\n\nThis is a very abundant species of kelp - there are an estimated 19.7m tonnes of it off Scotland's coasts, meaning the firm would be targeting about 0.15% of it.\n\nThe firm would collect the kelp using Norwegian-style harvesting vessels, which would bring their haul back to a harvesting plant in Mallaig.\n\nMBL are working on a number of potential products derived from the seaweed, ranging from a \"transparent armour\" for police and the armed services to slow-release drugs for treating colon cancer and medical implants and meshes.\n\nThe firm claims that the kelp-harvesting industry is perfectly sustainable, and could be worth up to \u00a3300m a year.\n\nWhat could the downside be?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fish and molluscs call the kelp forests home\n\nOpponents of mechanical harvesting include green groups and politicians, who say the practice can have an adverse impact on sealife and even on land.\n\nThere are concerns that industrial-scale harvesting can strip whole plants off the seabed, making it hard for them to grow back.\n\nA range of plants and animals call the kelp forests home - everything from sea anemones to sponges, pollack, wrasse and saith. Cutting them back can destroy the habitat of young fish and invertebrates and feeding grounds for seabirds.\n\nThere could also be an impact on the shoreline, as a thick bed of kelp can absorb energy from waves, dampening their strength before they reach land - so there are fears removing it could cause coastal erosion or even flooding.\n\nA petition circulated by a Green MSP gathered 14,000 signatures opposing what they call kelp dredging (a term that MBL contest, saying \"you can't dredge a rocky bottom\").\n\nVeteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough has also spoken out, saying it is \"absolutely imperative that we protect our kelp forests\".\n\nDespite all this, a strategic environmental assessment by Marine Scotland in 2016 concluded that \"although not straightforward, sustainable commercial scale harvesting of certain species is possible\".\n\nSo what's being done?\n\nImage caption Seaweed from the Scottish coast has traditionally been harvested by hand\n\nAs things stand, commercial harvesting of kelp from the sea bed requires a marine licence. The Scottish government says the licensing regime \"sets a presumption in favour of development that is sustainable\".\n\nHowever there is now going to be a review of the regulations around harvesting, as announced by Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham on Wednesday.\n\nShe defended the current licensing system, calling it \"robust\", but said \"continuous improvement\" was needed where there were \"new or novel activities\".\n\nThis came after Green MSPs claimed that Marine Scotland was too close to MBL, having obtained letters apparently showing the regulator praising the firm's \"innovative proposal\".\n\nMs Cunningham said members should welcome the Scottish government and its agencies \"looking at innovative industries and thinking about new technologies and what might be developed in Scotland in the future\".\n\nMeanwhile, opposition MSPs have sought to bring in measures to restrict mechanical harvesting, successfully amending the Scottish Crown Estate Bill to bar techniques which \"would inhibit the regrowth of the individual plant\".\n\nHowever this only applies to Crown Estate land, which covers about half of the foreshore, and includes various provisions to allow research and development and maintenance work at power stations and ports.\n\nMs Cunningham said she would write to MBL, and urged other companies which want to be \"part of this burgeoning industry\" to \"continue to engage with the government and relevant authorities\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "US-Mexico border vigilante: 'They are invaders'", "description": "Security has been stepped up along the US border with Mexico, where thousands of migrants from Central America have arrived hoping to seek asylum.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/46291419/us-mexico-border-vigilante-they-are-invaders", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B27C/production/_104429654_p06sf0cl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T12:12:53Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nSecurity has been stepped up along the US border with Mexico, where thousands of migrants from Central America have arrived hoping to seek asylum.\n\nNorth of the border, some are strongly opposed.

Tell us your experiences.\"\n\nThe vast majority of replies were not positive - perhaps skewed by the recent assault on the Irish referee.\n\nThese are your stories...\n\n'Threatened to rape my wife, kill my children, then kill me'\n\nI was a referee. A player who had injured himself, while trying to make a violent tackle on another player, threatened to come to my house, rape my wife, kill my children then kill me.\n\nWhen I reported him to the county FA they asked if I'd booked or red carded him at the time, I said no as I was alone and he was with his team-mates.\n\nThey said in that case they would take no action but should he [the player] make contact with me or my family to let them know. I never refereed again.\n\nPeter, Wiltshire\n\n'Respect for grassroots referees?'\n\nI'm a referee who has not re-registered with my county FA. I was assaulted during an adult Sunday League game. I had sent off a player for violent conduct and he was the player who assaulted me.\n\nThere is no respect for grassroots referees at all, whether that be from spectators, players or managers. The FA's Respect Campaign, in my opinion, has been an absolute failure.\n\nVerbal abuse is the most prevalent, but this is something that is seen week in and week out in the Premier League, yet the referees do not sanction any of the behaviour. Grassroots players, therefore, see this as acceptable.\n\nThomas, Sheffield\n\n'Club manager came to attack me'\n\nI was an amateur referee until 2010 when I stopped because the risk is too high and there is no protection from anyone. Not even the league. I was harassed and almost beaten three times - twice from the same team and once from another team.\n\nMy size probably stopped them from real physical attacks. On one occasion the club manager was coming from behind to attack me, but thank God for my intuitiveness.\n\nRonald, London\n\nThousands of amateur and youth footballers play the game every weekend\n\n'Trouble with two sets of parents'\n\nThis kind of behaviour does not surprise me. l have given refereeing up now, but during my time l found that the parents were the worst.\n\nThe only game that l was scrutinised on turned into a mass riot between two sets of parents. l was only asked to do the game because the manager of one of the teams assaulted a woman at a match the previous week.\n\nI had been involved in the game up to that point for 40 years, as my playing days were over and l thought l would give something back to stay involved. But after repeats of players and parents alike reacting like this, l walked away from the game completely.\n\nStephen, West Midlands\n\n'Girl ran up and slapped ref'\n\nI dismissed a player for his violent conduct. The game finished a few moments later and as I walked to collect my flag with my assistant, a girl came running up behind us shouting. He [the assistant] turned around and asked: \"Did you want to speak to me?\"\n\nWith that she slapped him with the palm of her hand, which really shocked him. Is it any wonder that it is proving very difficult to encourage people to take up refereeing?\n\nName withheld\n\nSome referees question whether the Football Association's Respect Campaign has worked\n\n'Part and parcel of the job?'\n\nReferees get verbal abuse on a weekly basis, I guess it is part and parcel of the job. Physical abuse is on the rise and it is just unacceptable. I have been put in headlocks, punched and even had my car vandalised after games.\n\nThe FA has a Respect programme and I see it work very well in youth games, and it is improving in adult grassroots football. But I feel more needs to be done within the professional game that will feed down to grassroots.\n\nAbuse, whether verbal or physical, would not be tolerated in any other sport - why is it in our national sport?\n\nConnor, Derbyshire\n\n'A 22-woman brawl'\n\nI once refereed a game as a 16-year-old where 22 ladies started fighting over nothing and afterwards proceeded to threaten me.\n\nA few weeks later, I was refereeing a game at a park when on the pitch next to me a fight broke out. Three police vans arrived as a result of one player and his father being chased by 10 lads to the car park. This was all somewhat a baptism of fire to my refereeing career.\n\nDaniel, West Midlands\n\nReferee Daniel Sweeney suffered a broken jaw in an attack after an Irish amateur league game\n\n'Threatened nine months after red card'\n\nWhile trying to get a player to come to me so I could speak with him, he refused so I issued a yellow card. He immediately went into a tirade of foul and abusive language directed towards me.\n\nI then produced a red card, at which point he came at me (he was built like a bodybuilder). Players from his team were trying to restrain him but he continued to come towards me in a threatening way. The match was abandoned and the player was banned by the county FA.\n\nNine months later, I was in a petrol station and he was there and as we passed each other he said: \"If you think I have forgotten, well I haven't\".\n\nAllan, Hampshire\n\n'Players tried to kick door down'\n\nAfter refereeing a youth football match in Belfast where three players were sent off, I was forced to lock the door of my changing room after a number of players attempted to gain entry by forcibly kicking the door down.\n\nLater, upon leaving the changing room, I was met with a hail of verbal abuse and told that if I were to referee one of the teams again I would get my head kicked in.\n\nChris, North Yorkshire\n\n'My wife was targeted'\n\nI retired from refereeing after officiating a cup match back in the early 1990s. I was threatened and jostled after the game, but it was five days after the game when two of the players threatened me and abused my wife when we were out for a night on the town.\n\nI was aware of the risk of abuse from players, but when my wife was targeted, that was the line that could never be crossed. The county FA were just not interested in anything that happened away from the field of play. I did referee again, but not in that county.\n\nAnti, Brisbane\n\n'How can this be acceptable?'\n\nThe manager began to question my decisions from the sideline, I spoke to him and asked him to stop, but it continued and when I confronted him about it the second time he kept trying to argue. As a result, I sent him to stand with the parents. At the end of the game, I had to caution one of the players as he had been questioning my decisions and committing fouls throughout the match. Shortly after, his father came and confronted me.\n\nI decided to bring out my card holder so I could write down what he had said. However, he presumed I was going to show him [the parent] a card, so he threatened me. I genuinely feared for my safety and at no point did anybody come and offer me any support.\n\nHow can this be acceptable for a 16-year-old referee to be confronted and threatened by two fully grown men?\n\nAli, Suffolk"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Labour could form minority government without election - McDonnell", "description": "John McDonnell says the Queen should give Labour a chance if Theresa May loses key Brexit votes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46288429", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/48F0/production/_104427681_mediaitem104427680.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:20:42Z", "content": "Labour could form the next government without a general election if MPs don't back Theresa May's Brexit deal, John McDonnell has suggested.

It was one of my lifetime ambitions to take charge of the Irish senior squad.\"\n\nThanking his backroom team, O'Neill described Keane as \"an inspirational figure in the world of football\".\n\nO'Neill pays price for difficult 2018\n\nAfter their World Cup 2018 qualification hopes ended in a humiliating 5-1 home defeat by Denmark, the Republic's inaugural Nations League campaign was plagued by poor results and a string of off-field incidents.\n\nIn September, midfielder Harry Arter pulled out of the squad for games against Wales and Poland following a row with Keane.\n\nO'Neill defended his assistant after audio emerged of defender Stephen Ward apparently describing the incident which led to Arter's withdrawal.\n\nAlthough Arter would return to the squad for October's fixtures, highly rated West Ham teenager Declan Rice has remained absent since September.\n\nThe London-born defender continues to consider whether to represent the Republic, for whom he has featured in three friendlies, or England.\n\nRelegation to the third tier of Uefa's new competition came as they collected just two points, scoring only once, in four games.\n\nO'Neill celebrates the Republic's Euro 2016 win against Italy\n\nSpeaking after Monday's scoreless draw in Denmark, O'Neill indicated that he wanted to remain in the job.\n\nThe 0-0 draw in Aarhus means the Republic, ranked 33rd in the world, have gone four matches without scoring a goal and failed to win a competitive match in 2018.\n\nRepublic of Ireland results in 2018 L 1-0 v Turkey Friendly L 2-0 v France

Denmark Nations League\n\nEuro 2016 the high point of O'Neill era\n\nThe appointment of O'Neill and former captain Keane in November 2013 was greeted by a wave of optimism among supporters following the decline of the team under Giovanni Trapattoni, which had seen the Republic slump to 67th place in the Fifa world rankings.\n\nThe new management duo had almost a year to prepare for their first competitive fixture and successfully steered the side to Euro 2016 after a qualifying campaign that featured a 1-0 defeat of Germany before beating Bosnia-Herzegovina in a play-off.\n\nA famous win against Italy at the European Championship secured a last 16 match against tournament hosts France but they were beaten 2-1 in Lyon.\n\nVeteran players Robbie Keane and Shay Given retired after the end of the tournament but the Republic made a promising start to their 2018 World Cup qualifiers before a scoreless draw against Wales triggered a run of four competitive fixtures without a win and the heavy play-off loss to the Danes, which ended their prospects of qualifying for Russia.\n\n\"I will not forget the night in Lille when we beat Italy to secure the nation's best ever achievement in the Euros competition,\" reflected O'Neill.\n\n\"The terrific night we beat the World Champions Germany at home in Dublin, or James McClean's goal in that euphoric win against Wales in Cardiff that put us through to the play-offs for this year's World Cup.\"\n\nIn his 55 games in charge, O'Neill had a win ratio of just over 34% with 19 wins, 20 draws and 16 defeats and he used a total of 65 players, including 28 international debutants.\n\nThe 66-year-old handed international debuts to 12 players this year as the former Leicester, Sunderland and Celtic manager looked to build a new-look squad for the start of the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Republic will be among the third seeds for the European qualifiers when the draw is made in Dublin on 2 December.\n\nMcCarthy and Kenny among possible contenders\n\nFormer Republic manager Mick McCarthy is already being linked with the job and, perhaps significantly, is available following his departure from Ipswich Town in April.\n\nMcCarthy guided the Irish to the 2002 World Cup finals and despite his infamous bust-up with Roy Keane on the eve of that tournament, remains highly regarded by the FAI.\n\nEven before O'Neill's departure, there were voices in the Irish media saying that Dundalk manager Stephen Kenny should be next in line following his successes with the League of Ireland champions.\n\nKenny guided Dundalk to the domestic double this year and his side have won the league title in four of his five seasons in charge.\n\nBrighton boss Chris Hughton, who won 53 caps during his Republic career, is also high in the betting but the FAI could face a difficult task in prising him away from the Premier League club."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author":

Its property assets are owned by the Monarch in \"right of the Crown\", but this does not make them the private property of the sovereign, nor do they belong to the government.\n\nThere have been many disputes surrounding this unique legal status of the Crown Estate and how the foreshore and coastal areas should be used and for whose benefit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption How many of us think about beach ownership while building a sandcastle?\n\nLegal historian John Macaskill has written a book, Scotland's Foreshore, analysing these controversies.\n\nHe argued that historically communities across Scotland, particularly in Gaelic speaking areas, thought these areas were in common ownership or were \"free territory\".\n\nHe said that this could be seen during the disruption of the Church of Scotland in the 1840s.\n\nDr Macaskill said: \"The ministers who left the established church to form the Free Church couldn't get land on which to build their churches so they were reduced to having services in the most odd areas.\n\n\"There was the famous floating church in Loch Sunart in Ardnamurchan and there were two or three instances of ministers from the new Free Church holding services on the foreshore because it was believed the landlords writ did not run there.\"\n\nDrunken sailors\n\nBut during the 19th Century as new money making opportunities began to emerge, notably through kelp harvesting, local landowners and civil servants managing the Crown Estate began to clash over who owned and controlled the foreshore.\n\nDr Macaskill's research also shows that some aristocratic landowners objected to the mere presence of the lower classes on the foreshore near their stately homes.\n\nNewspaper articles from the time show that their concerns included that \"fish curing establishments may be erected under their drawing room windows\" while the Earl of Selkirk demanded \"the power of excluding trespassers who might make the place intolerable to a family of females and children\".\n\nHe was particularly concerned about drunken sailors going bathing and upsetting women.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption John Macaskill says Scotland's foreshore is hugely important\n\nFollowing a number of court cases between the Crown and private proprietors it was established that the Crown did always have ownership of the foreshore around Scotland, although ownership could be disposed of by an express transfer to a landowner or by the landowner having a history of possession of the area.\n\nBut disputes about how the foreshore was managed continued, as responsibility for the Crown estate was passed between various government departments.\n\nBy the 1950s these assets were managed by the Crown Estate Commission, an organisation that often faced criticism for focusing too much on raising revenue for the Treasury and not enough on the wider public interest.\n\nThese long standing grievances were examined in a report published in 2012 by MPs on Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee.\n\nThey accused the commissioners of damaging local communities by behaving like an \"absentee landlord\" and \"tax collector\". MPs backed calls for greater local control and devolution of the Crown Estate to Scotland.\n\n'Long battle'\n\nHolyrood gained powers over the Crown Estate in 2017 and now the Crown Estate Bill going through the Scottish Parliament aims to clarify how these historic property assets should be managed.\n\nStated aims of the Scottish government include promoting social well being and sustainable development while there are also provisions to give councils and community organisations the opportunity to directly manage these assets on a \"case by case basis\".\n\nDr MacAskill said he hoped that these \"exciting opportunities\" for improving the management of the Crown estate in Scotland can be realised.\n\n\"The foreshore is hugely important when you live on an island and there has been a long battle between the Crown and private proprietors over ownership and over management and how management should be very much in the public interest,\" he said\n\nDr MacAskill added: \"However, I fear not enough attention has been paid to history in discussions over the new legislation.\n\n\"I rather like a quote from Lord Bingham which paraphrased Walter Scott's Guy Mannering when he said a lawyer without history as well as literature is a mechanic and probably not a very good mechanic at that.

But the students who live there don't pay their rent to a commercial investor.\n\nIn fact, it goes to Cambridgeshire County Council, which has just bought the building for \u00a338m.\n\nThe council is upfront about why it's bought the building - it is \"an investment opportunity to fund our frontline services,\" says Cllr Joshua Schumann, chairman of the council's commercial and investment committee.\n\nHe says the purchase \"is about us making sure that as budget pressures become more challenging, we have the money to support the most vulnerable members of our community\".\n\nImage caption Cllr Joshua Schumann says investing in commercial property helps fund frontline services\n\nAnd Cambridgeshire isn't alone when it comes to investing in commercial property.\n\nTwo years ago Spelthorne Council in Surrey spent \u00a3365m buying BP's headquarters. Earlier this year it spent another \u00a3170m on an office block in west London.\n\nMeanwhile Stockport Council bought a large shopping centre in 2016 for \u00a380m.\n\nAcross England, the amount councils have spent on acquiring land and buildings has shot up from about \u00a31bn in 2015/16, to \u00a34bn last year.\n\nThis year councils expect that figure to rise again, to \u00a35bn. Much of that money will be spent acquiring commercial property, financed through cheap loans from the Public Works Loan Board.\n\nCambridgeshire's purchase of Brunswick House has come about through some complicated financial engineering - the council has borrowed \u00a3100m at government-backed interest rates of about 2%, well below market rates.\n\nIt has loaned that money to a company it owns called This Land. This Land is using that loan to buy council-owned land, on which it will build houses. And so the council gets the money back as a capital receipt which it uses to invest in buildings like Brunswick House.\n\nCllr Steve Count, the council's Conservative leader, says he's proud to lead a council that looks for \"financial solutions\". He points out that by using the loan in the way it is, the council gets two income streams - interest on the loan it's made to This Land, and rents from Brunswick House.\n\n\"Anybody looking at this with a financial background will understand it's not just complicated, it's actually great use of public funds,\" he says.\n\n\"What we are managing to do is use public funds in a multitude of different ways delivering on a multitude of objectives.\n\n\"This is a council not complicating matters but utilising funds to the very best of their ability. And we're very good at that.\"\n\nImage caption Cllr Steve Count says the investment is a great use of public funds\n\nBut the body that regulates local authority financial managers is concerned about the scale of borrowing across England. Last month, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) wrote to every council in England, reminding them of rules that ban them from borrowing to invest for purely commercial purposes.\n\nDon Peebles, CIPFA's head of policy and technical, says that \"by taking a disproportionate level of borrowing, councils are perhaps opening themselves up to a level of risk that has not necessarily been identified\".\n\nAnd he warns that because income streams from commercial property are not guaranteed, but the debt will need to be repaid, councils are opening themselves up to \"a longer term risk\".\n\nThe councils do, however, have their supporters.\n\nPaul Hackett is the director of the Smith Institute, a think tank that focuses on housing, regeneration, public services and local growth. He argues commercial investments can do more than just prop up an authority's finances.\n\n\"A lot of councils in the North or Midlands are struggling to kick start things where values are not so high, where the market is not so active,\" he says.\n\n\"Sometimes there's nothing else to be done but for the council to take a risk and get involved. Particularly when it comes to regeneration, where many councils are frustrated that things aren't happening, maybe they feel the risk is worth the potential reward.\"\n\nIn Cambridgeshire, however, the reward is clear. Each student living at Brunswick House contributes six times more to the county's coffers than the average council tax payer."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Tiger Woods v Phil Mickelson: Face-off aborted before pay-per-view duel", "description": "Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson's bid to \"talk smack\" ahead of their winners-takes-all clash in Las Vegas ends in laughs and handshakes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/46287514", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/14214/production/_104425428_thematch_reuters.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:07:00Z", "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device When golfers think they're boxers: Mickelson and Woods face off The efforts of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson to \"talk smack\" ahead of their winner-takes-all match in Las Vegas ended in laughs and handshakes.

A diplomatic note - seen by the BBC - raised concerns about access and environmental commitments.\n\nThe prospect might be a surprise to them, focused on 585 pages of draft agreements, but it's been the backbone of the economic argument for the UK's most pro-Brexit industry. Many have said it would be the litmus-test of the whole process.\n\nThe waters around all the EU's member states, up to a limit of 200 miles, are effectively \"pooled\" when it comes to fishing. It means boats from one country can fish in another's seas.\n\nWhen the UK leaves the EU, barring any new agreements, those waters will exclusively become the UK's again, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nThere's also a further separate international agreement, called the London Fisheries Convention, covering the 12 miles closest to the shore. It's being terminated, meaning no foreign vessel will be allowed to fish in UK waters without the UK's permission.\n\nA long-running fear among skippers has been that their fishing rights would be \"traded away\" in deals done for the benefit of more economically valuable sectors. The draft withdrawal agreement seems to rule that out but it doesn't mean foreign boats will be immediately chased away by British vessels.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNone of the industry bodies has advocated allowing only UK boats to fish in our exclusive economic zone - the sea up to 200 miles from UK shores. What they want is for the UK - or the nations of the UK - to decide who is and isn't allowed in.\n\nWhen Greenland left the EU, in 1982, it allowed limited access to its waters in exchange for infrastructure funding. Greenland initially held all the quotas for its exclusive seas but effectively sold off some.\n\nA similar negotiation is proposed between the UK and EU but there is no commitment to reaching a deal. The document simply says the two parties will \"use their best endeavours\" to do so.\n\nThere will have to be flexibility as British boats don't just fish in British waters. The recent scallop skirmishes in the Baie de Seine, which resulted in tussles at sea between French and British fishermen in a row over access to fishing grounds, illustrated the need for cross-border cooperation.\n\nThe fishing industry in towns such as Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Grimsby will see Brexit as a success only if their harbours are filled with more local boats in the years ahead.\n\nImportant too is the link being made between fishing opportunities for EU vessels and the sale of fish and seafood by the UK into the EU.\n\nIt's unlikely the prominence of fishing will crumble in the wider noise of securing a trade deal, mainly because most of the industry is in Scotland.\n\nThe block of 13 Scottish Conservative MPs, including the Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, have repeatedly taken a tough collective stance with the prime minister over the issue, only last week restating that it would be a \"betrayal\" if the EU retained any control over fishing rights.\n\nThose 13 Tories have a stronger voting power than the 10 DUP members keeping Theresa May in office.\n\nAnd looming over all this is the threat of a second referendum on Scottish independence. It would be of great political benefit to the SNP if it was able to claim the fleet had been \"let down by Westminster\" on fishing.\n\nOf course, a general election could change the dynamic entirely but short of that its difficult to see any radical shift.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption French and British fishing boats recently collided in the English Channel during a row over scallop fishing rights\n\nAs for the environmental concerns, annually the quotas for fishing catches are based on scientific advice. That is, scientists prescribe how much of each stock - cod, haddock et cetera - can be caught sustainably. It then becomes a political negotiation over how to divide up the stock between countries.\n\nIt's difficult to argue with the scientists - although many often do.\n\nBut if the UK decides to conduct its own scientific research - and that contradicts the European Commission's - the negotiations could become sticky.\n\nUntil not so long ago, Iceland had a long running dispute with the EU over its rights to fish for mackerel when its own scientists detected changes in their migration patterns.\n\nBut because it was an independent coastal state, it held many of the cards and eventually secured a much larger share of the catch. It had muscle and used it.\n\nSo, should the EU 27 feel concerned about future fishing opportunities being restricted?\n\nWe don't know the answer yet.

They didn't want the deal signing and have expressed \"grave concern\" that it has.\n\nSo, what is the problem?\n\nWhat's the deal?\n\nThe new deal allows Sky Sports to show 138 EFL games, every play-off match, 15 games in the EFL Cup and the semi-finals and final of the EFL Trophy. For the final two seasons of the contract, Sky Sports can broadcast an additional 20 league games, which must be taken out of the weekend programme.\n\nIn addition, Sky Sports can show any game they are not showing live, apart from matches that kick-off on Saturday at 15:00, on their red button service to residential customers.\n\nSky can select any game for TV coverage but must show each Championship club at least twice at home. This increases to three times for the final two years of the contract.\n\nThe majority of Championship clubs believe this deal is materially different from the short form agreement they were sent last year.\n\nIs everyone happy?\n\nAbsolutely not. The vast majority of Championship clubs were opposed to the deal.\n\nOne senior executive at a member club told the BBC that the EFL \"have started a war\".\n\nRight until the last minute, the Championship clubs were urging the EFL to delay, in order to provide more time to assess the changes and to come up with an alternative. They are incredulous their voice was not heard.\n\nOn Tuesday, seven Championship clubs met to discuss the situation and released a statement that ended with an ominous warning: \"There is a calm determination within Championship clubs to ensure the matter is not left here.\"\n\nGiven those clubs deliver the vast majority of fans and TV viewers to the EFL, it means some pretty powerful people are upset - and they have a number of complaints.\n\nWhy are they annoyed?\n\nFirstly, they feel the deal is miniscule compared to the \u00a34.55bn Sky and BT have agreed to pay to show 180 Premier League games per season from 2019-22. Two of its member clubs, Aston Villa and Leeds, were the 10th and 12th best supported clubs in England last season. Seven Championship clubs were in England's top-20 best average attendances last season. The Championship as a whole do not understand why the gap between the top two leagues is so big and fear the consequences of it getting larger in terms of financial competitiveness.\n\nIn addition, a number of clubs have said they were not told about the EFL decision to allow Sky to show 'non-TV' midweek games on their red button service. The EFL is equally forthright in its view that they were. The disparity suggests the communication was not delivered effectively.\n\nClubs recently relegated from the Premier League have noted the difference in how that organisation is run by Richard Scudamore and how the EFL operates under the control of its chief executive Shaun Harvey. Many clubs have complained at the lack of clarity in decision making by EFL executives. Clubs even found difficulty getting to see the actual TV document submitted by Sky ahead of Monday's decision.\n\nUltimately, as the nine-member EFL board - comprising EFL interim chairman Debbie Jevans, Harvey, EFL non-executive director Ian Watmore and representatives from Walsall, Scunthorpe and Carlisle in addition to those from the three Championship clubs - voted on the TV deal, it could be argued the other clubs did not need to see it.\n\nIn addition, the biggest clubs also feel their matches are shown too often, disadvantaging fans and teams - last season, for example, 19 of Leeds United's 46 league games were selected for Sky TV coverage. It has also been suggested that some centrally negotiated deals end up costing clubs money because of the number of tickets they have to give away as a consequence.\n\nHow this deal compares to other television contracts\n\nThe Championship was the third most-watched league in European football during the 2016-17 season, while the Premier League was top with total attendances of more than 13m and Germany's Bundesliga second.\n\nHowever, the Championship's attendances of more than 11m ranked higher than Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1.\n\nBut some of the clubs feel the EFL could have got more money for its television rights.\n\nThe Premier League's three-year deal with Sky and BT Sport, which begins in 2019, is worth \u00a34.55bn, although the amount Amazon paid for one package of games has not been disclosed.\n\nThe top flight's previous deal, agreed in 2015 and running until 2019, was worth \u00a35.14bn.\n\nIn June, Spain's La Liga sold its 2019-2022 domestic television rights for 980m euros (\u00a3871.41m) per season to Telefonica, an increase of 15% on the last three seasons.\n\nThe domestic television rights for Ligue 1 in France were sold in May in a record deal of 1.15bn euros (\u00a31.02bn) for the rights from the 2020-2024 seasons. Spanish group Mediapro won the main \"lots\" auctioned by the League, with another \"lot\" acquired by BeIN Sports. By comparison, the prices for the period 2016-2020 amounted to 762m euros (\u00a3677.5m).\n\nGermany's top two divisions sold their domestic media rights for 4.6bn euros (\u00a33.6bn) in June 2016, almost double their previous deal.\n\nThe deal is in its second of four seasons and was an 85% increase on the amount raised by the same rights in 2013.\n\nFive months ago, broadcaster Sky and sports media group Perform won the rights to screen top-flight Serie A football matches in Italy until 2021 for more than 973m euros (\u00a3893.1m) per season.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe Championship clubs are still to decide their next move.\n\nForming a breakaway league 'Premier League 2' has been rumoured but this is thought to be unlikely due to the timescales involved.\n\nMore likely, legal advice will be sought to see if any regulations have been broken in agreeing the contract.\n\nIn the meantime, attention may start to focus on Harvey, a former chief executive at Bradford and Leeds, who became EFL chief executive in 2013.\n\nHarvey, 48, was behind the proposal to expand the EFL to four divisions of 20 teams, an idea that was scrapped when the FA refused to transform the FA Cup into a midweek competition.\n\nIn 2016, he caused controversy by inviting 16 Under-21 teams from the Premier League and Championship into the EFL Trophy as a way of helping young players gain greater experience in a competitive environment."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "The Sussex artist making unique prosthetic limbs", "description": "When is a prosthetic limb not just a prosthetic limb?

I actually missed the birth of my second child.\"\n\nKnowles recognised the type of non-impact injury Wilson suffered twice can \"be in your head quite a bit\" so built a programme which improved Wilson's confidence to \"decelerate, stop or change direction and then accelerate again\".\n\n\"It's like trusting the disc brakes on your car,\" Knowles added. \"It starts from the brain, it goes down through the butt and the hips, your legs, ankle and foot, and then it goes right back to the brain again.\n\n\"In Callum's case, making the England team is purely from his own perseverance and it's super-exciting that he's showing his talents.\"\n\nAndy Murray has used all sorts of strength training methods including paddling in a swimming pool without a canoe\n\n'Strength training is under-applied in UK'\n\nKnowles says his methods have helped Philadelphia Union's academy teams have \"dramatically low\" injury rates.\n\n\"We spend close to 30% of our total contact time with athletes of all ages without a ball,\" he says. \"They are doing gymnastics-type moves, body-weight strength development and athletics track-style drills.\n\n\"Much of this is done with our MLS senior team, which has not had one ACL injury in nine or 10 years.\"\n\nWhile he accepts the number of games played and club budgets are factors in injury prevention, he says British teams could lean more on strength training.\n\nKnowles adds: \"There are a lot of very talented sports science, strength coaches and physios but I believe that, in the UK, the concept of strength development in-season is a bit under-appreciated and under-applied.\n\n\"In America our sports are a lot more accepting of it as are many, many teams in Europe.\"\n\nIf that advice seems at odds with Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri - who has banned weight training for his players - Knowles disagrees.\n\n\"I am not going toe-to-toe with any manager, but remember weight training is only one form of strength development,\" he says.\n\n\"I use a lot of body-weight work and we do a lot of explosive plyometrics in the water, so you don't need big gym sessions in order to influence strength as an athlete.\"\n\nMurray pictured paddling in a pool without a canoe has certainly smashed that perception."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "'We have mountain to climb', says Russia's Welsh coach Jones", "description": "Welsh coach Lyn Jones says Russia \"have a mountain to climb\" as they prepare to tackle Ireland and Scotland in the 2019 Rugby World Cup.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46277938", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/51FF/production/_104419902_cdf_161118_ge_dragons_v_russia_34.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T06:19:25Z", "content": "A former flanker, Lyn Jones made five appearances for Wales Welsh coach Lyn Jones says his Russia side \"have a mountain to climb\" after being given a place in the 2019 Rugby World Cup.

For a Kodak moment, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg puts it. So what's really going on?\n\nOn the face of it, the two sides are scrambling to iron out the final kinks in the draft Brexit agreement. And indeed, stumbling blocks do remain over issues like Gibraltar and fishing. Some of those unhappy in Westminster also still believe there's room to make changes to the agreement - particularly the controversial customs \"backstop\".\n\nIn reality though, as Laura Kuenssberg explains, the prime minister has been pretty clear the agreement is essentially ready to be signed off. But creating the sense that even tiny tweaks could be on the table has made it possible for some of her unhappy ministers to stay on.\n\nOur Europe editor Katya Adler agrees. No-one, she says, seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal this weekend. But appearing to engage in last-minute fisticuffs with Mrs May will allow her to claim the final text was hard fought and hard won\u2026 in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.\n\nThose critics, led by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, admitted on Tuesday that plans for a vote of no confidence in the PM had stalled.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nTrump's Saudi 'shrug'\n\nDonald Trump says Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"could very well\" have known about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, adding: \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Either way, in the words of our correspondent Anthony Zurcher, the president made clear, with a shrug, that Saudi Arabia is a key economic and security ally of the US, and morality and global leadership take a back seat to that.\n\nJamal Khashoggi - a prominent critic of the Saudi authorities - was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, sparking international outrage. The US Senate is calling on President Trump to order an investigation specifically on the role of the crown prince.\n\nFast food ads\n\nMcDonald's and Burger King must take steps to prevent fatty, sugary or salty products being promoted near schools, the Advertising Standards Authority says. It has upheld complaints about adverts for McFlurry and Whopper Jr products posted within 100 metres of primary schools.

Many will be hoping to make the most of any deals on offer. Black Friday originated in the US, as a way of kicking off Christmas spending after Thanksgiving with the lure of great bargains.

The Sun has a mocked-up picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg in the captain's uniform telling his sidekick: \"Don't tell 'em your plan, Pike.\" \"Who do you think you are kidding Mr Moggwaring?\" asks the Daily Telegraph.

The chain has a voluntary policy of not advertising such products within 200m of schools.\n\n\"We have asked them to review procedures to ensure all possible precautions are taken to meet our voluntary standards,\" McDonald's said in a statement.\n\nBoth burger chain advertisements were reported in July."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/21 05:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3wjzx", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T05:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Gaza Strip's only concert grand piano makes music again", "description": "The only concert grand piano in Gaza has been restored and played in a rare concert.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-middle-east-46261479/gaza-strip-s-only-concert-grand-piano-makes-music-again", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F250/production/_104423026_p06sb8c6.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:49:39Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nThere is only one concert grand piano in Gaza and it has been played in a rare public performance after being restored.\n\nThe work, first documented by the BBC three years ago and now completed, was led by a charity that supports musicians in areas of conflict."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Trump asked to determine Saudi prince's 'role' in Khashoggi murder", "description": "The US president is asked to determine whether the crown prince was involved in Khashoggi's murder.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46285131", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06pllht.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:31:18Z", "content": "Media caption Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing?

But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom.\n\nBoth sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity.\n\nMany Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act. Many, who'd long been hoping to see their country move forward, have been shaken by this shocking murder, and regret it will cast a dark shadow for many years to come.\n\nIn the words of one prominent Saudi: \"It has brought Saudi Arabia 10 steps back.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia \"including appropriate members of the royal family\".\n\nWhat does Trump's statement say?\n\n\"The world is a very dangerous place!\" Mr Trump states, before holding up Saudi Arabia as an ally of the US against Iran.\n\nThe kingdom spent \"billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism\" whereas Iran has \"killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East\", it says.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mike Pompeo backed Mr Trump, saying \"it's a mean, nasty world out there\"\n\nThe statement also stresses Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases. \"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries,\" it adds.\n\nWhile admitting the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was \"terrible\", Mr Trump wrote that \"we may never know all of the facts\" about his death.\n\n\"The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\"\n\nMr Trump later said he would meet Mohammed bin Salman at a G20 meeting in Argentina next week if the crown prince attended.\n\nThe essence of America First\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter, Washington\n\nDonald Trump is a different kind of president, and nowhere is that more clear than in his foreign policy, exclamation points and all. His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language.\n\nThe president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises.\n\nPerhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an \"enemy of the state\" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMr Trump has distilled his \"America First\" worldview down to its very essence. Morality and global leadership take a back seat to perceived US economic and military security.\n\nHow will the statement play out internationally?\n\nWhat the take-away will be in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus.\n\nUS policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter, our correspondent says.\n\nMr Trump's narrow, interests-based approach will further dismay Washington's allies in the West, he argues, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a \"Russia First\" and a \"China First\" approach in international affairs.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/21 04:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3wf7s", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "US says China has 'not altered' unfair trade practices", "description": "The latest attacks come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping this month.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46285284", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25A0/production/_104423690_chinafactorysteelwoman.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T03:59:22Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images The Trump administration has accused China of not changing its \"unfair\" practices, inflaming a trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.

The 585-page document focuses on the terms of the UK's departure and not on any permanent future relationship.

It also covers the so-called \"backstop\", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. Two cabinet ministers have resigned over the deal, others are believed to be trying to change its wording and there has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered.

To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates.\n\nJune Sarpong is a broadcaster who campaigned for Remain.\n\nPerry McCarthy is an ex-racing driver who became the first Stig on Top Gear, and is firmly opposed to the EU.\n\nThey went into the meal without knowing who they would be meeting.\n\nBut did they get on?\n\nJune Sarpong\n\nWho are you? I'm June Sarpong, I'm a broadcaster and author.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? I am a passionate Remainer - or \"Remoaner\" - and I absolutely believe that a modified relationship with the EU would have been the right route to take. However, I understand why people voted Brexit.\n\nWhat was your initial impression of Perry? I liked him instantly because he was quite funny, and quite self-deprecating. He was very, very committed to Brexit and so it was nice to actually be around somebody who is a dedicated Brexiteer and to have it out in a respectful way.\n\nHow was your date? The date got heated in part which was good, and I have to say, credit to Perry, he was not backing down. I loved it!\n\nAnything you didn't enjoy? Part of our conversation symbolised what's going on in our country at the moment, which is the sort of unwillingness to accept the other's view. I even say that for myself, I don't think there's anything that Perry could have said to change my mind at all because I totally believe this is the wrong thing for the country.\n\nDid you have any common ground? Yes, we did! In terms of how white working-class people have been completely demonised in this whole process. I agreed when he made a point about the fact that anybody that voices any concerns regarding immigration or any frustration is straight away called a racist, straight away made to feel they are somehow anti-foreigner and that's not what it is - it's about being concerned whether or not our public services can handle that amount of people, it's about concerns regarding the changing demography of the country.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption June wants to have another referendum on Brexit\n\nWhat was your biggest disagreement? He said that now we are leaving the EU we can go direct to our trading partners [to strike deals], but what I was trying to say was that a lot of countries who were once British colonies will now have bigger economies than ours! We can't expect to have the same trading deal with these countries that the EU has when we're on our own.\n\nDid he convince you of anything? Hell no! Definitely not, but I really liked him.\n\nWould you see him again? Yeah, of course! I wanna go racing in one of his cars!\n\nMarks out of 10 for the date: I would give it a seven. And if we weren't talking Brexit I'd have given it an eight - Brexit was the thing that ruined the date actually.\n\nFind out more\n\nWatch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.\n\nAnd find out what happened tomorrow when Stanley Johnson, ex-Conservative MEP and father of Boris Johnson, went on a date with journalist Ella Whelan.\n\nPerry McCarthy\n\nWho are you? Perry McCarthy, an ex-racing driver who made it to Formula One, before becoming the first Stig on Top Gear.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? I like Europe. I love Europe. I've nothing against Europe. But I don't like Brussels and I don't like the direction that they're going economically or politically.\n\nWhat was your initial impression of June? She was highly determined and very well-informed. When she started speaking, I was listening but at the same time thinking to myself, \"You've got to be on the ball here, sunshine, or she's going to rip you apart\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Perry reacts negatively to June saying she's going to help him understand Brexit's effect on the pound\n\nHow was your date? I think that we certainly respected each other. We have different views but are hopefully two caring people who want the best for everybody.\n\nWhat was your biggest disagreement?: About her wanting a People's Vote [a referendum on the final Brexit deal]. I personally, for many reasons, am not in favour of that, but of course June has every right to hold that opinion.\n\nWhat was the worst thing about your date?: She finished her meal much quicker than I did mine, so I was left multi-tasking, putting my argument forward and chewing at the same time.\n\nAny awkward moments: Yes, when she first walked in, I knew I recognised her, but I just couldn't pinpoint it from where. But after sitting down and chatting it through I felt like such an idiot because she's been so omnipresent for many years with a stellar career.\n\nWould you see her again? It would always be an absolute delight to see June, and see her for a drink, and have a real in-depth discussion about Formula One - because I want to make sure I win the next one!\n\nDescribe her in three words: Outstanding, inspirational talent.\n\nMarks out of 10 for the date: Nine. Would have been 10 if she had agreed with at least some of my points!\n\nWatch more Brexit blind dates\n\nFind out what happened when...\n\nLabour peer Prof Robert Winston went for dinner with former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace\n\nLove Island's Zara went on a date with Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid\n\nFollow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "'Asking about suicide doesn\u2019t cause suicide'", "description": "Suicide rates in America are rising, particularly among white, middle-aged men.

Where previous governments have blinked, Mr Macron has stared down the unions, weathered their protests, and pushed through difficult reforms on labour laws, and railway workers' pension rights.\n\nBut protests over fuel prices this month are presenting him with a new kind of political challenge. This is a protest with no official leader, no national organisation, not run by any union or political party; a protest that feels distinctly spontaneous, individual and diverse. And that diversity is key - both to its importance, and to its potential weakness.\n\nLast weekend, more than 280,000 people dressed in high-visibility jackets blocked roads across France in protest at rising taxes on diesel and petrol, which the government says are to fund eco-friendly projects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A small number of hard-core protesters have continued blocking roads and petrol stations this week, and calls have gone out on social media for a second national demonstration this weekend - urging protesters to converge on the capital. So who are the men and women in the hi-vis vests?\n\n\"It's the France of the majority, who work, who are not marginalised, who struggle to make ends meet and often end the month in the red, \"explains political author J\u00e9r\u00f4me Sainte-Marie, who has written a book on democratic changes in France.\n\nThat majority of struggling families and workers, many of them from France's rural areas or the run-down suburbs that ring its major cities, crosses political party lines, he says, which makes this protest quite unlike the predictable, highly choreographed marches of France's unions or political groups.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Macron's popularity is slumping, according to some polls\n\n\"It's a movement that goes beyond political differences and that's dangerous for Emmanuel Macron,\" Saint-Marie explains. \"As long as the opposition to Macron is split between left and right, his power isn't challenged. The gilets jaunes (yellow vests) are a kind of social reunification of the opposition that goes beyond political divisions.\"\n\nMichel Pigenet, a social historian at the Pantheon-Sorbonne University in Paris, agrees. \"Anti-tax movements are generally a right-wing cause, but the cost of living is a left-wing issue. There's clearly a will - like Macron himself - to generate a movement that is neither left nor right,\" he says.\n\nHe believes that the gilets jaunes, with their unstructured approach, are a new kind of movement for France, not seen since before the Revolution in 1789, and says the movement \"poses a serious political question\".\n\nThere's lively debate here about the true nature of the protests - whether the movement is being steered by hard-right agitators, or hijacked by political interests. But for every one out blocking roads, there seem to be many French citizens supporting them at home. A survey by the polling agency Elabe found that almost three-quarters of French voters approved of the protests, and that more than half of those who voted for Mr Macron support them.\n\nSeveral of the main opposition parties have publicly backed them, including the centre right Republicains, the far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon and his far-right rival Marine Le Pen.\n\n\"We don't want anyone using our movement, and we don't want leaders,\" said Frank Buhler, a prominent member of the gilets jaunes. \"We have to start all over again, that's how far we've come. The French Revolution started with flour wars; for us it's fuel taxes.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The protests have spread throughout France\n\nMost people agree this is about much more than fuel taxes. It's about the economic policies of President Emmanuel Macron in the face of growing frustration from low- and middle-income workers about making ends meet.\n\nMr Macron has presented himself as a president brought to power on the back of a grassroots movement, who could heal the rift between voters and leaders, and rebuild trust in democracy among those who felt disillusioned and detached from politics.\n\nSince then, his campaign - like his leadership - has been criticised for being too rigid, too hierarchical, too arrogant and aloof. Now, with has approval ratings falling steeply, he's faced with a real grassroots movement, what will his response be?\n\nThe government has put forward a package of 500 million euros to support poorer households in meeting their energy costs. And last week, Prime Minister Eduoard Philippe told a radio programme that he understood the protesters' anger, and defended their right to mobilise. But, he said, the fuel taxes and other economic policies would stay.\n\nPerhaps the government is right not to seem panicked. The surprise success of the gilets jaunes last weekend was based on a spontaneity that's hard to sustain; the French daily newspaper, Le Figaro, has already begun profiling its emerging leaders.\n\nAnd the diversity that until now has proved such an effective unifier of opposition to the president, may ultimately prove to be its undoing.\n\n\"There is general agreement right now, but none of us believe the same thing,\" says protester Frank Buhler. \"We all sing the Marseillaise and call for Macron's resignation - those are the two slogans of the movement. When Macron stands down, we will no longer agree, but right now we walk hand-in-hand. The politics will come later.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'I don't want everything to be about Down's'", "description": "Brent is a big fan of Twitter, but as someone with Down's syndrome he finds he gets relentlessly drawn into the big debates, such as abortion.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-45901125", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10F51/production/_104175496_mediaitem104175495.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:18:07Z", "content": "Image copyright Jacqui Tyson Last autumn, Brent Marriner, a 27-year-old from Sunderland, collected a Chinese takeaway by himself for the first time.

He tweeted about his achievement and got more than 10,000 likes and retweets.\n\nThe positive response was more than he could have hoped for.\n\nBut since then, he has found himself dragged into controversial debates or hounded for what he posts.\n\nBrent, who has Down's syndrome, and his \"Mam\" Jacqui Tyson set up their joint account @Being_Brent in 2015. Brent wanted to show people that he can do \"lots of things\" and Twitter seemed the ideal place to share.\n\n\"It's a good life with Down's syndrome. Mam and family and friends help if I need it. It's just ordinary,\" he says.\n\nMuch like everyone else, they tweeted about their life in Sunderland - going to the theatre, the tedium of chores, and acknowledging life's little achievements. Jacqui calls it activism by example. They quickly hit 12,000 followers.\n\nBut then a more sinister edge crept in. They found their posts quickly becoming public property, which were fought over and used in battles about personal politics.\n\nIt started when Brent tweeted that he had put the laundry away by himself.\n\nImage copyright Jacqui Tyson\n\n\"Do you want a medal?\" one woman quipped.\n\nJacqui messaged her privately to explain why it was an achievement for him, and the woman immediately apologised. \"She was mortified, said she was so sorry,\" Jacqui recalled. For Brent's mum, that was that.\n\nBut some of Brent's followers hounded the woman, even after she deleted the tweet. Jacqui tried to rein it in and said she would deal with any \"bother\" on the account, but eventually the woman was forced off Twitter.\n\n\"The response is a bit like when somebody famous dies,\" Jacqui says. \"People can lose all sense of proportion and kindness and understanding and react in extreme ways.\n\n\"With Brent - he's just a bloke who wants to have a nice life.\"\n\nBrent was fostered by Jacqui when he was six years old, and she adopted him when he was 10. He works part-time in a cafe, performs with a local dance company, and on Sundays he carries the cross at Sunderland Minster where Jacqui is a curate.\n\nImage copyright Jacqui Tyson\n\nThe duo had agreed the account would be for fun, not to pontificate on ethical or political issues. Jacqui would type the tweets, as Brent struggles with speech and language, and she would post it once he was happy with the wording.\n\nBut the family found they occasionally had to delete @Being_Brent when things got out of hand.\n\nIn June, an academic jumped on a tweet by Brent that said he chose his own clothes and hairstyle \"because I am a man and I can\".\n\n\"Do you mean a man rather than a child Brent? It comes across as a man rather than a woman and I'm sure you don't believe that women can't choose their clothes and hair!\" the academic tweeted.\n\nA gender politics firestorm erupted and lots of Brent's followers publicly shamed the academic. Jacqui didn't like the attention or what she describes as the mob mentality and felt it necessary to temporarily shut down the account until the furore had died down.\n\nAnd then there's the emotionally charged debate perhaps most associated with children with Down's syndrome.\n\n\"People sometimes try to drag us into the abortion debate and we just won't,\" Jacqui says. \"No,\" Brent agrees.\n\nThe disability world can be very political with strong opinions defended by friends and family who want the best outcomes for the people they care about. Naturally there are clashes, but it's something Jacqui and Brent had not expected when they started out on social media.\n\nNor did they expect people to assume that Brent must also be a commentator if he'd set up an account and attracted so many followers, but they do.\n\nRecently, as a debate broke out about a new pre-natal test for Down's syndrome, soon to be available on the NHS, activists started to tweet links about the issue underneath Brent's posts.\n\nImage copyright Jacqui Tyson\n\nThe Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) allows pregnant mothers to find out if their unborn child has Down's much earlier than the current screening process. As it only requires a simple blood sample from the mother, it is also much safer.\n\nActivists from the Don't Screen Us Out campaign fear the new test will lead to the effective eradication of people with Down's syndrome. But others, including abortion providers such as BPAS, say it would be unfair to deny women more accurate information about their pregnancy if it is available.\n\nComedy actor Sally Phillips, whose son Olly has Down's syndrome, previously said that she and others in the community had been \"extremely bruised\" by the negative attitudes revealed in the recent debates around screening.\n\n\"The message we hear is: 'Everyone would be better off if you were not here at all,'\" she says.\n\nBrent's followers expected an answer from him, a suggestion of which way to turn on the topic. Jacqui says that Brent found it: \"Sad to think people didn't want babies with DS because, after all, babies are babies. And DS is just DS.\"\n\nShe says: \"For him it's that simple. For some people it's not.\"\n\nImage copyright Jacqui Tyson\n\nIt's not just those who want to reduce the number of babies with Down's who cause conflict for the pair. There are a few inexhaustible Down's advocates and supportive followers who, Jacqui says, can also be problematic and make Brent a commodity, rather than an individual.\n\n\"They were saying we wouldn't have wonderful people like Brent if DS was wiped out and asking if it was tantamount to eugenics.\"\n\nShe says she's also had to block people who continually added them to lists on Twitter, see Brent as inspirational and only send them articles about Down's syndrome.\n\n\"Brent has Down's syndrome, you have lots of friends with Down's syndrome, but presuming that all we're interested in is random people with Down's syndrome\u2026 I find that kind of patronising,\" she says.\n\n\"I will block anybody on a comment if it looks in the least bit iffy.\"\n\nImage copyright Jacqui Tyson\n\nThe pair still enjoy Twitter and remain optimistic it's a space to share Brent's experience of Down's, but Jacqui says some of the innocence has gone.\n\nShe is regularly contacted by other parents whose children have Down's and are encouraged to see how full Brent's life is. Some have even set up their own Twitter accounts, but Jacqui always gives a word of warning to expect some strife.\n\nOften, disabled people find that whatever they do becomes political to others, especially if they're a member of a minority like Brent.\n\nBut despite all the attempts to entice Brent into advocacy, he remains firm that his account is for fun, and he does his own form of advocacy - without signing a petition or using a hashtag - by just being himself and living his life.\n\nWhen asked if he thought his tweets were, in their own way, changing how others perceived Down's, Brent said: \"We don't know, but we hope so.\"\n\nFor more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Big dog Bopper the Whopper is 'too fat for a kennel'", "description": "An animal shelter which rescued \"Britain's fattest dog\" has an even bigger problem on its hands.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-46280728", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E34F/production/_104419185_bopper.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:13:58Z", "content": "Image caption Bopper the Whopper shocked staff at an animal shelter when he waddled in weighing almost 50kg (8st) An animal shelter which rescued \"Britain's fattest dog\" has an even bigger problem on its hands.

Yes, Julio Iglesias and La Bamba topped the charts with Spanish language hits but they were always one-offs.\"\n\nNena's 1984 hit, 99 Red Balloons, was a hit in the US in German - but had to be translated into English before it was released in the UK: \"Almost as if Britain was considered too insular for it to be a hit in a foreign language,\" remarks Masterton.\n\nSo what's behind the shift?\n\nSebastian Krys - a five-time Grammy award-winning record producer, who has worked with the likes of Shakira, Luis Fonsi, Gloria Estefan and Ricky Martin - says technology has a large role to play.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee performed Despacito at this year's Grammys entirely in Spanish, following the success of the remix featuring Justin Bieber\n\n\"I think Spotify and YouTube have a lot to do with what's going on. Before, music was curated by the record industry gatekeepers, who were generally middle class, middle-aged white men. And now it's curated by the masses,\" says the Argentine, now based in LA.\n\nMasterton agrees: \"Artists aren't restricted to releasing things to certain territories at certain times. As consumers there is no barrier to consumption.\"\n\nThis one-size-fits-all policy on release dates means we are seeing music released in one language - rather than localised versions for different markets.\n\n\"But we're still seeing that, generally, to have an international success you have to have some English,\" he adds.\n\nKrys says cultural migration has also had an impact: \"You have about 15 million Spanish-speaking people in [the USA]. Everything about the culture starts shifting: it starts with food and then TV and other mediums.\n\n\"We now have a Latin actress as the highest paid on US TV,\" he says of the Colombian Modern Family star, Sofia Vergara.\n\n\"It permeates into the culture of what people think they should look like and what they should sound like. And the same thing is happening now for the Asian community with [the film] Crazy Rich Asians.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ricky Martin spent three weeks at number one with Livin' La Vida Loca in 1999\n\nKrys says there is a real difference between what is happening now compared to the crossover careers of earlier stars: \"In the early 2000s you had Latin artists, who were singing English pop songs - like Ricky Martin. They had a flavour of something Latin about them.\n\n\"But now artists are doing music that is rooted in the Latin culture - they are not having to make compromises.\n\n\"There is more interest now in what other people and cultures are doing,\" he says. \"For a long time most pop music has been rooted in blues and R 'n' B, but you get tired of music all sounding the same. I think people that create music, whether it's K-pop or Latin music, are giving audiences something new, but which still sounds familiar.\"\n\nIs Mi Gente the new Despacito?\n\nDespacito breaks global streaming record\n\nKent Jones on his multi-lingual smash hit Don't Mind\n\nHannah Waitt, co-founder of K-pop news and entertainment website moonRok, says the huge popularity in Latin music is understandable given the large Spanish-speaking diaspora around the world - but calls the rise in Korean music \"a little more mystifying\".\n\nShe puts its success down to its heavily borrowed Western pop sound, which she says has been \"carefully manufactured and re-exported to the Western hemisphere with more English mixed into the lyrics\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption BTS are filling the gap left by One Direction and Fifth Harmony, says Hannah Waitt\n\n\"K-pop has also filled a huge gap in the market for groups,\" says Waitt. \"With Fifth Harmony and One Direction gone, there's no one really stepping in to give us that group dynamic, which I think young people want.\n\n\"K-pop almost feels like the second coming of the girl group and boy band renaissance that was started by the Spice Girls, N'Sync, and Backstreet Boys.\"\n\nShe says it helps that Korean artists give fans \"gratuitous access\" to their personal lives via social media and reality TV shows.\n\n\"Whereas many Western celebrities go to great lengths to protect their privacy, Korean celebrities let fans into their homes, their studios, and even their cars to give fans a closer look at their day-to-day lives. This sort of access fosters a more intimate relationship between the fans and the artist, which results in intense fan loyalty.\"\n\n\"Genres are disappearing and language has taken a backseat to the music,\" Waitt adds.\n\nMasterton agrees, saying: \"With BTS there is no real concession to English. Younger generations don't care what the language is, it's just the vibe of it and the feel of it that they like.\"\n\nHe also sees it as a way for artists like Beyonce, who features on Mi Gente with J Balvin and Willy William, to freshen up their sound: \"Anything that gives your record a bit of an edge and makes it sound different - as well as making it appeal across different countries is bound to be good.\"\n\nPerhaps this is the real reason the music industry seems suddenly so eager to embrace bilingual hits.\n\nWhich record company wouldn't want to conduct a mutually beneficial cultural exchange - introducing, for example, Dua Lipa to the Korean market and giving her immediate cachet by associating her with an already domestically successful artist? And likewise for Blackpink to the UK market.\n\nKrys concedes there is an element of this going on, but says it's not the most important aspect in the change we've seen: \"You go back to Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson - there are always people wanting to break into new markets. But I think these young artists want a new sound and want to collaborate.\"\n\nWaitt calls it a \"cynical\" way to view things, saying: \"I prefer to look at it as an incredible opportunity for the biggest artists in the world to create music that reflects the multi-lingual world that we live in.\"\n\nBTS management apologise for 'Nazi' photos\n\nWhat do non-Koreans love about K-pop?\n\nHow to be the perfect K-pop fan\n\nAnd what of K-pop - is it just a flash in the pan that will come and go?\n\nWaitt says: \"Every time I think K-pop is going to plateau or peter out, a new group comes along and takes the genre to a new level. I think K-pop is here to stay - it will always have a core fan base of young people that care enough to buy tickets and stream the songs.\"\n\nAll three say they see this cultural phenomenon as a good thing.\n\nKrys says: \"Where some people think artists are appropriating a culture, I think it actually opens up the cultural dialogue.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Beyonce and J Balvin perform their global hit Mi Gente at Coachella earlier this year\n\n\"Living in the US right now, on this very polarised planet, it's very weird to see songs like Mi Gente and Despacito be number one. I don't think it can be a bad thing to have positive cultural models like these.\n\n\"We're not all rapists and murderers,\" he remarks, referring to President Trump's 2016 election campaign. \"We're musicians and artists and doctors and normal people.\"\n\nMasterton sees it as beneficial that acts don't have to \"dilute\" their own culture to be successful in another country.\n\n\"And you know what,\" he adds, \"the number of teens that might know a phrase or two in Korean is also likely to be far higher than previously - which can only be a good thing!\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It is the family's choice to then decide what to do with the ashes afterwards.\n\nThe contentious topic of cremation is again in the headlines as the municipal council of Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, has recommended mandatory cremation for those who die aged 25 and under.\n\nThe proposal comes less than two years since the council had said the bodies of children aged 10 and younger should be cremated - highlighting the stark reality facing urban planners.\n\nThe rapid population growth around Zimbabwe's urban centres means burial space is running out. Councillors have limited options and they feel cremation is the solution.\n\nOne of the city's six cemeteries - West Park Cemetery - is reported to only have space for 200 graves. And the capital, Harare, is facing similar problems.\n\nThere are disputes about what the Bible actually says about cremation, but the core opposition to cremation is likely to spring from traditional burial rites.\n\nSprinkling beer required at gravesides\n\nCultural activists say cremation has no expression is African traditional religion.\n\nThe dead, known as \"the ancestors\", are symbolic and carry a lot of weight amongst the living. They need to be respected, and to do that you need a grave that you can take care of.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Most Zimbabweans are deeply religious\n\nThere are rich cultural practices to be done at the graveside that involve the sprinkling of beer to appease the forefathers.\n\nWith ashes sprinkled in \"no man's land\", this would make the ritual difficult to practise.\n\nThe spiritual connection between the dead and the living is difficult to disconnect. Cremating a human body entails that sad disconnection. And there is a strong view that this is a foreign culture.\n\nWhat the late Gordon Chavunduka, a former vice-chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, said nearly 20 years ago still holds true for some: \"The philosophy of death in Shona African society says it takes about a year for a spirit to leave the body and join the spirits of the ancestors.\n\n\"If the body is cremated, that spirit would be blocked. Although it would remain alive, it would be angered that traditional burial rites had not been followed properly and could return to punish the family and community.\"\n\nMore on funeral and burial rites in Africa:\n\nIt may also explain why the authorities are shrewdly suggesting that those who die younger be cremated - as they have no descendents or long memories that would require traditional rituals.\n\nThe council's proposal excludes adults aged over 25, who would be more likely to have children looking up to them in the spiritual realm.\n\n'Fear of witches'\n\nYet even on the cultural side there are those in favour of cremation - though perhaps for more tongue-in-check reasons.\n\nOne Harare resident has been quoted as saying it would be a good way to save oneself from the witches of the spirit world, who some believe can exhume and feast on dead bodies.\n\n\"I will not give them that satisfaction because now they must be salivating, lusting after my thick frame and big bottom. But if I am to be cremated tough luck on them, they can only sniff my ashes spread all over the village,\" she told the state-run Herald newspaper.\n\nEnvironmentalists have also argued that cremation is a better option, saying that coffins are usually coated with preservative paints and varnishes containing dangerous chemicals such as mercury that can contaminate underground water systems.\n\nBut at the end of the day, if anything is going to encourage a move away from burials to cremation in Zimbabwe, it is the cost factor.\n\nThe majority of the population is struggling to make a living as the economy yet again seems to be floundering.\n\nAs the Bulawayo-based Chronicle newspaper noted, it costs about $63 (\u00a355) to cremate a body, while conducting a burial without a funeral policy is about $1,000.\n\nMore Letters from Africa\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "FA Cup: Bradford City 1-1 Aldershot Town highlights (4-1 pens)", "description": "Watch highlights as Bradford goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell spares the League One side's blushes, saving two spot kicks as the Bantams beat National League Aldershot 4-1 on penalties in their FA Cup first-round replay.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/46283974", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:58:20Z", "content": "Watch highlights as Bradford goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell spares the League One side's blushes, saving two spot kicks as the Bantams beat National League Aldershot 4-1 on penalties in their FA Cup first-round replay.

The first US company to achieve a trillion dollar market value, the tech gi\u2026 [+4904 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple has lost billions in market value in recent weeks\n\nApple was once the, well, apple of Wall Street's eye.\n\nThe first US company to achieve a trillion dollar market value, the tech giant boasted trend-setting products, a cash pile larger than the economy of some countries and consumers so loyal they would camp out overnight.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the California firm has fallen sharply out of favour.\n\nIts share price has tumbled more than 20% since October, hurting other stocks and infecting the wider market.\n\nThe firm's share price is now trading below $180, and remains up only about 2.3% for 2018.\n\nSo what's taken the shine off Apple?\n\n1. Investors are worried about iPhone sales.\n\nIn September, Apple unveiled a new line-up of products but it isn't clear if that the excitement they generated is translating into sales.\n\nThe number of products Apple shifted was relatively flat in its most recent quarter and the firm's forecast of 0-5% year-on-year revenue growth for the holiday season - typically a time when families stock up on the latest gadgets - disappointed investors, triggering a steep market sell-off.\n\nRecent announcements of production cuts at some of the firm's suppliers - such as Lumentum - heightened the anxiety, even though such moves are notoriously difficult to interpret.\n\nApple exacerbated matters with its decision to stop saying how many iPhones, iPads and other products it has sold each quarter, raising suspicions that it had something to hide.\n\n\"The iPhone unit metrics being pulled ... was the straw that broke the camel's back on Apple's stock,\" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities.\n\n2. Apple's high prices could leave it exposed if the economy sours.\n\nIn recent years, Apple has responded to a slowdown in smart phone sales by raising prices - a move that has helped the company enjoy record revenues, even while the industry generally contracts.\n\nBut global and US growth is expected to slow, and recent data on consumer spending has been mixed.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple shares have fallen more than 20% from their October peak\n\nWith Apple demanding $750 for the cheapest of its new iPhones, it is at risk in the event of a slowdown. And its own sales forecasts have exacerbated those worries.\n\n\"Clearly the average selling price trend can't continue forever,\" said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA. \"I think the real concern out there for investors is how long can they keep this going.\"\n\n3. Investors aren't confident - yet - about Apple's services business.\n\nApple has identified its services business - which includes items such as ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store - as the next big growth driver. It aims to book $50bn in services revenue by 2020, drawing on its large user base.\n\nBut investors generally still have a lot of questions. For example, Apple hasn't formally shared its plans for television and movies and its goals for breaking into the health industry also remain relatively obscure.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple is looking to its services business to drive growth\n\nAnalysts will have to adjust to a business driven by smaller, regular payments, instead of big hardware hits, said Carolina Milanesi analyst at market research firm Creative Strategies.\n\nBut Ms Milanesi thinks worries are premature, for now.\n\n\"If we know that sales for the iPhones are going to be either flat or down and then there's nothing else to compensate that, then of course there are reasons for concern but I think it's too early,\" she said.\n\n\"In a year's time, if we don't see the services business pick up in the way we expect, then I think the concerns could be legitimate.\"\n\n4. Apple reflects broader market concerns - like US-China trade tensions.\n\nThe technology sector overall has been hit hard in recent weeks, as investors flee an industry that had driven market gains earlier in the year.\n\nHowever, until Apple's update to investors on 1 November, the turmoil left its shares relatively unscathed by comparison.\n\nImage copyright STR/AFP Image caption Greater China accounts for about 20% of Apple revenue\n\nNow the iPhone maker has also been infected by the market fears, of which there are plenty, including overly optimistic valuations, rising interest rates, currency fluctuation and US-China trade tensions.\n\nChina, in particular, is a risk some are watching for Apple, since the Greater China region - which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan - is the source of about 20% of the firm's revenue.\n\nIt also relies on manufacturers there, though its products have been spared from tariffs so far.\n\n\"It's definitely a white knuckle period,\" said Mr Ives. But, he added, that he remains optimistic about Apple's fortunes over the longer term.\n\n\"This product cycle does not appear to be hitting the levels the bulls were hoping for,\" he said. \"But I don't believe that there is a broader change in the Apple story if we look out over the next two, three, four years.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Mexican tetra fish may offer heart repair clues", "description": "A fish that can repair its own heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46275178", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/154AB/production/_104411278_blindfish.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:43:26Z", "content": "Image copyright BHF Image caption The Mexican tetra fish that lives in the rivers of Northern Mexico can heal its heart, while its cave-dwelling relative cannot A fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a st\u2026 [+2979 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright BHF Image caption The Mexican tetra fish that lives in the rivers of Northern Mexico can heal its heart, while its cave-dwelling relative cannot\n\nA fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study.\n\nScientists studying the Mexican tetra fish found three areas of the fish genome were involved in its ability to regenerate heart tissue.\n\nOne gene appeared to play a particularly key role in the process.\n\nResearchers hope their study will one day make it possible to heal heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in the UK live with heart failure, often as a result of a heart attack.\n\nBecause it is not possible for humans to regenerate their damaged, scarred heart muscle, people either have to live with the condition or may require a heart transplant.\n\nCave fish clues\n\nFor this study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and her team at the University of Oxford studied two types of Mexican tetra fish - river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot.\n\nThe cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness.\n\nComparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury.\n\nHaving discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish.\n\nWith this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring.\n\nScar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body.\n\nBoth of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nImage copyright BHF Image caption Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and a colleague in the cave where the fish live\n\nThe study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function.\n\nThis could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9.\n\nDr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: \"I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart...\n\n\"It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts.\"\n\nBut she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating.\n\nProf Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers.\n\n\"Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition.\"\n\nThe study has been published in Cell Reports.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Dirty Sanchez star Matt Pritchard to host BBC vegan cookery show", "description": "Former wildman Matt Pritchard landed the programme after his YouTube cookery shows were spotted.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46274408", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11AB3/production/_104417327_mattpritcharddirtyvegan.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:42:31Z", "content": "Image caption Dirty Vegan will air on BBC One Wales early next year Dirty Sanchez star Matt Pritchard is to front the BBC's first vegan cookery show.

Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nAt least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people.\n\nHow did the charity work out the death toll?\n\nIt is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open.\n\nSave the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food\n\nRising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity.\n\nThe UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation.\n\nThe rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds.\n\nSave the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the north of Yemen through its southern port of Aden, which has significantly slowed down aid deliveries.\n\nOne mother's ordeal\n\nNusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children.\n\nHe was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again.\n\nImage copyright Mohammed Awadh/Save the Children Image caption 13-month-old Nusair\n\nBy that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital.\n\n\"I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,\" his mother, Suad, told the charity.\n\nWhat happens to the malnourished children?\n\nThe charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year.\n\n\"For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,\" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says.\n\n\"Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry.\n\n\"Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it.\"\n\nHe further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with \"a dramatic increase\" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks.\n\nIsn't Yemen already suffering from famine?\n\nNot yet - but it's getting close.\n\nJust last month, the UN warned that half the population of the war-torn country was facing \"pre-famine conditions\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues\n\nA country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine:\n\nAt least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food\n\nMore than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition\n\nAt least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day\n\nThe UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts.

Black Friday - this Friday, 23 November - originated in the US, as a way of kicking off Christmas spending after Thanksgiving with the lure of great bargains.\n\nMost British retailers are now in on the action. Emails offering discounts have been hitting inboxes for days. But a few, including some of the biggest chains in the UK, are opting not to join the frenzy.\n\nSo how is Black Friday changing the way people shop?\n\nWe're buying more in November\n\nBlack Friday sales will see discounts applied across the retail sector - from clothing to electrical goods.\n\nIn 2015, sales in Great Britain grew faster in November than in December for the first time, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nDecember sales have been slowing down, as shoppers look to snap up a bargain earlier on in the build-up to Christmas.\n\nInternet sales are on the up\n\nOnline retail giant Amazon is often credited with bringing Black Friday discounts to the UK eight years ago.\n\nNow, the sales event, which is no longer limited to 24 hours, runs through the weekend and culminates in so-called Cyber-Monday. That's the Monday after Black Friday, when retailers cut prices for goods they're selling online.\n\nAccording to the ONS, average weekly internet sales nearly tripled between November 2010 and 2017.\n\nLast November, UK consumers spent over \u00a31.6bn online every week.\n\nWith internet sales increasing, analysts have questioned what impact Black Friday and Cyber-Monday could have on struggling High Streets.\n\nRachel Lund, head of insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"The results for footfall can be mixed. While many consumers hold off purchases until the end of November, many will take to the High Streets to scope out potential products to purchase come Black Friday.\n\n\"The rise of click-and-collect [order online, pick-up in-store] can also drive footfall back into town in the days following Black Friday.\"\n\nHow are companies coping?\n\nMany offers in the shops and online will be on electrical goods such as TVs, tablets or laptops.\n\nIn 2017, Currys PC World saw their highest volume of sales of televisions on Black Friday, while Argos saw 13,496 shoppers visit its website every minute.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been extending offers and opening hours to ease pressure on their staff, servers and delivery services. What started off as a one-day event has become \"Black Friday week\" in many stores.\n\nRetail analysts have also said that some companies' profits have been hit by heavy discounting in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nDepartment store chain Debenhams issued a profit warning in January 2018. Debenhams said that margins had decreased as shops compete to offer the best deals to attract customers. Baby goods retailer Mothercare also struggled after cutting prices early.\n\nSome firms have other plans for Black Friday. Primark, Asda, B&Q and Marks & Spencer have said they won't be taking part in the flash sales event.\n\nSeveral stores have said that they instead aim to offer value for money all year round. Others have made it a point of principle, saying that spending and over-consumption have a negative impact on the planet.\n\nRetail analyst Clare Bailey commented: \"Not participating makes sense for retailers like B&Q who don't sell products that lend themselves to Black Friday promotions.\n\n\"But for others, it just means that competitors will pick up the sales. That might not be the best thing to do in the current climate, when every pound counts.\"\n\nCharts by Daniele Palumbo."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "The West Bank homes being dropped from Airbnb", "description": "Airbnb's decision to stop listing the properties is welcomed by Palestinians but condemned by Israel.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-middle-east-46284900/the-west-bank-homes-being-dropped-from-airbnb", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2F00/production/_104423021_p06scz6n.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:09:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nAirbnb has decided to remove postings for homes located in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe decision comes after criticism from both Palestinians and Human Rights groups.\n\nGidi hosts a property located in the West Bank and is disappointed at the decision."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'I hire a man to pretend to be my daughter\u2019s dad - and she doesn't know'", "description": "When Asako saw her daughter was bullied for not having a dad she hired a man to act out the role.

But years later her mother told her he wanted to reconnect. Megumi began to see Yamada regularly. She thinks he is her father, and that Yamada is his real name - but this is a lie.\n\n\"Ever since she was little she'd ask me where he was,\" says Megumi's mother, Asako. \"All she knew was that he had gone soon after she was born, so she blamed herself.\"\n\nFor years it didn't appear to be a problem. But when Megumi was about 10, Asako noticed a change in her daughter's behaviour.\n\n\"She didn't talk to me and became very quiet and withdrawn,\" Asako says.\n\n\"It took a long while to find out about the bullying.\"\n\nAsako discovered that Megumi wasn't only blaming herself for her parents' breakup. Her classmates were also ostracising her because she didn't have a dad - children of single parents are often stigmatised in Japan.\n\nEventually she became so unhappy that she refused to go to school.\n\n\"She's my only child and it was breaking my heart to see her so sad,\" Asako says.\n\nShe tried to get the teachers at school to help, but when that failed another idea came into her head.\n\n\"All I could think about was, what if I found a man who was nice and kind, an ideal father, someone who would make her feel better?\" Asako says.\n\nShe'd heard about relative rental agencies that could send an actor to play a guest at a wedding or go on a date - they are well established in Japan. So she contacted one to ask if they could also provide a fake dad. After auditioning five hopefuls, she settled on a man called Mr Takashi.\n\n\"I found him the easiest to talk to,\" Asako says. \"He's very kind and sweet, so I just followed my instincts.\"\n\nTakashi runs a rental agency with about 20 staff and more than 1,000 freelancers - men and women of different ages and backgrounds who can cater for almost any situation, taking on fake names, personalities and roles. They often have to lie, but they are very strict about not breaking the law.\n\nAs an actor himself, he's played boyfriends, businessmen, friends and fathers, and been a bridegroom at five fake weddings.\n\nHe prepares for his roles, he confesses, by watching Hollywood movies like Little Miss Sunshine, the Oscar-winning film about a dysfunctional family bonding on a road trip, and The Descendants, in which George Clooney plays an indifferent parent who suddenly has to embrace fatherhood after a family tragedy.\n\n\"I study these films, and memorise phrases and lines,\" Takashi says. \"I take notes on how different family members interact and communicate, and what it takes to be a certain kind of father or husband. They help me understand different family dynamics and relationships.\"\n\nAsako met Takashi several times to talk about the kind of father she wanted him to play to Megumi.\n\n\"My requests were very simple,\" she says. \"Firstly, I wanted him to say how sorry he was that he couldn't be in Megumi's life until then. Secondly, I wanted him to listen to whatever she wanted to tell him.\"\n\nAsako then told Megumi that her father had remarried and now had a new family, but that he had recently been back in touch because he wanted to see them again.\n\nHe was working, she said, as \"an actor\".\n\nMegumi was shocked, but eventually agreed to meet him. And so, nearly 10 years ago, Takashi became Yamada, Megumi's father - his longest-running, and perhaps most ethically dubious role to date.\n\nTakashi still remembers their first meeting.\n\n\"It was a very complex emotion that was there,\" he says. \"She asked me why I hadn't come to see her before, and I felt her resentment.\"\n\nAs Yamada, Takashi began seeing Megumi and her mother a couple of times a month - joining them on days out, trips to the cinema and visiting for birthdays. And Asako says it didn't take long to see a real change in her daughter.\n\n\"After a while Megumi became much happier and more outgoing,\" she says. \"She loved to talk, she was lively - she even wanted to go back to school, and that's when I thought, 'This has all been worth it!'\"\n\nOne particular occasion sticks in Asako's mind - when she and Yamada were at Megumi's school parents' day.\n\n\"We were standing at the back of the classroom,\" Asako says. \"She saw us together and kept on turning around to look at us. She had the biggest smile on her face and that made me really happy.\"\n\nTakashi's services are not cheap. Each time Asako hires him to play Yamada she pays about 10,000 Yen, (about \u00a370 or $90), and although she earns a decent salary she has to make savings elsewhere to afford it. But when she remembers how unhappy her daughter once was, she thinks it is money well spent.\n\nTakashi also sees a difference in Megumi, from the quiet, hesitant girl that he first met.\n\n\"Gradually she became happier and more confident,\" he says. \"I used to meet her with Asako, the three of us together, but one day she said, 'I want to go out with my father, just the two of us,' so I took her out and she held my hand for the first time.\"\n\nOver the last 10 years, Takashi's character Yamada has grown very close to Megumi, now a young adult. He's become a part of the family. He even tells Megumi that he loves her, in the way that any father might - but, of course, he doesn't really.\n\nHow does he justify this act of deception?\n\n\"Switching personalities and identities is very important in this job,\" he says. \"But I'm human, and so, of course, it would be a lie if I said I don't feel any emotional conflict saying, 'I love you,' to that child. But this is a business, I have to do it, and I have to keep reminding myself of that.\"\n\nAsako also understands that some might disagree with her choices.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is drastic,\" she says. \"But I really, really wanted to save my daughter.\"\n\nTo complicate matters, she has also become very attached to the fictional character she is paying Takashi to portray.\n\n\"When the three of us are together, I feel at peace,\" she says.\n\n\"We talk, we laugh and we are very kind to each other. He's been in our lives for such a long time now, I would like to marry him and become a real family.\"\n\nBut Asako has had to face the bittersweet reality that she is in love with someone who isn't real and who cannot love her back.\n\n\"I have told him [how I feel], but he told me to my face that he's with us because it's his job. It's very complicated,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm very aware that he's only with us because we're paying him.\n\n\"I sort of fantasise about our relationship, that maybe we can be a real family, but the relationship as it is actually helps me emotionally and mentally as well. It keeps me stable.\"\n\nIn fact, Asako has no plans to end the arrangement with Takashi and says she would like to carry on hiring him to play Megumi's dad indefinitely - even if that means sinking deeper and deeper into a world of fantasy and deception.\n\n\"The ideal situation is that she continues to think of him as her father,\" she says. \"So when she gets married I'd like him to be at her wedding ceremony, and when she has her own child, I'd like him to act as a grandfather as well. The worst case scenario is that my daughter finds out.\"\n\nAnd if Megumi's real father were to ever turn up?\n\nThat's not a possibility that Asako has ever really considered. As she hasn't had any contact with him since their divorce she feels it is unlikely - but if he did walk through the door one day, she thinks Megumi would choose Yamada over her real dad, because they have such a good \"father-daughter\" relationship. He is the ideal father, just as Asako hoped he would be.\n\nTakashi is also aware that the lie could continue to grow.\n\n\"This is one of the big issues of renting a family,\" he says. \"Megumi could get married in the future and then her husband would think I'm her father. If she then has her own child that means she'd believe I'm the grandfather of her child, and the stakes get bigger and bigger.\"\n\nAnd he has thought about how Megumi might feel if she finds out - though the plotlines he envisages might strike many as highly optimistic.\n\n\"In the best case scenario, I'd like to think that she might thank me for taking care of her - that is 80% of my imagination,\" he says.\n\n\"The other 20% thinks that she would be devastated. She might say, 'Why did you come clean? Why couldn't you just keep lying to me until the end?'\n\n\"I think I've been a big support in her life... Maybe asking her to thank me is a bit excessive, but at least I'd like her to recognise our service.\"\n\nMany might also find it hard to understand why Asako has chosen to do something which could be so distressing for her daughter, if she discovers the truth. Yet she stands by her decision.\n\n\"I know some people think it's foolish to pay money to lie to my own daughter and to have a pretend father, but I was desperate,\" she says.\n\n\"Anyone can understand that horrible feeling of desperation, to see your child so hurt.\"\n\nShe says she does worry about the potential impact on Megumi, but tries not to think about it.\n\nAnd she thinks this kind of thing happens more than you might imagine.\n\n\"My situation isn't unique. I'm sure there are loads more surrogate fathers and mothers out there.\"\n\nAll names have been changed to prevent Megumi uncovering the deception before her mother is ready to tell her\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhen a one-day-old baby, Paul Joseph Fronczak, was stolen from a Chicago hospital in 1964, the terrible story made headlines across America.

Despite this, the initial transaction was not reversed.\n\nAfter reporting the call to the police, Charlotte discovered her phone line was diverted on the day of the call, explaining why the bank believed they were speaking to her at her home address.\n\n\"I just feel really angry that someone's been able to do it that easily,\" Charlotte told Watchdog.\n\n\"The bank said that the person was in the home, they did the transactions from the home and they passed all the security questions correctly - and that's why they believed that I'd done it.\"\n\nImage caption Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern and lawyer Arun Chauhan\n\nCharlotte's case pre-dates a new voluntary code of conduct on such scams which most of the banks have signed up to.\n\nIn essence, the code says that if a customer - or the bank - has failed to heed warning signs, they will be liable for any subsequent loss.\n\nUnder the code, RBS would have been obliged to pay up.\n\nThe industry is still consulting on the issue, and the code is expected to be finalised next year.\n\nFraud lawyer Arun Chauhan told the programme: \"I have a lot of sympathy for Charlotte,\n\n\"You can hear what [the caller has] tried to do is put together two transactions for the full balance of the account and the bank just don't pick it up as a warning sign.\n\n\"They know at the end this is fraud, but they've done nothing about the first transaction and that's why Charlotte should be so critical of the bank.\"\n\nAccording to fraud prevention service Cifas, facility takeover fraud - when a fraudster abuses personal data to hijack someone's existing account or services - rose 7% last year to more than 24,000 reported cases.\n\nBank accounts remain the most targeted product for fraudsters, with more than 100,000 reported cases in the UK last year.\n\nThis is how the fraud on Charlotte was carried out:\n\nBank records show the fraudster initially calls the bank, posing as Charlotte, and asks for her account to be reset for security reasons. Staff follow the bank's usual security protocol and call Charlotte's landline number, unaware the call has been diverted to a mobile phone\n\nThe security reset is processed despite the caller answering a security question incorrectly. The caller then requests that more than \u00a34,300 should be transferred to another account and the bank allows the transfer\n\nDuring the same 23-minute call, the caller requests a second transfer of a similar amount is made to a different account. This time security questions are flagged as being answered incorrectly and the transfer is denied, but the bank does not ask for the original transfer to be recalled\n\nThe bank maintained that because it had called Charlotte's home phone number to verify her identity, it was clear she was aware of the transactions. Following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police, it was discovered that the fraudster had made a call to Charlotte's landline provider to fraudulently divert the number to a mobile phone number in a different part of the UK\n\nThe FOS warned banks earlier this year that customers should not automatically be blamed for money lost through scams.\n\nIt added that fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were because of customer carelessness.\n\nThe FOS aims to resolve issues for customers relating to financial services including bank accounts, insurance, loans, credit and debit cards and investments. Last year, it was contacted by more than two million people.\n\n'Fair and reasonable'\n\nA FOS spokesperson said: \"We have made it clear to the banks that it's not fair to automatically blame a customer when they've lost money due to a scam, especially given the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems.\n\n\"When we look at complaints, we have to carefully weigh up the evidence provided by both parties to decide what we think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.\n\n\"We're pleased that Charlotte's complaint has now been resolved, and she's got her money back. If you've been the victim of a scam, and you feel your bank should have done more to help, please get in touch with us.\"\n\nAfter being contacted by Watchdog Live, an RBS spokesperson said: \"We would like to apologise to Mrs Higman that the service provided fell short of the high standards we expect.\n\n\"On review of Mrs Higman's case, and in light of new information provided to us, we have refunded Mrs Higman in full for her loss.\"\n\nYou can watch BBC Watchdog on BBC One on Wednesday at 20:00 GMT and afterwards on iPlayer."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "US adviser hints at evicting China from WTO", "description": "One of President Trump's top advisers suggests there could be a case for \"evicting China\" from the WTO.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46280318", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04BC/production/_104421210_mediaitem104415724.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:00:02Z", "content": "Image caption Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers One of President Trump's top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for \"evicting China\" from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In a BBC interview, Kevin \u2026 [+3994 chars]", "fulltext": "Image caption Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers\n\nOne of President Trump's top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for \"evicting China\" from the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\nIn a BBC interview, Kevin Hassett chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers said China had \"misbehaved\" as a member of the WTO.\n\nHe also claimed that the US had been failed by the organisation.\n\nBut Mr Hassett said that what he called the President's hardball strategy on international trade is working.\n\nOn the WTO, President Trump's administration has taken an approach that many others see as disruptive.\n\nIt poses a significant challenge to the WTO's ability to settle disputes between member countries about alleged breaches of its rules.\n\nWhat is the WTO?\n\nThe World Trade Organization was established in 1995, when it took over from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which came into force in 1948\n\nBased in Geneva, it has 164 members which it says represents 98% of world trade\n\nIt deals with the rules of trade between nations and its purpose is to promote international commerce\n\nWTO agreements are lengthy but aim to stop countries discriminating against each other\n\nIt aims to reduce barriers to free trade such as tariffs or quotas\n\nCountries can also use the WTO to handle trade disputes\n\nA key element in the WTO disputes system is a body which considers appeals against initial rulings by dispute panels. The US has obstructed new appointments when members' terms expire and that is making it increasingly difficult for the body to function.\n\nDamage\n\nDr Hassett said the WTO played a very important historic role in helping modernise the world. But he also thought that it had failed the US in many ways.\n\nHe said the US generally wins the cases it brings to the WTO but \"it takes five or six years and then the damage is done\".\n\nHe said the WTO needs to be better able to deal with countries that don't obey the rules and are willing to lose at the WTO because the penalties are so low.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping met last year but are engaged in a trade war\n\nOne country has featured prominently in President Trump's trade agenda, and Kevin Hassett continued with that theme: \"We never really envisioned that a country would enter the WTO and then behave the way that China has. It's a new thing for the WTO to have a member that is misbehaving so much.\"\n\nRemoving China\n\nThe question he argued is whether that can fixed through bilateral negotiation, by reform of the WTO or even, by removing China from the WTO.\n\nThe last of those is a not official US policy. It was the final, least preferred, of three options that Dr Hassett listed and he expressed it as a question: \"Should we pursue evicting China from the WTO?\"\n\nIt might not even be possible. But it is a startling suggestion to hear from a senior figure in the US administration.\n\nIt is certainly in keeping with a general approach to international trade has been much more assertive- many say confrontational - than that of President Trump's predecessors.\n\nProtectionism\n\nIn his first two years he has imposed tariffs - import taxes - on steel and aluminium and on a swathe of goods from China. He pulled the US out of one trade agreement, the Transpacific Partnership, and embarked on the renegotiation of another, the North American Free Trade Agreement, (NAFTA), which concluded earlier this year.\n\nMany of President Trump's critics see much of this as protectionism.\n\nBut Dr Hassett says that President Trump wants to see barrier-free trade with every country on earth.\n\nHardball\n\nWhen he took office, the US had opened up to other countries \"no questions asked\". The US, he said, found itself in a situation where it has lower barriers to trade than its partners.\n\nHe said Presidents Clinton, Obama and the two Bushes had all wanted to improve that situation and had failed.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump came into the White House with what Dr Hassett called a very hardball strategy, but he said \"I think it is clearly working\".\n\nHe pointed to the replacement for NAFTA and said the US is in negotiations with virtually all its trading partners now. \"That's an enormous amount of progress\".\n\nHe didn't accept the idea that the new tariffs are bad for Americans. Another former economic adviser to President Trump, Gary Cohn, has described them as a tax on consumers\n\nDr Hassett said that on China specifically the tariffs have been designed to cause minimum harm at home and put maximum pressure on China.\n\nHe said that has been very effective and the Chinese are now coming to the table. He said he was very hopeful that President Trump and President Xi would have productive talks when they meet at the forthcoming G20 summit."}]
