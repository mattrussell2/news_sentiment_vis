said that Mr Bobbitt had used \"his last $20\" to help Ms McClure when her car broke down in 2017.\n\nMr Bobbitt remains in custody, and the couple were released pending a court date on 24 December.\n\nThe three face potential sentences of five to 10 years for the second-degree crimes.\n\nWhat was the original campaign?\n\nMr Bobbitt and the couple first came to prominence in November 2017 when Ms McClure launched a crowdfunding GoFundMe campaign, which, they said, was to re-pay the debt of a homeless man who came to her aid at the side of a road.\n\nA photograph of Ms McClure and Mr Bobbitt, a veteran and drug addict who had lived on the streets for several years, standing on the side of the road, fronted the fundraising campaign.\n\nMore than 14,000 people donated, many inspired by the story's details, such as Mr Bobbitt instructing Ms McClure to lock her car doors before he returned with a can of petrol.\n\nOfficials said on Thursday they believe the photo was staged after the three met previously when Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico visited a casino near an underpass where Mr Bobbitt spent time.\n\nImage copyright Burlington County Prosecutor's Office Image caption Kate McClure, Mark D'Amico, Johnny Bobbitt\n\nWhen did things go wrong?\n\nThe relationship between the three soured in August when Mr Bobbitt brought legal action against the couple, alleging they were using the funds as their personal \"piggy bank\" to fund an extravagant lifestyle.\n\nAfter exceeding their original fundraising goal of $10,000, they bought clothing and a new camper van for Mr Bobbitt, but later reportedly asked him to remove it from outside their property.\n\nMs McClure and Mr D'Amico told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money.\n\n\"Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,\" Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview in August.\n\nInvestigators claimed the three originally made up the story to make people feel bad and compel donors to contribute to a cause.\n\nWhat happened to the money?\n\nNet proceeds for Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico amounted to more than $367,000 (\u00a3287,000) and were spent on a car, holidays, high-end handbags and casino gambling, Mr Coffina said.\n\nThe prosecutor said that Mr Bobbitt received about $75,000 (\u00a358,000).\n\nIn thousands of text messages read by police, the couple had discussed financial woes, inability to pay bills and debts, and Mr D'Amico said he hoped to raise more money by pursuing a book deal about the story.\n\nExpressing sympathy for Mr Bobbitt's homelessness, the prosecutor nonetheless accused the veteran of being \"fully complicit\" in the campaign, promoting it in several media appearances and appearing in the original photograph.\n\nMr Bobbitt posted a similar story on Facebook in 2012 about helping a woman who had run out of petrol, officials say, but that \"full responsibility\" should be ascribed to all three.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the crowdfunding site Go Fund Me confirmed donors who contributed to the campaign would receive a refund.\n\nBy Georgina Rannard, UGC & Social News"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/15 22:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five

He jumped a burn and the gun went off, the bullet entering his nose on an angle and entering his head, where it remains to this day. Young Erik had to learn how to walk and talk again after that incident, but the miracle was that he survived.\n\nThe near-death of the boy who would grow up to be his dad. That was the first major episode on Willem Petrus Nel's eventful path to professional rugby, a path that has led him to his 25th cap for Scotland on Saturday against the county of his birth.\n\nIt'll be the second time he'll have played a Test match against South Africa and, if there were no split loyalties back in 2015 when he faced them first, there's certainly not going to be any when he faces them again.\n\n\"My life is here,\" the 32-year-old says. \"The year I moved to Scotland [2012], I lost my mum and so, apart from my dad, there's not really a huge amount connecting me to South Africa any more.\n\n\"I have two kids and they were both born here. I have another on the way. My daughter would definitely consider herself Scottish.\n\n\"My son really loves his grandpa, so he'd probably think of himself as South African. He's more into music than rugby and won't be all that fussed about who wins on Saturday. I just hope he remembers to cheer for his daddy.\"\n\nErik won't be at Murrayfield, but his son talks about him a lot. Even despite his accident at such a young age, Erik Nel grew up to become an athlete and had his heart set on running the Comrades, the storied 89km ultra-marathon on the roads and hills between Durban and Pietermaritzburg.\n\nIt never quite happened for him. He was required on the farm and that was that. Working the land was what he did until he retired, even though the effects of that hunting accident stayed with him. Nine years ago, he lost the use of an eye because of the damage done that day as a kid.\n\n\"Loeriesfontein is a very small town, about 300 people,\" Nel says. \"If you drove through it, you'd think it was almost like a ghost town.\n\n\"It's just farming country and that's where my dad is. We go back to see him whenever we can.\n\n\"He came over for the World Cup and it was his first time on a plane. He didn't like being up in the sky for so long with all that water under him. I'd love to get him over again, but he's happy where he is.\"\n\n'Tug-of-war was my first love'\n\nNel played three seasons for the Cheetahs in South Africa\n\nNel's career in rugby wasn't really supposed to happen this way. There are kids who grow up in South Africa and all they want from life is to get the ball in their hands and play. He wasn't one of those. At his high school, there were eight rugby teams and he started off as hooker in the bottom rung.\n\nHe was 17 and the sport that obsessed him wasn't rugby, it was tug-of-war. He was hell-bent on making the South African schools championships that season. Even when a supportive teacher spotted his talent with the oval ball and promised him a spot in the firsts, Nel told him that tug-of-war was his priority and there was no changing his mind on that.\n\n\"Oppies Opperman was the name of the man who first told me I had potential in rugby,\" he recalls. \"He turned me into a tight-head. To be honest, I wasn't that bothered, but he believed in me.\n\n\"I went away to university to study agriculture and played some club rugby, but there was no doubt in my mind from the age of 19 and 20 that I was going to back to the farm. And I was happy to go there.\"\n\nAfter university, he was persuaded to delay his return home and joined Western Province in Cape Town. After two years, he lost the contract that the current Springbok coach, Rassie Erasmus, helped him get.\n\n\"Western Province didn't want me at the end of that particular season and I thought: 'Oh well, I had a good run for somebody who wasn't even supposed to play rugby, I've had fun'.\n\n\"I phoned some rugby friends who'd really helped me along the way and said: 'Thanks for everything you've done for me, but I'm done and I'm off to the farm now'. And one of them said: 'Hang on, gimme two weeks, something might come up'.\"\n\nAnd something did come up - the Cheetahs, where he stayed for four years, and then Scotland, where he's been for the last six.\n\n'I was close to stopping after neck injury'\n\nNel has been playing for Edinburgh since 2012\n\nHis early months in Edinburgh weren't easy. A new country, a new team and then the bombshell from home that his mother had died just as she was planning a trip to see him. \"It's life, isn't it?\" he says. \"You just have to stand up.\"\n\nNel's reputation slowly grew. Here was a strong man with all the mobility you could want from a modern prop. He became an international player on the residency rule, starred in the World Cup in 2015 and, suddenly, everybody was talking about him.\n\nFrom relative obscurity to being picked in prospective Lions squads. Everything had opened up for him.\n\nThen, another crossroads. A bad neck injury took him out of the game for a year. He missed the Six Nations of 2017 and missed the Lions tour that followed it.\n\n\"I was close to stopping,\" Nel admits. \"If it wasn't for the surgeon who was so positive, I'd have been done.\n\n\"I was thinking 'this is the end', definitely. My contract was up soon. 'What am I going to do?' There was a lot going on in my head.\"\n\nNel made it back for Scotland's 2017 summer tour, played in all three Tests against Italy, Australia and Fiji and it's easy to recall his smile on that trip. It hardly ever left his face.\n\nHe found it hard to explain how good it all felt, but then, he didn't need to. His demeanour said everything.\n\nA few months later and another kick. In the autumn, he broke his arm and that cost him more time. \"The injuries, especially the neck injury, are a reality check,\" he says.\n\n\"You're not invincible, you're just human and you need to get out of his hole. My wife and kids were very good to me - it was so great to have them around.\n\n\"I'm in the church and have good connections and I got lots of positivity there as well. It's a Christian church. Faith is a big thing for me and it helped me a lot. It gave my family what we needed.\"\n\n'You need to have a couple of tricks'\n\nSouth Africa came from behind to defeat France 26-23 in Paris on Saturday\n\nAnd now he's facing South Africa again. \"It's almost like a second chance after the injuries,\" he says. \"It gets harder.\n\n\"My breakthrough year would have been 2015-16 and opponents didn't know me so well in the international game then. Your years after that become harder because people are spending times studying your weaknesses and they're coming looking to exploit those weaknesses and you must be ready for when they come.\n\n\"That's a new challenge and it's what rugby is all about. We know what South Africa are going to be like - big and powerful and dangerous. The scrums will be interesting.\n\n\"Does anybody know what happens in there? Referees don't know, definitely not. If you can paint them a good picture, they will give you the benefit of the doubt, but after that, it's just a guessing game.\n\n\"To be fair, if I was a referee, I'd just be guessing too. Both packs want to dominate and if it's just power against power then you go nowhere, You need to do something - you need to have a couple of tricks and hope that your tricks are better than their tricks.\"\n\nIt's to Scotland's advantage that whatever tricks Nel comes up with, he'll be conjuring in a blue jersey rather than the green and gold."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "England sweep aside US in Rooney's farewell match", "description": "Wayne Rooney's farewell appearance for England ends in a comfortable friendly victory over the United States at Wembley.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45174412", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/2978/production/_104361601_rooney-index.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:59:27Z", "content": "Rooney replaced former Manchester United team-mate Jesse Lingard in the second half England celebrated Wayne Rooney's final international appearance with a comfortable friendly win over the United States at Wembley.

If they lose, they will be relegated.\n\nRooney's special night\n\nFor all the mixed opinions evoked by the Football Association's decision to give Rooney a sentimental final run-out for his 120th cap, there appeared no doubt in the minds of the Wembley crowd that this was a worthwhile exercise.\n\nWhen the former England captain appeared before kick-off with his four children through a guard of honour formed by both teams to receive a presentation from FA chairman Greg Clarke and Harry Kane, it was the start of a genuine show of affection.\n\nAnd Rooney beamed in appreciation as he warmed up near the touchline when Liverpool youngster Alexander-Arnold - another Merseysider - drilled in his first England goal.\n\nThe DC United striker was given a standing ovation when the big moment arrived, and he came on for Lingard for that final 33-minute appearance.\n\nRooney, who has excelled in Major League Soccer, looked trim and fit as the crowd cheered his every move, willing him to produce one more special England moment.\n\nHe almost delivered the dream finale in stoppage time when only the outstretched right arm of Guzan stopped him adding a 54th goal to his all-time England record. And, agonisingly, he was just unable to stretch enough to meet a cross six yards out seconds later.\n\nRooney took the acclaim of the crowd at the final whistle as the curtain came down on his England career.\n\nGood night for Southgate and England\n\nEngland's night may have been partly ceremonial as Wembley paid that final tribute to Rooney, but it was also a night of serious business for Southgate.\n\nHe and his players needed to build on the momentum delivered by the superb win against Spain in Seville, which was one of the factors leading to the criticism this was effectively turned into a Rooney testimonial.\n\nSouthgate can certainly be satisfied with plenty of what he saw, albeit against a United States side that looked very poor, despite Christian Pulisic forcing a fine save from Jordan Pickford at 0-0.\n\nEngland, though much-changed, played with pace and there was certainly plenty to be encouraged by from the new-look side.\n\nSouthgate is now likely to select his strongest available side for what is a winner-takes-all final Nations League fixture here against Croatia on Sunday.\n\nCroatia inflicted a second successive defeat on Spain while England were winning here so the equation is clear cut - and the World Cup finalists have demonstrated once more what a dangerous side they can be.\n\n\"We knew tonight would be tough for Spain,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"Croatia have shown again their resilience, it sets Sunday up to be a very special tie. I'm sure whoever devised the Nations League is sitting smugly somewhere in Switzerland.\n\n\"We know not to underestimate Croatia, they have a huge lift tonight and the great thing is it sets up a brilliant game at the end of what has been a really exciting year.\"\n\nMan of the match - Trent Alexander-Arnold (England)\n\n'The players have taken on board Wayne Rooney's humility' - what they said\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate said: \"The players will have taken on board Wayne Rooney's humility, even after everything he has given to the game. He mucked in during training and worked hard in the five-a-sides and in the game he was tracking back.\n\n\"We've got really good competition for places and it was a good test for them. We've got a brilliant game to come now, this is what the Nations League is all about.\"\n\nEngland debutant and goalscorer Callum Wilson: \"There was a chance just before the goal when Trent Alexander-Arnold slid the ball in and I thought the chance might have gone because I saw Marcus Rashford on the side of the pitch warming up.\n\n\"But there was one last opportunity and I managed to get my foot around it, which is one of the hardest finishes, so I'm delighted it went in.\"\n\nMan-of-the-match Trent Alexander-Arnold: \"A dream come true, first game at Wembley and for my country. It was exciting and we want to show what we are made of.\n\n\"It's been exciting, looking back on Wayne Rooney's career, he was one of the best players for the country and it was good to share the pitch with him. As a Liverpool lad, it is good to show people in Liverpool that it is possible.\"\n\nWilson's Cherry on the cake - the stats\n\nEngland have won all three of their games against the US at Wembley, by an aggregate score of 7-0.\n\nEngland's starting XI had just 94 caps between them coming into this match - the last time they fielded a more inexperienced side was in May 1980 against Australia (46).\n\nThis was England's biggest home win since beating Scotland 3-0 in November 2016.\n\nThere were just 104 seconds between Lingard's opener and Alexander-Arnold making it 2-0.\n\nAt 20 years and 39 days, Alexander-Arnold became the youngest Liverpool player to score for England since Michael Owen against Luxembourg in September 1999 (19y 264d).\n\nWilson became the first Bournemouth player to score for England, and the first player to score on his debut for England since Marcus Rashford in May 2016."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Brexit deal: What do the other parties think of Theresa May's plan?", "description": "As the Tories squabble over the draft Brexit agreement, we hear the views of some of the other parties' MPs.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46230736/brexit-deal-what-do-the-other-parties-think-of-theresa-may-s-plan", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12DAA/production/_104362277_p06rx3mh.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:56:28Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Brexit deal: Is everything decided?\n\nThere\u2019s a deal but what does that mean and what still stands in the way of getting it done?

We seem pedestrian and don't go at teams.\"\n\nAlex McLeish's squad fly to Albania on Friday ahead of Saturday's match in Shkoder, with a home match against Israel at Hampden on Tuesday concluding their Nations League group games.\n\nJohnny Russell, the recalled Steven Fletcher, Oliver McBurnie and Matt Phillips are the other striking options in the party, with Steven Naismith and Leigh Griffiths both sidelined.\n\n'Let Robertson and Tierney switch positions'\n\nHearts legend Robertson, who won 16 caps for Scotland, believes McLeish should revert to a back four, play a deep-lying midfielder - \"maybe someone like Graeme Shinnie\" - in front of them, with \"five players with real energy further forward\".\n\n\"I would play either Paterson or the young lad McBurnie - a big, up-and-at-em striker - up front and with those four lads behind them, we have got more more than enough,\" Robertson, the Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager, told BBC Sportsound.\n\n\"As a nation, with the players we have got and the quality they possess, we have to go with a mind-set that we are going to be really positive and beat Albania.\n\n\"If we can find the right formula, give them the freedom to take the shackles off and just go at teams, there is no reason why the likes of Forrest, Christie, McGregor, Armstrong, John McGinn when he is fit, Paterson, Shinnie, plus Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney, can't cause problems for the opposition.\"\n\nRobertson has a novel solution to the conundrum - faced by previous head coach Gordon Strachan, who played Tierney at right-back, and now McLeish, who has deployed Tierney as a centre-back - of how to fit \"two outstanding players in the same position\" into the side.\n\n\"What is wrong with playing a back four and saying to them, 'Kieran, you are going to start the first 15 minutes at left-back, Andy, you are going to play forward a bit. Go at them for 15-20 minutes and when you've done that, drop back and let Kieran have a go',\" Robertson opined.\n\n\"They are both exceptional players in the last third going forward for Celtic and Liverpool, and they are both used to somebody playing in front of them. So when they drift inside and allow each other to go past, they can actually just switch over positions. One can have a rest at left-back for a little while the other one forages forward.\n\n\"They are both good defenders but both terrific in the last third of the pitch. So instead of playing the two of them out of position, why not play them both at left-back, but just one of them a bit further forward, and switch over when you're ready?\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Croatia 3-2 Spain: Home win means England can still advance in Nations League", "description": "Croatia gain a dramatic injury-time victory over Spain in their Nations League Group A4 tie - and keep alive England's hopes of winning the tournament.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46230421", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/EF8E/production/_104362316_croatia_goal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:50:17Z", "content": "Tin Jedvaj scored twice for Croatia - his first two goals for his country Croatia gained a dramatic late winner to beat Spain in the Nations League - a result which keeps alive England's hopes of winning the tournament.

She was always at all of my concerts, but she was my biggest critic. She's not with me anymore but she was my number one fan.\"\n\n'Boxing and playing in an orchestra are just the same'\n\nRankin's mum, who died of cancer in 2013, was not such an admirer of her interest in combat sports. She wanted her to protect her hands and preserve her musical ambitions.\n\nBut having taken up taekwondo as a child, the youngster graduated to Thai boxing before moving to London, and it was there that she was introduced to boxing.\n\n\"I started doing a little bit of boxing for fitness and I fell in love with it,\" she says. \"I did white-collar boxing to raise some money for charity, then the competitive instinct kicked in and I turned professional.\"\n\nAll the while, her music career was growing in tandem, playing with the London Sinfonietta at Festival Hall, and Swan Lake at The Coliseum with the St Petersburg Ballet Theatre.\n\nIndeed, once this fight is over, she will return to the UK to perform Hansel and Gretel, The Opera as part of a quintet.\n\nBut while those two worlds seem an odd juxtaposition, Rankin insists there are plenty of \"transferable techniques\".\n\n\"It's a similar adrenaline rush, and you've got to control the nerves and excitement and just enjoy the moment in both,\" she says. \"You've only got one chance to get it right on stage or in the ring.\n\n\"A classical music audience sit there nicely and listen, but once I get under the lights, it's the same scenario. It's you and your opponent, or it's you and the orchestra, you're a team or you're one-on-one.\n\n\"Whenever I tell anyone from the boxing family that I'm a classical musician, they all think I'm a little bit nuts.\n\n\"And some of the orchestra were concerned about my hands and my mouth, but I think they can really respect the level of dedication it takes to be at the top level in sport.\"\n\n'Becoming world champion would blow my brain'\n\nRankin's last contest was in New York in August, when she lost by unanimous decision to Alicia Napoleon for the WBA super middleweight title.\n\nThat was only her seventh pro fight and second in the US, with her previous bout being when she beat Sanna Turunen in Paisley in June to claim the WBC silver middleweight belt.\n\nThe Scot acknowledges she will be expected to lose to double Olympic champion Shields - who has been threatening to \"make her pay\" - but is relishing the opportunity.\n\n\"Coming in as the underdog takes a lot of pressure off me and puts it mainly on Claressa,\" says Rankin, who will find a quiet corner to \"chat\" with her mum before the fight.\n\n\"I've got an opportunity to win not just one, but three world titles - if you're going to do it, go big. Once it's over and I become champion, then I can think about everything else.\n\n\"I'm so proud to be going over to America to represent Scotland. No-one really understands how amazing a thing that is unless they've had a chance to do it.\n\n\"To be the first ever female in Scotland to have a world title would blow my brain.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "The battle of the Christmas adverts: what's the magic formula?", "description": "From John Lewis' tear-jerker to Iceland's palm oil campaign - what makes a great Christmas ad?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46223136", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C69D/production/_104354805_johnlewis.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:58:23Z", "content": "Image copyright John Lewis Image caption Sir Elton John stars in the John Lewis Christmas ad this year It's that time of year again - it might still be November but retail giants including John Lewis, Sainsburys, M&amp;S and Iceland have already unveiled thei\u2026 [+5053 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do people still care about Christmas ads?\n\nIt's that time of year again - it might still be November but retail giants including John Lewis, Sainsburys, M&S and Iceland have already unveiled their Christmas adverts.\n\nSo what's the secret to the perfect festive marketing campaign?\n\nFirst and foremost, a strong, emotional story makes a intoxicating ingredient for many Christmas adverts, says Elias Jahshan, editor of Retail Gazette.\n\nThis continues to be a common theme with John Lewis and Sainsburys both opting for heart-warming stories this year.\n\nJohn Lewis have drafted in Sir Elton John, with their advert tracing the pop star's musical career in reverse - right back to the day he got his first piano as a young boy.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the singer's enduring hit single Your Song plays in the background. (That also completes a bit of a musical circle as Ellie Goulding recorded a version of Your Song for the 2010 John Lewis Christmas ad).\n\nMeanwhile the Sainsbury's advert depicts a school Christmas show, following an eight-year-old girl who overcomes her nerves to deliver a knock-out performance.\n\nWhile it's not always immediately obvious how these adverts promote products, retail expert Clare Bailey argues an emotional connection can still drive brand loyalty.\n\nHowever, it's not the only tactic, as some retailers are less reticent about putting their products front and centre of their advertising campaigns - and Mr Jahshan argues traditional sales techniques can still be effective if done well.\n\nWaitrose's \"Too good to wait\" festive advert for 2018 shows a couple abandoning their kiss under the mistletoe to rush to a table laden with food items available from the store. And Marks & Spencer squeezes in a dizzying amount of products in its \"Must Have\" advert starring Holly Willoughby and David Gandy.\n\nMs Bailey says: \"If you look at the adverts from people like Marks & Spencer and Waitrose they're talking product, product, product.\n\n\"It's like 'hey our Brussels sprouts are better than Aldi's'. Whereas John Lewis is saying we're just nice people and we want to make you feel good.\"\n\nImage copyright Sainsbury's Image caption The latest Sainsbury's Christmas ad features children performing in a school production\n\nMr Jahshan says recruiting a big name can also create a feeling of excitement, calling the recruitment of Sir Elton is \"a huge win\" for John Lewis.\n\n\"It not only appeals to John Lewis' core consumer demographic, but it's also a clever marketing tactic given the #EltonJohnLewis hashtag the advert has now created,\" he says.\n\nThe BBC's arts editor and critic Will Gompertz agrees the \"national treasure\" is a smart choice and \"the embodiment of the retailer's values\".\n\nImage copyright John Lewis Image caption John Lewis' advert looks back at Sir Elton John's musical career, from stadium tours to school concerts\n\nBut Ellen Hammett, who covers retail for Marketing Week, points out that this approach could backfire.\n\n\"The concern is that it will be remembered as 'that Elton John ad' rather than being associated with John Lewis. Elton might see a spike in album sales though,\" she says.\n\nIt hasn't escaped notice that the pop star has a retirement tour scheduled for next year, while a film about his life, Rocketman, is also set to be released in 2019.\n\nOne advert that you won't be seeing on TV any time soon is Iceland's, which highlights the impact of palm oil on rainforests through the story of an orangutan whose home is destroyed.\n\nClearcast, the body that approves TV ads, said it wasn't approved because the film was made by environmental organisation Greenpeace and so breached political advertising rules.\n\nBut Ms Hammet says the advert has still been hugely successful after going viral on social media.\n\nImage copyright Iceland/Greenpeace Image caption Iceland's advert has had 13 million views on Facebook\n\n\"It's generated a huge amount of praise for a retailer that would otherwise probably have struggled to gain cut-through during the Christmas period,\" she says.\n\nHowever Mr Jahshan warns that if brands are going to get political in their adverts they need to back it up with action or risk being branded opportunistic.\n\nFor example Iceland has committed to remove palm oil from all its own-brand products by the end of this year.\n\nYou could be forgiven for missing the Christmas message in Iceland's ad - it doesn't have a particularly festive theme.\n\nBut does that matter?\n\n\"I think people want Christmas ads to feel at least a little bit festive. That's what's going to get them in that all important 'feel good' Christmas mood,\" Ms Hammet says.\n\nHowever she says Iceland's advert seems to be aiming to build support for the brand in the long-term rather than just over the festive period.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The John Lewis advert depicts the moment Sir Elton John received a piano as a gift from his grandmother when he was a young boy\n\nJohn Lewis's advert has also faced criticism on social media for being more about Elton John's life than the Christmas spirit.\n\nBut Will Gompertz says it still has enough festive charm to warm the hearts of the public.\n\n\"We learn that a piano is for life, not just Christmas - and music can change lives,\" he says.\n\n\"Not a bad message for Christmas.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Why is Canada running out of marijuana?", "description": "Supply problems in the month-old legal cannabis industry could last well into next year.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46200873", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10FA8/production/_104344596_hi049997232.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:56:18Z", "content": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Demand for legal cannabis is higher than expected in Canada Cannabis retailers in Canada began to run low on supplies from the very first day of legalisation a month ago.

If the government warehouse is empty, it's empty. There's nothing you can do.\"\n\nSince the first day recreational cannabis was legalised in Canada, there have been shortages.\n\nNewfoundland's Thomas Clarke was one of the very first retailers to sell the drug legally in Canada at the stroke of midnight on 17 October.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cannabis retailers across Canada experienced line-ups following legalisation\n\nHe says he sold out that day and was out-of-stock for nearly a week.\n\nClarke has since been able to get product onto shelves but says he can't order exactly what he needs from the provincial supplier.\n\n\"They're dictating to me numbers and quantities and products that they have to send me, so I definitely don't get to get everything I want,\" he says.\n\n\"But I've had just enough to not run out.\"\n\nIn Quebec, the provincially run Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise du cannabis stores are currently only open Thursday to Sunday due to supply issues.\n\n\"We think that our suppliers will be able to respond to the demand easily next spring, but until then, we could still have shortages,\" says spokeswoman Linda Bouchard.\n\nNew Brunswick briefly closed 12 of its 20 stores because of a lack of supply.\n\nIn a statement, the provincial agency responsible for cannabis sales said that while it had ordered a full supply to stock its stores it received just 20% to 30% of that original order.\n\n\"Retailers across the country are experiencing a similar situation,\" it said.\n\nIn Ontario, the online retail store has seen certain products sell out quickly followed by lengthy wait times for resupply.\n\nThe Ontario Cannabis Store says it's working to expand the assortment of products available and to ensure product availability.\n\nThe cannabis shortages aren't a complete surprise.\n\nA report released in early October by the CD Howe Institute, a Toronto-based economic think tank, estimates that the current legal supply will meet about 30% to 60% of total demand in the first months of legalisation.\n\nBut people in the industry say the scarcity is worse than expected.\n\n\"Everybody knew this was going to happen,\" says Burns. \"Probably, frankly, not this quick and this starkly.\"\n\nPatrick Wallace, owner of Waldo 420 in Medicine Hat, Alberta, predicts it will be a year to 18 months before supply matches demand.\n\n\"We're riding on our initial investment of stock from a few weeks back,\" he says. \"So we're OK now but it's not sustainable.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption As Canada makes cannabis legal, what happens to those with past convictions for possession?\n\nHealth Canada, which grants licenses to cannabis producers, says it worked hard in the months prior to legalisation to increase the number of legal suppliers, and is urging patience.\n\n\"It is important to note that October 17 marked the end of nearly a century of criminal prohibition of cannabis and the launch of an entirely new regulated industry in our country,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"As with any new industry where there is considerable consumer demand, we expect there may be periods where inventories of some products run low or, in some cases, run out.\"\n\nOn concerns the shortages will push consumers back to the black market, the federal government says that, going by experience from US states that have legalised the product, displacing the illegal suppliers will take time.\n\nThere have also been reports of shortages of medical cannabis, which has been legal in Canada since 2001.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Cannabis retailers are reporting shortages of certain strains and products across Canada\n\nHealth Canada says it is working with both patient groups and industry to discuss the reports of shortages of certain products or strains.\n\nIt added that it \"expects licensed sellers to take reasonable steps to ensure that registered patients continue to have access to the products they need for medical purposes\".\n\nThe Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit research foundation, released a poll indicating that one in eight Canadians has used cannabis since legalisation\n\nHealth Canada says producers have shipped more than 14,500kg (32,000 lbs) of dried cannabis and 370 litres (81 gallons) of cannabis oil to date and have a reported inventory of more than 90,000kg of dried product and 41,000 litres of oil.\n\nVic Neufeld, CEO of Aphria, one of Canada's biggest licensed producers, told the BBC's World Business Report that they have faced supply chain problems getting out of the gate.\n\n\"It's like a five-lane highway all merging into a one lane, [there are] a lot of issues when you try to push so much through the system in a very short period of time,\" he said.\n\nNeufeld said the company faced delays getting its excise tax stamps and there were other hurdles caused by a last-minute change to labelling requirements. And there was greater than expected demand.\n\nBut he also said they are waiting on Health Canada for various approvals that would allow them to \"move faster, be more nimble, more efficient\".\n\nNeufeld expects problems to be worked out by early 2019.\n\nWhile Burns concedes the current situation is not ideal for retailers, he predicts only temporary frustration.\n\n\"This is long-term thing,\" he says of his company's foray into the cannabis market.\n\n\"At the end of the day it'll be fine.

That goes to the identity of the man himself; he was a precocious talent at 15-16 and was too good for the youth team at Bologna. He was knocking on the first-team door and made his debut in Serie A.\n\n\"At Inter Milan, Mancini gave a chance to Mario Balotelli but with the Italy job, he is a very provocative manager and wants to reignite a debate of giving young players a chance in Italy.\n\n\"In September, he called up a player called Nicolo Zaniolo who had never made a single appearance in Serie A. It divided opinion, with people saying you should not give away the Italy shirt for nothing, you should have played 30-40 games in Serie A and in the Champions League before being called up.\n\n\"Then there are those who feel they should be rewarding talent regardless of the experience. Mancini wanted to flag up to Serie A managers that there is talent out there.\n\n\"Since Zaniolo has been in the squad, he made his Roma debut against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu, and made his Serie A debut away at Fiorentina. This is what Mancini is seeking to encourage.\"\n\nDeploying a fluid front three\n\nIs Brescia midfielder Sandro Tonali the new Andrea Pirlo?\n\nMancini has two wins from seven games with the Azzurri, but knows three points against European champions Portugal on Saturday will give them top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next summer's finals.\n\nHaving previously topped the Fifa charts, Italy dropped to their lowest ever ranking of 21st in August, but have since climbed two places to 19th.\n\nHorncastle added: \"Mancini has sprung surprises again by calling up a player called Sandro Tonali who plays for Brescia, like Andrea Pirlo did - and in the same position, with hair like him too.\n\n\"His reasoning for that is that he wants to see these players and spend as much time with them as possible.

I think MPs across my party who look at that deal will recognise the importance of delivering on the vote of the British people and recognise the importance of doing that in a way that does protect people's jobs, protect security and protect the unity of our United Kingdom.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks the PM if she \"in office, but not really in power?\"\n\nBut Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable suggested the prime minister was \"in denial\": \"The facts haven't changed.

The remaining members of the cabinet are absolutely behind this deal and what we need to do now is get behind the prime minister and get that deal sorted in the November (European) Council.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Google's Alphabet gives up on rescue robots", "description": "The technology giant will close its Schaft robotics division after failing to find a buyer.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46221252", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FEAB/production/_104359156_mediaitem104359153.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:37:29Z", "content": "Image copyright Google Google-owner Alphabet is giving up the development of bipedal robots after five years.

Pre-match, there was an elaborate light show and pyrotechnics, but that was as nothing compared to some of the stuff that unfolded as soon as the first whistle sounded.\n\nSouth Africa might be trying to evolve their game but at their core is a monstrous physicality and a gameplan to suffocate the life out of an opponent. That's how they started - and it brought them points.\n\nWith the Springboks in his face and no other option but to kick it away, Russell's clearance was gobbled up and the next time Scotland got their hands on the ball it was for the restart after Kriel's try, a score that was sparked by a marvellous break by Pollard with Embrose Papier running support along with Steven Kitschoff, that most mobile of loose-head props.\n\nPollard converted and the Boks had their lead. For 15 minutes they had a dominance that quietened Murrayfield. That didn't last long. Scotland's capacity to strike from deep is a joy and the try that brought them level was another pearler in a long list of pearlers.\n\nIt started inside their own 10m line, a move that swept left to Huw Jones whose audacious pass to Sean Maitland brought the entire stadium to its feet. Away went Maitland, taking the tackle from Papier and offloading brilliantly to Jones whose timing on to the pass took him away Damian de Allende. The centre ran on and put Horne in, his midfield partner himself running a brilliant support line.\n\nIn a word, glorious.\n\nPeter Horne scored a stunning opening try for Scotland, after brilliant play by Huw Jones (right)\n\nThe pity for Scotland is that they got turned over at the next ruck and when South Africa went wide the home team were stretched and Pollard had no trouble going over. The fly-half added a penalty soon after that made it 17-7 to the visitors. A time for Murrayfield to gulp hard.\n\nLaidlaw, who kicked magnificently all day, put over a difficult penalty to calm the Scots, a precursor to a gallus score that brought them level. Stuart Hogg got them in the position to strike with a run and kick and chase that Willie Le Roux had to put into touch five metres from his own line.\n\nFrom the line-out, deception galore. Scotland flung Ben Toolis in the air and Hamish Watson whipped round into the gap ahead of him, took the ball and drove over. The Springboks had been suckered.\n\nLaidlaw's conversion was good and it went 17-17, Pollard's boot inching South Africa ahead again just before the break.\n\nSpringboks' power proves enough\n\nScotland's problems were obvious. At the breakdown, the Boks were nailing them. Their ball was too disrupted and too slow. That had to change. What looked like a major moment came early in the new half when Le Roux was binned for a deliberate knock-on, but South Africa came through that ten minute period well.\n\nLaidlaw made it 20-20, but Pollard replied with another penalty. A 3-3 draw while Le Roux was off the pitch was not what Scotland were looking for. It might even have been worse. Pollard hit a post with another penalty and missed another one soon after.\n\nScotland had a chance to level it again, but instead of going for the posts on the hour-mark they went for touch and then got turned over on the floor. In the context of such a tight battle, it was a major call, especially when Jantjies, taking over form Pollard, boomed over a penalty from distance to give them a six-point cushion.\n\nA try was now required for Scotland to pull it out of the fire. They had a chance, too. South Africa played precious little rugby in the second half, relying instead on the power game and their defence to get them through.\n\nThat Scotland chance came by way of an attacking line-out 10m from the South African line, but the visitors defended it thunderously, snaffled ball, cleared their lines and won an absorbing Test match.\n\nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Huw Jones, Pete Horne, Sean Maitland, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw; Gordon Reid, Stuart McInally, Willem Nel, Ben Toolis , Jonny Gray, Sam Skinner, Hamish Watson, Ryan Wilson\n\nReplacements: Fraser Brown (for McInally, 56), Allan Dell (for Reid, 45), Simon Berghan (for Nel, 56), Josh Strauss (for Wilson, 56), Jamie Ritchie (for Skinner, 73), Ali Price (for Laidlaw, 63), Adam Hastings (for Horne, 68), Chris Harris (for Hogg, 63)\n\nSouth Africa: Willie le Rou x, Sbu Nkosi, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Aphiwe Dyantyi, Handre Pollard, Embrose Papier; Steven Kitshoff, Malcolm Marx, Frans Malherbe, RG Snyman, Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi (captain), Pieter-Steph du Toit, Duane Vermeulen.\n\nReplacements: Bongi Mbonambi (for Marx, 66), Thomas du Toit (for Kitshoff, 58), Vincent Koch (for Malherbe, 58), Lood de Jager (for Snyman, 60), Francois Louw (for Kolisi, 66), Ivan van Zyl (for Papier, 78), Elton Jantjies (for De Allende, 56), Cheslin Kolbe (for Nkosi, 64)."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Sri Lanka crisis: Brawl in parliament amid weeks of political turmoil", "description": "Fighting breaks out a day after a motion of no-confidence over the recently-appointed PM.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-46228483/sri-lanka-crisis-brawl-in-parliament-amid-weeks-of-political-turmoil", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8E36/production/_104360463_p06rwh5n.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:29:01Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nFighting broke out among lawmakers in Sri Lanka's parliament after weeks of political turmoil over who should lead the country.\n\nMPs rushed on to the floor of the house, a day after a motion of no-confidence was passed over the controversially-appointed new prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nAt least one MP was taken to hospital as punches were thrown and lawmakers from rival parties shouted at each other.\n\nEarlier in the session, the parliament's speaker said Sri Lanka now had no functioning government.

There's a broad range of objection, but these are some of their key complaints.\n\nFor the Brexit faithful, it all comes down to control. Esther McVey, one of two senior members of the UK government to quit because of the proposed deal, did so because it fails to \"regain control\" from Brussels.\n\n\"Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy... This deal fails to do this,\" she wrote.\n\nHer claim directly contrasts with what Theresa May said on Thursday: \"This deal... brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union.\"\n\nSo what exactly are the objections and how does the government defend them?\n\nMoney\n\nThis year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn. It has agreed to continue paying similar amounts until the end of the \"transition period\" - the time after Brexit Day on 29 March 2019 that both sides have set aside to agree a trade deal.\n\nThe payments will form part of the \"divorce settlement\" - expected to be at least \u00a339bn - which the UK has agreed to pay the EU to cover its financial obligations for leaving.\n\nThe transition period is due to end on the last day of December 2020, but it may not. The draft agreement leaves the option of it being extended - if a trade deal isn't sorted out. If the transition is extended, it can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nThis means a previous commitment by Theresa May that any extension would be for a \"matter of months\", cannot be guaranteed, especially as the decision to extend the transition has to be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.\n\nSo if the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU which will be agreed separately.\n\nHowever, supporters of the draft deal say once the UK leaves the transition period, its big annual payments will end. This is why the prime minister and her supporters claim the agreement allows the UK to regain control of its money.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nBorders\n\nDuring the transition period, freedom of movement rules apply, meaning EU citizens will be free to live and work in the UK and vice versa.\n\nOnce the UK exits transition, it will be able to set its own rules on immigration.\n\nThis is why the prime minster claims the UK will be \"taking back control\" of its borders and that the country will be ending free movement.\n\nBut if the transition period continues, so EU citizens will be able to carry on moving to the UK.\n\nLaws\n\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the gremlin here for many Brexit believers. It has the final say on disputes between people and governments on matters of EU law. Its opponents say the last word should always be with a UK court.\n\nMrs May agrees. Two years ago she declared: \"We are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.\"\n\nBut during the transition, the UK will have to follow all EU rules and abide by ECJ rulings.\n\nOpponents argue this leaves the UK as a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. And if the transition period is extended into a backstop, the ECJ's jurisdiction will also be extended.\n\nBut Mrs May's backers say the UK will be free of the ECJ once the transition is over.\n\nAnother objection, voiced by MP Mark Francois, is that under the agreement the UK has committed to keeping \"equivalent standards\" with the EU in employment, environmental and social policy. In effect, the UK \"would continue to take EU law\" says Mr Francois.\n\nFurthermore, if the backstop is triggered then disputes about putting the agreement into practice will be settled by an arbitration panel, consisting of people nominated by both sides. That panel must refer any matter which concerns the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ\n\nIndependent trade policy\n\nOnce the UK exits transition, and assuming the backstop isn't triggered, it will be able to implement any agreed free trade deals it strikes with other countries.\n\nIf the transition period is extended, that is the backstop is introduced, free trade deals will have to wait.\n\nAnd if the UK becomes a single customs territory, which is what would happen under the backstop, it won't be able to implement any deals on goods (but it will be able to do some deals it reaches on services).\n\nDeciding when the backstop comes to an end, will not only be up to the UK. It will also have to be agreed with the EU.

They've got plenty of other things to worry about other than Brexit. They want it sorted one way or another\n\nWhat will it mean for British citizens' freedom of travel and rights to live & work on the continent? Henry Covey\n\nDaniel Sandford, Home affairs correspondent replies:\n\nThe headline is freedom of movement ends after the transition period finishes in December 2020, but until then British citizens and their families will continue to have the right to move to live and work in the EU, and vice versa.\n\nThose who take up residence before the end of the transition period will be allowed to remain beyond transition and, if they stay for five years, will be allowed to remain permanently.\n\nHowever, once the transition period is over, the draft agreement does allow the EU to require UK citizens who stay on to apply for a new residence document.\n\nWill the UK be free to make trade deals with other countries? Peter Hodge\n\nAndrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies:\n\nThe full answer is complicated. The short answer is: it looks like it would be difficult.\n\nFirst let's suppose we do end up activating the Northern Ireland backstop. That involves what the draft agreement calls a Single Customs Territory for the UK and the EU, which appears to be a customs union in all but name.\n\nIn particular it says: \"Under no circumstances may the United Kingdom apply to its customs territory a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff (applied by the EU) for any good or import from any third country.\"\n\nThat rules out the bread and butter of trade agreements, negotiating the reduction or elimination of tariffs. It might still be possible to do deals on services and also investment, which is an area that has often been added on to trade agreements.\n\nIf the backstop is not activated, then it depends on the shape of the agreement on the long-term relationship, which would be negotiated during the transition period.\n\nWe have an outline of the political declaration intended to guide those negotiations, which says the ultimate deal should \"build on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement\".\n\nOn the face of it, that could run into the same difficulties as the backstop in terms of trade deals with other countries. If, however, it drops the prohibition on applying tariffs lower than the EU's, we would be in a position to negotiate conventional trade agreements with other countries.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nWhat does the deal say about services, specifically regulations on UK financial services? Is there equivalence? Schwitt, London\n\nAndrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies:\n\nThis is a question for the long term rather than the Withdrawal Agreement. The outline political declaration doesn't make a general commitment that there will be equivalence granted but it does refer to it. The EU and UK can take \"equivalence decisions in their own interest\".\n\nThe document calls for assessments of equivalence to start as soon as possible after Brexit and be completed by the end of the transition period.\n\nBut I would emphasise this. It is just an outline to guide negotiations, not a definitive statement of where they will end.\n\nI am a UK national, living and studying within the EU, what impact would this have on me? Paul Blow, studying in Venlo in the Netherlands\n\nSean Coughlan, Education correspondent replies:\n\nThe future status of UK students in the EU and EU students in the UK still remains uncertain.\n\nUp to 2020, and during the transition period, not much would be expected to change. But the longer-term arrangements, about levels of tuition fees and access to student loans, have still to be decided.\n\nAt present, EU and UK students are treated the same for fees in each other's countries - which has seen some UK students going to university in low-fee countries such as the Netherlands. But it will have to be negotiated whether there will be any reciprocal deals to replace this.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nWill the EU still have access to UK waters and fish stocks? Stephen Knox\n\nChris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies:\n\nOne policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing.\n\nThat's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial.\n\nThe draft agreement simply states that \"the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify\" an agreement \"on access to waters and fishing opportunities\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When will Brexit happen?\n\nWill the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) continue to have the same validity for UK citizens visiting the EU as is currently does?

After a brief mid-term interlude that included dire warnings about refugee caravans in Mexico and mix-and-match endorsements of Republican candidates, the looming Russia investigation is back on the president's mind - and his Twitter feed.\n\nMr Trump may simply be reflecting the growing sense that Mr Mueller is poised for new action after a pre-election quiet period. Rumours and reports have swirled of impending indictments and late nights at the special counsel's office.\n\nThere's also the possibility that the president knows something new - either passed along from his lawyers or allies under investigation, or from his newly appointed acting attorney general, who the New York Times referred to in September as the White House's \"eyes and ears\" in the justice department.\n\nWhatever the explanation, Mr Trump has appeared in a sour mood of late, lashing out at the media and, according to background sources, considering changes to his top staff. There is the feeling in Washington of an impending storm, of threats to the presidency from the outside and within.\n\nIt's been a quiet few days, but that seems certain to change.\n\nIt comes just a week after the US president forced the resignation of Jeff Sessions, the US Attorney General who was an early supporter of Mr Trump.\n\nMr Sessions had earlier voluntarily removed himself from the Russia probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nFollowing this decision, Mr Trump told the New York Times: \"Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.\"\n\nMr Sessions' replacement in charge of the Department of Justice, Matthew Whitaker, now has the power to sack Mr Mueller or end the investigation.\n\nMr Whitaker, who has been appointed acting attorney general, has been open about his concerns over the scope of Mr Mueller's inquiry.\n\nWhat is behind the Russia investigation?\n\nIn 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nA team of investigators led by Mr Mueller is looking into whether anyone from Mr Trump's campaign colluded in the effort.\n\nIt has been established that senior members of Mr Trump's team met Russian officials, while several of these meetings were not initially disclosed.\n\nThe president's son, Donald Trump Jr, met a Russian lawyer during the campaign who was said to have \"dirt\" on Mrs Clinton, and adviser George Papadopoulos has admitted lying to the FBI about meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.\n\nFour people connected with Mr Trump's campaign and presidency have been charged and further indictments could be issued.\n\nHowever the US president denies any wrongdoing and no solid evidence has emerged to implicate him."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Man denies inviting girls into house in Sanquhar", "description": "The 63-year-old also pleads not guilty to offering to supply the under 13s with alcohol in a south of Scotland town.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-46220795", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/74222000/jpg/_74222639_sheriffcourt004.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:36:36Z", "content": "A 63-year-old man has denied offering to supply two young girls with alcohol in return for their underwear.

How did he slip through the net?\n\nOn the face of it, Ian Naude was an ideal police candidate.\n\nA former machine gunner with the Royal Irish Regiment, he said he wanted to make a difference at Cheshire Constabulary.\n\nThe reality, his trial was told, is that he joined the force to meet vulnerable young girls and have sex with them.\n\nAnd as jurors were played the film he made while raping a 13-year-old girl in the back of his car, they too were convinced that motive rang true.\n\nThe opportunities to stop him, however, were there before he was given in the words of prosecutors, \"the keys to the sweetshop\".\n\nNaude, 30, had been vetted in October 2016 and given the all clear to join as a student officer in the new year.\n\nBut when a complainant told Staffordshire Police in February 2017 she had been raped by Naude - and that he had applied to be a policeman- his recruitment was delayed while the neighbouring force investigated.\n\nWhen no further action was taken, the father-of one took up his position in the April. Seven months later, he had groomed, assaulted and raped a young girl.\n\nImage copyright Cheshire Police\n\nIt was while detectives investigated her allegations that Cheshire Police came to realise Naude had slipped through the net.\n\nAs his conduct came under scrutiny, it emerged he had also been named as a suspect to Staffordshire Police in January 2017 for sexual activity with a child.\n\nThe same month, the West Mercia force also received an allegation he was persistently asking a girl on social media to meet him.\n\nCheshire Police was not made aware of either probe because at the time, the forces weren't aware he was due to become an officer.\n\nHis details had been added to the Police National Computer, but as there is no obligation under the national Vetting Code of Practice to have him re-vetted, the information did not come to light.\n\nIt was, however, while on duty as a serving officer in October 2017 that he met his victim.\n\nHe had been called to deal with a domestic incident at her home - ending up in her bedroom where she showed him her belly button ring, the court heard.\n\nLater, he tracked her down on Facebook and sent her sexual messages and images, asking her to \"call me daddy\".\n\nImage copyright Cheshire Police\n\nHe claimed it was \"just a turn-on\". His victim, meanwhile, told police, \"he's not my dad so I don't know why I'd do that\".\n\nThree days later, he returned to the house, waited until her mother was out, and drove her down a quiet country road, where he raped her.\n\nHe told the court his victim, who he filmed and photographed during the attack, \"seemed to be enjoying it\".\n\nHis defence was that she gave consent. In reality, the girl was traumatised and told her parents.\n\nIn addition to the victim's account, police officers found Naude had contacted girls through a fake Facebook profile he made towards the end of his career in the army, where he had served in Afghanistan.\n\nAs \"15-year-old Jake Green\", he targeted children online, persuading them to undress and perform sex acts on camera.\n\nIn return, he would send them images and videos of himself masturbating.\n\nImage caption Acting chief constable Janette McCormick said it is investigating further possible offences by Naude\n\nCheshire Police has admitted it missed an opportunity to spot Naude's perverted behaviour.\n\n\"He joined the force as anybody else would join, through the selection processes, through the screening processes, through the national vetting processes,\" said acting chief constable, Janette McCormick.\n\n\"Between passing those processes and joining the force, there were offences he committed which didn't come to light in that vetting process and that meant that he was employed within the force as a student officer.\n\n\"There were investigations, there were specific issues in relation to those investigations that were difficult, there were pseudonyms that were used that meant we didn't link him to going through the recruitment process in the force.\n\n\"He didn't join to be a police officer, he joined to be a predator.\"\n\nMs McCormick believes he acted alone but added: \"I would be naive to think there are not other people within the force and that's why we have to be active in looking at that behaviour so we can root it out.\"\n\nThe Independent Office of Police Conduct said it investigated Cheshire Police's vetting of Naude and \"did not find a case to answer for misconduct for any individual officer\".\n\nBut the force said the case had made it look \"long and hard\" at its recruitment and screening process.\n\n\"The national... Vetting Code of Practice states that there is no time frame as to when somebody is vetted before joining a police force,\" a statement added.\n\n\"However, Cheshire Constabulary has now changed its vetting processes.\n\n\"If there is a delay in the recruitment process of more than three months, once a person has been vetted, the force will carry out further checks on the national police systems.\n\n\"Furthermore, checks on the national police systems and complaints records of all officers who are reaching the completion of their probation period of two years are now undertaken.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Charles Piutau: Bristol Bears full-back not fazed by 'highest-paid in Premiership' tag", "description": "Bristol Bears' Charles Piutau says being labelled as the highest-paid Premiership player does not worry him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46224146", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/CC79/production/_104354325_charlespiutau.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:56:28Z", "content": "Since moving to Ashton Gate, Charles Piutau has made two Premiership Rugby Cup appearances Bristol Bears full-back Charles Piutau says he is not worried about the pressure of being labelled as the Premiership's highest-paid player, ahead of his debut in the c\u2026 [+1102 chars]", "fulltext": "Since moving to Ashton Gate, Charles Piutau has made two Premiership Rugby Cup appearances\n\nBristol Bears full-back Charles Piutau says he is not worried about the pressure of being labelled as the Premiership's highest-paid player, ahead of his debut in the competition.\n\nHaving recovered from a shoulder injury, the 27-year-old is set to start at home to Exeter Chiefs on Sunday.\n\nAfter his switch from Ulster, Piutau is reportedly on almost \u00a31m per year.\n\n\"If I worry about any of these tags or pressure, I won't play to the best of my ability,\" he told BBC Points West.\n\n\"I enjoy this game and just want to go out and have fun.

Following the Labour line and expressing concern about the implications for devolved nations of not respecting referendum results.\n\nToday his tone was markedly different.

He wants the club to play matches on a Saturday night. And he wants the Scottish Premiership side to return to the latter stages of European competitions.\n\nIn this interview, Cormack tells BBC Scotland about bringing American kids to Scotland, swelling manager Derek McInnes' budget through commercial deals, and getting bored of being on a Florida beach.\n\n'American clubs want to bring kids to Aberdeen'\n\nSoccer is growing exponentially among the younger generations in the United States and Cormack wants Aberdeen to seize upon that.\n\nHe says he has met people through business who have intimated an interest in coming over to play golf and \"would kind of like to be involved\" at the club.\n\nFurthermore, he is exploring affiliating with \"20 to 30\" soccer academies - something he says could raise up to \u00a32m a year through them buying Aberdeen kit.\n\n\"It's not that Man City or Man United or Barcelona don't do it, but with them they are just a number,\" Cormack explains. \"We can bring something tangible.\n\n\"There is the appetite to bring kids to Aberdeen in the summer - 200 kids, two-week stints - where they get an experience of training in a professional environment, and we let them see the sights and sounds of the north east.\n\n\"Not everything is going to work, but I learned a long time ago, if you are going to fail, fail fast and learn quickly, and if you don't try you are never going to succeed.\"\n\nSummer football & Saturday night games\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Watch: Mackay-Steven scores terrific winner\n\nEarlier this month, Cormack invited one of the owners of MLS club Philadelphia Union - Richie Graham - to give a presentation to the Aberdeen board.\n\nManager Derek McInnes and his staff were also there and the talk centred on how a club such as Union or Aberdeen can compete with more moneyed rivals.\n\nCormack points to commercial deals which, in the last seven months, have enabled the club to put an extra \u00a3750,000 into the playing budget. And he believes that figure can be swelled further by catering more to the fans.\n\nSummer football, Saturday night kick-offs and a good customer experience at the stadium are all on his agenda.\n\n\"I think we can do a lot better,\" says Cormack, who has established that the average Aberdeen fan is a 39-year-old male.\n\n\"Businessmen and leaders in the States aren't any better than we have in Scotland, but the difference is that there is a can do attitude.\n\n\"The leaders over there in my software business will give us 10 reasons why something can be done, and maybe nine of them are useless but there is always a gem. Here its 'ach, that'll never work', but we need to explore these things.\n\n\"The principle has to be 'is this the right thing for the fans?' and how we entertain them and look after them.\"\n\n'Why can't we be guaranteed group-stage football?'\n\nSince arriving as a non executive director, Cormack has invested heavily in Aberdeen, both in terms of time and money.\n\nBut now the 59-year-old is keen to influence the wider Scottish game - starting with merging the SPFL and Scottish FA and having a single body run the professional game and another deal with the semi-professional, amateur and youth side.\n\nThe status quo has led, in his opinion, to \"mediocrity\" and that clubs must \"strive for more\" and that attitude extends to the European game, too.\n\nAberdeen took Burnley to extra time this season before being knocked out in the Europa League qualifiers\n\nCormack believes the Scottish game should not be \"sitting back and taking the crumbs off the table\" at a time when Uefa are considering the creation of a third club competition, and when some of the game's biggest clubs are discussing a possible European super league.\n\n\"Teams like Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs should have exposure to European football, and not just a qualifying round here or there,\" he says.\n\n\"Why can't we be 'guaranteed' some kind of group-stage football if we finish second, third or fourth in the league? What is wrong with trying to promote a Europa League or Champions League for teams that have turnover of \u00a320m or less, with clubs from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Greece, Turkey and Scotland?\n\n\"Let Barcelona, let Real Madrid knock themselves out on their own. I just think we need to be pushing that agenda. Nobody else is going to fight our corner like we will.\"\n\n'I got bored being on the beach'\n\nSeventeen months after returning to Aberdeen, where he had a stint as interim chief executive in 2000, Cormack says he is now in it for the long term and for reasons that are about more than simply football.\n\nSpending too long at his beach house in Florida made him hanker for the challenge of working in Scottish football and he was drawn back to his home town.\n\nHis work so far has focused on the commercial side, but his personality is such that his portfolio will likely expand.\n\n\"After six months of getting a great sun tan and walking the beach, I kind of got bored,\" he says. \"My wife and I are both from Aberdeen, with lots of family here, so we are blessed to be able to come back and forth.\n\n\"As long as I feel I am adding value to what we are doing and what we are trying to achieve then I am happy to be around.\n\n\"It's not just about the club, it is about the city, and giving something back because the city gave us a lot.

Whether it is the rising amounts spent on player wages, agents' fees, and managerial pay-offs, and controversy over a possible 'Big Six' breakaway, the proposed 39th game, ticket prices for away supporters, and clubs not paying staff a living-wage, to some the game resides in a bubble.\n\nBut rarely before has there been outrage from fans quite like the one sparked by Scudamore's \u00a35m pay-off.\n\nPerhaps that is partly down to the timing.

numbers of extreme wildfires could result in a significant increase in CO\u2082 emissions, scientists warn.\n\nThat could mean attaining the Paris climate agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C could become harder, they say.\n\nPresent emission-cut pledges by countries are projected to increase the average global temperature rise by more than 3C by the end of the century.\n\nThat would lead to dangerous climate change impacts, experts say.\n\nThese include sea level rise, drought, wildfires, among other extreme events.\n\n\"We can't neglect the emissions from wildfires,\" says Ramon Vallejo, a scientist specialising on fire ecology with the University of Barcelona.\n\n\"Particularly now that we are seeing intense wildfires all around the world.\"\n\nEstimates and uncertainties\n\nAlthough estimates vary and still carry uncertainties, some experts say wildfires account for up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey are estimated to increase by a few percent to roughly 30% by the end of this century depending on how the climate changes.\n\n\"It is a double whammy,\" said William Lau, atmospheric scientist with Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\n\"Big forest fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Raab: 'Major and fatal flaws' in PM's plan", "description": "Dominic Raab, who has resigned as Brexit secretary, says a change of course on Brexit is needed.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46224446/raab-major-and-fatal-flaws-in-pm-s-plan", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13F3D/production/_104352718_p06rvh8g.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:14:26Z", "content": "Video In his first post-resignation interview, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg a change of course on Brexit is needed.", "fulltext": "Brexit deal: Is everything decided?\n\nThere\u2019s a deal but what does that mean and what still stands in the way of getting it done?

He hit Moeen Ali down the ground for six and punished an increasingly ragged England alongside Akila Dananjaya, who made a fluent 31 off 39 balls before falling lbw to Moeen.\n\nAdded to Karunaratne and Dhananjaya's patient partnership of 96 in the morning, this was comfortably Sri Lanka's best day of the series.\n\nEngland did not bowl particularly badly but their spinners were inconsistent, producing too many bad balls between the unplayable ones and allowing the hosts to alleviate the pressure.\n\nStokes and Rashid's magic moments\n\nBen Stokes pulled off an excellent run-out followed by a one-handed catch\n\nEngland were laboured in the first hour of the day, their spinners bowling too full and taking only the wicket of nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara to show for their toil as he heaved Moeen to mid-wicket.\n\nYet with Karunaratne and Dhananjaya smoothly accumulating, Stokes produced two pieces of fielding brilliance.\n\nFirst, Dhananjaya guided towards point and set off. Stokes swept in to gather, throw across his body and hit the one stump he had to aim at, with Karunaratne two yards short.\n\nThe all-rounder then took a stunning one-handed catch to his left at slip as Leach removed Kusal Mendis for the third innings in a row.\n\nRashid put the hosts in further trouble after lunch with a fine spell of 2-19 from 10 overs.\n\nThe leg-spinner found bite and bounce to have Dhananjaya caught behind before an equally exquisite delivery drew Angelo Mathews forward, with the impressive Ben Foakes taking a fine catch at the second attempt behind the stumps.\n\nRashid finished with 3-75, returning to end Roshen's resistance as he picked out Moeen at mid-on.\n\nWait, didn't England score 285?\n\nThey did. But the tourists were awarded five penalty runs following a bizarre moment in Sri Lanka's innings.\n\nRoshen cut Leach towards the boundary and, thinking he had picked up four, did not ground his bat at the non-striker's end after jogging through for the first run.\n\nHowever, Moeen prevented the boundary and Roshen set off back to the striker's end from a yard outside the crease.\n\nUmpire Marais Erasmus declared a dead ball and gave England five penalty runs, ruling Roshen had deliberately run short, perhaps believing he had done so to guarantee he maintained the strike.\n\nRoot later received an official reprimand for showing dissent after shaking his head and kicking the turf when Erasmus turned down Moeen's appeal for a bat-pad catch against Perera.\n\n'England need to be disciplined' - analysis\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social\n\nEngland will be aggressive on day three. They will look at the likes of Sam Curran and Jos Buttler's innings but I hope they take a leaf out of the book of Curran, who was disciplined early in his knock.\n\nIf they come out and play their shots, they could lose two or three wickets quite quickly.\n\nThere is nothing about the Sri Lanka spinners which should worry England too much - they don't have a Muttiah Muralitharan or Shane Warne - but the tourists do have a collapse in them.\n\nThey should have it within them to bat a decent number of overs and then it's over to Sri Lanka.

Given that two members of the cabinet have resigned on the basis that the proposals put at risk our Union I want to urge you in the gentlest and strongest terms to follow suit.\"\n\n'Incredible job'\n\nMr Thomson also stressed that he believes Mr Mundell is a \"great Secretary of State\" who is doing an \"incredible job\", and said he would \"support you in whatever you decide\".\n\nMr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson warned Mrs May last month that they could not back any deal that \"delivers a differentiated settlement for Northern Ireland\", fearing it would be a political gift to the SNP and could fuel the case for Scottish independence.\n\nThe Scottish government has argued that the deal would effectively allow Northern Ireland to remain in the single market while Scotland has to leave - giving it a competitive advantage that would be \"devastating\" for Scottish jobs and investment.\n\nIt has said it will hold a symbolic vote on the proposals in the Scottish Parliament before a vote takes place in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments have also asked the UK government for face-to-face talks over the agreement next week.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister gave a statement on the draft agreement to the House of Commons on Thursday mornig\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood that Mr Mundell and Ms Davidson would both now resign if they had any \"backbone\", and reiterated that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would vote against the deal.\n\nScottish Labour MP Ian Murray said it was now clear that the Conservatives \"are as big a threat to the integrity of the UK as the SNP\".\n\nHe added: \"This Brexit deal has zero chance of getting through parliament and it is now imperative that the prime minister offers the public a People's Vote with the option of remaining in the EU.\"\n\nThere are major doubts over whether Mrs May can convince enough MPs in the House of Commons to support her Brexit plan, and there have been suggestions some Tory MPs could try to force a no-confidence vote.\n\n'National interest'\n\nMrs May told the Commons on Thursday morning that, as prime minister of the United Kingdom, she has a \"responsibility to people in every part of our country and I intend to honour that promise\".\n\nAnd she described the draft deal as a \"decisive breakthrough\" in the Brexit negotiations as she urged MPs to \"consider the national interest and give it their backing\".\n\nMrs May warned: \"Voting against a deal would take us all back to square one. It would mean more uncertainty, more division, and a failure to deliver on the decision of the British people that we should leave the EU.\n\n\"If we get behind a deal, we can bring our country back together and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.\"\n\nWhy is David Mundell not resigning?\n\nAnalysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland correspondent\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sources told the BBC earlier this year that Mr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson would resign if Northern Ireland was given a different deal to the rest of the UK\n\nGiven that Ms Davidson and Mr Mundell effectively threatened to resign over any deal that introduces different arrangements for Northern Ireland why are they not now considering their positions?\n\nLast night Mr Mundell seemed to interpret the deal rather differently from some of his cabinet colleagues, saying: \"I was content to move to the next stage... on the basis that arrangements for Northern Ireland will not undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK.\"\n\nHow does he square that with the warnings from Mr Raab and Ms McVey that the deal threatens the integrity of the UK?\n\nOther members of the Scottish Conservative parliamentary team say they want more clarification from the PM on the Union and on future arrangements for the control of UK fishing rights. But many are likely to back the deal.\n\nThe SNP have consistently argued they want Scotland to remain a member of the EU single market and customs union even if the rest of the UK leaves.\n\nThe UK government maintains it would not be possible to have different arrangements for Scotland while it remains part of the UK.\n\nThe worry from Scottish unionists is that allowing a separate regulatory regime for Northern Ireland undercuts that argument and allows the SNP to demand separate arrangements for Scotland.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday, the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, said the prime minister was \"in a mess of her own making\".\n\nAnd he insisted the choice facing the country was not between \"Mrs May's way or no deal at all\".\n\nHe said voting down the Brexit agreement in the House of Commons would give the government 28 days to come back with a set of alternative proposals.\n\nThese could include renegotiation, single market and customs union membership, staying in the EU, a general election or a second referendum on the Brexit terms.\n\nMr Russell said he believed the option of remaining in the EU - which the PM herself mentioned in a statement outside Downing Street after her cabinet meeting - was still \"on the table\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Ilford crossbow killing: April 2019 trial date set", "description": "Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo is accused of murdering heavily pregnant Sana Mohammed at her home.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46219653", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E36/production/_104303811_050583126.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:40:01Z", "content": "Image caption Sana Muhammad died in hospital on Monday A man accused of shooting dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow may face trial next year.

The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as \"very positive for business\" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG.\n\nNorthern Ireland also has the guarantee of a \"friction-free\" customs border with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: \"There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal.

But she added: \"There was that very disturbing period when the British Cycling independent review had to be conducted and concerns about the voice of athletes being heard, growing awareness that the athletes' voice wasn't being heard in sports and needed to be heard.\n\n\"There was a period that felt very uncomfortable.\"\n\nNicholl, who will step down next summer after eight years, added: \"But what I'm proud of is that we responded by doing the right thing in a number of areas of work that we've taken on board and activated - not least, cultural health checks are now conducted across all the sports to drive positive change and be athlete focused on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nSpeaking about Varnish's lawsuit - with a hearing scheduled for 10 December - Nicholl denied it had played a part in her decision to step down, but said: \"We will learn from this regardless of whether we win or lose.\"\n\nIf Varnish's lawyers successfully argue that she should have had employee status, the case could have major ramifications for all contracted British athletes who are funded by UK Sport.\n\nUK Sport might have to pay Varnish backdated pension and national insurance costs. This is currently avoided because athletes are not regarded as members of staff. Other athletes might then pursue legal action themselves.\n\n\"Our approach to supporting athletes has been similar to a student grant - a performance award that enables them to train - with no pay-back from that,\" said Nicholl.\n\n\"There are other professional sports that actually have central contracts so there are two ways of doing this. The test of this case is whether the way Jess was supported constituted an employment status, so whatever the outcome we will review - as part of our future strategy - how we best support athletes and our relationship with athletes.\n\n\"Obviously we may be forced to change some things but regardless of that we will absolutely look at what is the best relationship we can have that's right for them and for the system of public funding to get the best results in the future.\"\n\nOverseeing a period of success\n\nHaving joined UK Sport three years after Britain picked up just one gold medal at the Atlanta 1996 Olympics, Nicholl oversaw Team GB's record haul of 67 medals at Rio 2016 - 27 of which were gold.\n\n\"We can see elements of what we do that can be even better,\" she said.\n\n\"We won't be first in the medal table in 2024 as the gap between us and the US is enormous, but we have more sports now that know how to win medals and more sports that know how to win gold medals.\"\n\nA number of sports have lost UK Sport funding for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, including badminton, archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby. That has been largely driven by a fall in the National Lottery money available to the agency, with fewer people playing it.\n\nCycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than \u00a34m to \u00a325.98m.\n\n\"After Rio there were more sports that had no funding,\" said Nicholl. \"Our board then said this for us is the tipping point, it can't be any deeper than that. Even to fund the sports we are funding now we have to have a government underwrite it.\"\n\nUK Sport recently launched a \u00a33m Aspiration Fund in a bid to help more athletes compete at the Tokyo Games who compete in unfunded sports, including skateboarding and surfing, which will make their debut in 2020.\n\nNicholl said the fund was a \"pilot\", adding: \"We will learn from it, whether it can be embedded into a future strategy.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Retail sales see slide in October", "description": "The 0.5% fall last month defied expectations of a 0.2% increase as consumers put their wallets away.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46219340", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8A42/production/_104349353_gettyimages-976863628.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:40:32Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Retail sales fell 0.5% in October, missing economists' expectations of a 0.2% rise by a wide margin.

The village administrator quietly said they were all \"terrorists\".

It includes a commitment to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons in the EU to continue living, working and studying.\n\nThere is also a planned 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a \"financial settlement\" from the UK, thought to be between \u00a335bn and \u00a339bn.\n\nThe most contentious part of the negotiations has been the \"backstop\", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, whatever long-term arrangements are agreed further down the line.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBrexiteers are angry about the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules long-term, particularly as the arrangement could only be terminated by mutual consent of Brussels and London.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish sea.\n\nBoth sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nA crucial 24 hours\n\nBy BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\n\nThe threat of resignations is still live.\n\nEsther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, seems the most likely to go, followed by the International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt. And there is silence tonight and a lot of chatter about the position of the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab.\n\nOne might not be a problem for the PM. The departure of either Mordaunt or Raab or both, both of whom harbour ambitions for the top job, would be very dangerous for No 10.\n\nJust as immediately - Brexiteer backbenchers are furious, just like the DUP.\n\nAnd it is possible that the Parliamentary postman will be extremely busy on Thursday with letters that might trigger a challenge to Mrs May.\n\nOne senior Tory told me on Wednesday night there is likely to be a move against the prime minister in the next 24 hours.

Then we got signed and the record label loved it and wanted to put it out.\n\n\"We never, ever intended this to be a record. Ever.\"\n\nThe album in question is Seatbelts For Aeroplanes; and Taylor's band is called Brand New Friend.\n\nThey were formed just two years ago when the 23-year-old, who'd been gigging around pubs and clubs in the seaside village of Castlerock, enlisted his younger sister Lauren, 20, to join him on vocals and keyboards.\n\nBassist Aaron Milligan, 21, and drummer Luke Harris, 19, were added soon afterwards and together they concocted a contagious mix of indie hooks and exuberant pop harmonies that's seen them championed by BBC Radio Ulster, and booked to play the BBC Introducing Stage at Reading and Leeds.\n\nListening to their immediate, hooky indie-pop, you can see why Xtra Mile Recordings wanted to rush out the band's demos, even though Taylor still \"cringes\" at their imperfections.\n\n\"I think we're a far better band than that now,\" he says. \"We're playing a million miles an hour because we had to do the whole thing in four days.\"\n\nThe band keep that energy on stage - promising to squeeze in seven songs during their 20-minute set at the Northern Ireland Music Prize ceremony at the Ulster Hall on Thursday night.\n\nThey'll arrive at the ceremony after clocking off from their day jobs: Taylor works as an estate agent in Ballymena (\"I'm calling you from the office right now\"), while his sister is studying in Queen's University, Belfast. Aaron, however, has found it harder to juggle work with the band's burgeoning success.\n\n\"He's the one who's suffered the most,\" says Taylor. \"He's had five or six different jobs since he joined the band, he's had to sell his car, he's been unbelievably skint - like crazy skint - loads and loads of times.\n\n\"I think in 2018 it is unrealistic to think you could make a living from this.

I think they're an extraordinary songwriter. Someone that could be an artist to watch in the future. I think they could be an international act.\"\n\nPhillipa is up for best single for Human, an emotional, graceful track that explores the complexities of their non-binary identity; in a category that also includes Ash's visceral Buzzkill, and Roe's anti-bullying pop anthem Hey Thomas.\n\nThis best album list is \"the most diverse ever,\" says Dryden - with dance duo Bicep rubbing shoulders with punk jazz collective Robocobra Quartet and rock architects And So I Watch You From Afar.\n\nBut Dryden says \"the most leftfield of them all\" is Hannah Peel.\n\nThe Craigavon musician describes her third album Mary Casio: Journey to Cassiopeia \"as a space colliery synth album\" that mixes analogue synths with the sounds of a traditional brass band.\n\nShe was commissioned to write the piece as a response to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells but, somewhere along the way, it morphed into a meditation on the EU referendum.\n\n\"On the news they kept focusing on things like, 'Oh there's this guy in Barnsley and he's giving off on why we should be out of the EU' and I just felt like, 'right I'm going to take you all into space, and it's all going to be connected again'.\n\n\"There's an amazing quote from Carlo Rovelli, who's a physicist: 'We have a hundred billion neurons in our brains, as many as there are stars in a galaxy.' And that, for me, just connected everything. Despite all these wars and divisions and everything we do to segregate ourselves, we're all the same. We're all still stardust.\"\n\nPeel says awards like the Northern Ireland Music Prize provide an important corrective to the more commercially-minded Brit Awards and Mercury Prize.\n\n\"I don't think you get a chance any more in the Mercury to hear the outer edges of Britain,\" she says. \"There's definitely a commercialism to it now that there didn't seem to be 10 years ago and that's really sad.\n\n\"I do think that maybe that should change - maybe the winner from each country should be automatically entered into the Mercury, as something you should listen to, no matter how obscure it is.\"\n\n\"There's definitely something in that,\" says Dryden. \"The Mercury is the one everyone looks to, but it could be argued that there's been a bit of under-representation from Wales, from Ireland, from Scotland over the years.\n\n\"Maybe this could help generate a bit of fresh excitement - even a little bit of curiosity - about completely new stuff.

This means the person is self-employed, rather than being employed onto the BBC's payroll. It is legal and is common across the media industry.\n\nBefore April 2017, any freelancer working for the BBC as a PSC had to inform HMRC of their employment status for tax purposes - such as self-employed or employed - ensuring they would pay the correct amount of tax.\n\nBut after April 2017, a change in the law meant it was up to public bodies like the BBC to become responsible for determining the employment status of PSCs it hired.\n\nIn 2017, the BBC started using a new HMRC tool to assess the employment status of its freelancers. This started giving different results. Before, the majority of on-air freelancers were classed as self-employed but with the new tool they were classed as employed.\n\nIn March this year, a group of 170 presenters wrote an open letter expressing dissatisfaction with how the BBC handled the changes.\n\nQuestions were also raised during a parliamentary select committee in April this year about how the BBC used PSCs.\n\nWhat did the watchdog find?\n\nAccording to the NAO, the BBC has taken steps to help the affected individuals.\n\nIt said the BBC previously announced its plan to set up an independent mediation process for presenters who were hired through PSCs and who now believe the BBC bears some responsibility for the HMRC's demands.\n\nBut the report said issues relating to the BBC's relationship with its freelancers remain \"unresolved and may have financial implications for the corporation\".\n\nIt said that between April and September 2017, the BBC paid \u00a38.3 million of tax (in advance) to HMRC to avoid any penalty charges for not paying tax that was potentially due. It has not fully recouped the money yet.\n\nWhat has Meg Hillier said?\n\nMeg Hillier MP, who chairs the Committee of Public Accounts - the group of MPs in charge of scrutinising public spending - said more needed to be done to ensure certainty for freelancers working for the BBC .\n\n\"The Public Accounts Committee raised concerns about the BBC's use of personal service companies six years ago,\" she said.\n\n\"It is worrying that, six years on, the mess of clarifying the employment status for tax purposes of people the BBC hires through PSCs has not been fully untangled.\n\n\"With around 100 investigations into PSCs still outstanding, the BBC and HMRC must work together to ensure certainty for freelancers working for the BBC.\n\n\"Particularly for those freelancers who have been left in desperate circumstances.\"\n\nWhat have the BBC and HMRC said?\n\nA HMRC spokesman said: \"Presenters are now increasingly paying the right tax and most do.\n\n\"Where presenters have not paid the right amount of tax it is right that we enforce the law so people are treated equally and fairly.\"\n\nThe BBC has approached HMRC to discuss the possibility of an alternative approach to resolving cases.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \"As the NAO recognises, personal service companies are a legitimate way of contracting for services used by many across the media industry.\n\n\"However, determining whether an individual is employed for tax purposes is complex and in managing this we have always sought to balance the interests of our workforce and the licence fee payer.\n\n\"We recognise there are still issues to address and remain committed to resolving them.

Maidstone Borough Council was approached about the level of reports, but has yet to respond.\n\nImage caption Jody Leach, of Open Road, said organisations such as his provide drug users with containers so needles can be more safely disposed of\n\nBristol City Council told the BBC it handled 4,045 reports - the second highest number - but added its figures were for all \"sex and drugs litter\", which might include \"condoms and canisters as well as syringes\".\n\nRelease, the National Centre for Expertise on Drugs and Drug Law, said national cuts to funding meant many local authorities had very limited resources to allocate to harm reduction measures such as needle exchanges.\n\nThe organisation said: \"The high number of discarded needles may also be attributed to the ongoing rise in street homelessness as more people will be injecting drugs publicly rather than at home.\n\nNeedle exchanges such as Open Road, in Colchester, Essex, are funded by both the NHS and local authorities and provide both treatment and a place to deposit used syringes.\n\n\"We've distributed nearly 300,000 needles,\" said Jody Leach, quality and treatment manager at Open Road. \"We issue 'sharp bins' (containers) to everybody who uses the exchange and they are encouraged to return them the next time they want to use the exchange.\n\n\"Without a programme like this, that we provide, it would be very unclear what would happen to the equipment that is being used.\"\n\nA government spokesman said: \"We are committed to doing more to reduce drug misuse and want everyone in need to get the treatment and support they need.\n\n\"Our drug strategy aims to protect the most vulnerable and help those with a drug dependency to recover and turn their lives around.\n\n\"That's why we're giving local authorities \u00a316bn over the next four years to provide public health services, including drug support and treatment.\n\n\"Councils have access to more than \u00a390bn this year and next to meet the needs of their residents, and we announced extra money for them in the Budget in October.\"\n\nThe NHS says used syringes can put people at risk of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, but the National AIDS Trust said there were no reported cases of anybody acquiring HIV from a discarded syringe.\n\nKat Smithson, the trust's director of policy and campaigns, said: \"The problem of discarded needles is a concern for many people who would like public places to be safe and pleasant, particularly for children.\n\n\"At the same time, it is important to reassure the public regarding HIV risk. HIV can be transmitted through the direct sharing of injecting drug equipment, however, HIV is a very delicate virus that does not survive outside the body well and therefore risk from a discarded needle is extremely low.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Women\u2019s World Twenty20 highlights: Sri Lanka keep semi-final hopes alive with win", "description": "Sri Lanka recover from losing a wicket to the first ball of their innings to get their first win of the 2018 Women's World T20 with a 25-run victory over Bangladesh in St Lucia.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/cricket/46217455", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:35:16Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Sri Lanka recover from losing a wicket to the first ball of their innings to get their first win of the 2018 Women's World T20 with a 25-run victory over Bangladesh in St Lucia.\n\nWATCH MORE:World T20: Bug strife, circus catches & Irish despair"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Doctor Who to skip Christmas Day for first time in 13 years", "description": "Sci-fi fans will have to wait until 1 January to see Jodie Whittaker's festive special.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46210019", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DA60/production/_104340955_doctor1_bbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:31:51Z", "content": "Image caption Jodie Whittaker's Doctor can currently be seen on Sunday nights The festive edition of Doctor Who will be shown on New Year's Day on BBC One instead of Christmas Day for the first time since the drama's return in 2005.

It's a day when BBC One likes to display many of the programmes it regards as its crown jewels.\n\nThen again, it's a move that mirrors the programme's shift from Saturday to Sunday - a scheduling change that has seen significantly bigger audiences for Jodie Whittaker's Doctor.\n\nNew Year's Day is a day that in recent years has often delivered bigger ratings than Christmas Day with shows like Sherlock. A 1 January broadcast for Doctor Who will help it to stand out more, instead of just being one of a number of family favourites fighting for viewers on 25 December.\n\nOne other possible factor could be that a New Year's Day episode guarantees 2019 won't be a totally Doctor Who-free year, as it now looks unlikely Jodie Whittaker's second series will air before 2020.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt's never been explicitly or officially stated that there would be a new set of adventures every year, and the BBC isn't commenting on exactly when the next series will be transmitted.\n\nBut it's understandable that many expected they'd want to maintain the momentum built up by Whittaker's successful relaunch by echoing the early tenures of David Tennant, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi and having a new run of stories around a year after their debut series.\n\nYet while the absence of a 2019 set of episodes would disappoint many, in a changing TV landscape it's not uncommon for event shows such Game of Thrones to have gaps longer than 12 months between some series.\n\nThe whispers I've heard coming out of the Tardis are that while there's a recognition that fans might want a series every single year, Doctor Who has almost uniquely complex filming requirements and a lengthy post-production period.\n\nThe team behind it are adamant that the most important thing is for the show to be 100% and not have its quality compromised by squeezing that process in order to meet a particular transmission pattern.\n\nThe Christmas Day edition of Doctor Who has been a TV fixture since Christopher Eccleston ushered in the show's current era.\n\nKylie Minogue, David Morrissey, Katherine Jenkins and Sir Michael Gambon are among the stars who have appeared in previous festive specials.\n\nImage caption Peter Capaldi (centre) bowed out of Doctor Who in last year's Christmas episode\n\nWhittaker's first full episode attracted a record audience for a new Doctor - 10.9 million viewers - last month.\n\nThe actress was first seen in her new role at the end of Twice Upon A Time, last year's Christmas special and the last episode to feature her predecessor, Peter Capaldi.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment.

I don't think I would have written it - it gave me that push to finish it. It is my dream job!\"\n\nBoth sisters have ended up as successful authors, with Jaclyn known for her novels aimed at children and teenagers.\n\nLiane's stories are decidedly more grown-up, and her new book follows nine people who enrol on a 10-day wellness course at a country retreat in Australia.\n\nThe group couldn't be more different - they include a dysfunctional family of three, a young married couple and a romance novelist in her 50s (who is not based on 51-year-old Moriarty).\n\n'We're obsessed with weight'\n\nThe group all expect to improve their health, but end up going through an experience they never expected, thanks to the vision of resort boss Masha.\n\n\"We're obsessed with wellness, it's just the latest trend so it was fun to explore,\" the author explains. \"It is something I believe in but at the same time I like to make fun of it.\n\n\"I just know that most people going to a health resort are thinking about losing weight and I remember speaking to a friend and her memory was everyone jumping on the scales each day.\n\n\"As a society we are obsessed with weight loss and it seemed to work with a character whose husband had left her, she would think that weight loss would be the answer - she thought that it would change the way she saw herself.\"\n\nMoriarty says the importance of highlighting the wellness obsession was to show \"we go too far with it and believe it will answer all our problems - it's become the new religion\".\n\nImage copyright HBO Image caption Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies\n\nWhile her book has only just hit the shelves, it's already had its film rights snapped up by a familiar face - Nicole Kidman.\n\nKidman and Witherspoon are both producers on Big Little Lies, as well as the stars.\n\n\"It's very exciting,\" Moriarty says. \"She [Kidman] will play the role of Masha and I think she will be so good at showing her narcissism and insecurities.\n\n\"Nicole is so good at showing two things simultaneously without saying a single word - just through an expression, so she will be fantastic.\"\n\nIt makes sense for Kidman to get involved in adapting another of Moriarty's novels after the success of Big Little Lies, which was Moriarty's sixth novel.\n\nThe TV show, which tells the story of three mothers with children in nursery school who get caught up in a murder mystery, has been a huge hit with audiences and critics.\n\nThe first series won eight Primetime Emmys, including outstanding limited series and best actress for Kidman.\n\nIt also picked up four Golden Globes and was named as one of Time Magazine's top television shows of 2017.\n\nMoriarty's previous novel, The Husband's Secret, is also being adapted into a film starring Blake Lively, but she insists this turn of events was never her intention.\n\nImage copyright Sky Atlantic Image caption The second series of Big Little Lies is currently in production\n\n\"As I'm writing a book I never want to think, 'It will be a film'.

despite receiving \"billions of dollars\" each year.\n\nThe California Professional Firefighters said the assertion forest management policy was to blame was \"dangerously wrong\".\n\nThe International Federation of Firefighters - which represents members across the US and Canada - attacked President Trump for suggesting he might cut off funding.\n\nSome of those fighting the recent fires have also pointed out that fires have started in open scrub or grassland rather than in forests.\n\nThe comments have also been criticised by some experts who say they ignore the bigger picture of climate change and population shifts in the state.\n\nWhat is the situation in Finland?\n\nFinland has large forested areas - but Finns were not quite sure what President Trump was referring to when he talked about them \"raking\".\n\nProf Pekka Leskinen, of the European Forest Institute, told BBC News it could have been a misunderstanding during President Trump's conversation with his Finnish counterpart.\n\nHe says there are important differences between forests in Finland and those in California:\n\nan extensive network of roads acting as firebreaks and giving quick access to emergency services\n\nsmaller individual forest holdings, sometimes separated by lakes and rivers\n\ndifferences in types of trees and other vegetation, with those found in Finland less flammable\n\ncooler conditions on average than the hot dry weather in California\n\nFinland also benefits from a network of volunteers who make up an effective early warning system, thus enabling fires to be doused before they spread.\n\nWho manages California's forest?\n\nIn California, nearly 60% of forested areas are managed by national agencies such as the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.\n\nAnd there's a significant amount in private hands as well.\n\nThe actual amount managed by the California state authorities is small - but the California Department of Fire and Forestry Protection is responsible for putting out fires and prevention measures in privately owned areas.\n\nThe national agencies have funds set aside for managing the land they own:\n\nThe US Forest Service has a budget of $4.73bn (\u00a33.64bn) for 2018, of which $2.4bn is for \"fire suppression and preparedness\"\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management had a budget of $1.3bn in 2017, although it's not clear how much was for forest management or fire prevention\n\nThe National Park Service's anticipated budget for 2019 is $2.2bn, with $289.2m for \"resource stewardship\"\n\nWe don't know exactly what amounts are spent on measures to reduce fire risk on land they manage in California.\n\nBut concerns have been voiced about whether there's been enough emphasis on longer-term fire prevention.\n\nScott Stephens, a leading authority on wildfires at the University of California, has for some years been questioning forest management priorities.\n\nHe believes more focus needs to be put on more sensible management of the environment and better land use to avoid \"catastrophic burning\".\n\nHe has also pointed to the large number of dead trees in parts of the state, due to drought and disease, as a serious fire risk that needs to be addressed.\n\nTom Bonnicksen, professor of forest science at Texas A&M University, says the real issue is that there are too many trees in California's forests.\n\nHow could forests be managed differently?\n\nProf Stefan Doerr, at Swansea University, says the modern policy of putting out all fires in wild areas may have been misguided.\n\nFor centuries, Native American peoples would burn parts of the forest so they could hunt or gather plants that grow in the cleared areas and that would thin out the more flammable vegetation and make forests less dense.\n\n\"But in the recent century or so, the emphasis has been on putting out any fires - and with climate change this has now created a tinderbox of vegetation,\" Prof Doerr told BBC News.\n\nThe case for allowing controlled fires to clear out vegetation also applies to other types of landscape such grass and shrub land, according to another expert.\n\nIs the problem getting worse?\n\nThere's little doubt fires have been getting worse in California in recent years, both in terms of their destructive power and their size.\n\nAll but one of the 10 biggest fires by area have taken place in the past two decades, according to the California Fire Service.\n\nAnd in terms of loss of life and damage to property, the data shows the worst fires have all been in the past 10 years or so - except for one fire in 1991 in Alameda County.\n\nMany experts point out that climate change has made things worse, leading to higher temperatures, lower humidity and changes in wind and rainfall patterns.\n\nDrier, warmer conditions lead to vegetation drying out and becoming more flammable,.\n\nAdd to that the fact that winter seasons when it rains or snows are getting shorter.\n\nCalifornia is also one of a number of US states where more and more people are moving out of the main urban centres and into rural or semi-rural areas.\n\nA report by the US Department of Agriculture in 2010 noted that by that year more than 11 million people out of a population of some 37 million in California were living in such areas - and flagged the fire risks this posed.\n\nAlso, houses are often built of combustible materials such as wood.\n\nCalifornia state law does require homeowners to take steps to protect their properties from fire hazards, including clearing or reducing vegetation near properties.\n\nHowever, research by the Hoover Institute earlier this year raised concerns over public awareness, enforcement and the availability of up-to-date information about the areas at most risk.\n\nThere's little doubt that unless some of these issues are addressed, the costs to California - as well as to Washington - will grow.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Fake news in Turkey: Hunting for truth in land of conspiracy", "description": "Fake news in Turkey is rampant, and targets many, including the BBC.

That is because opposition outlets have been steadily shut down, branded \"terrorist propaganda\", or financially crippled.\n\nNewspapers that survive serve not as models of journalism but as government mouthpieces, which were recently handed the leaks from the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. That led the world to swallow what they printed, rather than treating them with the usual caution.\n\nTurkey is the world's largest jailer of journalists, ranking 157 of 180 countries in the press freedom index of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders.\n\nJust 38% here trust the news, the Reuters study shows.\n\nHow a website debunked 500 fake stories\n\nFertile ground, then, for Turkey's first independent website devoted to fact-checking online material. Teyit.org takes its name from the Turkish word for confirmation.\n\nFounded in 2016 by a young journalist, Mehmet Atakan Foca, its team probes the authenticity of photographs and stories that circulate online.\n\nFoca, who did an internship at the BBC Turkish service, says they now get more than 30 tip-offs a day about suspicious-looking material, and use a variety of core journalistic skills and digital technology to check them.\n\nImage caption The Teyit team have debunked hundreds of stories in their first two years\n\n\"To tackle the problem of fake news, it's not enough to publish articles about misinformation,\" he says. \"We want to educate people and give them the tools to strengthen their capacity for verification.\"\n\nOver the past two years, Teyit has debunked 526 false stories. Many are political, using doctored photographs or false social media claims about politicians.\n\nOthers have even more serious consequences.\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nFor more visit www.bbc.co.uk/beyondfakenews\n\nWhen photos of three men were published online and labelled as those who killed 39 people in an attack on Istanbul's Reina nightclub, Teyit traced the men and disproved the allegations.\n\nOne of the wrongly accused, Metehan Alim, told us a defamation case against six media outlets is ongoing.\n\nImage copyright Teyit Image caption Many of Teyit's debunked stories are political, or deal with social issues\n\n\"Turks are fundamentalists with our beliefs,\" he told the BBC. \"We want to read what we already believe. We resist science or facts. We believe in myths instead.\"\n\nSome of the stories debunked by Teyit are international.\n\nAt the height of the violence in Myanmar against Rohingya Muslims, the Turkish finance minister tweeted photos that allegedly showed victims. Teyit discovered they were from elsewhere.\n\nThe Myanmar government formally complained and the minister was forced to delete the tweet.\n\nEven former Ankara mayor Melih Gokcek, notorious for conspiracy theories, retracted a tweet showing a photograph purportedly of flood damage to a road. It had been debunked by Teyit, and he even credited the fact-checking website.\n\nHow I became a target for fake news\n\nBut I am still waiting for Mr Gokcek to retract his unfounded claim that the BBC rented a hotel room overlooking Besiktas football stadium just before it was attacked by suicide bombers in 2016.\n\nSupposedly, that allowed me to broadcast live within minutes - and suggested that we were complicit or knew of it in advance.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Lowen reported on the Besiktas bombing some 90 minutes after the attack\n\nThe absurd allegation was disproved by Teyit, showing my first live broadcast from our BBC office 90 minutes after the attack and debunking a video that falsely translated my words.\n\nImage caption Teyit debunked the Besiktas allegations, showing that the live report came from the BBC office\n\nAfter four years in Turkey, I'm getting used to such baseless claims.\n\nPro-government dailies frequently allege I've been sent from London as a provocateur to stir up social unrest.\n\nOne needs a thick skin in this country.\n\nRise of the 'fake fact-checkers'\n\n\"News literacy is very low in Turkey,\" says Mehmet Atakan Foca. \"It's more about propaganda. People live in an echo chamber, accusing others of being terrorists or pro-government, creating false stories to strengthen their opinions.\"\n\nEven fact-checking itself is used as a tool in a country riven by mistrust and division.\n\nOne website claims to be an independent verifier of news, but is actually run by a prominent columnist for Sabah, the main pro-government daily, and her husband. Instead of authenticating sources or photographs, it pushes the government line, discrediting perceived criticism of President Erdogan.\n\n\"There is no freedom of information in Turkey\", Mr Foca says, \"so fake fact-checking websites are used as propaganda.\"\n\n\"They're another weapon of government\", he adds.\n\nControlling information, peddling false stories, fuelling the \"us and them\" narrative: these are all tactics of authoritarian governments.\n\nThey are all major challenges for the fact-checkers aiming to go beyond fake news."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Suneung: The day silence falls over South Korea", "description": "More than half a million students take on an exam for which they have been preparing all their lives.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46181240", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/133A8/production/_104306787_gettyimages-77919570.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:37:43Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images All across South Korea, at exactly 08:40 local time (23:40 GMT Wednesday) on Thursday, more than half a million students take the exam for which they have been preparing for their entire lives.

In Korea, going to university is very important. That's why we spend 12 years preparing for this one day. I know people who've taken this exam up to five times.\"\n\nImage caption Full of textbooks and revision notes, Ko Eun-suh's bedroom doubles as a study\n\nEvery year in November, Suneung brings the whole country to a standstill.\n\nSilence descends across the capital Seoul as shops are shut, banks close, even the stock market opens late. Most construction work halts, planes are grounded and military training ceases.\n\nOccasionally the stillness is broken by distant sirens - police motorbikes racing to deliver students running late to their exam.\n\nMany nervous parents spend the day at their local Buddhist temple or Christian church, clutching photos of their children - prayers and prostrating are sometimes timed to match the exam schedule.\n\nLee Jin-yeong, 20, took the Suneung twice before getting into university.\n\n\"For about a week before the exam I practised waking up at 06:00, so that my brain would be at its best. I kept telling myself, 'you've studied so hard, now you just need to show them',\" she says.\n\nLast year she remembers arriving at the school gate about 07:30. A crowd of delirious first years were singing and chanting, and handing out sticky toffees known as \"yeot\", for good luck.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBut once inside, the mood transformed into solemn silence.\n\nAt the entrance to the exam hall, inspectors brandishing metal detectors confiscated all possible distractions, from digital watches, phones and bags to books.\n\n\"Everyone was so quiet,\" says Jin-yeong. \"Even the teachers were told to wear trainers so their shoes didn't make any noise that could distract the students.\"\n\nThe writing of the exam itself is shrouded in mystery. Every September, about 500 teachers from across South Korea are selected and driven to a secret location in the mountainous province of Gangwon. For a month, their phones are confiscated and all contact with the outside world is banned.\n\nEun-suh remembers when her former Chinese language teacher told the class he had previously been selected to help write the test.\n\n\"At the time, he told his colleagues he was going travelling. Some teachers even thought he had retired. He was taken to a secret location. For a month he wasn't allowed to leave and he couldn't even contact his family.\"\n\nJin-yeong admits she was really nervous last year.\n\n\"The test was so difficult. By the end of the Korean language exam, I was so shaken, I couldn't even finish reading the last question. I just guessed.\"\n\nShe holds up an old exam attendance card. On the back, it is covered in scribbles and ticks, her answers to a previous year's Suneung.\n\nImage caption Jin-yeong holds her attendance card from a previous year's Suneung\n\nOfficially, every student's individual score is published on a national website, one month after the exam. But bootleg websites, publishing almost immediately after the exam, allow students to compare their total score with the minimum required to get into the university of their choice.\n\nThis is how Jin-yeong discovered she had failed.\n\n\"When I found out my score was less than what I needed, my heart broke. I felt like I wanted to melt into the ground and disappear.\"\n\nThe following year, Jin-yeong took on Suneung for a second time and, much to her relief, scored enough to make it into university.\n\nBut why does such an extreme level of stress surround the university application process?\n\nSouth Korea has one of the most highly educated populations on the planet. A third of people without a job have a university degree.\n\nWith youth unemployment at its highest rate in almost a decade, it has never been harder to get into a good university.\n\nLike many young people in Korea, Eun-suh is not just aiming for a good university, she's aiming for Sky - the collective name for the country's three most prestigious universities, Seoul, Korea and Yonsei. They are seen as the Harvard and Yale, or Oxford and Cambridge, of South Korea.\n\nSome 70% of high school leavers will go to university, but fewer than 2% will reach the dizzy heights of a Sky institution.\n\n\"If you want to be recognised, if you want to reach your dreams, you need to go to one of these three universities,\" says Eun-suh. \"Everyone judges you based on your degree and where you got it.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Seoul's business district\n\nThe prestige of attending Sky is also one of the best ways into a job at one of the highly influential family-run conglomerates known as \"chaebol\", meaning \"wealthy clan\".\n\nThe nation's economy is tied to these few, but huge, sprawling dynasties including LG, Hyundai, SK, Lotte, and the largest of them all - Samsung.\n\nProf Lee Do-hoon, a sociology teacher at Yonsei University - the Y in Sky, says: \"Every year, the national newspapers print how many lawyers, judges and chief executives from the big conglomerates graduate from Sky universities.\n\n\"This makes people think, if you go to Sky, you can get a good job. It's why so many parents and students are so eager to go to those universities. But the number of jobs and opportunities within those big firms are actually very few.\"\n\nProf Lee explains that graduating from a good university in South Korea does not guarantee young people a good job or a secure wage. The level of competition between applicants is really tough.\n\n\"What I hear from my students is that even if you graduate from one of the prestigious colleges, it's getting more and more difficult to get a job. But it's still easier for them, than for students from lower-tier universities.\n\n\"Of course, if you don't take the exam and go to university at all, it's nearly impossible to get a good job.\"\n\nWith so much of their future dictated by the outcome of this one single exam, revision starts early.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Even as young as four-years-old, most children attend cram schools several times a week\n\nSince the age of four, Eun-suh, an organised and diligent student, has been preparing for this year's exam.\n\n\"I go to school at 07:30 to study by myself. Classes start at 09:00 and last until 17:00. After school, I eat dinner, go to hagwon, then come home around midnight.\"\n\n\"Hagwons\", also known as \"cram schools\", are revision classes led by private tutors, both in person, or online.\n\nThere are more than 100,000 hagwons in Korea, and with more than 80% of all Korean children, both primary and secondary, attending a cram school, it is a $20bn (\u00a315.4bn) industry. Some of the country's top celebrity teachers earn millions every year.\n\nEun-suh goes to hagwon six times a week for extra maths and English lessons.

However, the pressure on parents to fork out thousands per month on private tuition is leaving poorer families behind.\n\nExperts such as Prof Lee believe such escalating costs are also one of the main reasons why South Korea's birth rate is the lowest in the world.\n\n\"This high cost of preparing kids to go to college is one of the main reasons we are experiencing low fertility rates. It's about quality over quantity. Parents would rather invest more in a small number of children.\"\n\nSuccessive governments have tried to rein in the cram school industry, both for the sake of the parents' pockets, but also out of concern for student wellbeing.\n\nToday by law, cram schools in Seoul are meant to close no later than 22:00, they cannot teach any material ahead of mainstream schools and fees have been capped.\n\nBut for Prof Lee, it is simply not enough.\n\n\"The problem is even with all these changes, the private side of education is so dominant in Korea. It's so common to send students to cram school and private tutoring that those with more money are still more likely to get into a prestigious university.\"\n\nAnother criticism of Suneung is the huge burden on students' mental wellbeing.\n\nDr Kim Tae-hyung, a psychologist working in Seoul, says: \"Korean children are forced to study hard and compete with their friends.\n\n\"They are growing up alone, just studying by themselves. This kind of isolation can cause depression and be a major factor in suicide.\"\n\nGlobally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people, but in South Korea it is the number one cause of death for young people aged between 10 and 30.\n\nThe country also has the highest levels of stress among young people aged 11 to 15 compared with any other industrialised country in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nDr Kim says the pressure in Korean society to go to a good university and get a good job begins early.\n\n\"Children are feeling nervous from a very young age. Even first-year elementary students talk about which job pays the most.\"\n\nProf Lee thinks his nation's obsession with educational achievement, but also rising unemployment, are the main reasons so many young people in Korea are struggling.\n\n\"I think the high suicide rate is being driven by an increasing gap between the lack of employment opportunities, and students' own expectations of success. There is also a lack of coping strategies to handle the stress.\"\n\nHowever, many experts emphasise educational pressures are not the only cause. The rapid growth of cities, as well as a decline in traditional close-knit family structures, have also been attributed to increased feelings of isolation, depression and suicide.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFor more than a decade, the government has been attempting to tackle the nation's poor mental health by investing in advertising campaigns, setting up national helplines and opening up more hospital beds in psychiatric wards.\n\nBut unlike almost all other OECD countries, over the past decade, the suicide rate in Korea has continued to increase.\n\nThe government has also attempted to overhaul Suneung by allowing students to gain university entrance points in other ways, such as mentoring or volunteering. But for Eun-suh, this has only made the process more stressful.\n\n\"There are now other ways of collecting extra points, but in practice this just makes it all the more confusing, because there are now more things to worry about. We need to achieve it all, including extra-curricular activities, volunteering, mentoring, and other school exams.\"\n\nBy the weekend, Eun-suh will know whether she has achieved her dream of getting into a Sky university.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nShe says she just needs to control her nerves.\n\n\"Every time I get my mock exam results, I get depressed. I ask myself, 'can I go to the university I want?'. I might be happy with my own ranking compared to the rest of my school, but when I compared myself to the rest of the country, I get scared. Too scared to even show my mum.\"\n\nBut for Jin-yeong, now at university, she can look back with confidence.\n\n\"When I watch foreigners on YouTube trying to solve the questions from Suneung, they find it so hard.\n\n\"From the outside, I know it looks difficult, but it's not as scary as you might think,\" she says. \"Instead of pitying us, I wish foreigners would think how awesome we are.\"\n\nThis article will be updated with Eun-suh's results.

The plasma is then separated in a machine next to the bed, before the blood cells are returned to the person in saline solution.\n\nIn countries such as the UK, where blood donation is entirely voluntary and unpaid, paying for it might seem distasteful or exploitative.\n\nBut in nations such as the US, Germany, Austria, and certain provinces of Canada, people do indeed get remunerated for giving blood, and business is booming.\n\nImage caption Scotty Hearron says it felt good to both help others and make some money\n\nThere is in fact a huge multi-billion dollar global market in the sale of plasma.\n\nPlasma can be sold globally because unlike whole blood it has a very long shelf life.\n\nWhile whole blood is typically kept refrigerated and needs to be used within 42 days, plasma can be stored for up to 10 years as long as it is kept frozen.\n\nThis makes it relatively easy for plasma to be shipped over the world, where the 100 or so proteins it contains are increasingly used to help treat a multitude of diseases and health conditions.\n\nSuch is the growing demand for plasma, that the global market - worth $23.6bn in 2016 - is predicted to almost double to $44.3bn by 2023.\n\nThe US, the world's largest exporter, now sends more than $2bn worth of plasma and related blood products overseas every month, making it the country's 12th most valuable export.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Blood plasma is now being used to help treat a host of illnesses and medical conditions\n\nIn Canada, two provinces currently allow private companies to pay people for their blood plasma - Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.\n\nCanadian Plasma Resources (CPR) collects plasma from two clinics, one in each province.\n\n\"The biggest use for plasma at the moment is mainly for immunoglobulins or antibodies,\" says Barzin Bahardoust, chief executive of Canadian Plasma Resources.\n\nPeople with immune deficiencies can be given extra immunoglobulins, a protein molecule, to boost the levels in their bloodstream, helping them fight infections. The effects last three to four weeks.\n\nPlasma also contains clotting factors that can be used to help treat haemophilia, and albumin, a protein that can be used to help heal burns.\n\nAfter CRP has collected its plasma, it is placed in special containers, then sent by lorry to Montreal, or Calgary, before being flown to Frankfurt for processing.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Each plasma donation typically takes one hour\n\nBut is it ethical to pay people for their blood?\n\nMario Macis, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, says that altruistic donation isn't enough to meet the world's growing need for plasma.\n\n\"Individuals with [a number of] diseases would die without those therapies [from paid for plasma],\" he says.\n\nProf Macis adds that the demand for plasma is growing as more people in the developing world have access to healthcare.\n\nRobin Slonim, an economist at the University of Sydney agrees, saying that without the supply that comes from paid donors, plasma treatments would only be affordable for the rich.\n\nHe adds that while Australians are not paid for blood donations, more than 50% of the plasma in the country comes from people in the US who have been financially rewarded.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nOther people and organisations are very much against paying people to donate blood plasma, or other blood items.\n\nOne such individual is Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Toronto-based Blood Watch.\n\n\"I oppose paid plasma all day, every day,\" she says.\n\nShe says that paying for plasma \"preys on vulnerable populations\", and harms voluntary blood donation.\n\n\"As soon as you get your donor base attached to gaining money it's been proven time and time again that you can't get those donors back into the voluntary pool.\"\n\nMs Lanteigne adds that plasma should remain in the public sector, or otherwise pharmaceutical companies will be able to set prices as high as they like.\n\nShe backs efforts by Canadian Independent Senator Pamela Wallin to introduce a law to ban companies from paying people in Canada for their blood.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Blood plasma can be successfully frozen and then stored for years before use\n\nThe European Union is also evaluating its current blood donation legislation in light of the \"market entry of private operators... into a traditionally non-profit orientated sector\".\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization wants a move towards 100% non-remunerated blood donation in every country, saying that this is required as the foundation of a safe, sustainable blood supply\".\n\nDefenders of paying for plasma and other blood items argue that it shouldn't be viewed as mercenary, pointing to European examples.\n\nProf Macis says that in Germany plasma donors receive \u20ac27 ($30.50; \u00a323.50) a time, which is \"described as a reimbursement for lost time and transportation, and other costs\".\n\nHe adds: \"And that's a lot more appealing to people, the act of donating shouldn't make anyone worse off.\"\n\nAlternatively, Italy may offer a useful middle way.

It's not about any permanent future relationship.\n\nIt's a long read - 585 pages long - and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead.\n\nBut what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise?\n\nWell we've known about a lot of the content for some time.\n\nThere are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least \u00a339bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations.\n\nThere's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU.\n\nTransition period\n\nThe legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change).\n\nThat means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period \"shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom\".\n\nThe transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their \"best endeavours\" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it).\n\nThe document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision \"extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX].\" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nIf there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called \"backstop\" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBoth sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult.\n\nSo what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it?\n\nIf a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK.\n\nThe draft agreement describes this as a \"single customs territory\".\n\nNorthern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nOne policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing.\n\nThat's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that \"the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify\" an agreement \"on access to waters and fishing opportunities\".\n\nThe way out?\n\nThere are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future.\n\nIf either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details.\n\nBut the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if \"the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly\" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end.\n\nFor some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable.\n\nBut, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns.\n\nThey too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage.\n\nThe EU insists the draft agreement \"includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK.\"\n\nSo, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised.\n\nFinally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Chechnya uses televised shamings to stop dissent", "description": "Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov forces citizens who complain to retract what they said on TV.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46201690", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/21C2/production/_104324680_mediaitem104324679.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:02:36Z", "content": "Image caption Yakha Beksultanova appears on Grozny TV to apologise spreading for false information One day in May last year, Yakha Beksultanova swiped open her phone, tapped the Instagram icon, and began typing a message to the leader of Chechnya.

Local reports said the blaze had left at least two residents with severe burns and dozens more homeless.\n\nIn all likelihood, Ms Beksultanova assumed her plea to the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov would go unnoticed - his Instagram account, since shut down by the platform, had about three million followers and attracted hundreds of comments. But she typed out her message anyway and hit send.\n\n\"Dear Ramzan Akhmatovich, a big request: hear our pain and help render medical assistance to the victims. There are two of them: a mother and a son. In the photo, the mother - with more than 90% of burns and the son with more than 60%.\"\n\nThe message did not go unnoticed. Just a few hours after she wrote it, Ms Beksultanova found herself on Chechen state TV. Looking chastened, she gave a statement: \"I did not have any information and thought that nothing was being done to help people. Today, I saw that a lot of work was being done.\"\n\nThe correspondent of the news programme described Ms Beksultanova's Instagram comment as a lie which would aid Chechnya's enemies. The Chechen Health Minister, Elkhan Suleimanov, accused Ms Beksultanova of insulting President Kadyrov.\n\nMs Beksultanova, holding a handkerchief in her hand, sighed and said nothing. But the message was clear: if you complain in Chechnya, be prepared to apologise for it.\n\n'You can apologise for anything'\n\nOver the past decade, Mr Kadyrov has asserted an authoritarian grip on Chechnya, a Russian republic in the North Caucasus. Staunchly loyal to the Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Kadyrov has crushed the free press and stifled dissent. Among the tools he has used, according to human rights activists: threats, forced disappearances and, over the past few years or so, televised public shamings.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, has been accused of brutally repressing his people\n\nThe tactic takes advantage of the deeply conservative nature of society in Chechnya. Like a modern-day stocks in the public square, it uses shame to keep people in line. Rights activists have traced examples of public humiliation back to the start of Mr Kadyrov's rule in the 2000s, when Chechen authorities used the principle of collective responsibility to crack down on the relatives of suspected separatist rebels, forcing them to apologise for and publicly disown family members.\n\nThe development of social media spawned a separate TV genre, in which citizens posting even mild dissent on social networks or private messaging apps were targeted.\n\nOne of the first well-documented examples was that of social worker Ayshat Inayeva. In late 2015, Ms Inayeva recorded a voice message on WhatsApp accusing Mr Kadyrov of neglecting poor Chechens while living lavishly. The message went unexpectedly viral and Ms Inayeva found herself on Grozny TV.\n\nBelow: Ayshat Inayeva in a Grozny TV broadcast, apologising to Ramzan Kadyrov\n\nUnlike Ms Beksultanova, Ms Inayeva was brought before Mr Kadyrov himself. Sitting next to her husband on a golden-yellow sofa in front of the Chechen leader, his aides and her own boss, she looked visibly distressed. As Mr Kadyrov reprimanded her and played excerpts from her audio message, she recanted. She kept her head bowed throughout, moving only occasionally to wipe her nose with her headscarf.\n\nSince then, Chechens have apologised on screen for a wide range of perceived offences, from spreading rumours about vaccines and child abductions, to complaints about local officials, to allegations of human rights abuses.\n\n\"If initially people apologised for remarks addressed to Mr Kadyrov or for criticising local authorities in general, now the apologies have transformed. You can actually apologise for anything,\" said journalist and human rights activist Aida Mirmaksumova from neighbouring Dagestan.\n\n\"For example, parents complain in a WhatsApp group that they are forced to collect money, forced to pay for a school trip to a circus or a theatre. Even for this they can be called to apologise.\"\n\n'Her bad reputation is here to stay'\n\nIn March last year it was Maret Zanzulayeva's turn to say sorry.\n\nMs Zanzulayeva's offence was to accuse Chechen police of beating up people in her small village. She made the accusation at a local gathering and someone filmed the gathering and posted the video online.\n\nLooking subdued and distressed, Ms Zanzulayeva sat quietly in front of the speaker of the Chechen parliament, Magomed Daudov, as he accused of her of having no respect for law enforcement.\n\n\"Maret, this case has sparked a lot of rumours in Chechnya\u2026 I have a question for you: has any representative of the authorities created any problems for you?\" Daudov asked.\n\nMs Zanzulayeva looked down: \"No,\" she said, adding: \"I saw something I didn't really see.\"\n\nBelow: Ms Zanzulayeva apologises to the speaker of the Chechen parliament\n\nMany of those hauled onto TV are reprimanded by officials and shamed by Grozny TV's correspondents, who warn them that their actions will damage their reputation.\n\nIn April, Kulsum Dzhavotkhanova, a nurse at a rehabilitation centre in the village of Alpatovo, was accused of provoking a patient into spreading false WhatsApp rumours about alleged abuse at the facility. In a six-minute report on Grozny TV, patients and officials said the allegations had been a lie and accused Ms Dzhavotkhanova of taking advantage of a patient.\n\nMs Dzhavotkhanova stood silently, her head bowed. Standing alongside her, her husband who apologised on her behalf. The segment ended with a closeup of Ms Dzhavotkhanova's face. \"She is now out of work,\" the correspondent said, \"but her bad reputation is here to stay.\"\n\nNo place to hide\n\nIn a disturbing trend, Chechens are being targeted not just for public expressions of dissent but for private messages sent to friends and family. Particular attention appears to be paid to audio messages on Whatsapp.\n\nIn September, Rovzat Dokudayeva from the small village of Dzhalka apologised on state TV for an audio message that she said she had sent only to her relatives, in which she warned about possible child abductors near a local school.\n\nThe message was forwarded on and eventually came to the attention of the authorities, and Ms Dokudayeva found herself on Grozny TV.\n\nChechens' activity on social media is monitored by a special department in charge of handling citizen's complaints. Officials from the unit appear to be working closely with journalists, who report positively on the reprimands carried on on citizens.\n\nIgor Kalyapin, the head of the Committee Against Torture, a human rights group, said the Chechen state was developing a network of informants among its ordinary citizens.\n\n\"This never existed before,\" Mr Kalyapin said. \"It has become fashionable to squeal. Many young people, seeing no real prospects, see it as a way to further their careers.\"\n\n'I'd rather drink poison'\n\nThose accused of spreading false rumours face an impossible choice. By apologising, they bring shame on themselves and their relatives. By refusing to do so they put themselves and their family at risk.\n\n\"A person can say: 'I'm not ready to be humiliated, let them do whatever they like with me,' but if this is about their children, brothers and sisters, or their parents, they do not have a choice,\" said Tanya Lokshina from Human Rights Watch in Moscow.\n\nCollective responsibility had become \"one of the most efficient repression mechanisms in Chechnya\", she said.\n\nImage copyright Public domain Image caption Ramazan Dzhalaldinov accused officials of embezzlement. His home was torched and he apologised.\n\nIn 2016, Ramazan Dzhalaldinov was forced to flee Chechnya after he accused local officials of embezzlement in an online video appeal to President Putin. His family home was torched, while Mr Dzhalaldinov himself was sentenced to community service for defamation and had to apologise on state TV.\n\nSpeaking to Russian journalists a year later, he said he had only apologised because his cousin was sent to prison after he released the video.\n\n\"They would not force me to do that again now. I'd rather drink poison than say those words again,\" he told Batenka Da Vy Transformer, an independent Russian media outlet.\n\nIn Chechen society, where personal and family dignity play a crucial role, being told to apologise puts people in a terrible bind. To refuse brings repercussions from the state; to agree brings shame.\n\n\"In effect, the disgrace falls not only on a person and their parents, but their entire family,\" said Aida Mirmaksumova, a journalist and human rights activist in neighbouring Dagestan.\n\n\"Nobody will have anything to do with your family or do business with them. A daughter will not be married into a family, a son-in-law will not be accepted. And on and on.\"\n\nThis story is part of a series by the BBC on disinformation and fake news - a global problem challenging the way we share information and perceive the world around us.\n\nTo see more stories and learn more about the series visit www.bbc.co.uk/beyondfakenews"}]
