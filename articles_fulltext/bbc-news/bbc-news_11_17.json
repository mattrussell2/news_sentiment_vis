killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, officials say, despite reports the CIA believes it was ordered by the Saudi crown prince.\n\n\"Numerous unanswered questions\" remain, a State Department statement said.\n\nSources told US media they did not believe the murder could have taken place without the approval of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).\n\nSaudi Arabia has called the claim false and denied he had any knowledge.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he was due to receive a report on Tuesday which would outline who American authorities believe was responsible for the journalist's death.\n\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document.\n\nSaudi Arabia says Khashoggi was killed as the result of a rogue operation.\n\nThe public prosecutor has charged 11 people over the murder and is seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nBut after changing its account of the death, and amid suspicions of a high-level cover-up, the Saudi government remains under pressure over the killing.\n\nWhat is the CIA's finding based on?\n\nThe Washington Post, for which Khashoggi worked, says the CIA assessment was based partly on a phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US.\n\nPrince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen?\n\nPrince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year.\n\nHe said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason.\n\nIt is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince Mohammed by the team that carried out the killing.\n\nSources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval.\n\nThe crown prince is widely described as the kingdom's de facto ruler.\n\nDoes the White House share this assessment?\n\nNot yet. \"Recent reports indicating that the US government has made a final conclusion [on the murder] are inaccurate,\" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\n\nShe said the State Department would continue to seek the \"relevant facts\" and work towards making those involved in the killing accountable.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had spoken to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the CIA's assessment of the Khashoggi murder, the White House said.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders gave no details but said Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA.\n\nEarlier, the US president again stressed Saudi Arabia was a \"great ally\" and that he had to \"take a lot of things into consideration\".\n\nDamning case but no smoking gun\n\nBy Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London.\n\nThe purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince.\n\nA second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in the Saudi capital Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the crown prince's knowledge.\n\nTaken together with the Sigint (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial.\n\nGovernment officials do not believe there is a metaphorical \"smoking gun\" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top.\n\nIn the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states, there is simply no such thing as \"a rogue operation\", as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/17 21:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31ltg11f", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T21:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Ireland hold nerve to secure historic win over All Blacks", "description": "Jacob Stockdale's second-half try helps Ireland earn a first ever home win over New Zealand as they clinch a 16-9 triumph.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46249842", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13A4A/production/_104385408_jacobtryshop.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T20:57:21Z", "content": "Peter O'Mahony produced a number of vital interventions for Ireland in a man-of-the-match display Autumn internationals: Ireland v New Zealand Ireland: (9) 16 Tries: Stockdale Cons: Sexton Pens: Sexton 3 New Zealand: (6) 9 Pens: Barrett 2 Drop Goal: Barrett I\u2026 [+1884 chars]", "fulltext": "Irish joy was unconfined after the final whistle at the Aviva Stadium\n\nAutumn internationals: Ireland v New Zealand Ireland: (9) 16 Tries: Stockdale Cons: Sexton Pens: Sexton 3 New Zealand: (6) 9 Pens: Barrett 2 Drop Goal: Barrett\n\nIreland have beaten New Zealand on home soil for the first time with a frenzied 16-9 win at the Aviva Stadium.\n\nJacob Stockdale's superb chip-and-gather try decided an absorbing contest between the top two sides in the world.\n\nJohnny Sexton advanced his claims for the world player of the year award with the rest of Ireland's points.\n\nThe Grand Slam champions added to their historic first win over the All Blacks in 2016 as they sent out a warning before next year's Rugby World Cup.\n\nStockdale's try pushed his side into a 10-point lead in the 49th minute and they produced a heroic defensive display, led by man-of-the-match Peter O'Mahony, to repel the inevitable New Zealand fightback as 'The Fields of Athenry' rang through the Dublin night.\n\nStockdale swings it\n\nA game of tiny margins was ultimately decided by a moment of brilliance from Stockdale which had Joe Schmidt's imprint all over it.\n\nOff a 10-metre line-out - Ireland's favourite attacking platform - the home side swung the ball towards the right before Bundee Aki dramatically switched direction and fed Stockdale down the narrow side.\n\nIt left last season's Six Nations player of the year facing a group of weary All Blacks who were still picking themselves up from the line-out.\n\nThe Ulster wing's deft chip took them out of play and he won the sprint with Aaron Smith to gather and score the decisive try.\n\nJacob Stockdale's try helped push Ireland into a 16-6 lead and they held on despite intense late New Zealand pressure\n\nNew Zealand indiscipline\n\nThe tone for a frenzied but absorbing contest was set from the off when the Irish team took a half-step towards the New Zealand haka and sent the crowd into overdrive.\n\nThe adrenaline coursed from the stands down onto the pitch, where New Zealand set a bewildering tempo, but a wonderful steal by Josh van der Flier and CJ Stander under their own posts helped Ireland to clear the danger.\n\nThe All Blacks were living dangerously without the ball and repeatedly were warned for offside by referee Wayne Barnes as a half-time penalty count of 9-2 against the visitors told its own story.\n\nSexton and Beauden Barrett traded early scores but the home side were unquestionably on top with Stockdale and Garry Ringrose looking menacing with every possession.\n\nKearney denied\n\nSexton nudged Ireland back ahead before Barrett landed a wonderful drop-goal to keep his side in touch after Cian Healy had been held up over the line and Rob Kearney had knocked-on in the act of scoring at the other end.\n\nIreland dominated the second quarter after a superb gather-and-go by Stockdale brought them into the opposition half and they appeared determined not to leave without a try.\n\nA cross kick to Stockdale did not succeed but New Zealand's creaking defence continued to concede penalties and Kieran Read was warned about his team's indiscipline as Sexton eventually settled for a penalty to give his side a 9-6 half-time lead.\n\nPeter O'Mahony produced a number of vital interventions for Ireland in a man-of-the-match display\n\nO'Mahony and Sexton stand firm\n\nStockdale's try was the score Ireland deserved for their first-half domination and - crucially - pushed them more than a converted try ahead.\n\nBut New Zealand are not the world's number one side for no reason and the black jerseys began to gather momentum in the final quarter.\n\nReiko Ioane cut a dangerous figure with ball in hand and Kearney had to scamper back to gather Ardie Savea's kick through.\n\nNext it was O'Mahony's turn to save the day as the Munster captain somehow managed to pivot and dive on Barrett's grubber, and minutes later he put his body on the line again to produce a brilliant turnover that lifted the siege and simultaneously forced him off the field with an injury.\n\nSexton conceded a penalty for a high tackle that allowed his opposite number to shrink the gap to seven points but the Ireland fly-half was fired up and he punched the air with a roar minutes later when he combined with Stockdale to bundle Ben Smith out of touch.\n\nSexton also departed before the end as the big hits continued to rain in but the Irish line held firm to clinch a momentous victory.\n\nWhat they said:\n\nIreland's man of the match Peter O'Mahony: \"They're not the number one team in the world for nothing. We probably had to play our best game of this term and thankfully we managed to do that.\n\n\"It's a big piece of history and one that we wanted to tick off here in Ireland and now we have done it.\"\n\nIreland captain Rory Best: \"To stop New Zealand scoring a try shows what a fantastic effort it was.

It was an outstanding second-half performance and sent out a real positive statement.\"\n\nSelection issues\n\nWales' fringe players were hoping to force their way into the starting side against South Africa after those who orchestrated the victories over Scotland and Australia were rested.\n\n\"There were a lot of players who impressed,\" said Gatland.\n\n\"As the game went on a lot of those individuals got better and more comfortable, especially in that second half.\n\nCardiff Blues' Ellis Jenkins captained Wales against Tonga\n\n\"This is the position you want to be in and there's some real questions in terms of picking the squad.\n\n\"We've got 40 players in the squad and eight or nine of them are going to miss out on the World Cup. Some players are aware of how important the next six months are.\n\n\"It's probably one of the best group of guys we've had since I've been with the squad.

Having preferred uncapped seamer Tayla Vlaeminck to spinner Georgia Wareham, her main contribution was to take a breathtaking one-handed leaping catch at backward square leg to remove Veda Krishnamurthy.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'A staggering catch' - debutant Vlaeminck takes stunning catch\n\nIndia may even have been disappointed to post only the third highest score of the tournament after Mandhana and Kaur fell in the closing overs.\n\nHaving failed to keep India from rotating the strike, Australia were then themselves strangled by a spin-heavy India attack which only sent down two overs of seam.\n\nWithout the injured Healy, who has been their catalyst at the top of the order, several batters started well but perished as India profited from bowling their slow spin outside off stump to a packed off-side field.\n\nOnly Ellyse Perry - who had a good all-round game, making an unbeaten 39 from 28 deliveries to add to her 3-16 with the ball - looked like hitting the boundaries which Australia needed to keep up with the rate.\n\nOf greater concern to Australia than losing the match will be the concussion suffered by Alyssa Healy\n\n'We've got a lot to work on' - what they said\n\nIndia opener Smriti Mandhana: \"I was quite relieved as in the first three matches I was getting starts but not able to convert it.

After Elliot Daly's penalty from halfway had levelled it up at 10-10, Leitch battered through Care's attempted tackle and stepped past last man Daly to dive over in the corner.\n\nA sleepy Twickenham was stunned, with Japan playing with pace and invention, and England left leaden-footed in defence and predictable on their few attacks.\n\nLeitch was almost in again down the right just before half-time, his side enjoying 69% possession and 77% territory, and England were fortunate to be just five points down at the interval.\n\nFarrell helps spare England's blushes\n\nJones threw on Sam Underhill and Ben Moon into his pack as England looked to find some answers and a semblance of control.\n\nKyle Sinckler was next on, for Harry Williams, as the minutes ticked by with no shift in the balance of power, and when England did threaten the Japanese line, they were penalised for holding on.\n\nOnly with 22 minutes to go did they take the lead, with Ford's dummy pass opening a gap in the defensive line and his inside ball finding Wilson cantering through.\n\nFord's conversion made it 20-15, and his penalty shortly afterwards opened a little daylight on a clear autumn afternoon.\n\nCokanasiga then sealed his debut in fine fashion after replacement Richard Wigglesworth had burst clear down the left, with Owen Farrell making a real impact off the bench in England's midfield.\n\nHis fellow finisher Dylan Hartley came up with his second try of the autumn off a driving maul in the final few minutes as the Brave Blossoms finally wilted.\n\nWith a struggling Australia coming to Twickenham in seven days' time, Jones will hope to make it three wins from four this month.\n\nBut his side will need to produce a full 80-minute performance after three matches so far where they have excelled only in spells.\n\nMan of the match - Maro Itoje (England)\n\nThe vice-captain was a menace at the breakdown and in the loose after England had initially shipped far too many penalties, Leitch running him close as he made as many line-breaks in the first half as the entire home team.\n\n'The finishers made a massive difference' - what they said\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones: \"We wanted Japan to be at their best so we're so pleased with that game; it's the sort of game we needed.\n\n\"They had a few things go their way and got back into the game and it became an arm wrestle for a while.\n\n\"We had a team with 11 changes and there wasn't a lot of cohesion, but Owen Farrell made a difference for our team because he's an influential player.\"\n\nJapan head coach Jamie Joseph: \"We gave sloppy penalties away and allowed England back in which was a little bit disappointing, but I'm proud of the players all the same.\n\n\"Comments in the media helped our motivation. Eddie Jones' comments fired me up a bit but at the end of the day we still prepare how we prepare.\n\n\"Our mentality is slowly changing, we're starting to believe that we can take these bigger teams on and that's going to help us next year.\"\n\nEngland's man of the match Maro Itoje: \"Against any team in international rugby, we know the opposition will have quality and Japan had a lot of quality; they didn't give up.\n\n\"Their breakdown game was very strong and they did well in that area in the first half.\n\n\"Eddie spoke at half-time with Dylan [Hartley] as well as George [Ford].

He said the hull was \"totally deformed, collapsed\" and that debris was scattered over an area of about 70m (229ft).\n\nThe wreck was found by US search firm Ocean Infinity, a private American company which can map the seabed. Argentina had engaged its services after an international operation failed to locate the doomed vessel.\n\nThe company, which uses underwater rovers, previously tried and failed to find the wreckage of the lost Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane.\n\nHow have victims' families reacted?\n\nYolanda Mendiola, the mother of missing sailor Leandro Cisneros, 28, said families of the crew had been brought together by the navy to learn the latest details.\n\n\"We are with the other relatives. They are going to show us the photos. They say that our youngsters are inside,\" she said.\n\n\"We are all destroyed here.\"\n\nMs Mendiola called on the government to recover the wreck, saying: \"If we don't see it, we can't have closure. Therefore we're going to demand that the president (of Argentina) finds a way to get (them) out, because it's possible, the company said so.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Gabriel Attis, chief of the Mar del Plata naval base, said much of the sub's hull is intact\n\nThe discovery came a day after relatives had gathered at a sombre ceremony to remember their loved ones. President Mauricio Macri attended and promised to keep up the search for the submarine.\n\nAn anonymous naval officer told the AFP news agency that the vessel could be lifted - at a cost: \"Raising the submarine to the surface is not impossible, but it is a very complex operation, and therefore very expensive,\" the officer said.\n\nIt remains unclear what caused the sub to implode, and the victims' families want an independent investigation.\n\n\"We have found them,\" Jorge Villarreal, the father of one crew member, told local radio. \"Now we are going to search for the truth. For us this is the start of a new chapter.\"\n\nWhat happened to the sub?\n\nThe ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, when it reported an \"electrical breakdown\".\n\nAccording to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a \"short circuit\" in the vessel's batteries.\n\nThe sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately.\n\nThe Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well.\n\nEight days after the sub vanished, the CTBTO - which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions - said that there had been a \"hydro-acoustic anomaly\" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT).\n\nLast year, navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged.\n\nThe saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base, but then disappeared.\n\nArgentine authorities later launched a criminal investigation into the disappearance."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "GB come from behind to draw Champions Trophy opener", "description": "Hannah Martin and Lily Owsley score as Great Britain draw 2-2 with China in their opening match.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/46246007", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/F1C9/production/_104379816_owsley_getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T15:31:46Z", "content": "Olympic gold medallist Lily Owsley scored Great Britain's second goal against China Great Britain twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with hosts China in their Champions Trophy opener.

I think everyone's seen the light,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think we'll have this again to this extent,\" he added.\n\nExperts have pointed to the weather, climate change and population shifts as bigger causes of the wildfires.\n\nBesides the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives.\n\nAdding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters, and the air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst.\n\nHeavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation.\n\nWhat kind of welcome did President Trump get?\n\nThe US president was greeted by Governor Jerry Brown and his successor Gavin Newsom, both of whom are Democrats and have sparred with Mr Trump over the wildfires.\n\n\"Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,\" Governor Brown tweeted.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Trump viewed the damage to homes in the town of Paradise, which was ravaged by fire\n\nIn Paradise, Mr Trump praised the efforts of local law enforcement, politicians and the teams searching for survivors on the ground.\n\n\"This is very sad to see.

His father was a keen amateur singer who encouraged his son to take up the piano.\n\nImage caption Initially he was not permitted to appear on camera\n\nAcademically gifted, Baker won a place at grammar school before going to Peterhouse College, Cambridge, to read history and modern languages.\n\nTwo terms into his university education, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He found himself on a minesweeper attached to the supply convoys to Russia, one of the most dangerous and gruelling theatres of the conflict.\n\nDream job\n\nHe whiled away the time by reading Tolstoy's War and Peace, as well as collating information about his then admiral, Sir Gilbert Stephenson, which formed the basis for a biography Baker later published on this pioneer of anti-submarine warfare.\n\nThe war over, he returned to his studies at Cambridge, where he became an enthusiastic member of the Marlowe drama society.\n\nOn graduation he began acting in various repertory companies and secured a short attachment as an English teacher in a London grammar school.\n\nImage caption Baker with Kenneth Kendall and Robert Dougall\n\nIn 1950, he wrote to the BBC asking if they were recruiting actors, resulting in an offer of a job as a presenter on what was then called the Third Programme, much later to become Radio 3. It was a dream job for the young man with a deep interest in classical music.\n\nWhen the news department began planning bulletins, Baker and Kenneth Kendall were recruited and it was Baker who introduced the first BBC news bulletin on 5 July 1954. The bulletin itself was read by the doyen of radio announcers, John Snagge.\n\nSticky tape\n\nAt first the BBC refused to allow newsreaders to appear in vision. \"It was feared we might sully the stream of truth with inappropriate facial expressions,\" Baker later recalled. \"Instead the viewers saw pictures making the news.\"\n\nWhen ITN prepared to go on air with named newscasters in 1955, the BBC relented - to the extent that it allowed Baker and Kendall to appear on the late-night TV news summary. \"It was hoped not too many people would be watching,\" Baker said wryly.\n\nTwo years later Baker, along with Kenneth Kendall and Robert Dougall, became the regular faces of BBC TV news bulletins.\n\nImage copyright Rex Features Image caption He married Margaret, a childhood friend, in 1961\n\nBaker's calm and unflappable style proved invaluable in the days when technical problems often bedevilled the bulletins. The scripts on the Autocue, from which the presenter read, were held together by sticky tape which often peeled away.\n\nFilm footage shot on location, which had to be couriered back to the studio, sometimes failed to arrive on time or, if it did, the film broke or the machine failed, leaving an embarrassing gap.\n\nInevitably, despite the wishes of BBC management, the newsreaders became personalities in their own right, purely because they were appearing in the nation's living rooms every night. Baker recalled being sent jumpers knitted by adoring fans and he began to be recognised while out shopping.\n\nNothing Like a Dame\n\nHowever, newsreaders in the 1960s were not paid the star salaries of the current generation. Baker's son Andrew recalled family holidays in a caravan on a farm, the cost of foreign travel being prohibitive.\n\nIn 1969 he was narrator of the BBC children's series, Mary, Mungo & Midge, which ran for 13 episodes, and he later narrated another children's series, Teddy Edward.\n\nImage caption He was part of an ensemble of presenters on the 1977 Morecambe & Wise Christmas Show\n\nBaker's high profile led to three guest appearances on Monty Python's Flying Circus and, in 1977, he joined other BBC presenters to take part in a performance of the song, There is Nothing Like a Dame on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show.\n\nIn 1982, he decided to leave the TV news desk but his voice continued to be heard on BBC radio where he presented, among other programmes; Start the Week, These You Have Loved and Your Hundred Best Tunes.\n\nFor many years he fronted the Last Night of the Proms from the Royal Albert Hall, resplendent on a balcony festooned with streamers.\n\nIn 2015, along with other veterans of the Arctic convoys, he received the Ushakov medal, to recognise the bravery of British sailors who assisted the Russian navy.\n\nIn his final years, Richard Baker moved to a retirement home. He was a little unsettled at first but soon found a way of integrating.\n\nHe would read all the newspapers and cut out the interesting headlines. Then, at Six O'clock, he would read them aloud to his fellow residents over supper.\n\nFor the great news man it was a smaller audience than he was used to; but one which was no less appreciative of his talent."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Scotland raises more than \u00a34m for Children in Need", "description": "Scots helped get the UK total to more than \u00a350m and an all-time total of \u00a31bn since the first appeal in 1980.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46246299", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17582/production/_104381659_cintrail1611.1_frame_32848.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T12:43:11Z", "content": "Image caption Jackie Bird and Pudsey bear brought the show to Scottish viewers Fundraisers in Scotland have contributed \u00a34.17m for Children in Need.

He missed a ball that Moeen got to straighten from around the wicket, with the lbw decision confirmed on review.\n\nMixed bag from England's spinners\n\nDespite England's four spinners taking nine wickets between them in Sri Lanka's first innings - the other coming from a Ben Stokes run-out - there were signs for concern in their lack of consistency.\n\nThose worries persisted throughout day four as each of them could only pepper threatening spells among plenty of ineffective ones.\n\nAfter Ben Foakes finished 65 not out to help England post 346 in the morning, Leach was on the mark, drawing Kaushal Silva down the pitch by giving the ball more flight before it dipped and spun past the edge for Foakes to whip the bails off.\n\nThe slow left-armer got his second when Keaton Jennings took a stunning low catch at short leg to remove Dhananjaya de Silva, before England correctly called for a review for lbw against Kusal Mendis, who has now been dismissed by Leach in all four innings in the series.\n\nMoeen could not offer his usual control, but took the key wickets of Mathews and Roshen, who was caught at slip by Root after inside edging on to his pad.\n\nRoot added five overs of unremarkable off-spin, while leg-spinner Adil Rashid embodied the mercurial nature of England's spin attack. He fizzed deliveries past the outside edge and bamboozled batsmen with his googly, but then dragged plenty short and gifted Sri Lanka easy boundaries.\n\nIt is likely to be enough to win this Test, but England's spin attack may struggle against better batting line-ups.\n\nSublime catches boost England\n\nKeaton Jennings (right) parried Dimuth Karunaratne's sweep shot for Ben Foakes (centre) to catch\n\nWhen England's bowling has been lacklustre their fielding has bailed them out, with Jennings involved in two superb catches on day four.\n\nFirst, Dhananjaya tried to work Leach into the leg side and, despite Jennings moving to his right as the ball deflected the opposite way off the face of the bat, he kept low enough to instinctively grab it with his left hand.\n\nKarunaratne then swept Rashid round the corner, but Jennings showed tremendous anticipation to start moving to his left before the opener was through with the shot.\n\nEven then the ball was travelling wide of the fielder, preventing him from wrapping his left hand around it - but he had the presence of mind to flick it upwards, allowing Foakes to complete the catch.\n\nA touch of fortune perhaps, but also tremendous guile under the helmet from Jennings and, just as with Stokes' fine run-out and one-handed catch in the first innings, two key interventions from England's fielders have boosted their chances of victory.\n\n'Don't discount Dickwella' - analysis\n\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew in Pallekele: \"What a game we have set up now - 75 runs for Sri Lanka and you can't discount that Niroshan Dickwella is such a dangerous player.\n\n\"He's going to have the tail around him, so he's going to have the licence to play some shots. I'll be interested to see how they play it.\"\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social: \"I'd be disappointed if we went down to Colombo for the third Test and it was an absolute road.\n\n\"I like these 300-par-score pitches. It tells us all that Test cricket is alive and kicking if there's a contest between bat and ball.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Viral fame for Brexit sign language interpreter", "description": "Social media thought the sign language interpreter captured the current mood in the country about Brexit.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46241508/viral-fame-for-brexit-sign-language-interpreter", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2CD/production/_104377614_p06s1s40.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T10:43:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nBrexit has been making headlines all this week, with many commentators keen to have their say.\n\nBut people on social media thought it was this BBC sign language interpreter that best captured the mood of the country."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Camden flat fall death: Fourth manslaughter charge", "description": "Sheiku Adams was found dead after falling from the third floor of a block of flats in Camden.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46246821", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D561/production/_104052645_n550-18adams.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T10:41:14Z", "content": "Image copyright Met Police Image caption Sheiku Adams died after falling from his third floor flat in Camden A fourth person has been charged with manslaughter after a man died in a fall from a third-floor flat.

McLeish had set out his stall with an attacking line-up and blue shirts swarmed over Albania's backline, pressing high.\n\nIt paid off when Christie nicked possession on the edge of the box and touched the ball to Fraser, who dropped the shoulder and finished into the far corner on his right foot.\n\nChristie was again in the thick of the action as the game took another turn towards the visitors. Albania captain Mavraj appeared to lurch his head towards the Celtic forward.\n\nReferee Vladislav Bezborodov, who was in the process of booking Mavraj for a foul on Forrest, got word in his earpiece and duly reached for the red card to reduce Albania to 10 men.\n\nAt times, Scotland were a joy to watch, a glimpse into the fearless young side McLeish is desperate to see on the big stage. Albania struggled to handle Fraser, Christie and Forrest, while Callum McGregor controlled the midfield.\n\nBefore the half-time whistle, Scotland were 2-0 ahead. Rey Manaj was adjudged to have handled a Stuart Armstrong free-kick. It was harsh, the ball was hit straight at him as he jumped in the wall.\n\nFletcher, making his first Scotland start in over two years, and in his first appearance in the dark blue in 13 months, stepped up and stroked the penalty past goalkeeper Etrit Berisha.\n\nAny time Albania played a high line, Scotland pounced. Christie's threaded ball allowed Forrest to put on the afterburners and he added a third after the break.\n\nIt was night and day from the disappointing display in Haifa last month - and Scotland were still not done.\n\nOn his 25th appearance, Forrest had already scored his first goal. But his second showed what a top player the Celtic winger has now become; collecting Fraser's pass, knocking the ball up with his right foot and thumping in a volley with his left.\n\nScotland have done the first part of the job and now a win over Israel at Hampden will complete the first assignment of winning their Nations League group ahead of the draw in two weeks for the Euro 2020 qualifying groups.\n\n'Fitting end to difficult year within grasp'\n\nBBC Scotland's Brian McLauchlin in Albania\n\nAs Forrest volleyed in Scotland's fourth goal, the swirling noise of the bagpipes could be heard from the 2000 Tartan Army members who had made the lengthy and difficult trip to Shkoder in Northern Albania.\n\nAnd, after the huge disappointment of the Israel defeat, no one can deny them the celebrations that will undoubtedly follow late into the night.\n\nFrom the first minute until the last, Scotland were simply outstanding.\n\nWith so many call-offs prior to the game, the pressure was on, but to a man they handled this with ease.\n\nBut the real heroes were Forrest and Fraser. Their pace was a constant threat the Albanians simply couldn't cope with.\n\nThe real test will come on Tuesday at Hampden, where we now know a win will be good enough for Scotland to progress to the next stage of the tournament.\n\nAnd what a boost that would be at the end of what has been a difficult year for the national team and their head coach."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "One person dies after Livingston house fire", "description": "The emergency services find the house in Livingston well alight with one person trapped inside.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-46246686", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F3C8/production/_104380426_fire.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:42:07Z", "content": "One person has died following a house fire in Livingston, West Lothian.

or ultimately can't afford.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nKlarna claims to offer online shoppers the ultimate \"try before you buy\" experience.\n\nIf you want to try on \u00a3200 of shoes or clothing, it offers you a way of having the goods delivered to you in one go and not having to pay anything upfront.\n\nInstead, the shop or retailer gets paid by Klarna, which in turn takes on the debt.\n\nShoppers buying through Klarna get up to 30 days to make up their mind about what they want to keep and Klarna gets a percentage of the purchase from the retailer.\n\nSo long as the shopper sends back anything they don't want before 14 or 30 days have lapsed - depending on the retailer - then he or she simply pays for the purchases that are kept and there is no further charge or interest, and no fee.\n\nHowever, there are concerns about giving people such easy access to credit at the checkout.\n\nCritics say this type of payment service could encourage consumers, especially younger ones, to take on dangerous levels of debt.\n\nAfter the initial 30-day period, shoppers have an extra 120 days to pay their bill, after which it can then be passed to a debt collection agency.\n\nThat's when a person can face increased charges and debts, which can ultimately affect his or her credit rating.\n\n'Soft' credit check\n\nKlarna also only carries out what it calls a \"soft\" credit check for people wanting to use its service.\n\nIt asks for personal details, such as an email address, postcode and date of birth.\n\nIt then checks if the shopper's had any repayment problems with either itself or other retailers and, if not, instant credit is likely to be approved.\n\nIn the UK, about 70% to 80% of applicants - mainly people in their teens and 20s - are accepted and so far this year more than one million people have used Klarna's \"pay later\" service.\n\nJane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust - the charity that runs National Debtline - said that, while \"buy now, pay later credit\" offers some shoppers flexibility it can also cause financial problems.\n\n\"This can be an expensive way to borrow if the customer is unable to pay and if they exceed any interest-free time limit as charges can soon mount up,\" she said.\n\n\"For all customers, and particularly younger consumers, the check-out should never be a place for the hard-sell when it comes to credit.\"\n\n'A good history'\n\nLuke Griffiths, the UK managing director of Klarna, said his company's business model was different from traditional credit services, such as credit cards.\n\nHe said the firm has global ambitions.\n\n\"Our 'pay later' solution does not charge the consumer any interest, any fees, or anything associated with not paying on time.\n\n\"We encourage them to pay on time but if they're unable to pay at 30 days we do not charge them beyond that point.\"\n\nHe added: \"So, as opposed to a credit card, if you go over a period when you were intended to repay and you start incurring charges and interest this service is different because we're working with the customer.\"\n\nImage caption Klarna's UK managing director, Luke Griffiths, says Klarna has global ambitions\n\nHe also denied it encourages problem debt for people in their teens and 20s.\n\n\"Should they have any difficulty with repaying we're providing flexibility about the way they ultimately return that repayment to Klarna.\n\n\"Should they have any issues with repaying they won't be able to use our service in the future as well.\n\n\"So we're not going back to customers who've been struggling to repay and encouraging them to use us again.\n\n\"We're basing the access to our service on a good history of paying for our service and being able to repay.\"\n\nYou can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12:00 BST or listen again here.\n\nFollow Money Box and Dan on twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/17 08:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31ltdgbr", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T08:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Gary Anderson & Wesley Harms deny farting accusations at Grand Slam of Darts", "description": "Gary Anderson and Wesley Harms deny causing \"rotten egg smells\" during their match at the Grand Slam of Darts.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/darts/46245993", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/136ED/production/_104379597_darts.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:26:56Z", "content": "Scotland's Gary Anderson beat Wesley Harms to reach the quarter-finals of the Grand Slam of Darts Some athletes blame poor performances on the state of the pitch.

His body has not been found.\n\nTurkey also insists the order to kill him came from the highest levels.\n\nWhat is the CIA's finding based on?\n\nThe Washington Post, which Khashoggi worked for, says the CIA assessment was based partly on a phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US.\n\nPrince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen?\n\nPrince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year.\n\nHe said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason.\n\nIt is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince bin Salman by the team that carried out the killing.\n\nSources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval.\n\nWhat do the Saudis say happened to Khashoggi?\n\nAt a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection and his body was dismembered inside the consulate after his death.\n\nThe body parts were then handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the grounds, he added.\n\nA composite sketch of the collaborator has been produced and investigations are continuing to locate the remains.\n\nEleven unidentified people have been charged over the journalist's death and the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of them.\n\nDamning case but no smoking gun\n\nBy Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London.\n\nThe purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince.\n\nA second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the Crown Prince's knowledge\n\nTaken together with the SIGINT (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial.\n\nGovernment officials do not believe there is a metaphorical \"smoking gun\" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top.\n\nIn the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states there is simply no such thing as \"a rogue operation,\" as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author":

It was common to find barley, cabbage and turnips in a Viking larder.\n\nArt was another strong element of Viking identity. According to Davy Cooper of the Shetland Amenity Trust, jewellery had a practical use.\n\n\"They displayed their religious affiliation through their jewellery. Many people wore Thor's Hammer,\" said Mr Cooper.\n\nAssociated with a thunderbolt, it was believed that Thor defended the order of the gods against their foes using the might of the hammer.\n\nImage copyright VW Pics Image caption Gokstad Viking ship showcased in the Viking Ship Museum in Norway.\n\nThe Viking Expansion\n\nTrade became more varied as the Vikings made their way across Europe, bringing conflict and commerce where they went.\n\nOne example was the Volga River in modern-day Russia. The Vikings who settled along the river, who were known as the Rus, gave Russia its name.\n\nThe Volga Trade Route opened up Northern Europe to the possibilities and potential of trade with Arabic nations and the Byzantine Empire.\n\nAccording to Mr Cooper, the items plundered from monasteries along the way \"allowed them to buy the things they couldn't produce on their own farms\".\n\nThese included goods ranging from salt and dyes to spices which were collected in exchange for honey, fur and slaves taken from the Viking raids.\n\nThey travelled even further afield, arriving in modern-day North America towards the end of the 10th Century, where they are said to have had fractious relationships with native tribes in North America and Greenland. The Vikings termed them \"Skr\u00e6ling\", meaning \"skin-wearer\" or \"wretched people\".\n\nImage copyright Universal History Archive Image caption A depiction of Norsemen landing on the coast of North America in the 11th century\n\nHow did they get there?\n\nViking technology was revolutionary. In particular, the marine technology they developed established them as world leaders, and feared anywhere there was water.\n\nMr Cooper said: \"[Their ships] were designed for speed, to carry the maximum number of men, and to go a fair way up river systems.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The shape of the boat meant it created bubbles on the edge of the planks [on the outside of the boat]. To all intents and purposes, a Viking ship rides on a cushion of air, and has far less resistance in water.\"\n\nAnd for navigation they had a \"sun compass\" which was, according to Mr Cooper, \"a very simple circle with a pin in the middle\" which is used to take a reading according to the height of the sun and time of day.\n\nBut journeys sometimes had unexpected final destinations.\n\n\"They tended to get blown places accidentally, but they knew what direction to sail going back,\" said Mr Cooper. \"That meant they could find the place again, and they could tell someone else how to find it.\"\n\nHaving used the natural world to provide food, the Vikings were able to utilise it in a novel way for navigation - in the form of crystals.\n\nMr Cooper said: \"They used a crystal that, when turned in a certain direction it goes dark, and when it goes in another direction it goes light. So when turned to a light source they discovered that it even worked in fog if they knew where the sun was - meaning they could figure out what direction they were travelling in.\"\n\nImage copyright ullstein bild Image caption The Althing, the parliament in Reykjavik, originally established by Vikings in 930AD\n\nDoing their 'Thing'\n\nViking society has been influential on modern life in numerous ways.\n\nArt and language derived from Viking cultures is still evident literally in the day-to-day - 'Thursday' itself comes from 'Thor', the Norse god of thunder.\n\nThe Viking system of law contains elements which mirror the ethical codes of many cultures, along with a framework of ownership.\n\nMr Cooper explained: \"They are still some of the laws we use to this day; don't kill, don't steal. A lot of it related to property and respecting property.\"\n\nThis loose set of guidelines and rudimentary laws were discussed at a gathering known as the Thing.\n\nAt these, alleged criminals would be tried by a group of their peers and could be found innocent or guilty. If the latter was the final decision, people could be fined, semi-outlawed, or fully outlawed.\n\nIn 930 AD, Vikings had established the 'Althing' in Iceland. It runs to this day, and is reported to be the world's longest running parliament.\n\nThe thing has left a mark on local communities, their names being derived from these gatherings.\n\nTingwall in Shetland was the site of the islands' local government until the 1500s.\n\nAnother prominent location is Dingwall in the Highlands. Archaeological evidence was found in 2013 confirming it was the site of a Viking parliament, built on the instructions of a powerful Viking earl.\n\nMr Cooper said: \"The Viking system was almost like our current system still works. There was a local Thing, which was a local council. Then there was like, for example, a Shetland-wide Thing. Local Things would send representatives to that. Ultimately there was the King and court in Norway.\"\n\nImage copyright Universal History Archive Image caption Icelandic Women's brooches, ornamented similarly to that from Viking Age Scandinavia.\n\nIn ways, this structure filtered through into egalitarian aspects of Viking society.\n\nMr Cooper said: \"Women had rights in Viking times that they lost and didn't regain for 10 centuries. They could own land, they could inherit land, and they could speak at the Things.\n\n\"They were a fair-minded race. Despite their reputation. they had rules to live by.\n\n\"It's just that those rules didn't apply to anyone who wasn't a Viking.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Homeowners 'conned' by Green Deal firm", "description": "The government-backed scheme left many unable to cope with long-term debt they did not know they would have.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46206788", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06rzy94.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:38:36Z", "content": "Media caption The homeowners scammed by Green Deal firm Mary Hunter says she was given a promise that improvements to her home would lower her energy bills at no cost to her - and that it was all backed by the UK government.

But this didn't always work in practice, as some low users could have ended up paying more as they used less energy than average.\n\nNot only that, but as the loan was attached to the home, rather than the person applying, there were fears it could make a property difficult to sell.\n\nIn July 2015, the UK government pulled the plug on the scheme, due to low uptake - only about 15,000 Green Deal loans were issued over the two-and-a-half years the scheme was open.\n\nHundreds of complaints\n\nThe Green Deal Finance Company (GDFC) took over the Green Deal loan book in January 2017 and relaunched the scheme.\n\nThey confirmed they had received 486 complaints about Helms.\n\nMany of the cases are still being dealt with but more than 200 have received an offer, which would reduce or cancel their loan.\n\nThese include four people on the same Blantyre street which also has seven complaints still outstanding.\n\nThe decisions were taken because of breaches of the Green Deal Code of Practice, this includes misrepresentation and failure to ensure that any plan \"is affordable to the bill-payer and meets their needs and financial situation\".\n\nHowever, these offers do not cover the feed-in-tariff agreements for the solar panels or resolve issues around building warrant guarantees and future maintenance.\n\nCitizens Advice Scotland has advice on its website about how to complain about Green Deal mis-selling.\n\nA statement from the UK government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"Green Deal loans have helped householders make their homes more energy efficient and we have always been clear that loan repayments should not exceed savings.\n\n\"Anyone who feels they have been mis-sold should complain to their loan provider.\n\n\"If that fails they should take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/17 02:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31ltcqvz", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Reality Check: The customs union explained", "description": "Confused by Brexit jargon?

They couple have shared their story with BBC Radio 5 live in the hope it will inspire more people to get tested.\n\nMax's story\n\nImage copyright Max\n\nI was 24 when I found out I was HIV positive. It was definitely a shock, a punch to the gut. When they told me, I started crying. I didn't know what to do. Should I go back to work or put my life on pause? Should I tell someone? How would I ever find a boyfriend now?\n\nThe nurse at the clinic hugged me and said: \"Don't worry, everything will be OK.\" Because I got tested regularly, I found out early, which was good news. The sooner you start treatment, the better.\n\nHIV medication works by reducing the amount of the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. This means the levels of HIV are so low the virus cannot be passed on during sex. Taking my medication has been easy - just one pill a day with dinner. Compare that to my type 1 diabetes, which requires four or five daily injections.\n\nImage copyright Max\n\nThe main problem I've experienced has been around mental health - the anxiety caused by telling other people about my status.\n\nIn the weeks after my diagnosis, I told all of my close friends and family members. Most of them responded brilliantly but not everyone was so supportive.\n\nI remember telling an older gay mentor, who I had looked up to, and one of the first things he said was: \"If I'm looking to have sex with someone HIV positive - which, frankly, I wouldn't - I'd ask myself if they can be trusted to have taken their meds.\"\n\nI felt he was characterising people with HIV as \"reckless\" and himself as \"responsible\" for avoiding contact with us.\n\nThis view emerged in the 1980s, when HIV was considered a personal failure or a death sentence. People still associate HIV with those powerful images of gravestones on the television or Princess Diana hugging people in hospital. Many refused to touch us, let alone have any intimate contact. But today, those of us living with HIV can expect to live just as long as anyone else.\n\nMy mentor's reaction really affected me. I started having panic attacks. I'd never experienced them before but I couldn't breathe. I couldn't go outside.\n\nIt only takes one person treating you differently before you begin to wonder if that's how everyone sees you.\n\nImage copyright Max\n\nI met Alex shortly after. We are both academics interested in gender and sexuality, so we bonded over that. He already knew I was HIV positive, so it was never something I had to bring up.\n\nI'm not sure at what point we stopped using condoms. There was no angst about it on his part but I did worry I was pressuring him into not using condoms to make me feel better about my diagnosis.\n\nLast year, we took part in the Partner study, which proved overwhelmingly that people who are undetectable can have sex without condoms and not pass HIV on.\n\nI think if more people knew about this study, there would be far less fear or stigma around HIV - and no one would have any qualms about getting themselves tested.\n\nHIV treatment:\n\nHIV is treated with antiretroviral medications, which stop the virus replicating\n\nThe amount of the virus in the blood is then measured to see how well treatment is working\n\nIt can take up to six months for this viral load to become undetectable\n\nPeople with HIV, on effective HIV treatment and whose viral load has been undetectable for six months or more, can't pass the virus on through sex\n\nThe NHS says a condom is the most effective form of protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STIs)\n\nAlex's story\n\nImage copyright Max\n\nMy first impression of Max was that he was very confident. I met him at a Green Party political conference. I was with a group of young gay guys - we were probably quite intimidating as a collective - and he just walked up to us and said: \"Hi.\"\n\nI found out Max was positive a few days later as he posted his status on Facebook with a picture of his meds.\n\nOne of the reasons I was drawn to him was he was so open in discussing it. I've always admired his confidence and his refusal to bow to social pressure.\n\nI also admired the fact that, even when he was dealing with the shock of the diagnosis himself, he was willing to dedicate time and emotional energy to trying to help others.\n\nWe met up a couple of months later and it just went from there.\n\nImage copyright Max\n\nI didn't feel any trepidation about him being positive. I felt sad, because I knew that he had suffered some stigma in the aftermath of his diagnosis. But that was all about other people's responses, nothing to do with the condition itself.\n\nWhen it came to having sex without condoms, I didn't worry about getting HIV because I knew he was taking his medication.\n\nI trust him completely. Some people try and undermine the science with claims that positive people won't take their meds. But this is just prejudice. If you're positive, your health depends on taking that one pill a day. It's not something you forget.\n\nI haven't told the entirety of my family about Max's status - I don't think it's significant enough. I did tell my parents before I first brought him back for dinner but that was only because he used to take his meds with food and I didn't want him to have to leave the room.\n\nI think it's a shame that the science of how it can't be passed on hasn't been better publicised. Far too many people are made to suffer stigma for no reason.\n\nPeople's views about HIV are stuck in the past. We really need to push for change.\n\nClick to listen to the full report on BBC Sounds."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Welcome sight: Why some Jamaicans want the army to stay", "description": "The Jamaican government has deployed the army to patrol some streets and residents are welcoming it.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46139175", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1452A/production/_104324238_9df2eedc-ddd7-4d73-9346-b1532df4958b.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:17:50Z", "content": "Image copyright Ben Toren Image caption Pauline Perez says the joint force has brought more security to the streets Every morning, Pauline Perez walks past the bullet-ridden Denham Town police station to commute to work as a government clerk in West Kingston,\u2026 [+6514 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Ben Toren Image caption Pauline Perez says the joint force has brought more security to the streets\n\nEvery morning, Pauline Perez walks past the bullet-ridden Denham Town police station to commute to work as a government clerk in West Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nFor the past year, she has passed by dozens of soldiers and police brandishing M-16s who now block every road to her community.\n\nThe government has selected the Denham Town neighbourhood for a crime-fighting plan called Zones of Special Operations (Zoso).\n\nThe plan uses a heavy military presence to attempt to address the island's spiralling murder rate, now the sixth highest in the world according to a 2017 report by the Small Arms Survey.\n\nImage copyright Ben Toren Image caption The joint force consists of members of the Jamaica Constabulary Force and soldiers\n\nWhen Denham Town was first declared a Zoso last October, armed soldiers and police descended upon the community. They imposed curfews, searched residents, and detained suspects.\n\nIt was supposed to last only 60 days. But last month, just shy of the project's first anniversary, Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced an extension until at least January 2019.\n\nWhen it was first introduced, critics such as Human Rights Watch warned that the crime-fighting plan was \"ripe for abuse\", pointing to the Jamaican police force's reputation for brutality and corruption.\n\nBut there have been few complaints from residents, in fact, many say they never want the joint forces to leave.\n\nLiving in the midst of gang warfare, residents like Ms Perez argue that they are happy to trade a few civil liberties for temporary security.\n\nImage copyright Ben Toren Image caption The security forces are now a much more common sight on the streets of Denham Town\n\n\"It's the first I've slept without [hearing] gunshots in years,\" she says. \"But I'm not sure it's a long-term fix.\"\n\nFor the past few years, Ms Perez has been working as a \"violence interrupter\" with an NGO called Peace Management Initiative, a role in which she counsels youths and gunmen on how to renounce violence.\n\nShe feels many youths want to get out of violence but are not always sure how. She and her colleagues are hopeful about brokering a ceasefire between rival gang factions.\n\nShe says that the residents of Denham Town have learned to rely on themselves but that the Zoso has given them some peace and quiet to allow the talks to proceed.\n\nAbandoned and neglected\n\nMany locals say that before the arrival of the troops, they felt neglected by the police, abandoned by the state and left at the mercy of the powerful criminal gangs which serve as de-facto governments in many inner-city communities.\n\nEarl is one of these residents. \"Anything could go before,\" he says as he works with a group of men shovelling mulch from a hopelessly blocked drain. The work is part of the crime-fighting plan which also attempts to improve conditions in the neighbourhood.\n\nEarl says that this clean-up could not have happened before because of the violence. \"It doesn't matter that we're in front of the police station, gunmen would still shoot you. The police can't do anything about it.\" Earl says they would have had to hire guards as lookouts.\n\nImage copyright Ben Toren Image caption The walls of Denham Town police station are riddled with bullet holes\n\nWhile the main opposition People's National Party has called it a publicity stunt and not viable as a long-term solution, its lawmakers have repeatedly approved the plan's extension in parliament.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Holness announced that 20 more Zoso would be rolled out throughout the island.\n\nJamaica is not the first country to use soldiers to police its streets, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines have all done so before.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhat is striking is how well the move has been received on the Caribbean island. A recent survey found that more than half of Jamaicans would even go as far as accepting military rule in order to rein in the country's high crime levels.\n\nSome academics put the warm welcome given to the military down to the failures of Jamaica's police force, which has in the past struggled in areas like Denham Town.\n\nNotorious neighbourhood\n\nThe government chose Denham Town for the Zoso after an explosion of gang violence in the area. It is an intricate maze of zinc fences and unpaved roads that criminals know intimately and police officers often struggle to navigate.\n\nImage copyright Ben Toren\n\nThe drug don who ran Denham Town was Christopher \"Dudus\" Coke. He was extradited to the US on drug charges eight years ago, and it has been chaos ever since as gangs fight for power in the vacuum he left behind.\n\nIn this 10 block by 10 block space, 18 people were murdered last year. Since the Zoso was introduced, that number has dropped to 10. Residents say that number is still unbearably high but welcome the fact that shootings have dropped by 70%.\n\nSince the crime-fighting plan was introduced, it has been eerily quiet in Denham Town, where 40% of youths are unemployed. The rum bars that usually blast dancehall music and the street corners that are normally filled with young people are now silent and empty.\n\nImage copyright Ben Toren Image caption Checkpoints have been erected at key roads leading into the neighbourhood\n\nThe security forces believe they are beginning to mend what was a broken relationship with the community. \"What we are trying to do here is build trust,\" says Jamaican army spokesman Major Basil Jarrett.\n\nHe says that officers from the joint police and army force are receiving training in human rights before they enter the areas.

The temple had also opened for a few hours twice after the court verdict.\n\nBut ever since the ban was repealed, tens of thousands of protesters, including many women, have blocked roads, attacked female devotees and vandalised property in a bid to stop women from entering the shrine.\n\nThey say that they are protecting their deity in accordance with an age-old belief that women of a menstruating age are a threat to his celibacy.\n\nA debate around this has been raging in the rest of the country as well.\n\nWe asked two writers, with different viewpoints, to explain their stand.

What masquerades under the garb of \"reform\" is a way to impose modernity on native practices by judicial writ and state force if necessary.\n\nThe judgement has also raised disturbing questions about the relationship between religion and state in India.\n\nThe government has become increasingly involved in managing religious institutions and the judiciary in determining \"correct\" religious practice.\n\nImage copyright Kaviyoor Santhosh Image caption Sabarimala is one of the most prominent Hindu temples in the country\n\nThe stand-off at Sabarimala exposes the stark dichotomy between a cosmopolitan elite who celebrate the \"liberation\" of women and the visceral grassroots reaction from millions of women devotees who feel their voices are not being heard in today's India.\n\nKerala is not a place where women are voiceless. It has historically been a matrilineal society where women have controlled and inherited property for centuries. The state has the highest literacy rate in India and its social indicators are comparable to developed countries.\n\nThe protesting women feel that no one cared to understand their worldview.
