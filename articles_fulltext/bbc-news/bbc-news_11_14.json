But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun.\n\nNearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes.\n\nThe planet's mass is thought to be 3.2 times that of our own, placing it in a category of world known as a \"super-Earth\".\n\nIt orbits Barnard's star, which sits \"just\" six light-years away.\n\nThe star is an extremely faint \"red dwarf\" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.\n\nCo-author Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9 said the newly discovered world was \"possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nDr Anglada Escud\u00e9, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Jim Acosta: White House defends revoking CNN man's access", "description": "\"No journalist has a First Amendment right to enter the White House,\" its legal memo reads.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46213088", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5F54/production/_104340442_050463334.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:54:36Z", "content": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jim Acosta lost his White House access after a fiery exchange with President Trump The White House has filed a memo opposing CNN's suit against the Trump administration, saying no journalist has a constitutional right to \u2026 [+4130 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jim Acosta lost his White House access after a fiery exchange with President Trump\n\nThe White House has filed a memo opposing CNN's suit against the Trump administration, saying no journalist has a constitutional right to access.\n\nIt states the president and his staff have \"absolute discretion\" over journalist access and interviews.\n\nTheir memo comes on the same day numerous other media organisations - including Fox News - announced their support for the broadcaster.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta lost his access after a fiery exchange with President Trump.\n\nA White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he tried to ask the president another question.\n\nHis pass was revoked shortly afterwards, with press secretary Sarah Sanders claiming it was because the correspondent \"put his hands on\" the intern.\n\nCNN filed suit against the president and several of his aides.

Media outlets jealously guard their prerogatives - and White House access is the lifeblood of their business.\n\nCNN and others came to Fox News's defence in 2009, when the Obama administration froze the cable network out of interviews with key officials.\n\nThey also supported Fox when one of its reporters, James Rosen, was named as a criminal co-conspirator in a 2013 Obama justice department leak investigation.\n\nIt appears that CNN may also have legal precedent on its side. In a case dating back to the Lyndon Johnson administration in the 1960s, a federal court ruled that a reporter for the left-wing Nation magazine could not be denied a press credential for \"arbitrary or content-based criteria\".\n\nForty years later, a court will be considering constitutionally protected press freedoms.

Mundell has backed the draft Brexit deal despite concerns about its impact on the fishing industry.\n\nEmerging from a five-hour cabinet meeting, he said the alternative of a no-deal would be \"appalling\" for Scotland.\n\nHe said he was clear the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in 2020.\n\nEarlier he was among 13 Scottish Tory MPs who wrote to the prime minister seeking assurances on fishing.\n\nAfter a much longer than expected meeting, Theresa May's cabinet collectively backed the withdrawal agreement, and the 585-page document has now been published along with a shorter document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU.\n\nBut Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara have since resigned in protest.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon described it as \"bad deal\" for Scotland and predicted the prime minister would struggle to get it passed in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Mundell told the BBC on Wednesday evening there had been a \"full and frank\" discussion at cabinet and they had agreed to move to the \"next stage\".\n\nHe said there would be a special EU council meeting, hopefully later this month, and the cabinet would then decide if to recommend the deal to parliament.\n\nAsked about rumours of a leadership challenge to Mrs May, he urged fellow Conservatives to back the prime minister.\n\nHe said: \"We need to support her going forward with the agreement, that's potentially been reached because the alternative to reaching this agreement is no deal, and no deal is an absolutely appalling outcome, not just for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scotland's fishermen largely backed Brexit ahead of the referendum\n\nThe earlier letter to Theresa May from Scottish Conservative MPs came amid speculation that the UK's departure from the Common Fisheries Polices (CFP) could be delayed or watered down.\n\nThe CFP is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.\n\nThe letter reminded the prime minister she had promised this would happen and that anything less than this would be a \"betrayal of Scotland\".\n\nIt went on to say: \"This has raised expectations in the fishing industry that Brexit will lead to complete control and full sovereignty over domestic waters that we must deliver on.\n\n\"In order to deliver on these expectations, we could not support an agreement with the EU that would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares.\n\n\"That would mean that we would not be leaving the CFP in practice, and would become an independent coastal state in name only\".\n\nEU fishing vessels\n\nFollowing publication of the draft agreement the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) said it was seeking assurances that EU vessels will not be guaranteed continued access to UK waters in return for favourable trade terms.\n\nOn Wednesday evening the EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: \"An essential condition for the single customs territory to cover fisheries... will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nThe declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU makes clear that a new fisheries agreement will need to be negotiated.\n\nSFF president Bertie Armstrong said: \"Any linkage between access and trade contravenes all international norms and practice and is simply unacceptable in principle.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland 'concerns'\n\nMr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is on maternity leave, have previously written to Mrs May warning they would not support any deal that gave Northern Ireland a different arrangement to the rest of the UK on the single market and customs union.\n\nThey fear that making a special case for Northern Ireland while rejecting calls to do the same for Scotland would be a political gift to the SNP, and could fuel the case for independence.\n\nAsked about Northern Ireland, Mr Mundell said they continued to have concerns.\n\nHe said: \"We want to ensure that Northern Ireland remains fully part of our United Kingdom.\n\n\"We've always been very clear about that and we want to be satisfied that those arrangements in place for Northern Ireland that also respect the Good Friday Agreement and existing all-Ireland arrangements don't do anything to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.\""},

He says his saliva thickened so much he could barely breathe.\n\nSince then his life has changed forever and after recent high-profile cases surrounding food allergies, Oli's been telling Radio 1 Newsbeat how he copes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Oli's allergy means simply taking medication after coming in to contact with nuts might not be enough to save his life.\n\nOli describes the first time he was rushed to hospital after eating that peanut butter as his scariest experience.\n\nHe had no idea what was happening to his body as his skin broke out in hives (swollen, pale red bumps).\n\nIt's not just a simple case of avoiding eating peanuts. Even kissing a girl on a night out could be risky.\n\nIf she'd eaten a peanut or it had even been used as an ingredient in a meal, that trace could be enough.\n\n\"People have died from it,\" Oli explains.\n\n\"It's quite a real risk, which people wouldn't think about if you didn't have allergies.\n\n\"Unless you know someone close to you who's got an allergy, you don't really need to think about areas like foreign holidays, flying, or romantic relationships.\n\nImage copyright Food Standards Agency Image caption Oli has worked with groups like the Food Standards Agency on raising awareness of severe allergies in young people.\n\n\"You quite often get people having a curry, then going to the pub and then going out, so it's not just having physically eaten a peanut, it's 'have you had an Indian? Have you had a kebab?'\n\n\"I tend to avoid it really. There have been times in the past when it's ruined my night, because I've spent the whole night thinking 'Am I having a reaction?'\n\n\"I don't need the extra stress. It would be nice to not have to worry about stuff like that but it's a reality.\"\n\nImage copyright Oli Weatherall Image caption Oli makes his own food from scratch to avoid nuts and has started an Instagram page with allergy friendly, vegan recipes.\n\nEating anywhere other than at home is a problem.\n\nWhile restaurants should be aware of allergens and which ones are in their food, Oli says inexperienced managers or waiting staff can make life tricky.\n\nIt means every time he's out and about for more than a few hours, he has to plan his meals precisely.\n\n\"A lot of your life has to be planned around being able to eat safely.\n\n\"It just removes spontaneity a bit. You have to be quite forward thinking all the time. Meal deals (such as at supermarkets) are always a good way to go, rather than trying to eat out.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Oli finds going on holiday with an allergy exhausting and isn't planning on doing it again any time soon.\n\nForeign holidays aren't happening at the moment either. The 22-year-old says that's also too much of a risk.\n\nIt's not just food on the plane. Any language barrier on holiday could create a lethal misunderstanding.\n\nOli says: \"If I did have a reaction in the air, quite a lot of people would think 'oh you've got your EpiPen, just have one of those and you'll be fine' but that's not the case.\"\n\nAirlines do carry medical equipment and staff are trained in first aid. But Oli worries that's not always enough.\n\n\"If you use an EpiPen you need urgent medical attention, that's not something which is possible to do in the air.\n\n\"I went travelling with my friends around Australia and New Zealand three or four years ago. It was worth going, but when you're staying in rubbish hostels with a severe allergy you can't cook there.\n\n\"It's not a safe environment. I ended up eating the worst diet, stuff I knew was fine for the whole trip.\n\n\"You're on holiday, travelling and doing all these things and you're thinking constantly ahead - 'Am I sorted for tomorrow?' It's exhausting. I'm glad I did it but I wouldn't be going to do something like that again.\"\n\nNatasha Ednan-Laperouse and Celia Marsh both died after eating Pret A Manger food.\n\nOli says it underlines why he would never be confident to eat at similar chains.\n\n\"There's not the labelling there,\" he says. \"There's not a uniform way of doing it - which gives people with allergies good information to make the choices.\n\n\"It's obviously an awful story and it proves what can happen when the regulations aren't in place.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Agnieszka Radwanska: Wimbledon finalist retires from tennis aged 29", "description": "Former world number two Agnieszka Radwanska announces her retirement from tennis at the age of 29.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/46213294", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/AEA0/production/_104340744_radwanska_getty1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:49:40Z", "content": "Radwanska also won the 2015 WTA Finals Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska has announced her retirement from tennis at the age of 29.

Doctors diagnosed cyanide poisoning.\n\nHis poisoning has led investigators to re-examine the forensic tests carried out on his father's body.\n\nThe possibility that Jorge Enrique Pizano's death may not have been due to natural causes has caused a stir in Colombia with many speculating about who could have wanted to silence the engineer.\n\nWhistleblower\n\nMr Pizano worked as an auditor for the Ruta del Sol (Sun Route), one of Colombia's biggest infrastructure projects aimed at constructing roads to link up the centre of the country with the Caribbean coast.\n\nThe contract to build much of the 1,000km (620 miles) stretch of motorway was awarded to Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and its local partners.\n\nBut Odebrecht's concession was cancelled in February 2017 after evidence emerged suggesting the company had paid bribes to be awarded the contract.\n\nOdebrecht is at the centre of a massive corruption scandal spanning Latin America and, as part of a plea deal with the US justice department, it has admitted paying bribes in 12 countries, including Colombia.\n\nProsecutors in Colombia estimate the firm paid $27m (\u00a320.9m) to land the contract for the Ruta del Sol project.\n\nMr Pizano was hired as an auditor in 2010 and in 2013 began denouncing what he said were suspicious payments made by Odebrecht and Grupo Aval, Colombia's largest banking group which was also involved in the Ruta del Sol project.\n\nPosthumous interview\n\nIn August, Mr Pizano handed Colombian news programme Noticias Uno a secret audio recording he said he had made in 2015 of himself flagging up the payments to N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez. Mr Mart\u00ednez was Grupo Aval's legal adviser at the time and is now Colombia's attorney-general.\n\nNoticias Uno says Mr Pizano feared there were people plotting against him and handed their reporter the recording and other documents for safekeeping either until he was safe in another country or for publication in the case of his death.\n\nNoticias Uno broadcast the audio on Sunday night and it has triggered calls for Mr Mart\u00ednez to resign.\n\nMr Mart\u00ednez said in a statement that Mr Pizano had told him about irregular payments at the time but that it was not clear that those payments were bribes. Mr Mart\u00ednez also said that he had passed on Mr Pizano's concerns to company officials at the time.\n\nGrupo Aval has released a statement saying it had \"immediately ordered an internal audit into Dr Pizano's suspicions\" at the time and that it had not been aware of any bribes being paid before 21 December 2016, when Odebrecht admitted to the payments as part of the plea agreement."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Djokovic takes big step towards ATP Finals semis", "description": "World number one Novak Djokovic takes a big step towards the semi-finals at the ATP Finals with a clinical victory over Alexander Zverev.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/46211126", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/C994/production/_104340615_novak_djokovic_getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:36:43Z", "content": "After a challenging first set, Novak Djokovic raced through the second set in 29 minutes ATP Finals Venue: O2 Arena, London Dates: 11-18 November Coverage: Follow live coverage across BBC TV, radio, the BBC Sport website &amp; mobile app. Live text commentary\u2026 [+906 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is not supported on this device Watch: Djokovic beats Zverev in straight sets\n\nATP Finals Venue: O2 Arena, London Dates: 11-18 November Coverage: Follow live coverage across BBC TV, radio, the BBC Sport website & mobile app. Live text commentary available on selected matches.\n\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic became the first man to reach the semi-finals of the ATP Finals after a clinical win over Alexander Zverev and a favourable result in the group's other match.\n\nAfter a very physical and close first set, the 31-year-old Serb ran away with the second to beat the German 6-4 6-1.\n\nDjokovic, chasing a first ATP Finals title since 2015, reached the last four when Marin Cilic beat John Isner later.\n\n\"I don't think it was breathtaking tennis but a win is a win,\" he said.\n\n\"I played well midway through the second set and started to swing through the ball.\n\n\"I had not served that well but he made a lot of unforced errors which helped me to win.\"\n\nIndeed, it was a double-fault from Zverev that handed Djokovic the first set and a total of 33 unforced errors that contributed to the 21-year-old's downfall.\n\nZverev himself later later seemed to imply that fatigue had perhaps also played a part, saying the length of the tennis season was \"ridiculous\".\n\nDjokovic plays Cilic in his final round-robin match on Friday, while Zverev takes on Isner.\n\nAre you Mr Bendy, Novak?\n\nIt took until the ninth game of the first set for either player to fashion a break point, Zverev missing two in that game.\n\nHaving survived that pressure, Djokovic left it until the perfect time to break in the following game - taking the set when the German double-faulted.\n\nIt was an unfortunate way for Zverev to fall behind, having been impressive with his serves until that point, delivering seven aces and in one game firing down three successive serves at more than 140mph.\n\nTipped by many as a future Grand Slam-winner, Zverev showed some of his talent with some beautiful passing shots but he was up against a player who can contort his body to reach almost anything.\n\nDjokovic met one of Zverev's body serves with an unconventional placement of his racquet that looked more about shielding his face - but of course the return went in - and later Zverev needed two attempts at a smash to put the ball away, when against any other player the first one would have done.\n\n\"That's a first - 'Mr Bendy',\" the Serb laughed in his on-court interview. \"I am relying on my flexibility a lot. I was fortunate to be surrounded with people who emphasised the importance of stretching and it has paid off.\"\n\nDjokovic is favourite to win a sixth title at the end-of-season tournament after a remarkable year in which he came back from elbow surgery to win Wimbledon and the US Open and return to the top of the rankings for the first time in two years.\n\nThe top two from the two four-player groups qualify for Saturday's semi-finals, with the winners of those matches meeting in Sunday's final.\n\nGroup Gustavo Kuerten P W-L Sets Games Novak Djokovic 2 2-0 4-0 24-12 Alexander Zverev 2 1-1 2-2 19-24 Marin Cilic 2 1-1 2-3 30-28 John Isner 2 0-2 1-4 21-30\n\nWhere did it go wrong for Zverev?\n\nThe turning point of the match was at 4-4 on Djokovic's serve, when Zverev went 0-30 up. But a forehand and then backhand error wiped out the advantage and the German bounced his racquet off the ground in frustration.\n\nDjokovic netted a forehand to give Zverev a break point, which he wasted by returning long, and the Serb then gave him a second chance with a double-fault but the youngster missed that break point when an attempted lob drifted long.\n\nIn the end, Djokovic held his serve with a lovely drop-shot and never looked back.\n\nThree errors in a row in the next game gave Djokovic his first break points of the match and while Zverev saved one of them with a smash, he gave the set away with his only double fault of the first set.\n\nThe opening two games of the second set were close, Djokovic whacking his shoes with his racquet when he failed to break in Zverev's first service game having taken him to deuce.\n\nBut after that Djokovic turned the screw, with the German taking only three points in the final five games as the 14-time Grand Slam champion wrapped up victory against an apparently tiring Zverev in one hour and 16 minutes.\n\n\"The issue is that our season is way too long. But I've said it before,\" Zverev, whose 55 match wins this year is more than any other player, told reporters.\n\n\"We play for 11 months a year. That's ridiculous. No other professional sport does that.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nFormer player and BBC commentator Andrew Castle:\n\nThis was from a guy [Djokovic] who was nowhere. He was a lost soul in the last two years after winning the French Open in 2016. He had won everything. But he is re-ignited now. I think it is fantastic to see him back at his best. It is brilliant for the game. Everyone will be watching this and thinking 'that is a high standard'.\n\nThis tournament is finally starting to light up. We have had a lot of ordinary matches but that wasn't one of them. Djokovic didn't seem to think it was but if that's the case then I'd like to see him playing 'well'."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "PMQs: Corbyn and May on post-Brexit trade deals", "description": "Theresa May criticises Labour policy saying it could not be in both a customs union and negotiate its own trade deals.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46209425/pmqs-corbyn-and-may-on-post-brexit-trade-deals", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/00FD/production/_104335200_p06rrl8x.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:36:29Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nJeremy Corbyn reminded Theresa May about Liam Fox''s claim about 40 trade deals ready to be signed the second the UK leaves the EU, asking how the negotiations are coming along.\n\nShe asked him about Labour policy, saying the UK could not be in a customs union and negotiating its own trade deals.Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "PMQs: Corbyn and May on Raab and Dover-Calais trade route", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn taunts the prime minister about Dominic Raab's comments on Dover-Calais trade routes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46209426/pmqs-corbyn-and-may-on-raab-and-dover-calais-trade-route", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B224/production/_104340654_p06rrlm7.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:36:04Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Brown: There will be a referendum at some point\n\nThe British people \"have got a right to have the final say\" on the UK's relations with the EU, says former prime minister Gordon Brown."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "PMQs: Corbyn and May on Labour's Brexit policy", "description": "After being reminded of claims from Liam Fox and Dominic Raab, Theresa May asks the Labour leader about differences between him and Keir Starmer.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-46209427/pmqs-corbyn-and-may-on-labour-s-brexit-policy", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15C41/production/_104335198_p06rrlc3.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:34:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Brown: There will be a referendum at some point\n\nThe British people \"have got a right to have the final say\" on the UK's relations with the EU, says former prime minister Gordon Brown."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prepare lunch for Barnsley homeless charity", "description": "William and Kate visit Centrepoint in Barnsley after opening \u00a350m McLaren chassis factory.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-46209824", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10DE5/production/_104339096_soup.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:28:14Z", "content": "Image caption Prince William has been a patron of Centrepoint since 2005 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made lunch for young people who have been helped by the homelessness charity Centrepoint.

I just got a bunch of envelopes and addressed them to 'the manager'.\"\n\nRobert Rowan was an 18-year-old college student from Fife when he sent out the dossiers on the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona in Rome.\n\nIt was a punt that would earn him scouting roles with Celtic, then the Scotland national team, and a stint during which he combined working in a bank with being the sporting director of Scottish League One side Stenhousemuir, before joining Brentford in 2014.\n\nAt the time of his death on Tuesday at the age of 28, Rowan was the Championship club's technical director.\n\nThe club's co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen described him as \"not only an ambitious colleague who kept pushing the club forward but also a warm, funny and trusted man\".\n\nBut how did a teenager with no football experience end up such a pivotal figure in one of the world's biggest leagues at such a young age?\n\nTurning up at Celtic clueless & soaking wet\n\nWhen football-daft teenager Rowan spotted the internet leak of a scouting report Andre Villas-Boas had compiled for Jose Mourinho's Chelsea a few weeks earlier, he thought he'd have a go at writing one himself.\n\nRemarkably, Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Celtic replied to his mail shot, with the latter inviting him for a meeting in Glasgow.\n\nRowan had never been to Scotland's largest city on his own before. In fact, he hadn't been to many places outside the small town of Kirkcaldy in which he grew up.\n\n\"My mate was at university in Glasgow so he met me and we decided, for some reason, to walk to Celtic Park,\" he told BBC Sport in 2016. \"By the time we got there we were soaking.\n\n\"When I was inside speaking to them, I could see my mate outside in the car park huddled under a \u00a31 umbrella that we bought from a guy on the road side. Thinking back, I wouldn't do it that way again.\"\n\nDespite the shambolic scene, Rowan impressed enough to be invited to work with Celtic's youth and under-21 sides, scouting opposition teams.\n\n\"I was young and naive and there was nothing too complicated about the reports,\" he said. \"I wasn't cocky but I had nothing to lose and wanted to give it a shot.\"\n\nAsking if he could become sporting director\n\nRowan had been at Celtic for a year when Mick Oliver - chief scout for then-Scotland manager Craig Levein - asked him to meet at a non-descript hotel in a non-descript part of central Scotland.\n\nThe two had never spoken before but Oliver handed over footage of Slovenia and asked the wide-eyed 20-year-old to write a report on how the national team's next opponents played.\n\n\"It must have been okay because he gave me a job,\" he said.\n\nThat job, which entailed tracking players from other countries, looking at potential Scotland internationals and recruiting pupils for the Scottish FA's performance schools, ended when Levein was sacked.\n\nThinking his hopes of a career in football were over, Rowan started a traineeship with a bank. Then came another opportunity.\n\nStenhousemuir had never had a sporting director until Rowan arrived\n\nFormer Scotland striker Scott Booth, with whom he had worked at the Scottish FA, was appointed Stenhousemuir manager and asked him to get involved with the part-time club.\n\n\"I jokingly told him I'd only do it if I could be the sporting director, but Stenhousemuir had never had one before,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think for a minute it would work and, actually, I don't think the club were ever convinced they needed me, but they let me have a go at it.\"\n\nFilming games, showing clips to players and holding analysis sessions may not seem revolutionary, but it was entirely alien to a squad of joiners, plumbers and policemen to be asked to turn up for an additional third training session every week.\n\nHiding in a bank toilet talking to Brentford\n\nThroughout that time, Rowan continued his traineeship and was beginning to consider it his career until two interviews in the space of two days in August 2014 rekindled his hopes of a job in football.\n\n\"I'd told the bank I needed a day off because I had an interview with the English FA,\" he recalled. \"But the Brentford thing was on my day off\u2026\n\nThe \"Brentford thing\" involved a trip to Blackpool on a Tuesday night. The west London club were playing Blackpool and - thanks to his friendship with then-assistant manager Davie Weir - they asked Rowan to meet them pre-match to discuss a position as scouting co-ordinator and join them to watch the game.\n\n\"The problem was, I was working the next morning so I had to drive down then leave pretty much straight away after the chat,\" he recalled. \"I remember heading up the road to Kirkcaldy really hoping I'd get the job but at the back of my mind I was thinking 'aww man, I've got work in the bank tomorrow morning'.\n\n\"But a few weeks later, after hearing nothing, I got a call at work one day and ended up hiding in a toilet cubicle listening to Brentford's director of football talking about salaries, contracts and start dates.\"\n\nGambling with personalities at Brentford\n\nManager Mark Warburton, left, and assistant Davie Weir departed not long after Rowan arrived. The latter two were flat-mates for a spell\n\nA few months after arriving at Brentford - and being promoted to head of football operations - Rowan found himself stuck in the middle of a schism between owner Matthew Benham and the management.\n\nDirector of football Frank McParland, manager Mark Warburton, and assistant Weir were not convinced by professional gambler Benham's statistical modelling strategy.\n\nBut Rowan was an enthusiastic disciple, insisting on spending one day a week studying at Benham's Smartodds statistics company throughout his first year at the west London club.\n\n\"That was a tricky time for me personally but I learned a lot and I've done a lot,\" he said two years ago.\n\n\"In a way, it was good for me to be thrown into that situation because I just had to get on with it and it's given me the kind of experience that very few people my age have, in whatever industry they work in.\"\n\nThat experience attracted an offer from Celtic a couple of years ago to work with their first team and an interview with Rangers last year when they were searching for a director of football.\n\nHowever, Rowan opted to stay in England, where his remit had evolved into the role of technical director. It was a role in which he was making a name for himself at the time of his death.\n\n\"We are all simply devastated with this news,\" said Brentford chief executive Mark Devlin. \"Rob was a terrific man and a great character around the club.

I know gambling addiction can devastate lives.\"\n\nHow important are FOBTs to bookmakers?\n\nBy Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check\n\nFOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999. Since then, the number has grown to 33,468 in Great Britain.\n\nData from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from \u00a31.05bn in 2009 to \u00a31.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%.\n\nLast year, betting shops made \u00a33.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional \"over-the-counter\" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09.\n\nThat suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit.\n\nWhy has the government been looking at this issue?\n\nFOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm.\n\nThe machines have been called the \"crack cocaine\" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems.\n\nThe government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a \"call for evidence\" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players.\n\nHow has the market reacted?\n\nInvestors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%.\n\nAfter the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken \"the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals\".\n\nHe added it was \"a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Lewis Hamilton: Michael Schumacher's record has never been a target", "description": "Five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton says reaching Michael Schumacher's record of seven Formula 1 world titles \"has never been on his mind\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/formula1/46211784", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:06:39Z", "content": "Five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton says reaching Michael Schumacher's record of seven Formula 1 world titles \"has never been on his mind\".

But three times over that period, the UN Security Council has always voted to maintain them, claiming the country was a destabilising factor in the Horn of Africa region.\n\nBut all that seems to have changed after Eritrea signed a landmark agreement with Ethiopia in June, committing to end a bitter two-decade dispute.\n\nSince then, diplomatic ties have resumed and both air and land transport between the two countries have re-opened.\n\nThe bromance between Ethiopian's new reformist leader Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea's President Isaias Aferweki seems to have rubbed on neighbouring leaders.\n\nEritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia have now signed a joint agreement of cooperation, and leaders of the three countries have met personally on three different occasions this year - something that hadn't happened in years.\n\nRelations between Eritrea and Djibouti are also thawing after years of a border dispute. There is now even an ambitious talk of the Horn of Africa countries forming an economic bloc of sorts.\n\nMany analysts believe that there are still many issues like the border disputes to resolve before that can be achieved, but so far leaders of the region are daring to believe."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Referee whose jaw was broken by players forgives his attackers", "description": "The referee who was assaulted after a junior football match in the Republic of Ireland says he bears no animosity towards those who attacked him.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/46211844", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:42:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "A referee who was assaulted after an amateur football match in the Republic of Ireland says he bears no animosity towards those who attacked him.\n\nDaniel Sweeney - a Scot who now lives in the Republic - sustained serious facial injuries including a broken jaw, following the Combined Counties Football League game in the village of Horseleap on the Offaly-Westmeath border.\n\nFootage courtesy of RTE\n\nRead more: Referee's jaw broken after attack in Irish amateur league"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict", "description": "Theresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the draft Brexit agreement - here are the key bits.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46209354", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BE0D/production/_104335684_apmq.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:40:09Z", "content": "Image copyright HoC Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons.

Here's what happened.\n\nMrs May's draft Brexit agreement was the only show in town - and Jeremy Corbyn went for it, despite the disadvantage - shared by everyone who is not in the cabinet or a select group of Tory backbenchers - of not having read it yet.\n\nHe branded the draft agreement a \"failure on its own terms\", based on what we know about it, that \"breaches the prime minister's own red lines\" and doesn't protect jobs and industry. He asked: \"Does she still intend to put a false choice to Parliament between her botched deal and no deal?\"\n\nThe PM accused Labour of wanting to \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nMr Corbyn quoted Jo Johnson who quit the government last week accusing the PM of a \"failure of statecraft\" of historic proportions - and said the EU's lead negotiator had reportedly told EU ambassadors \"the UK must align their rules with the EU, the EU will retain all the controls\".\n\nMrs May insisted she had negotiated a \"good deal\" for the UK that delivers on the referendum and ensures we \"take back control of our money, law and borders\".\n\nMr Corbyn turned to whether the UK can strike its own trade deals if it is in the temporary customs union as part of the so-called backstop to prevent the return of a hard Irish border.\n\nHe asked a briefly silent Commons (this is a point Tory Brexiteers are keen to get clarified too) whether her agreement would ensure the \"sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop\".\n\nMrs May said there needed be a backstop as an \"insurance policy\" but neither side wanted it it to be used.\n\nShe said she was \"aware of concerns\" that \"we don't want to be in a position where the European Union would find it comfortable to keep the United Kingdom in the backstop permanently and that's why any backstop has to be temporary\".\n\n\"I think that non-answer has confirmed that Parliament won't have that sovereign right,\" replied Mr Corbyn. What happened to the 40 trade deals Liam Fox had said would be ready to go \"a second after midnight\" on Brexit day next March, he asked.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cCan the PM tell us exactly how many of these 40 deals have been negotiated?\u201d\n\nMrs May said the UK had \"started discussions\" with other countries, before launching an attack on Labour's policy of being in a customs union, which she claimed would prevent trade deals.\n\nMr Corbyn had some fun at the expense of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said last week he had not been aware of how much the UK relied on the Dover/Calais route for trade in goods.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cWhen did the PM become aware of this absolutely shocking revelation about Britain\u2019s trade routes?\u201d\n\nThe PM insisted \"we do know about trade policy\" - before turning PMQs on its head by asking Mr Corbyn - in the light of apparent differences between him and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer - if it was Labour policy to \"stop Brexit\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May asks Jeremy Corbyn \"is it Labour Party policy to stop Brexit?\"\n\nMr Corbyn said Labour respected the result of the referendum - and took another swipe at Mr Raab's \"woeful ignorance\". He ended with his first question - would MPs be presented with a choice between her \"half-baked deal\" or \"no deal\"?\n\nMrs May ignored this in favour of her customary swipe at Labour's economic policies and a defence of her Brexit agreement.\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford also went on Brexit, calling for Scotland to stay in the customs union.\n\nTory Brexiteer Peter Bone accused the PM of failing to deliver the Brexit people had voted for.\n\nThe prime minister hinted that a planned crackdown on betting machines in bookmakers shops could be brought forward - after protests from MPs on all sides and the resignation of Sports Minister Tracey Crouch.\n\nLabour's Rosena Allin-Khan called for another EU referendum.\n\nLabour's Wes Streeting called for stricter controls on the sale of crossbows.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nJeremy Corbyn was on fire today. A series of pointed, well-delivered questions, including one on whether the UK could unilaterally leave the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement, which the PM danced around but didn't answer.\n\nThe prime minister was in the awkward position of discussing an as yet unpublished and unagreed document, and she looked uncomfortable and, at times, cornered.\n\nShe endured a very tough three quarters of an hour against opponents whose position was far more fluid than her's could be. I think we saw Jeremy Corbyn's position evolving a bit, before our very eyes.\n\nHis warning that Labour would not accept a choice between the PM's Brexit deal or a no-deal Brexit opens up the prospect of an attempt to present some further option. But what? A new round of negotiation?\n\nPerhaps accompanied by an extension to the Article 50 deadline for Brexit?\n\nHis aside that Labour respected the referendum verdict would seem to rule out a call for a second referendum. A number of his senior colleagues are attempting to waft him towards a very soft Brexit position, and maybe more; today they got some Remain body language.\n\nEven more ominous was the intervention that followed from Conservative Brexiteer backbencher Peter Bone.\n\nHe normally wraps his political messages in a joke - this time he delivered a blunt, to-her-face warning that the PM's deal was unacceptable. It's the kind of attack from the benches behind that has failed to materialise at previous PMQs that may be a feature of future ones.\n\nThe prime minister fielded questions about other issues - the horrible crossbow murder in Ilford, rolling stock in Elmet and Rothwell, viaducts in Eddisbury, disabled veterans and many more, but the Brexit questions kept coming.\n\nSeveral MPs quoted departed transport minister Jo Johnson at her, and the questions he raised will not go away.\n\nThe PM could swat away outright calls for another referendum, but the SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, zeroed in on the idea that Scotland should have a similar customs union deal to that offered for Northern Ireland, an idea which alarms Scottish Tories, while Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts used a Brexit question to take a swipe at the Labour-led Welsh government in Cardiff.\n\nAnd at the end of it all a series of points of order established that the PM will probably be back tomorrow (Thursday) for a full-dress Commons statement on the deal - if it gets through Cabinet.\n\nThis was a mere appetiser for what promises to be a gruelling \"til they drop\" ordeal."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald film premiered in London.", "description": "It is the latest movie release set in the world of Harry Potter but is set decades before the events depicted in the first Potter story.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-46205902/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-film-premiered-in-london", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AB6B/production/_104338834_jkget.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:39:32Z", "content": "Video The film continues the story of Newt Scamander, writer of a famous book in the wizarding world called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

failures in relation to heart trace monitoring and realising the baby is in distress, delays in taking women for an emergency caesarean and issues with the wrong use of forceps\".\n\nWhat are the other problems?\n\nAs well as the midwife-led, independent review into alleged maternity errors, the trust in charge of both hospitals has also been placed in special measures.\n\nIt has faced criticism from the Care Quality Commission, whose inspectors assess the standard of services provided by a hospital.\n\nIn October, inspectors were so alarmed by what they saw on the trust's maternity and emergency wards in Shropshire that they ordered bosses to submit weekly status reports.\n\nA few weeks later, the trust received its third CQC warning in four months - highlighting staffing concerns in certain critical care and emergency areas.\n\nTwo days after that, the trust was placed in special measures - meaning it was no longer trusted to run itself alone.\n\nUnusually, the decision was taken by health service bosses before the CQC had made a recommendation to do so.\n\nNHS Improvement said it had identified a number of \"challenges\" which could threaten patient safety, including governance, staffing, urgent and maternity care and whistle-blowing issues.\n\nThe CQC said it would have been likely to recommend special measures, as it believed the trust would be unable to improve \"without external support\".\n\nChief executive Simon Wright said the trust welcomed the move and the \"extra support\" it would bring to ensure necessary improvements could be made.\n\nWhat's the next step?\n\nImage caption It is not known when Donna Ockenden's review will be published\n\nThe trust will receive \"enhanced support\", including additional funding, while in special measures, NHS Improvement said.\n\nThe trust is usually re-inspected by the CQC within 12 months of going into special measures, but this can be sooner if there are \"significant concerns about quality\", or if there is \"enough evidence of good progress\", the watchdog said.\n\nIf inspectors feel a trust has made enough progress, they will recommend it is taken out of special measures.\n\nWhere there has been insufficient progress, the CQC will consult with NHS Improvement to decide whether further action is needed.\n\nIt is not known when the Donna Ockenden review will publish its findings.\n\nHer website still carries an appeal for \"anyone who feels they have... significant questions that remain unanswered\" about their care at the trust to get in touch."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Claudio Ranieri: How Fulham fans greeted Italian's appointment", "description": "After Fulham sack Slavisa Jokanovic and immediately appoint ex-Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri, here's how the fans are feeling.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46208484", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/A657/production/_104338524_ranieri1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:28:42Z", "content": "Media playback is not supported on this device Welcome back to the Premier League Ranieri In one of the most \"outta nowhere\" moves we've seen in a while, Fulham have sacked their manager Slavisa Jokanovic and immediately appointed former Leicester City boss C\u2026 [+1259 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is not supported on this device Welcome back to the Premier League, Ranieri\n\nIn one of the most \"outta nowhere\" moves we've seen in a while, Fulham have sacked their manager Slavisa Jokanovic and immediately appointed former Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri.\n\nGary Lineker (of 'doing-Match-of-the-Day-in-his-Leicester-City-pants' fame), tweeted this...\n\n2018...\n\n...An exact replica of the one he wrote when his former club appointed the Italian back in 2015.\n\n2015...\n\nWell we all know how that ended...

Neither does 13 goals conceded in that time.\n\nBut perhaps the most damaging statistic is that Alex McLeish's side have scored only four goals so far this calendar year. One of those was an own goal, another a penalty, and of the two that Steven Naismith scored, one was a consolation in a 3-1 defeat by Portugal.\n\nThe absence of Naismith and fellow striker Leigh Griffiths because of injury for the Uefa Nations League games against Albania and Israel has left a vacancy in McLeish's attack.\n\nBut who can fill the void? BBC Scotland assesses the options...\n\nFour players, 10 goals... six of them against Gibraltar\n\nRecalled 13 months after his last cap, Steven Fletcher was one of the most notable inclusions in the squad. The Sheffield Wednesday forward had not featured at all since McLeish took control for a second time in early 2018.\n\nFletcher continues to be something of a conundrum for Scotland. He had a much publicised absence from international duty during Craig Levein's tenure, meaning he did not feature between August 2010 and October 2012. During that period, he scored 29 goals, mostly in the Premier League in England.\n\nSince returning to the international fold, he has scored 27 club goals in six years but most of those have been in England's Championship. He has three in 18 games this term.\n\nWith nine goals for Scotland, Fletcher is by some distance the top scorer in the squad but six of those - two hat-tricks - came against Gibraltar.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Inverness CT manager John Hughes on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nHe's only 31 - still a young boy, really - and he's playing regularly for Sheffield Wednesday. He's been there and done it and I think he'll start through the middle.\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nSteven's been there. He's experienced enough. If you're looking for an option that holds the ball up well, technically good, always a goal threat then Steven's more than capable of filling that void.\n\nScotland Women midfielder Leanne Crichton:\n\nI think he will be a shoo-in to start. I don't think a guy that's been out for 13 months, you would just bring him in to almost supplement the squad. He's brought him in knowing that he'll probably play.\n\nUnlike Fletcher, Matt Phillips has been involved in McLeish's squads this year and netted his debut international goal in the March win over Hungary.\n\nHe started as a lone striker in the friendlies against Costa Rica and Peru, as well as against the Hungarians, but his versatility means he could play with a more recognised number nine like Fletcher.\n\nPhillips, 27, has scored five times in 14 club appearances this season for West Brom and offers pace as well as power at the apex of the attack.\n\nThe 27-year-old's recent record at club level of four goals in 13 appearances is superior to that of Fletcher (three in 18).\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nMatty Phillips has done the job up front for Scotland and Alex McLeish seems to like him in that role.\n\nThough lauded for some of his performances at international level, Johnny Russell is yet to score for his country.\n\nThe former Dundee United and Derby County forward proved a good foil for Naismith in the opening 2-0 Nations League win against Albania at Hampden and has scored 10 goals for Major League Soccer side Sporting Kansas City this term.\n\nShould McLeish persist with his 3-5-2 formation, Russell seems a good bet to keep his place playing off one of the other strikers.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland forward Kris Commons on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nJohnny Russell is playing at a real good level - man of the match displays in America, involved in the play-offs. His contribution to Scotland over the previous games has been superb. He adds pace, he's clever, he can get hold of the ball.\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nJohnny Russell's played in the last few games as well and I think he's done excellent up there with Naismith. I think he's done okay, despite performances maybe not being quite up to scratch.\n\nSwansea City striker Oli McBurnie may be the underdog to lead Scotland's attack but he has scored more club goals this season than either Fletcher or Phillips - seven in 18 games.\n\nHe started in the friendly defeat by Portugal and came on in Israel last month, and has had a substantial amount of game time under McLeish in the past few months.\n\nMcBurnie has also proven he can score goals at under-21 level under Scot Gemmill's command.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nMcBurnie's started a game or two, and has been around the squad. Again, he's having a decent goalscoring start to the season with Swansea.\n\nFormer Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nFrom what I've seen of McBurnie, he's not set the heather on fire playing for Scotland.\n\nIs Paterson a left-field solution?\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing option is former Hearts defender Callum Paterson.\n\nThe 24-year-old has won each of his nine caps at either right-back or right wing-back, and is notionally in the squad to cover those positions.\n\nHowever, he has been deployed as a lone striker by Cardiff City in recent Premier League matches, scoring three goals in four games, and broke through at Hearts as a centre forward.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nCallum Paterson plays in a team that's so suited to their style of play and the athlete that he is. But I don't see his attributes being a link man holding it up and that is vital.\n\nFormer Australia striker Scott McDonald on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nIf you're playing away from home, I think you would be a little more inclined to play on the counter and I think Cardiff have been trying to do that. So why would you not throw him in there? He's got pace, he's got power, he's good in the air. If you're playing that out-and-out lone striker who wants to run the channels and be a nuisance all night, Paterson might be your man.\n\nSo what does McLeish do?\n\nBoth Celtic's James Forrest and Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser could also be considered, with the pace of the wingers a potential counter-attacking weapon in Albania. Between them, they have scored 11 times this term for the clubs.\n\nBut neither have scored for the national team. Celtic's Callum McGregor hasn't either. Nor midfielder counterpart from Aston Villa John McGinn.\n\nIn fact, among the rest of the squad, only captain Andrew Robertson and midfielder Stuart Armstrong have international goals to their name. And by goals, we mean one each.\n\nSo who would you select to play in attack in Shkoder?"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Ilford crossbow death: Help offers for Sana Muhammad's family", "description": "Pregnant mother Sana Mohammed was attacked in her home, but her unborn son was delivered safely.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46210474", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E36/production/_104303811_050583126.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:19:42Z", "content": "Image caption Sana Muhammad died in hospital on Monday Offers of help, including a pledge to cover funeral costs, have flooded in to the family of a pregnant mother killed in a crossbow attack in her own home.

She says there are plenty of misconceptions.\n\n\"People think I can't eat sweets, chocolate or cake,\" she says. \"I can eat it, I just have to take insulin.\"\n\nPeople with type 1 tailor their dose of insulin to the amount of carbohydrate in the food they're eating, but April says people don't always understand how dangerous the condition can be.\n\nWhen she was at university, a housemate drunkenly moved her insulin from the fridge to the freezer - and insulin doesn't work if it gets too cold.\n\n\"As it was frozen I had to throw it away,\" says April, saying she had only got the prescription two days previously. \"People don't realise how serious it is - it's someone's life on the line.\"\n\n'If I'm having a hypo, don't give me insulin'\n\nThe 21-year-old actress adds that in \"life or death situations\" most non-diabetics may not know what to do. Once, April says, her lunch plans with friends almost became fatal.\n\nApril had a \"hypo\", short for hypoglycaemia, meaning her blood sugar levels were too low. Hypos happen if the balance of medication - usually insulin - isn't right. Symptoms can include shaking, sweating, going pale, being anxious or irritable and blurred sight.\n\nThey can be caused by things like delaying meals, not having enough carbohydrate, doing lots of exercise or drinking alcohol on an empty stomach.\n\n\"My body was shutting down on me,\" she says. \"I was disorientated and I didn't have the energy to speak.\"\n\nBut when they were trying to help, her friends injected her with insulin - which made her levels even lower. When her condition did not improve, another friend was called who explained that she needed sugar, not insulin.\n\nIf someone has a hypo, they need a fast-acting carbohydrate - something sugary that will enter the bloodstream quickly.

He also wants more to be done in schools to educate children about the condition.\n\nDiabetes - the basics\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2. There are also other kinds like gestational diabetes, which develops during pregnancy.\n\nIn type 1, which is typically diagnosed earlier in life but can develop at any age, insulin has to be injected, either manually or through a pump. It can't be prevented or cured and it's not caused by lifestyle.\n\nPeople get type 2 when the insulin they produce isn't working properly, or not enough is being made. It can be linked to being overweight or inactive and also to family history. It's much more common than type 1, accounting for about 90% of all people with diabetes.

The final winners of each category are chosen by a blended vote between a jury of games industry professionals (90%), and the public (10%).\n\nWhile there are some predictable nominees in this year's line-up, YouTube producer and games critic Louise Blain believes some unexpected patterns emerged.\n\n\"What's really refreshing to see is that the majority of the game of the year awards are huge single player experiences,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"With all the discussion over the last few years of the future of games being depressingly described as an ongoing 'service', the success of games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and God of War shows that there's still an absolute love for brilliant single player games.\"\n\nGames as a service (GaaS) is industry jargon referring to how players are encouraged to spend more money through a steady drip feed of new in-game content.\n\n\"There's no denying the power of Fortnite, which is nominated elsewhere, but single player games aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nYou can read the full list of nominees across 23 categories below.\n\nGame of the Year\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey (Ubisoft Quebec / Ubisoft)\n\nCeleste (Matt Makes Games)\n\nGod of War

Of these, around a quarter are on the edge of extinction.\n\nThe \"winners\" in the new Red List include:\n\nThe mountain gorilla\n\nThere were around 600 mountain gorillas left in the wild in 2008; but numbers have now risen to over 1,000 after intensive conservation efforts. These include anti-poaching patrols and vets trained to give care to gorillas in the wild.\n\nThe gorilla is restricted to protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Threats remain, including poaching, civil unrest and diseases passed on by humans.\n\nBut while mountain gorillas are increasing in number, the great ape remains endangered.\n\nDr Liz Williamson of the IUCN primate specialist group said conservation action must continue.\n\n\"Coordinated efforts through a regional action plan and fully implementing IUCN Best Practice guidelines for great ape tourism and disease prevention, which recommend limiting numbers of tourists and preventing any close contact with humans, are critical to ensuring a future for the mountain gorilla,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fin whale: From endangered to vulnerable\n\nThe fin whale\n\nPopulations of this large whale - one of the biggest in the ocean - are on the rise, and have roughly doubled since the 1970s. There are now estimated to be 100,000 adults.\n\nThe western gray whale\n\nThis whale too is reaping the benefits of bans on commercial whaling. Numbers are starting to rise, albeit more slowly. However, this success could be derailed by threats from oil and gas development and commercial fisheries.\n\nImage copyright Oregon State University Image caption Western Gray Whale: From critically endangered to endangered\n\nRandall Reeves of the IUCN cetacean specialist group said it is a relief to see populations of both whales on the rise, but conservation efforts must continue.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"Large whales are, for the most part, doing pretty well - they show that if you stop killing them, they can recover. Not all populations of large whales are recovering - some of them were brought so low that they still may disappear.\"\n\nThe \"losers\" in the new Red List include:\n\nThe titan arum\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Blooming 'corpse flower': Endangered in the wild\n\nNicknamed the corpse flower, one of the world's largest and smelliest flowers has been assessed for the first time.

He will enjoy his new manager's popularity but he will also want his pragmatism and expertise to get results.\n\nRanieri's warm personality will lift some of the clouds over Fulham in an instant and they will also garner support among neutrals purely because of the Italian's presence.\n\nYes, it did go wrong in the final months at Leicester City but his methods were still enough to take an unheralded squad to unimaginable heights in the previous season.\n\nAnd they were not always conventional.\n\nWho can forget Ranieri's imaginary \"dilly-ding dilly-dong\" bell he claimed to use when players were not paying attention - even giving his players a small bell as a light-hearted Christmas present?\n\nEarlier in that glorious campaign Ranieri complained about a lack of clean sheets, promising his players a pizza as a reward. He duly delivered with a trip for his squad to a local pizzeria after his demand was fulfilled.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Ranieri wants to 'pay players with pizza'\n\nRanieri's man-management also fostered the sort of spirit Khan hopes he can reinvent at Fulham.\n\nLeicester City's players asked for a break if they got nine points from three tough games in February 2016. A last-minute loss at Arsenal meant they only got six - but Ranieri gave them their holiday anyway.\n\nAnd to show his human side, he spent the day Leicester City clinched the title - when Spurs only drew with Chelsea - in Rome celebrating his mother's 96th birthday.\n\nWhen his arrival at Leicester was questioned he said: \"I like to travel. I like to discover new places. I am like Christopher Columbus.\"\n\nBut will charm and affability be enough for what he will he discover at Craven Cottage?\n\nCan popular Ranieri get tough?\n\nThere is no doubt that Ranieri's charisma will be crucial in lifting spirits at a club that started the season high on optimism before plummeting to the foot of the table, despite spending \u00a3100m in the summer following promotion from the Championship.\n\nAnd Khan will be hoping he gets the Ranieri who inspired Leicester City to the Premier League on a tidal wave of momentum that saw his 'Tinkerman' reputation ditched in favour of continuity - although this Fulham side will certainly need some tweaking to achieve its potential.\n\nKhan will not want the second-season scenario at Leicester, where Ranieri's glory boys quickly went off the rails and the manager lost his sure touch to such an extent that he was sacked only nine months after his greatest moment, with the Foxes one point off the relegation zone.\n\nRanieri also left amid suggestions of discontent among the players and his own backroom staff. It was certainly not a happy ending to that mercurial management tenure.\n\nKhan, then, will want a manager with fire in his belly and a determination to end his Premier League story on a high after the disappointing end to his short time at Leicester, although the love he still inspires at the King Power was illustrated when he was back recently to pay tribute to owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha following his death in a helicopter crash.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Ranieri pays respects to Leicester owner\n\nWhat are Ranieri's biggest priorities?\n\nRanieri will walk into Fulham's secluded Surrey training ground and Craven Cottage to find plenty of sympathy for Jokanovic, who was actually his first signing as Chelsea manager.\n\nJokanovic took Fulham into the Premier League playing attractive attacking football and Tom Greatrex, chairman of the club's Supporters' Trust, said in a glowing testimonial: \"He will always go down as one of the great Fulham managers.\"\n\nIndeed, it was only two weeks ago that owner Khan delivered combative support for Jokanovic in his programme notes for the home game with Bournemouth in response to stories he was facing the sack, writing: \"I'm in equal parts amused, astonished and disappointed. I ask you not to believe everything you read. Or, in this case, don't believe anything you read.\"\n\nThe subsequent 3-0 loss to the Cherries, a damaging 1-0 reverse at fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town and Sunday's defeat at Liverpool meant things changed quickly - as Ranieri knows they can after his own sacking at Leicester.\n\nNow he must use his well-honed brand of charm and personal magnetism to not only lift a team short on confidence and low on morale, but also apply a fix to serious flaws in a Fulham side that was expected to live comfortably in the Premier League.\n\nFulham spent big in the summer to confirm the loan signing of Aleksdandar Mitrovic from Newcastle United for \u00a320m and bring in the likes of Jean Michael Seri from Nice for \u00a325m, Marseille midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa for \u00a322.3m and Germany World Cup winner Andre Schurrle on loan from Borussia Dortmund, as well as Swansea City defender Alfie Mawson for a deal that could eventually be worth \u00a320m.\n\nThere have been questions about how many of these deals were at Jokanovic's request but only Mitrovic has been a real success and the result has been an imbalanced, uninspired side that has lost its best attacking qualities and has also conceded more goals than anyone else in the Premier League - 31 - and has the worst goal difference at minus 20.\n\nCuring that defensive flaw will be his biggest challenge but he has proved he can do it before - while also getting those big-money buys to justify those lavish price tags.\n\nRanieri will arrive at Fulham on a tide of goodwill, despite replacing the much-admired Jokanovic, but Fulham's situation is so serious he may not be able to use the light touch immediately as one of management's most enduring and popular characters gets back to business."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "BBC African Footballer of the Year 2018: Five-man shortlist to be announced on Saturday", "description": "The shortlist for BBC African Footballer of the Year 2018 will be revealed on Saturday 17 November.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46207346", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/2BD7/production/_104332211_bbc_english_afoty2018_landscape_rgb.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:43:42Z", "content": "The shortlist for BBC African Footballer of the Year 2018 will be revealed on Saturday 17 November.

Having scored 63 and 78 to shift the first and fourth Tests against India in England's favour this summer, the 20-year-old made another vital half-century in trying circumstances.\n\nHis change of pace was ferocious - having largely defended in a stand of 45 with Adil Rashid, Curran was 16 off 65 balls when James Anderson arrived at the crease at 225-9, before the Surrey all-rounder scored 48 off his next 54 deliveries as they put on 60 for the last wicket.\n\nHe blasted six sixes before hitting his sole four and now has 14 sixes in his seven Tests - more than any other batsman in 2018 and more than Alastair Cook made in his entire career.\n\nHe had some luck - he was dropped on seven and 53, while Anderson successfully overturned a decision on review after being given out lbw first ball - but by the time he picked out long-off for the final wicket, Curran's innings had ensured the beleaguered hosts were visibly deflated as they left the field.\n\nFamiliar flaws on a tricky pitch\n\nJust as in Galle, England won the toss, batted with a positive approach and were in trouble early on, albeit more down to testing bowling than particularly reckless shots this time.\n\nThe flaws were all too familiar though - opener Keaton Jennings showing why doubts over his long-term place remain just one innings on from his unbeaten 146 as he again struggled against pace, prodding uncertainly at Suranga Lakmal to be caught behind for one.\n\nIt is too early to judge Ben Stokes' long-term candidacy as England's number three - he applied himself well before before he was squared up by Dilruwan Perera to fall lbw for 19, the ball straightening sharply and hitting the back leg, with Sri Lanka successfully overturning the initial not out decision on review.\n\nRoot was busy from the off but tried to defend an innocuous delivery from Pushpakumara with a large gap between bat and pad, the ball flicking both on its way to hit the stumps.\n\nThere were positives - Rory Burns hit 43, his highest score in his three Test innings to date, before nicking a fine, biting delivery by Akila Dananjaya to first slip.\n\nBen Foakes also looked assured following his century on his debut, although should have reviewed when given out for an apparent bottom edge that flicked off his and counterpart Niroshan Dickwella's pads before ending up at first slip, with replays suggesting the wicketkeeper had not hit it.\n\nBut, despite moving down from three to six, Moeen Ali's form with the bat remains a concern - the all-rounder playing across the line and out lbw on review for 10.\n\nButtler and Curran - together with Rashid's enterprising 31 - took England to a decent total but better sides will not let them recover from such perilous positions.\n\nPoor tactics let down Sri Lanka\n\nThat Sri Lanka let England off the hook was a result of some poor tactics in the field.\n\nTheir plans were too easily scrambled by Buttler's approach, with stand-in captain Lakmal leaving huge gaps square of the wicket for the England batsman to target and seemingly waiting for the miscue that took 63 runs to arrive.\n\nCurran and Anderson batted together for 66 balls but the tail-ender faced only 12 of those deliveries, with Curran routinely able to tap an easy single off the last ball of the over and keep the strike.\n\nThose mistakes let down an otherwise admirable bowling display by Sri Lanka's spinners.\n\nOff-spinner Dilruwan constantly threatened England's left-handers from round the wicket and returned to trap Rashid plumb lbw before dismissing Curran, while slow left-armer Pushpakumara picked up three middle-order wickets.\n\nAkila, who will be tested after being reported for a suspect bowling in the first Test, shrugged off that added scrutiny to bowl well, including a ripping delivery to dismiss Leach.\n\n'It's going to be a three-day Test' - analysis and reaction\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on the TMS podcast: \"It's been a riveting day. It looks like we're in for a three-day Test.\n\n\"I can't see how the pitch will get any better. If Sri Lanka can get close to England, it makes the third innings tricky.\n\n\"I think there's one low score in this match and if it's Sri Lanka's first innings, it's game over.\"\n\nEngland all-rounder Sam Curran on the TMS podcast: \"I was struggling for a bit of rhythm when I first got in but Adil Rashid got some crucial runs and then I just tried to take over from him.\n\n\"There is a ball on that wicket that is going to take your edge or hit your pads so it's hard to start on but once you're in you've got to try and cash in.\"\n\nEx-England bowler Ryan Sidebottom on The Cricket Social: \"Seeing the way Leach was causing problems at the end, I can't see Sri Lanka getting more than 150.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Leicester City helicopter 'did not respond to pilot's command'", "description": "Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in the crash alongside four others.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-46208494", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7A63/production/_104113313_heli2710petewhite.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:03:58Z", "content": "Image copyright Pete White Image caption The AW169 helicopter, pictured here landing at the stadium after the game The helicopter that crashed outside Leicester City's stadium, killing five people, did not respond to the pilot's command, initial findings show\u2026 [+2273 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off\n\nThe helicopter that crashed outside Leicester City's stadium, killing five people, did not respond to the pilot's command, initial findings show.\n\nClub chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others died when the aircraft came down after a match on 27 October.\n\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the helicopter started to turn right \"contrary to the pilot's left pedal command\".\n\nIt added the cause of the apparent loss of control is still being investigated.\n\nWidely shared video footage, taken inside the stadium, shows the AgustaWestland AW169 climbing normally for about 40 seconds, before it pauses and goes into a downward spin.\n\nSafety checks have been ordered on helicopters of a similar design to the one involved in the crash, and an investigation of the tail rotor control system is being \"carried out as a priority\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/Facebook/Instagram Image caption (L-R): Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash\n\nIn a Special Bulletin, the AAIB said the helicopter embarked on its first flight of the day from Fairoaks Airport in Surrey with the pilot and one passenger on board.\n\nIt later landed at London Heliport in Battersea where three more passengers boarded.

Lee left the Marvel company in 1972 but remained a chairman emeritus.\n\nIt's not often with a company as large as Marvel that one of the creators becomes such a well-known household name - Lee is almost as recognisable as the name Spider-Man.\n\nHe is known for creating compelling characters that people could relate to, as his comic book and storytelling ability inspired others to create.\n\nX-Men characters Professor Xavier and Magneto were allegories for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, while many fans have compared the gay rights parallel to the discrimination the X-Men often faced. Ian McKellan, who went on to play Magento in multiple movies once said that parallel was his reason for taking on the role.\n\nImage copyright Barcroft Image caption The X-Men were first created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963.\n\nLee had a fondness for portraying characters with flaws that the audience could relate to, such as the Hulk, possibly the strongest character in the Marvel universe, but that power, ultimately can not be controlled. Peter Parker, although gifted with his spidey-senses and superhuman agility and strength, was still a teenager dealing with normal teenager problems of negotiating homework deadlines and avoiding school bullies.\n\nAlthough most fans know the Hulk and Spiderman, some of Marvel's less high profile characters have roots in Scotland, and while Scottish characters are still rare in US comics, Lee has helped craft and inspire other Scottish creators as well.\n\nOne of the first Scottish characters in Marvel given a prominent role was Dr Moira MacTaggert, a geneticist who made her first appearance in Uncanny X-Men in 1975. Although the character was not a mutant, she founded a mutant research facility called Muir Island, an island chain off the coast of Scotland and had a on-and-off relationship with X-Men leader, Prof X.\n\nMoira has featured in multiple comics, and made two live action movie appearance, one with her native Scottish accent during X-Men 3, and again when she was portrayed by actress Rose Byrne in First Class, this time without the Scottish accent.\n\nAnother popular character, and eventual X-Man is the mutant Rahne Sinclair, a powerful Scottish born woman who goes by the mantle Wolfsbane. Again, created by Chris Claremont, Rahne has the ability to turn her body into both a wolf and a werewolf and has been a featured member of the X-Men team for years. She has teamed with Wolverine many times during their run in X-Men spinoff series, X-Force.\n\nShe will be making her big screen debut in 2019 when she is brought to life by Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams.\n\nMore recently Leo Fitz, one of the main characters on Marvel's television series S.H.I.E.L.D. is a Scottish born agent and scientist and there is even a Scottish Spider-Man called Peter Parquagh set in an alternative comic book Earth.\n\nNot only did Stan Lee inspire other comic book writers to create Scottish characters within the Marvel universe, he worked with two of the biggest names in comics today.\n\nGrant Morrison and Mark Millar, two Scottish born comic book writers have written Lee's characters in the past with great success.\n\nImage copyright Dave J Hogan Image caption The Game of Thrones actress with portray the Scottish hero in upcoming movie, The New Mutants\n\nMorrison MBE is a comic book writer and playwright and had a successful run on New X-Men, which was also illustrated by fellow Scot, Frank Quitely. Millar MBE is best known for his work on Kingsman: The Secret Service, Wanted and Civil War.\n\nRichmond Clements, a graphic novel writer from Northern Ireland, who has been living in Scotland for the past few years says \"Scotland easily punches above its weight\" in the comic world, but when it comes to US comics, Scottish characters are thin on the ground.\n\nClements said: \"Alan Grant always enjoyed bringing Marvel and DC characters to Scotland, and jokes about how little American editors would know about Scotland.\n\n\"A great example of Alan's mischief can be found in one of his Nick Fury tales, where the Marvel superspy had a top-secret base on top of the Old Man of Hoy. I'm sure it was no coincidence that the artist on this story - Cam Kennedy - lives on Orkney.\"\n\nComics in Scotland have become more popular over recent years, there is even a Comics and Graphic Novels degree course at Dundee University and in Saltire, a graphic novel set in a mythological Scotland, the genre has truly come home.\n\nImage copyright Diamondsteel Comics Image caption Set in a mythological Scotland, Saltire is inspired by real life places and events.\n\nMeanwhile Clements is currently writing his graphic novel which he described as \"the most Scottish comic possible\" - set to be released next summer. And Scots duo Gordon Rennie and Emma Beeby recently created the award winning Robert Burns Witch Hunter, which recasts the Nation's favourite poet as a crusader against the supernatural.\n\nClements thinks it is impossible to call yourself a comic creator, or fan, and not be in some way influenced by Stan Lee.\n\n\"It is not an exaggeration to say he is the most important figure in American comics ever - and there's a good argument to be made he's the most important figure in comics ever,\" he added.\n\n\"His characters have went from cheap, disposable comic books to now being the cornerstone of the biggest and most successful film franchise around. That is quite a legacy.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Addison Lee loses appeal on worker rights", "description": "Court upholds ruling that drivers are employees, not self-employed, in major blow to taxi company.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46209144", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AE6D/production/_104335644_dp3e_ebw4aeg1k3.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:28:59Z", "content": "Image copyright Addison Lee/ Twitter A claim that Addison Lee's drivers are employees, not self-employed contractors, has been upheld in a major blow to the taxi company.

The cost of oils and fats dropped by 6.3% compared with the previous month, while milk, cheese and eggs prices were down 1.4%.\n\nOverall food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropped by 0.2% in October. Clothing and footwear also dipped by 0.5%.\n\nBut gas and electricity prices both jumped by 2%, while liquid fuels soared by 7.2%.\n\nHow have manufacturers fared?\n\nLooking at the latest date, for manufacturers, the cost of raw materials was 10% higher than in October 2017.\n\nAnd manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 3.3% year-on-year compared with 3.1% the previous month.\n\nHow have house prices been affected?\n\nThe ONS said house prices in September rose by an annual 3.5% against 3.1% in August.\n\nBut prices in London fell for a third month running, down by 0.3%.\n\nWhat does this mean for interest rates?\n\nAnalysis by economics correspondent Andy Verity\n\nThere may not have been a change in the inflation rate, but there has been a change in expectations regarding when interest rates are likely to rise. In the City, the betting now is that the next upward move by the Bank of England is more likely than not to come as early as next May.\n\nThat would take the official rate to the giddy heights of 1%.\n\nBut is by no means obvious that rates will have to rise soon to tame inflation. If you strip out volatile items like food and fuel, so-called \"core inflation\" remains subdued at 1.9%.\n\nEven though wages are rising more strongly, there's little sign that prices are rising to compensate for those higher costs - rather, competition is holding prices down. Then again, the Bank of England has made no secret of its desire to \"normalise\" rates, so the markets may be right.\n\nIs there a Brexit factor?\n\nAccording to Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: \"Brexit is still the elephant in the room when it comes to the future path of inflation, and consequently of monetary policy.\n\n\"That's because the pound now waxes and wanes with the Brexit negotiations, and that has a big impact on how much UK consumers pay for imported goods."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Welcome back to the Premier League Ranieri - the Italian's best quotes", "description": "Claudio Ranieri returns to the Premier League as manager of Fulham - BBC Sport looks back at his most memorable quotes from his tenure as Leicester manager.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/36183010", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:46:33Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Claudio Ranieri returns to the Premier League as manager of Fulham - BBC Sport looks back at his most memorable quotes from his tenure as Leicester boss.\n\nREAD MORE: Fulham sack Slavisa Jokanovic and appoint Claudio Ranieri\n\nWATCH MORE: Leicester's title - a comic book celebration"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Pokemon Detective Pikachu movie filmed in Highlands", "description": "Starring a character voiced by Ryan Reynolds, the scenes were filmed in parts of Glen Nevis and Glen Affric.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-46207315", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C120/production/_104304494_mediaitem104304493.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:43:49Z", "content": "Image copyright Warner Bros Image caption Ryan Reynolds voices the character of Pikachu in the film Scenes for the upcoming Pokemon Detective Pikachu movie were filmed in the Scottish Highlands, it has emerged.

Slavisa Jokanovic was Claudio Ranieri's first signing as Chelsea manager in October 2000.\n\nRanieri's first game in charge will see Fulham host Southampton at Craven Cottage on Saturday, 24 November.\n\n\"I know this team is very capable of better performances, which we will work on straight away as we prepare for Southampton at the Cottage,\" he added.\n\nRanieri's rollercoaster - title shock to the sack\n\nClaudio Ranieri led Leicester City to the Premier League title in 2015-16 at odds of 5000/1\n\nDespite vast experience with clubs such as Valencia, Juventus, Inter Milan, Roma and Monaco, Ranieri joined Leicester City in 2015 on the back of a failed spell as Greece boss, including losing to European minnows the Faroe Islands during Euro 2016 qualifying.\n\nThe Italian had earned the nickname 'The Tinkerman' during his previous spell in England in charge of Chelsea, where he guided the Blues to second in the Premier League as well as reaching the Champions League semi-finals.\n\nMore than a decade later, his Leicester side started the 2015-16 season as 5,000-1 outsiders to win the Premier League and were among the favourites for relegation.\n\nBut the Foxes delivered one the greatest sporting shocks of all time as they clinched the club's first top-flight English title, described by many as a \"miracle\".\n\nThe fairytale could not continue, however, with Ranieri sacked the following campaign - just ninth months after delivering the title.\n\nJokanovic sacking 'correct decision'\n\nJokanovic, who joined the club in December 2015, led Fulham to promotion via the play-offs last season.\n\nBut they have so far registered just one win on their return to the Premier League after four seasons in the Championship.\n\n\"I wasn't anticipating having to make this announcement related to Slavisa and wish the circumstances were such that I didn't have to, but our path this season has led me to make what I know is the correct decision, at the right time, for our players, the club and our supporters,\" added Khan.\n\n\"Slavisa will always have my appreciation and respect for everything he did to return Fulham to top-flight football.\n\n\"I am hoping everyone in the Fulham family shares my heartfelt sentiments for Slavisa and joins me in wishing him success and good fortune, wherever his next stop may be.\"\n\nAnalysis - Can the Tinkerman keep Fulham up?\n\nPhil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer\n\nFulham's owner Shahid Khan delivered combative public support for manager Slavisa Jokanovic in his programme notes for the home game against Bournemouth less than three weeks ago, telling fans \"don't believe anything\" in reports he faced the sack.\n\nTimes change. Quickly.\n\nFulham were beaten 3-0 by The Cherries, then lost at fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town, and Sunday's defeat at Liverpool was the last straw. The man who guided The Cottagers to promotion was gone.\n\nKhan reacted as Fulham lay bottom of the Premier League, after a summer investment of \u00a3100m only resulted in an imbalanced side where few new faces had made an impact, a loss of the attacking impetus that was their trademark and the worst defensive record in the division.\n\nThe fear of relegation always overrules sentiment.\n\nSo it is welcome back to the Premier League for ever-popular Claudio Ranieri, whose title-winning deeds at Leicester City will be remembered forever.\n\nThis time he must work fast to turn a serious situation around with his brand of personal charm but more importantly his tactical acumen, starting with shoring up that porous defence.\n\nIt will be no easy task for 'The Tinkerman'."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Mathieu Flamini: Former Arsenal midfielder calls on footballers to 'use influence' to help important causes", "description": "Former Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini calls on footballers to use their influence to help important causes.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46205331", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/12FFF/production/_104332877_flaminiozil.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:09:02Z", "content": "Mesut Ozil and Mathieu Flamini have set up their own environmentally-friendly grooming brand Think footballers and you're probably imagining flash cars, designer clothes and impressive mansions.

Teams who finish bottom in each group are relegated (except those in the bottom division - and, as it has turned out, Group C1).\n\nTeams level on points are separated by head-to-head record before goal difference - for a more detailed breakdown, read below\n\nHow teams level on points are separated\n\n(Article 15.01 of 2018-19 Uefa Nations League regulations)\n\na. higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question;\n\nb. superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question;\n\nc. higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question;\n\nd. higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question;\n\ne. if after having applied criteria a) to d), teams still have an equal ranking, criteria a) to d) are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the remaining teams to determine their final rankings.

If I do well on a weekend, I think it pushes him. It motivates both of us.

Then it's like, 'Reiss, what you gonna do today?' I'm just like, 'Leave it, let's crack on'.\n\n\"We message each other every day and, if he's got a game a day before mine I'm like, 'Sanch, you know what you've got to do today, come on, do what you can do'.\n\n\"He says the same to me. It's a healthy relationship. We're encouraging each other but I don't think it's a rivalry thing. It will never be that for me.\"\n\nSancho agrees.\n\n\"Me and Reiss, growing up together, playing together when we were younger - we've got a strong bond,\" he said.\n\n\"We banter a bit! When we played Hoffenheim, we drew that game but the banter you know will always be [there].\"\n\nSo should other young players move abroad?\n\nPlayers aged 21 or under accounted for just 5.3% of all Premier League minutes played this season up until last weekend. That's lower than the French, German, Italian and Spanish leagues, according to research by a CIES study.\n\nAnd in terms of English-qualified players of any age, there has been an average of 29.8% starting Premier League games this season. Taking a snapshot of last weekend's fixtures, that figure was 21.2% among the traditional top six clubs of Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Spurs, Arsenal and Manchester United.\n\n\"If English clubs are not giving you a chance then abroad is always an option,\" said winger Sancho. \"They're always open to just seeing your ability and, hopefully, if you're good enough then you get your chance. That's how I felt.\n\n\"That's what the Bundesliga is about. They believe in you, they trust you and, even if you're so young, they wouldn't get you out here if they didn't really believe in your ability.\n\n\"I'm not saying English clubs don't believe in your ability, I'm just saying I think they [Bundesliga clubs] look at it earlier than the English clubs will do.\"\n\nNelson, who claimed the Bundesliga's rookie of the month award for October, added: \"Sanch started the trend, I'd say. I call him every day and he's obviously saying we are kind of setting the trend for the young boys to come over.\n\n\"I know a lot of the top [young] players in England as well and they're always saying, 'How is life in Germany, how is the Bundesliga?' and I'm just saying, 'It's great'.\n\n\"They believe in young players and that's the main thing. Getting the belief behind you to play football.\n\n\"It might not be so good for England if they [young players] all leave, but on a personal level, I think it will be great for young players to get playing time and show everyone what they can do.\"\n\nWhy did you move abroad and how good has it been?\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Reiss Nelson hits brilliant free-kick\n\nSancho left Manchester City and joined Dortmund for \u00a310m in August 2017. He turned down a new deal that City manager Pep Guardiola said he had agreed to sign as he went in search of regular first-team football.\n\n\"I just felt I was ready for the next step and I felt Borussia Dortmund was a great club to move to and develop my career,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"It's taking my game to a different level, only because I'm playing and getting the chance to show the world what I can do on the pitch.\"\n\nEngland Under-21 striker Nelson left Arsenal on a season-long loan.\n\n\"For me, I always want to be the best player I can be,\" he said. \"I'm 18 and I thought going to the Bundesliga will give me a challenge and doing that would make me become a better footballer and a better person as well throughout life.\n\n\"I wanted to challenge myself and see what I could do. It's going well so far.\n\n\"It's incredible. But I've just got to keep it up. It's not just for the six games, I've got to do it throughout the season.\n\n\"I don't know where it's going to take me, but I've just got to keep my feet on the ground and keep positive.\"\n\nWhat's life like in Germany?\n\nSancho is in the more metropolitan city of Dortmund compared with the quieter town of Heidelberg, where Nelson has chosen to live.\n\n\"I like it. I've settled down now - got my apartment and I'm loving it here,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"The city is nice. I go for little strolls, I'm getting to learn the language as well, so everything's going well so far.\n\n\"My dad's over here at the moment, so he's just looking after me. I've actually got a chef - Dortmund recommended him and he's helped me a lot, keeping me healthy and in shape.\n\n\"There's a lot of foreigners in the dressing room so I think it's just normal to them, but it's nice to be around everyone. There are different cultures and you get to learn different things.\"\n\nNelson has swapped the bustle of London for a town which, according to Wikipedia, has \"roughly a quarter of its population being students\".\n\n\"London is a very big place but I'm in a small town called Heidelberg and I'm here with my family,\" said Nelson. \"I'm happy at the moment and I'm playing, so it's all going well.\n\n\"It [Hoffenheim] is a small little village. I've got my mum and my brother here - they're exploring Heidelberg and they say to me they love it, so that's just all good for me.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can speak a bit of German. I'm having German lessons and it's going well. The boys banter me sometimes, the way I speak, but that's just what comes with it.\"\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nNelson (left) and Sancho have 11 goals between them so far this season\n\nSancho's form has led to him breaking into the England squad and he made his debut in a goalless draw in Croatia on 12 October. He came on for Raheem Sterling after 78 minutes and produced an impressive cameo appearance.\n\n\"I feel like I'm just doing my job really, I don't really look at myself as the next big thing,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm just here to do my job and I just want to play - that's the love of the game really.\n\n\"I think if I keep this up I can go a long way, but I've just got to keep grounded and keep focused.\"\n\nSancho added: \"Right now I'm just focused on season-by-season, game-by-game. I couldn't really tell you the future.\n\n\"But, country-wise, I hope I get more senior caps, that would be fantastic for me and my family. I've just got to keep on working hard and you never know what's next.\"\n\nNelson moved to Hoffenheim on the back of signing a new long-term contract with Arsenal and Gunners fans can rest easy when he talks about his next destination.\n\n\"Arsenal are my boyhood club,\" he said. \"I've been with them since I was eight, so that's 10 years.\n\n\"I just want to go back there stronger because at the time I was at Arsenal I was 16, 17 and I didn't feel confident.\n\n\"I didn't think I was a man, but now I'm feeling stronger and I think a couple more months or even a year in Hoffenheim will make me strong and give me the belief and confidence to go back to Arsenal and do very good there.\n\n\"I want to be an Arsenal legend. And, for England, it's the best.

We were playing against Leicester; Jeffrey Schlupp was playing up and down the wing in front of me, had made a bad challenge, and I got into him.\n\nI got his attention and we exchanged a few choice words before I gave him the bird as he jogged off. About five minutes later he scored and celebrated in front of me while holding eye contact with me the whole time. Not really much I could say at that point...\n\nTom from Stafford\n\n'Your dad's rubbish at advertising'\n\nHi Peter - I work in advertising and know your dad Bruce slightly. When you were on loan at Norwich, you came up to Deepdale. You were in the Preston box and I was behind the goal.\n\nI shouted out something along the lines of, \"You're rubbish and your dad's rubbish at advertising.\" Because it was obvious that I must know your dad in some capacity you lost concentration and scanned the crowd for a moment.\n\nJust so we're clear: your dad was a great creative. I was saying it to put you off.\n\nMick\n\nHasselbaink handbags\n\nI was at Chelsea v Arsenal when the away fans were down the side of the main stand.\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink came over to get the ball and my mate shouted, \"Oi Hasselbaink, your backside is massive in those shorts!\" - just as there was a lull in the singing, and everyone heard it.\n\nThe stand seemed to laugh and I laughed out loud too but just as I laughed, Jimmy looked round and stared straight at me with those massive eyes.\n\nHe stayed there staring for what seemed like minutes. I kept pointing to my mate but he wasn't having any of it. Jimmy shook his head and I felt that my days were numbered.\n\nJonathan\n\nWiki woe\n\nA couple of mates and I went to Oxford v Cambridge at the Kassam Stadium. In the second half, we were standing near the Cambridge keeper of the time, Chris Dunne.\n\nOne of my mates had his Wikipedia page up on his phone and we were giving him abuse based on his playing stats over the years, saying stuff like: \"What happened at Yeovil in 2013-14, Chris? Why weren't you good enough to play?\"\n\nAfter 20 minutes of our heckling, he dropped the ball and got it taken around him by a striker.\n\nAlthough the striker hit the bar we still believe that we broke him down mentally and caused that mistake.\n\nJames\n\nSqueaky voice time\n\nI was 15 years old, and we were at a non-league game at Altrincham FC. The goalkeeper was getting abuse hurled at him from behind the goal all game from about 200 fans. I decided to get involved and picked out one of his weaknesses, and I plucked up the courage to hurl my witty abuse.\n\nI shouted at the top of my voice: \"Keeper, you've got small feet!\" As I did, the whole stand went quiet and everyone heard me say it. Even the keeper turned round as my voice, which hadn't yet broken, went as high-pitched as humanly possible, not helped by the realisation of how rubbish my insult was.\n\nSafe to say, I shrivelled into a cocoon and have never publicly insulted a player at a football match again.\n\nChris\n\nGiving Uriah heaps\n\nWhen at a Stockport County game some years ago, I stood up in the main stand as the players went into the tunnel at half-time and shouted towards the referee, Uriah Rennie: \"It's because of performances like that, you're reffing in League Two!\"\n\nHe stopped shy of the tunnel, looked at me with genuine sorrow, then looked down at his feet and trudged into the tunnel.\n\nI've never been able to forget his hurt expression. Sorry Uriah.\n\nPhil from Hazel Grove\n\nRebel Neville\n\nI need to apologise to the Neville brothers. During their time playing for Manchester United together, my football club, Blackburn Rovers were also playing in the Premier League. I sat in the Jack Walker Stand, lower tier, pitch side. Impeccable seats.\n\nFor whatever reason, Sir Alex Ferguson opted to play Phil on the right wing, with Gary behind him at right-back. The Neville right-side double.\n\nAnd so for the entirety of the second half, with both players in front of me as Gary overlapped Phil, I sang the Chuckle Brothers theme tune to the Neville brothers.\n\nI genuinely feel like I put them off their game. Without doubt they recognised the chant, as I was acknowledged while Gary took a throw-in. Phil, especially, played dreadfully.\n\nI'm not sure if Phil ever played on the right wing again. I do know that shortly after, he was shipped off to Everton. I would like to think that game alone didn't have anything to do with the decision to let him go.\n\nThank you for this opportunity.\n\nJosh\n\nBolton boo-boys\n\nAfter spending a season at Bolton Wanderers in their Championship relegation year, I'd like to apologise to David Wheater and Dorian Dervite for suggesting that the defence would have put up more of a fight had they stabbed a pair of upside-down broomsticks into the turf and hung shirts on them.\n\nHaving said that, they would have at least held a decent defensive line.\n\nCraig Thompson\n\nJeers for Jenko\n\nWanted to take the opportunity to apologise to one of my favourite Arsenal players, Carl Jenkinson. We love him because he's a fan and chose to have the same number as Kanu.\n\nI was at a League Cup match, Arsenal v Southampton, and I was sitting at the side where Jenko was having a poor game. Forgetting how close I was, I shouted, \"Jenko! Bloody play better!\"\n\nI did not realise quite how close I was and he looked up at me, visibly upset. Which made me feel terrible.\n\nWhat followed was Mathieu Debuchy getting rushed back from injury and getting hurt again, eventually leaving after very few Arsenal games, and Wenger saying to the press that Jenko has lost confidence (he then didn't play for Arsenal for two years).\n\nI feel so bad that I ruined potentially two players' Arsenal careers, and would like to apologise to Jenko and Debuchy. If nothing else it's nice to get it off my chest.\n\nHarry\n\nTwo faces\n\nMy apology is for Ben Garratt, who plays for Crewe Alexandra.\n\nOn 26 August 2017, I watched Port Vale lose to local rivals Crewe. I spent 90 minutes berating Ben, the Crewe 'keeper.\n\nAfter the game, I bumped into him in the car park. My reaction was to compliment him on his performance, have a photo with him and wish him well for the season.\n\nThis was a totally natural reaction after having spent the previous few hours screaming all sorts of expletives at him.\n\nEd (From Stoke but a Vale fan)\n\nTwo faces, part two\n\nIn the late 1990s (I'm now 41) I used to give the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Ben Roberts a really hard time from the stands.\n\nLater on that season I managed to go along for a few trial games for Middlesbrough. The goalkeeper in the two games I played was Ben Roberts. Being a central defender, I was in close proximity to Ben for all of the two games and I felt really guilty for having slagged him off from the terraces only a few weeks earlier as he was genuinely a nice lad and tried to help me out in the games.\n\nThe only opportunity I got to speak with him really after the game. So I found myself over compensating and being over friendly with Ben Roberts in the showers. Must have been a bit weird for him, as it was for me too.\n\nI didn't make it as a footballer. I'm now a civil engineer.\n\nAlan Robinson\n\nOuch for Crouch\n\nThis has been eating away at me for years. It was Old Trafford, England v Poland. We'd just qualified for Germany. Sven was in charge and Becks wasn't playing. The game was cracking. Lamps and Owen scored if I remember correctly.\n\nSomehow my friends and I were sitting pretty much next to Sven and the bench. So while everyone was watching the exciting game we noticed Sven getting ready to make his notorious, game killing substitutions. So we started shouting \"Noooo!\" and then \"Booo!\"\n\nUnfortunately the crowd around us caught on just as Peter was preparing to come on and suddenly everyone was booing Crouchy.\n\nI always felt guilty for starting the booing which was never intended to be aimed at Peter. Crouch, you are a legend.\n\nDavid in Worcester"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/14 06:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31lt3j46", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Reiss Nelson and Jadon Sancho: Friends not rivals", "description": "Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson, who have been making their mark in the Bundesliga, tell BBC Sport that their friendship motivates them, but it's not a \"rivalry\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/46200802", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:05:17Z", "content": "Teenagers Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson, who have been making their mark in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim respectively, tell BBC Sport that their friendship and form motivates them to do better, but it's not a \"rivalry\".

Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go.\n\nIf 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence.\n\nMeanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which supports Mrs May's government in key votes - warned of \"consequences\" if there is a deal that \"breaks up the United Kingdom\".\n\nCrunch cabinet meeting\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Penny Mordaunt said nothing as she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday\n\nThe BBC's Norman Smith said the prime minister would seek to head off the threat of any resignations by telling her cabinet ministers that while not perfect, the agreement was as good as it can get.\n\nDowning Street, he added, were pointing to what they view as significant wins, including no separate customs border for Northern Ireland and an arbitration mechanism to ensure the UK can exit the proposed \"backstop\" customs plan.\n\nJust ahead of the cabinet meeting, all 13 Scottish Tory MPs, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, signed a letter to the prime minister saying they would not support a Brexit deal that prevents the UK from negotiating its own fishing quotas.\n\nAccess and quotas \"cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership\" and the UK must leave the Common Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020, they added.\n\nWhat's been agreed?\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement addresses the Northern Ireland \"backstop\", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations that involves not having a physical border.\n\nThis has proven the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.\n\nThe backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a \"hard border\" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.\n\nHowever, some Brexiteers fear this will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years.\n\nThe agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\".\n\nThe future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf the cabinet signs it off, the EU Commission is expected later to publish the details of the 500-page draft withdrawal agreement as well as the much shorter declaration on future economic and security relations.\n\nAmbassadors from the remaining 27 EU member states will discuss the possibility of organising an emergency summit later this month to sign off on it.\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar has signalled the summit could take place on 25 November.\n\nIf this happens, the government will then face a battle to win Parliament's backing, in a vote the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nWith some Tories vowing to vote against it and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which Mrs May relies on to win key Commons votes - also expressing concern, it is not clear which way the vote will go.\n\nBrexiteer Conservative MPs were first to criticise the agreement, based on leaks of it, saying it would keep the UK under EU control.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Peter Bone said the reported agreement would not \"deliver\" on what people voted for and risked \"losing the support of many Tory MPs and millions of voters across the country\".\n\nBut Mrs May, who is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, said the agreement would leave the UK free to do its own trade deals while the customs union \"backstop\" would be temporary.\n\nAnd Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was \"confident\" the deal would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\n\nIt doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document.\n\nIt's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament.\n\nOne source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament.\n\nSlamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down.\n\nWhat are the parties saying?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption MPs react to reports about the draft text of a Brexit agreement\n\nFormer foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the reported agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop as \"utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy\", and said he would vote against it.\n\nLeading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told BBC Newsnight he was so unhappy with the agreement he was considering calling on Mrs May to quit as PM.\n\nThe DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today that from \"what we have heard... this deal has the potential to lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom and that is not something we can support\".\n\nAnd the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK was heading towards a Brexit that would \"cost jobs\" and urged MPs to \"think about your constituents' interests, think about jobs, think about prosperity\".\n\nBut one of Mrs May's allies, former first secretary of state Damian Green, criticised \"hyperbole\" from people who had not read the document.\n\nAnd former Conservative leader Lord Hague urged the cabinet to \"stick together\" - saying the draft agreement contained a \"lot of compromises\" but would allow the UK to regain control of immigration, fishing and farming.\n\nView from the EU\n\nBy BBC Europe editor Katya Adler\n\nWhat's so striking about this draft Brexit deal the UK media and politicians are all abuzz about, is the marked lack of excitement and/or hysteria in EU circles.\n\nContrary to the UK narrative, this is not viewed in Brussels as the back-against-the-wall, make-or-break moment.\n\nThere's still some time to keep negotiating. EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the \"i\"s, nor all the \"t\"s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed.\n\nThe thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Lion Air crash: Victim's fianc\u00e9e takes wedding photos alone", "description": "The young woman says her partner had joked she should take the photos alone should he be delayed.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46204053", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13878/production/_104329997_2f737006-6ec7-4599-8730-b37dedf22ba6.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T04:08:07Z", "content": "Image copyright Instagram/intansyariii Image caption Intan Syari says she's fulfilling her partner's last wish An Indonesian woman whose fianc\u00e9 was on a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea has gone ahead with her wedding pictures alone.

These children tend to be aged between 5.5 and 6 years old at the time they start school.\n\nChildren in Northern Ireland begin compulsory education earlier than children in the rest of the UK, at four years old. But if a child turns four between 2 July and 31 August of a given year, they will not begin compulsory education until the following September.\n\nA petition has been submitted to the Welsh assembly asking AMs to consider automatically to allow requests for children born between 1 April and 31 August to start reception a year later; or failing that, placing more emphasis on councils to fully consider requests.\n\nSome parents of summer-born and premature babies want their children to start formal schooling later as they fear there is an impact on the child's ability and confidence when they compare themselves with older classmates.\n\nThe Welsh Government said: \"Our school admissions code is clear that admission authorities should consider requests for admission outside the normal age group carefully. Any decisions should be made on the basis of the circumstances of each case and in consultation with the parents and the school, and specifically in relation to what is most beneficial to the child.\n\n\"The cabinet secretary expects local authorities to apply this conscientiously.\n\n\"As part of our review we will work with admission authorities to ensure that they are applying the guidance consistently.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son", "description": "Californian wildfires survivor Sorrell Bobrink fled her home in Paradise, California with her son.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-46203963/california-wildfires-survivor-s-tearful-account-of-escape-with-son", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A78C/production/_104329824_p06rpng4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T01:34:56Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nA survivor of the Californian wildfires, which have killed at least 42 people, has told the BBC of her escape.\n\nSorrell Bobrink, whose neighbourhood has been completely destroyed, fled the town of Paradise with her son and pets.\n\nShe described a journey through roads surrounded by flames and feelings of chaos and shock at how quick the fire took over.\n\nDozens of people remain missing as California continues to burn.

They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.\n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness.\n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A boat in Bissau harbour preparing to make the journey to the Bijagos\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.\n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments.\n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes. It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation.\n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Dr Anna Last examining a patient for trachoma\n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission.\n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present.\n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination.\n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it.\n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world.\n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nOccasionally attracts intrepid explorers, but not a typical holiday destination\n\nGetting to the islands can be treacherous, particularly in the rainy season, when storms can come out of nowhere and cause large swells\n\nThe journey from the mainland takes at least five hours, on a small ferry packed with people and animals\n\nThere are few health centres, with the largest on the main island of Bubaque - medical supplies are limited\n\nWhile medical professionals provide the best care they can, remoteness and inaccessibility at times make this difficult\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe. Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.\n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Researchers from LSHTM leaving Rubane island following a mosquito survey\n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides.\n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Islander Ansulmani collecting mosquito larvae using the dipping method\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the \"intervention\" islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the \"control\" islands, will not.\n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria.\n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist, on the islands.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Ba is studying to be an entomologist\n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen.\n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands.\n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research.\n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population.\n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. The two-year study towards infectious disease elimination on the Bijagos Islands was funded by UK Research and Innovation.\n\nProf James Logan is head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

For now, at least.\n\nMoves has a signature Ed Sheeran quality to it - which makes sense, when you learn The Shape of You star co-wrote it - mixed with Murs's trademark upbeat bounce.\n\nThe infectious Liam Payne-esque Take Your Love was also co-written by Murs and appears to make reference to the singer's life in the limelight.\n\n\"Everybody knows your business in this town, but you can't help it...\" run the track's lyrics.\n\nMurs, who is currently single, has previously said he finds dating difficult because of his fame, and says he feels under \"constant pressure\" from media scrutiny.\n\n\"You get it all the time, we're in the public eye so we're always open to it, annoyingly.\n\n\"It's never easy because if you're in a relationship, the media are always going to try and make up stories and try and find information out - or they sometimes write lies about you.\n\n\"But it's about just staying strong as the person you are and trying to not let it affect you - but it is difficult. It's not easy,\" he concedes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Murs disputes that he and Simon Cowell are not on speaking terms and says the pair are friends\n\nThe singer, a regular feature of tabloid articles, says he tries not to respond to fake stories written about him and says he hopes his loved ones also know better than to believe them.\n\n\"If some of my friends and family would believe that sort of story then that's their own fault,\" he says frankly. \"They should know to speak to me first or ask me about it.\"\n\nMurs calls press intrusion \"part and parcel\" of life, saying resignedly: \"It doesn't matter what I say or what I do because everyone has their own opinion - that's the whole world we live in now: that's 2018.\n\n\"You have an opinion, you're on Twitter, you can say what you want.\"\n\nSelfridges: 'You weren't there'\n\nMurs addresses the particular criticism he received after tweeting there were gunshots at the central London department store, Selfridges, while Oxford Street tube station was in lockdown.\n\nPiers Morgan was among those to chastise the singer on the platform, saying Murs \"stirred extra needless panic by tweeting false information\".\n\nThe star, who has 7.5 million followers on Twitter, is robust in his response: \"People can tweet and say what they want but you weren't there. If you're not there, you don't know the situation.\n\n\"You can have an opinion if you were there, but you weren't. Yes, I tweeted something that was wrong - but what if it was right? I didn't know at the time.\n\n\"I was being fed information by a senior member of Selfridges that there was something happening on the floor. There were potential gunshots, so I [was] only giving people what I heard.\n\n\"Luckily everyone's safe and everyone's out of the building and nothing happened.

while his mum washed dishes in the campus canteen - that Prof Hedges realised the opportunities a degree could bring.\n\nFast-forward half a lifetime, and that young boy is now a leading academic, chairman of the department of statistics and professor of education at Northwestern University, Illinois.\n\nAt a ceremony in Hong Kong, Prof Hedges will receive this year's Yidan Prize for education research, worth $3.9m (\u00a33m), with half awarded as a cash prize and the rest to support his research into studying what really works in improving education.\n\nBeing the first in his family to go to university was \"life-changing\", says Prof Hedges.\n\nHe is \"passionate\" about others getting similar opportunities, but he says it's a \"hard question to answer\" whether today's youngsters have the same chance of social mobility.\n\nDoors still open?\n\n\"I think that there's still plenty of opportunity, but I'm not so sure that it's better than it was 30 years ago,\" he says.\n\nAs a child, when he spoke about going to university his mother would say: \"Well, that's a good ambition but I'm not sure people like us can do that.\"\n\nImage caption Prof Hedges has won a major prize for his work in education research\n\n\"When she talked about that, there was a consciousness of social class in her mind,\" he says.\n\nHe believes she was trying to spare him from \"getting slapped down for trying to step out of my place\".\n\nThe turning point was wandering around a college campus as his mother washed \"pots and pans\" in the cafeteria.\n\nHe walked through an open door into a chemistry lab and met a graduate student.\n\nThis was the first time in his life, Prof Hedges says, that he had \"a concrete idea of what it would be like to be a scientist, or to work in a university\".\n\nReaching out\n\nA good student, in 1970, at age 18, he won a prestigious Regents Scholarship to study mathematics and physics at the University of California at San Diego.\n\nA stint working on improving opportunities for disadvantaged students at the university followed, where he first discovered the field of education research.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt is unlikely that disadvantaged students today would be exposed to the potential of a college education in the same way, he acknowledges.\n\nBut there are efforts to reach these youngsters.\n\n\"I think that things have changed a lot, and probably it would be harder to walk into that lab because there are probably now many more safety restrictions.\n\n\"On the other hand there are, at least in the US, more efforts to extend the reach of the university to places where university is unfamiliar.\"\n\n'Keys to opportunity'\n\nAt Northwestern there is an initiative which recruits 14 and 15 year olds from Chicago state schools with the aim of preparing and encouraging them to apply to US elite universities.\n\n\"One of the things that makes me happiest is that the universities themselves have been agents of change,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Northwestern University encourages applications from state schools in Chicago\n\n\"Rather than sitting in their own ivory towers and lamenting the fact that not many disadvantaged students seem to come to their university, most universities are trying to do things to reach out to those communities - and not just encourage people to come, but make it more likely that they'll be able to come.\"\n\nMany top US universities offer generous financial aid to students who would otherwise be unable to afford to attend, Prof Hedges says, although perception of cost is still a challenge.\n\nWould-be students also need the \"knowledge not only that going to college is a good thing, but that it makes a difference which college you go to\".\n\nProf Hedges says that while to some, \"going to the community college down the street may seem appealing\", attending a top university can give people \"a whole different range of opportunities\".\n\n\"For better or worse, the most elite universities are the keys to the most opportunity, at least in the US.\"\n\nProf Hedges says the long term \"holy grail\" is to figure out how to organise the education system and teach children so that they all excel at a high level.\n\n\"You can teach almost any child almost anything that the best students know, or are able to do.\n\n\"We know that it's possible to achieve excellence for all, we just don't know how to make it happen,\" he says.\n\nMore from Global education\n\nThe editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk)."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Maseratis and cruise ships", "description": "Punching well above its weight, impoverished Papua New Guinea is hosting this year's Apec meeting.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46176440", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10AD6/production/_104301386_epa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:08:46Z", "content": "Image copyright EPA Image caption Most locals aren't exactly fans of the summitry Papua New Guinea (PNG) might be the least likely place to spot world leaders shaking hands.

It's deemed to be too dangerous to be out after that time.\n\nInternational troops\n\nIt is no surprise then that in the run-up to the event, the summit's unlikely location has largely overshadowed news about the actual agenda.\n\nSo how does PNG plan to stage an event like this?

When she started using the unit she had no permanent living space and it was a way for her to keep all her things in one place.\n\n\"This little box is also my home,\" she says.\n\nAngela is not the only person willing to shell out for extra space to store her things.\n\nThere are now around 1,500 self-storage sites in the UK, with use of them up almost 9% last year on 2016, according to the most recent industry figures from the Self-Storage Association UK (SSA).\n\nImage copyright Everett Collection Inc / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption Cash stash: In Breaking Bad self-storage was used to hide the illicit gains from a crystal meth lab\n\nThe industry's reputation has been shaped by TV and films, where they're often used as a hiding place for a dead body or stolen goods.\n\nIn horror film Silence of the Lambs, serial killer Hannibal Lecter uses one to store a severed head, whilst in cult TV series Breaking Bad a unit was used to stash the illicit gains from a crystal meth lab. Even on the reality TV show Storage Hunters, snakes and a naked man have been stashed away in units.\n\nThe reality is much more prosaic. The contents of these giant warehouses, which loom over busy road junctions or are situated in industrial parks, are typically the mundane realities of day-to-day life - cooking equipment, spare mattresses, books or bikes.\n\nMost people turn to them at a significant junction in their lives - they've had a child, got married, separated or divorced, or they're moving house or redecorating and they need somewhere to store their stuff temporarily.\n\nBut for an increasing number of people, like Angela, self-storage has become a longer term option. Almost a third of customers have had their unit for over three years. And over a quarter of users (27%) say they use storage because there is no room for the items where they live.\n\nImage caption Self-storage is cheaper than renting or buying a larger home\n\nThe average household in the UK is 2.4 persons, larger than both Germany and France, yet we have the smallest average property size, making the UK population \"one of the most squeezed in Europe\", according to the SSA.\n\nSo it's not surprising that people are turning to self-storage, with it cheaper to rent extra space than it is to buy or rent a bigger home, says Rennie Schafer, chief executive of the SSA.\n\nA \"room away from home\" is how he describes it.\n\n\"People know their stuff is safe and with most self-storage units offering 24-hour access they can get to their goods whenever they want to.\"\n\nBut it's not cheap. Mr Schafer estimates \"as a very general guide\" that a 90-sq-ft unit, which would easily accommodate the contents of a three-bedroom house, would be around \u00a3150-\u00a3200 per month in London and \u00a3100-\u00a3150 per month in the North of England.\n\nImage copyright Attic Self Storage Image caption Frederic de Ryckman de Betz says he wishes he'd held on to more of his mother's things\n\nShouldn't people just get rid of things?\n\n\"It's human nature to hoard and keep things,\" says Frederic de Ryckman de Betz, the founder and owner of Attic Self Storage.\n\nHe says the number of \"lifestyle customers\" who are keeping storage long term are increasing.\n\n\"People might discover it when they move house, but once they move in and it's all nice and clean the last thing they want to do is clutter it all up, so they leave their stuff in storage.\"\n\n'I wish I'd kept more'\n\nMr De Ryckman de Betz discovered the industry when a relative died in Belgium and he had to deal with their belongings. He used it again when his mother died.\n\nHe only used self-storage temporarily, but now wishes he had kept the unit for longer.\n\nThis would have given him time to realise the emotional value of some of his mother's items, such as her collection of dresses from the 1960s, he says.\n\n\"When you experience a loss like that you're not in the right place to make those decisions. With the benefit of hindsight I wish I'd kept more.\"\n\nBut the fact that he struggled to find an available unit and that, when he did, the rent on it was put up twice in just 18 months made him realise it was an attractive industry.\n\n\"The more I looked into it, the more I realised it was a good sector, a growing business,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Julia Weiland rents a self-storage unit across the road from her office\n\nIt's not just individuals driving the self-storage boom.\n\nAround a quarter of self-storage users are small businesses, attracted by the fact they don't have to commit for a long period. Typically you can leave with just a month's notice and crucially you don't need to pay business rates on the premises.\n\nThey too often use self-storage to supplement more expensive office space.\n\nJulia Weiland runs a direct marketing agency specialising in events. She has an office across the road from the self-storage unit we meet at, but still rents a unit to store clients' props and samples.\n\n\"It's just much more convenient. We wouldn't be able to store the stuff for all our different clients in the office.\"\n\nShe is trying to grow the business and says eventually it will \"probably come to a point where it will make financial sense to have something a bit more permanent\".\n\nImage caption Gemma Martinez says she feels safe to visit late at night\n\nGemma Martinez uses two self-storage units to keep all her stock for her wholesale business Bonadea, which supplies high-end dining and tableware wholesale.\n\nShe initially considered a warehouse instead, but said self-storage offered more \"scalability\".\n\n\"I started with a small unit and then kept on growing. It would also work the other way around. If I needed to cut costs I could do so very quickly.\"\n\nEven if clients like Julia and Gemma move on, Mr de Ryckman de Betz is confident they will be easily replaced.\n\nHe points out that self-storage is hugely popular in the US despite the fact that people's homes tend to be larger.\n\n\"It's the great contradiction of self-storage to think that it's for people without enough space. The more space you have, the more you're going to keep,\" he says."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Diabetes glucose monitors 'available to thousands more'", "description": "The decision comes after patients in some areas of England were being denied access to the device.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46198366", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B63C/production/_104325664_c0380309-woman_with_diabetes-spl.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:07:12Z", "content": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels Wearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with\u2026 [+2340 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels\n\nWearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with type 1 diabetes from April 2019, NHS England has announced.\n\nIts decision comes after an investigation found patients in some areas of the country were being denied access to the device.\n\nIt reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and helps people with diabetes to manage their condition.\n\nDiabetes charities called the change of policy a huge step forward.\n\nIn England, around 300,000 people have type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by Prime Minister Theresa May, who has the autoimmune condition, was made available on the NHS last November.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister's Freestyle Libre could be seen on her arm when she and her husband attended a dinner with President Trump in July\n\nBut recent research suggested only 3-5% of type 1 patients in England had access to the monitors on the NHS, when 20-25% were eligible.\n\nThis was because some local clinical commissioning groups decided not to prioritise funding of the devices.\n\nNHS England said the device would now be funded to allow access throughout the country in all 195 clinical commissioning groups, benefiting a target of about a quarter of people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe glucose monitoring device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin of the arm which is connected to a small transmitter patch on the surface of the skin.\n\nThe sensor reads blood sugar levels from fluid just beneath the skin and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor.\n\nThe technology reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and can make it much easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition.\n\n'It's like swiping a contactless bank card'\n\nBBC journalist Lauren Turner has had type 1 diabetes for 14 years and has tried using a flash glucose monitor.\n\n\"I've used the Libre and compared to pricking my fingers (which I do about eight to 10 times a day), it's revolutionary,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm now waiting to find out when I can get it on prescription.\n\n\"It doesn't work for everyone -

The Milan stock exchange fell 1% before recovering some of its losses.\n\nWhy does Italy want to spend more?\n\nItaly's government, made up of the populist Five Star Movement and right-wing populist League, came to power vowing to \"end poverty\" with a minimum income for the unemployed, along with promises of tax cuts and scrapping extensions to the retirement age.\n\nTo fulfil its promises it trebled the previous government's deficit target of 0.8% of Italy's economic output.\n\nIn his letter to the Commission, Mr Tria reaffirmed Italy's commitment to maintain public finances, but insisted it would stick to a deficit target of 2.4% which he said was an \"impassable limit\".\n\nHe said Italy would aim to generate 1% of GDP by selling state assets with which it would pay back debt. However, it also faces considerable costs because of \"exceptional events\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Damage from flooding in several areas of Italy will cost some 0.2% of economic output, Italy's finance minister predicts\n\nIn his letter he cited the cost of the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa in August, which 43 people died; he also mentioned weeks of flooding and bad weather that caused damage in many areas of Italy in recent weeks.\n\nThe total cost of repairs would equal around 0.2% of GDP for the next three years.\n\nMr Salvini, who leads the League party, was quoted as telling Rai radio on Wednesday that the Commission had \"got it wrong if they are even just thinking of imposing fines on the Italian people\".\n\nLuigi Di Maio of Five Star said: \"We have the conviction that this is the budget needed for the country to get going again.\"\n\nThe government argues that servicing its debt of 131% of national output - second only to bailed-out Greece - would hurt Italians, who have still not recovered from the decade-old financial crisis.\n\nItaly's economy is still smaller than it was in 2008. The governing coalition argues an increase in spending would kick-start growth.\n\nHow bad is Italy's debt?\n\nItaly's debt level is described by the European Commission as a \"major vulnerability\" for its economy.\n\nIn July the EU recommended that it should be cut by 0.6% of GDP in 2019, but the Commission believes the current budget will increase Italy's structural deficit by 0.8% of GDP.\n\nIn his letter to the Commission, Mr Tria was upbeat about the country's growth prospects, predicting that Italy's debt would fall over the next three years to reach 126% of GDP in 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday the International Monetary Fund challenged his predicted growth assumptions of 1.5% for 2019 and 1.6% for 2020, with its own estimate of 1% for 2020.\n\n\"For the first time the Commission is obliged to request a euro area country to revise its draft budgetary plan but we see no alternative than to request the Italian authorities to do so,\" the European Commission Vice-President for the euro, Valdis Dombrovskis, said last month.\n\nHe pointed out that Italian taxpayers were having to spend as much servicing the national debt as on education.\n\nDutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said it was very disappointing that Italy had failed to change its budget. Austria said it would back the Commission if it stepped up its action against Italy with what is known as an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that the EU wanted to reach out to Italy but that it had adopted budget rules \"that we all now have in common\"."}]
