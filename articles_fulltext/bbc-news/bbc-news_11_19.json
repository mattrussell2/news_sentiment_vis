Here are a few reasons why the answer may be yes.\n\nIt will be like a home tournament\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Dyke targets 2022 World Cup win for England\n\nEuro 2020 will be played across 12 countries and the good news for England is that Wembley will host the semi-finals and the final.\n\nThe last time that happened was in 1996, when England hosted the whole tournament and reached the last four, losing on penalties to Germany. And before that? The 1966 World Cup, when England won the trophy.\n\nIn two years' time, Wembley will host seven games, including at least two of England's group matches if they qualify.\n\nThe Three Lions have won 15 of their past 16 competitive matches at Wembley - a record stretching back to 2007 - with their only defeat coming against Spain in September.\n\nIn addition, teams can set up their headquarters wherever they want during the tournament, meaning England can be based at St George's Park and will not have to do as much travelling.\n\nAnd there seems to be no better time for England to play in front of their own fans, with Wembley rocking during Sunday's dramatic 2-1 Nations League win over Croatia.\n\n\"The biggest thing is the connection with the fans - I haven't seen the new Wembley like that,\" said Southgate after beating the 2018 World Cup runners-up.\n\n\"The way it feels with the fans is special. It's giving us the energy to try to go on and break new barriers all the time.\"\n\nSo will England's new \"connection\" with the fans play a big part in 2020?\n\nEngland are winning while top teams stutter\n\nManchester City forward Raheem Sterling scored twice as England beat Spain 3-2 in Seville last month\n\nEngland are enjoying their best form in two decades after winning back-to-back competitive fixtures in the Nations League against two of Europe's major teams - Spain and Croatia.\n\nYou have to go back to June 1997 for the last time England won consecutive games against Europe's elite - beating Italy and France at Le Tournoi, a four-team summer tournament that also involved Brazil.\n\nAt their next major tournament, the 1998 World Cup, England made it to the last 16 before going out to Argentina on penalties.\n\nSport analysts Gracenote, who create their own rankings system based on team's performances, rate England's chances highly.\n\n\"After the win against Croatia, England have risen to sixth in the world on the Gracenote Football Ranking, with only France, Belgium and Spain ahead of them in Europe,\" said Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Gracenote.\n\n\"England can be regarded as one of the favourites for Euro 2020 at this stage, not least because France, Belgium and Spain have all stuttered during the latter stages of the Nations League.\n\n\"England should perhaps beware a fast-improving young Dutch side, who Gracenote currently rates as the ninth best team in the world, and fellow Nations League finals participants Portugal, who are seventh.\n\n\"England's 3-2 win in Spain was the team's best result since winning 4-1 in Croatia in 2008 and the fourth-most impressive result in England's history according to Gracenote's model of international football. Only the 3-0 friendly win in West Germany in 1985 and the 5-1 victory in Munich in 2001 [in addition to that 2008 victory in Croatia] were better. \"\n\nWarming up with competitive football\n\nPortugal were crowned European champions in 2016 after they beat France 1-0 in the final\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of qualifying for the Nations League finals - where England will join Portugal, the Netherlands and Switzerland - is that England will be playing competitive tournament football next summer as a warm-up for the Euros.\n\nIt will beat the preparations in recent years, which have included friendlies against Costa Rica, Nigeria, Australia, Honduras and Ecuador.\n\nEngland's Nations League performance also guarantees they will be a top seed for Euro qualifying - with the draw to be made in Dublin on 2 December.\n\nNone of the favourites for Euro 2020 will be in the Nations League finals after France, Spain and Belgium were eliminated and Germany were relegated.\n\nSpain finished runners-up in England's group, while world champions France were pipped to top spot in their section by the Netherlands, who did not qualify for Russia 2018.\n\nBelgium fell short as Switzerland came from two goals down to thrash them 5-2. The Belgians, who finished third at the World Cup in July, are yet to win a major tournament - their biggest achievement is winning gold at the 1920 Olympics - and their 'golden generation' are starting to age.\n\nGermany, meanwhile, finished bottom of their Nations League group, after falling at the group stage in the World Cup - their first exit at the opening round of the finals since 1938.\n\nItaly, who also failed to qualify for the World Cup, saw their Nations League hopes ended by European champions Portugal, who earned their finals place with a 0-0 draw.\n\nA young squad with potential\n\nGareth Southgate handed a debut to 18-year-old Jadon Sancho (bottom right) in the 3-0 win over USA this month\n\nWhile the downfall of England's rivals helps prospects, there's plenty to be positive about closer to home too.\n\nSouthgate has formed a young, exciting squad. Of the Nations League games played in November, England had the youngest average starting XI (24 years, 203 days) heading into their match with Croatia.\n\nThere was a debut for 18-year-old winger Jadon Sancho in the 3-0 friendly victory over the USA, in which 20-year-old right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold scored his first senior goal.\n\nSancho has contributed to 12 goals in 15 Champions League and Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund this season and is not the only English youngster ripping it up in Germany.\n\nReiss Nelson, the 18-year-old on loan at Hoffenheim from Arsenal, has scored six goals and assisted one in seven league appearances, to push his claims for an England call-up.\n\nLeicester defender Ben Chilwell, 21, made his debut in September and has now made five England appearances while Marcus Rashford, 21, Dele Alli, 22, and Raheem Sterling, 23, are seasoned internationals.\n\nAdd a couple of years of experience - and a hatful of more caps - and England could go into Euro 2020 as genuine contenders.

It is in a way a fiction now or a dream,\" said Ceferin.\n\nAgnelli, who is also chairman of Juventus - one of the teams reported to be a potential founding member of the Super League - added: \"I can confirm we have never seen, never discussed, never been involved in the creation of this document.\n\n\"We are fully engaged with Uefa in shaping the game going forward.\"\n\nSpeaking exclusively to BBC Sport, Ceferin and Agnelli also outlined:\n\nTheir plans to reform European football from 2024 onwards.\n\nHow a revised football calendar could see less domestic football and more European ties played.\n\nWhy qualification for Europe must not just be for the elite.\n\nWill there be a breakaway?\n\nGerman publication Der Speigel claims to have documents which show a new Super League could be up and running by 2021 - featuring the biggest clubs from Spain, Italy, Germany, England and France.\n\nHowever, Ceferin and Agnelli are adamant that the top clubs will stay within Uefa and that detailed talks are under way to find \"solutions\" - including changes to the format of the Champions League to secure a more lucrative broadcasting deal.\n\n\"We have some ideas. All I can say is that any Super League is out of the question. Participation stays. And everybody will have an opportunity to compete in every European competition,\" said Ceferin.\n\nSo what does it mean for European competitions?\n\nA new third European competition with 32 teams will be rubber-stamped at a Uefa meeting in Dublin early next month.\n\nSo with the Champions League, Europa League and the new third contest, a total of 96 teams will compete once pre-qualifying is completed.\n\nCerefin says it will be the \"beginning of wider European competition\", and that clubs and national associations \"appreciate it\".\n\nReferencing the likes of Celtic, Porto, Benfica, Ajax and Anderlecht, Agnelli added: \"It will be our duty to safeguard the great heritages of European football but on the other side I think we are very well aware that we have to safeguard markets, we have to think about upcoming markets.\n\n\"We have to think about Poland. We have to think about [countries like] Turkey, we have to think about Russia. Fans can rest assured that if we put our hands to making a new product it's because we want to make sure that fans across Europe engage.\"\n\nWill the rich just get richer?\n\nReal Madrid won their third Champions League title in a row\n\nBoth men reject the suggestion that the dominance of Europe's top teams is being reinforced by these new competition structures.\n\n\"The dogma of the dream has to stay alive, because it is the foundation of European sports,\" says Agnelli.\n\nCeferin says: \"Unfortunately in the world many times it happens that the rich become richer. I think we are one of the rare organisations in the world that tackles this problem.\n\n\"We know that we have to slow the gap [between rich clubs and the rest] because probably it will be hard to stop completely.\n\n\"And I'm not sure if we want to have everyone equal without intervention. I think that wouldn't be the right approach because if you are doing a good job, you're working a lot, trying to do something, you have to be rewarded for that.\n\n\"But 'know your place' is not fair to say. You have to compete, you have to have results to qualify for the top competition. If you don't have results it would be a strange competition. You decide it by sport results, it's the only way.\"\n\nWhy do they think change is needed?\n\nNothing will actually change before 2024 when the existing competition arrangements expire.\n\nAgnelli says the aim is for every club to increase their international exposure through more European ties - while Cerefin says they are \"trying to find a solution together\".\n\n\"The best platforms can only come through international competitions and that is why increasing participation increasing inclusion it is key to all of us,\" he added.\n\n\"Now the most relevant games are the top of the ladder games. If you look at the Champions League final in comparison to the Super Bowl it beats it by a factor of 1.5 to 1.\n\n\"So the spectators of that game are on a global scale. We have to build on that to make sure we have the resources to allocate throughout Europe to allow every single club, in every single European country, to have a proper international platform.\"\n\nDoes that mean less domestic football then?\n\nBoth men declined to give specific detail on the potential changes to European football, given the ongoing negotiations with clubs, leagues and associations.\n\nBut if European fixtures increase then an already packed football calendar will need comprehensive revision.\n\nThe ECA wants to see the international confederation tournaments, such as the European Championships and Afcon, all played in the summer of the same year. Guaranteed rest periods for players is also high on the agenda.\n\nAnd Agnelli's idea for a \"rebalancing\" of European games over domestic games is likely to cause some controversy - although both officials were keen to point out that they are simply at an \"idea stage\".\n\n\"Evidently if you want to have an overall rebalancing of European football and more international [European] football, all that would have to go hand in hand with a reduction of domestic games,\" says Agnelli.\n\n\"But most importantly it is harmonising. Today you take England, for example, that has two national cups. A team potentially plays 53 domestic games.\n\n\"Then you take Germany where the maximum number of games is 43 because there are two fewer teams in the league and there is only one cup. So that is 10 games difference. Is it logical?\n\n\"There's a whole system of anomalies that have to be addressed. It might mean in certain leagues increasing the amount of games. It's not just about reducing, it's about making it a level playing field, which is very important.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nCeferin and Agnelli will travel to Brussels on Tuesday to meet the European Commissioner for Sport, Tibor Navracsics.\n\nCerefin said: \"We want to show that our vision of the future of football is, let's say, similar. It's not completely the same. We [Uefa and the ECA] have some disagreements from time to time but we firmly believe in the European sports model together.\n\n\"We think that the European football can go further only if we stay together, unified. If you want to develop football you have to stay together.\n\n\"Europe has problems with unity these days - and football, as one of the biggest powers, should lead this unity.

The important negotiations - on the long-term relationship between the UK and EU - start next April.\n\nBut it is worth emphasising that this outbreak of cordiality is born of necessity, rather than desire.\n\nBusiness, the CBI says, wants a future relationship with the EU that guarantees frictionless trade. The political declaration released last week makes clear that trade friction is part of a trade-off: the more aligned the UK remains with the EU's rules, the less checks and controls you'll have at borders.\n\nMeanwhile, services has been left rather out in the cold thus far. Despite some suggestions that what is proposed is a victory for the City of London, it is anything but. Relying on so-called equivalence for continued access to European markets in financial services was considered for a long time to be a totally unacceptable outcome.\n\nBut after alternative proposals went nowhere, it is what they've been left to work with - a third, or perhaps fourth, best solution, depending on how you count it.\n\nAs opinion in her party splinters, the CBI speech offered the prime minister a brief respite from the disharmony. Even if things go her way (and that's a big if), it could be a different story next year.\n\nYou can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so.\n\nAsked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain.\n\nGibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a \"well-known tactic\" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position \"does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward\".\n\nA spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as \"the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies\".\n\n\"We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family.\"\n\nWhy Madrid is making its voice heard\n\nBy Gavin Lee, Europe reporter\n\nSpain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a \"protocol\" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control.\n\nThere seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had \"no significant concerns over Gibraltar\", that the \"behaviour of the British government was good\" and an agreement could be reached.\n\nSo what has changed?\n\nThe Spanish government says that its \"bone of contention\" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.\n\nA senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: \"This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain.\"\n\nUnderlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a \"British colony\" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid.\n\nThough Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it.\n\nA referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote.\n\nSpain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU.\n\nGibraltar in numbers\n\nGibraltar has a population of 33,600 and 7.7 million visitors a year\n\nFinancial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there\n\nIt has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates\n\nAlthough there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25%\n\nGibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita than either the UK or Spain.\n\nGibraltar profile"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "St Michaels: Alleged gang sex assault shocks Canada", "description": "The alleged gang sexual assault with a weapon took place on a classmate at a Canadian private school.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46268978", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D3F4/production/_104406245_gettyimages-961053636.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:37:08Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Six teenage boys from an elite school have been charged with gang sexual assault after videos of alleged hazing incidents surfaced online.

In fact, I'm told its offer for an exclusive deal fell \"many tens of millions\" short of what Sky bid.\n\nOne club boss told me they were underwhelmed by what's been signed, but others see it differently. The desire was to get more cash, fewer games and a greater say on kick-off times. The new deal mostly delivers on that.\n\nThe comparisons to deals signed by other leagues around Europe is also not as cut and dry as it seems. In Sweden, where almost all games are broadcast, they get much more in the pot but an average of around \u00a3100,000 per game.

In serious cases, it can lead to complications like inflammation of the brain, pneumonia and death.\n\nThe virus spreads through contact or coughing and sneezing, though it is not as contagious as measles, which can be spread without any contact.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends vaccinating children between one and 12 years of age. Though serious cases are uncommon, the CDC says chickenpox spreads easily and can be deadly.\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine was licensed in the US in 1995. According to the CDC, the vaccine has prevented 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9,000 hospitalisations and 100 deaths annually in the US.\n\nAnd though some individuals may still get chickenpox with the vaccine, it is very effective at preventing severe or life-threatening cases.\n\nVaccinating also helps protect susceptible individuals who are unable to get the vaccine, like pregnant women, infants younger than one-year-old and cancer patients.\n\nIn the UK, the chickenpox vaccine is listed as an optional childhood vaccine."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Jeremy Corbyn tells CBI business must act for 'common good'", "description": "The Labour leader tells the CBI the \"rules of the game\" must change to boost prosperity and equality.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46265560", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06s82mt.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:43:14Z", "content": "Media caption Jeremy Corbyn says the government must \"change course or stand aside and let an election take place.\" Labour is not planning a \"war on business\", Jeremy Corbyn has insisted, as he told the CBI Brexit should be a catalyst for economic transformat\u2026 [+3197 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn says the government must \"change course or stand aside and let an election take place.\"\n\nLabour is not planning a \"war on business\", Jeremy Corbyn has insisted, as he told the CBI Brexit should be a catalyst for economic transformation.\n\nHe defended plans to give employees shares in their firms, saying despite the \"frenzied reaction\" in some quarters, it would \"strengthen\" them.\n\nThe \"rules of the game\" on boardroom pay and financial regulation needed to change to address inequality, he said.\n\nThe CBI said Labour should work with business, not seek to control it.\n\nLabour is committed to nationalising Royal Mail, the train operating companies, water firms in England and Wales and some parts of the energy network in a series of market interventions which the Conservatives have said will see borrowing increase by up to \u00a31 trillion.\n\nMr Corbyn told business leaders that the plans were part of a radical programme of \"industrial and economic renewal\" needed after years of under-investment and economic deregulation.\n\n\"Rigid and outdated\" economic thinking, he said, had contributed to widening inequality, with 20% of the country's wealth in the hands of only 1% of the population.\n\n'New settlement'\n\nThe UK's \"profoundly unbalanced economy\" had been a factor in the Brexit vote, he said, and the UK's departure from the EU must lead to \"real change\"\n\nBusiness must play its part in boosting productivity and ensuring prosperity was shared more equally, particularly in areas of the country that felt \"left behind\" in recent years.\n\nHe defended plans to force all large firms to put 1% of their share capital aside every year to give workers up to \u00a3500 in shares and to use the remainder to fund public services and welfare.\n\n\"Despite the frenzied reaction in certain sections of the press, there certainly is not any kind of war on business,\" he said of the plans. \"Actually it is the opposite, rather.\n\n\"We recognise the vast and vital contribution businesses make to our society and our economy and at the heart of that contribution are your employees.\n\n\"They have an interest in the long-term success of your company...Workers create profits.

This was only the 11th time a team has added 40 or more for the 10th wicket in both innings of a Test, and the fifth of those to contribute to a victory.\n\nThere is now the prospect of England's first ever 3-0 series victory in Asia (they won the first three Tests of a five-match series in India in 1976-77, the final score being 3-1).\n\nJoe Root has now led England to seven victories in eight Tests, after losing six and drawing two of his previous eight, and a new, exciting, interesting team is emerging, with balance, depth and players capable of match-turning brilliance in all three disciplines.\n\nHere are four talking points ahead of the third Test:\n\nJoe Root scored his 15th Test century to set up England's victory in Pallekele\n\nHas England's cricket been bold, cautious or both?\n\nRoot said after the latest victory: \"We said we'd come out here and play bold cricket, and be courageous.\"\n\nWith the bat, the boldness was clear, in the purposeful sweeping, the relentless accumulation, and the high number of sixes.\n\nIn the field, it has been considerably less obvious and, as a result, this is turning into one of the all-time classic Test series for fans of The Single.\n\nNo series since records for such matters begin (in 2001) has seen singles scored more often - one every 4.16 balls by both teams combined.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!\n\nAt the same time, they have hit sixes with more regularity than in any other series - 24 in just two Tests, at an average of one every 87 balls (their previous best was one every 130 deliveries). By contrast, they have hit a four only once per 20 balls - their 10th lowest figure since 2001.\n\nThe Pallekele Test was notable not only for the high number of wickets taken by spinners, but also for the low number of maiden overs and dot balls they bowled.\n\nBoth captains set, for the most part, deep fields, preferring to allow the batsmen to accumulate a steady flow of singles, rather than risk occasional boundaries, and wait for the pronounced turn offered by the pitch to provoke a wicket.\n\nBatsmen did not have to push the field back - it was often set back as soon as they arrived at the crease.\n\nThe relative ease with which batsmen played themselves in, and the constant difficulty of surviving on a turning pitch, is illustrated by the fact that there were no century partnerships in the match, but 18 stands of 30 runs or more.\n\nThe 1,215 match runs was the second highest aggregate in a Test without a hundred partnership (1,225 were scored in the Ashes Test at the Oval in 1993).\n\nRoot himself, in his 124, scored off more than half the balls he faced, and reached the second quickest of his 15 hundreds (in 120 balls) with his fourth fewest boundary count (10: two sixes and eight fours).\n\nEngland's much-trumpeted positive approach, therefore, has not been an all-guns-blazing, boundary-blitzing, leather-larruping onslaught (their first-day troubles in Galle highlighted the risks of such an approach).\n\nRather, it has been a process of positive strike-rotation, regular accumulation, blended with intermittent, well-selected thwacks over the rope.\n\nAnd it has been facilitated, even encouraged, by the curiously sedate, acquiescent, minimal-intensity tactics of a Sri Lankan team which has been content to wait and hope.\n\nIn the field, England have adopted a similar approach themselves, and have smashed their records for singles conceded (one per 4.2 balls, previous mark was 5.2), percentage of runs conceded in singles (47%, previously 35%), lowest percentage of runs conceded in boundaries (35%, previously 44%), highest percentage of balls scored off (33%, previously 31%), and runs per scoring shot (1.56, previously 1.83).\n\nEssentially, the teams have adopted the same, defensive strategy of compliantly accepted accumulation, on pitches turning enough to all-but-guarantee that wickets will occur with sufficient regularity.\n\nHave England got it right, and Sri Lanka got it wrong? Have England got it wrong, but won anyway? Or have both teams backed the right tactical horse, and watched it beat itself down the home straight?\n\nMoeen Ali made the crucial breakthrough to remove Niroshan Dickwella on day five of the second Test\n\nHow can England get fourth-innings Moeen to bowl in all innings?\n\nMoeen Ali has an extraordinary fourth-innings record - 52 wickets in 22 innings at an average of 21.8, a better fourth-innings average than, amongst others, Shane Warne, Graeme Swann, Derek Underwood and Anil Kumble.\n\nHis 4-72 was his seventh haul of four or more wickets in a fourth innings, six of which have come in his past nine fourth innings, since July 2017, including some massive contributions to nerve-jangling victories.\n\nNo other England bowler has more than five fourth-innings four-fors in his entire career. Anderson and Broad have six in 94 innings between them.\n\nMoeen's average improves pronouncedly through the course of a Test - 56 in the first innings, 46 in the second, 35 in the third, and 21 in the fourth.\n\nAnother task on the To-Do list for England's back-room alchemists, then, is to concoct a magic psychotropic elixir that convinces Moeen that it is always the fourth innings.\n\nApart from when he is batting, mind - his innings averages are 46 in the first, then 20, 27 and 20. If Moeen could bowl at himself in the fourth innings of a Test, he would have himself in knots on toast. And if he could bat against himself in the opening innings of a Test, he would dislocate both shoulders smiting himself for six.\n\nTo get the best out of Joe Root, should England's other batsmen deliberately avoid scoring centuries?\n\nThis Joe Root's 15th Test hundred, and the sixth time he has been the only centurion in a Test match.\n\nOnly six players have been the sole century-maker more often in Tests - Australia's Greatest-Batsman-Of-All-Time\u2122 Don Bradman, Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara, and Indians Mohammad Azharuddin and Sunil Gavaskar (they did so seven times each). TMS' own Geoffrey Boycott made the only hundred in eight Tests, but in none of which he batted with a stick of rhubarb; and the all-time leader is England's Colin Cowdrey, who was the only hundredista 9 times in his long career. Eight other players have also made a Test's solitary three-figure score on six occasions, including Sachin Tendulkar and Jacques Kallis.\n\nWhy Jack Leach is doomed\n\nIn his first Test, in New Zealand in April, Jack Leach took two wickets. In his second, in Galle, he took five, and then eight in Pallekele.\n\nAssuming he continues to improve at his now-established rate of three wickets per match, in the third Test of next year's series in the West Indies, he will take all 20 wickets, whereupon he will be forcibly retired from international cricket on mathematical grounds.\n\nA further Leachy curiosity - by opening the batting as nightwatchman in England's second innings, Leach, in his third Test, alongside Rory Burns, in his second, became half of England's least experienced opening partnership in Test cricket since the Mumbai Test of February 1973, when Graham Roope and Jack Birkenshaw, both in their second Tests, strode to the crease.\n\nGot a question for Andy?\n\nGot a burning statistical question you'd like to have answered.

which was known as The Know in 2015 - operated from the Eldon Insurance building in Bristol\n\nIn one sequence in the footage, Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney is seen at Mr Banks's office in Bristol asking an insurance worker to bring up an image for the Brexit campaign - at that point called The Know - on the screen and said \"just pretend that you're working on it\".\n\nAnother worker says she had \"started in the insurance side\" having worked for Mr Banks for six years and then moved to work on the campaign.\n\nWhen asked in the 2015 footage if the social media team usually worked on insurance but could work on the leave campaign, Ms Bilney said they had looked at \"what skills are transferable and what skills aren't transferable\".\n\n\"Social media skills, for example, are completely transferable and if you're a creative person you're creative and passionate about what you do,\" she said.\n\n\"So we found that works and our finance director, for example, can look after our group so that skill, again, is a nice transferable skill.\"\n\nShe added that staff were \"very adaptable\" and said \"we like to morph and evolve into different things\".\n\nWhen Mr Banks was asked in the select committee hearing if he used \"staff that had previously worked in the insurance business in Leave.EU\", the businessman replied \"no, no\".\n\nWhat Arron Banks told the select committee\n\nIan Lucas MP: \"You made clear earlier that you didn't use the same employees.\"\n\nArron Banks: \"So within our office we had an office set up that was for Leave.EU. It was a call centre. And we were getting a tremendous number of phone calls from our, obviously, the website, from Twitter, from Facebook and for the whole thing.\"\n\n[Later in the same hearing]\n\nMr Lucas: \"So did you use staff that had previously worked in the insurance business in Leave.EU?\"\n\nMr Banks: \"No. No.\"\n\nMr Lucas: \"Where did these people come from?\"\n\nMr Banks: \"Well we created a team of people as you would do in a business. We just put people together.\"\n\nMs Bilney has since said the people who had previously worked for the insurance firm were on \"seconded contracts until they were seconded back after the referendum\".\n\nShe added that other functions, such as IT and HR, were billed to Leave.EU by Eldon Insurance after the referendum and that a compliance officer had overseen this.\n\nMs Bilney also admitted in an interview with the BBC in the past week that employees had worked for both businesses and said that Mr Banks's comments to the MPs had been taken out of context.\n\nHaving seen the footage, Damian Collins, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, said: \"The people working on computers there could just switch seamlessly between one campaign to the other.\n\n\"Now, if this was kept totally separate, then that wouldn't be possible. You would have firewalls in place to stop people doing that, to make sure these things are kept completely separate.\n\n\"But what you can see here is it quite clearly wasn't separate at all, it was all mixed up together. So it means he, Aaron Banks, wasn't telling the truth or giving us the full picture when he gave evidence to parliament.\n\n\"Of course, it raises all sorts of questions that if workers were working on both campaigns at the same time, how was that accounted for to the Electoral Commission in terms of time and also were there any breaches of data protection law because of the different ways data was being processed?\"\n\nMs Bilney has denied data was used improperly.\n\nImage caption This chart shows several ex-insurance workers who went on to work for Leave.EU\n\nMr Banks said: \"The BBC have been working with Open Democracy, which is a second referendum campaign funded by Remain supporting groups, to smear my business interests.\n\n\"They contain identical points put to us by this activist group, the purpose of which is to discredit the Brexit campaign.\"\n\nThe BBC has not worked with Open Democracy on this report into links between staff for Eldon Insurance and Leave.EU.\n\nMr Collins said the footage would feed into the select committee's inquiry into fake news.\n\nMr Banks is the subject of a police probe into claims he was not the \"true source\" of \u00a38m loaned to Leave.EU.\n\nAn investigation into the businessman's donations to Leave.EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum has been referred by the Electoral Commission to the National Crime Agency, which has said potential criminal offences may have been committed.\n\nWatch BBC Inside Out West on the iPlayer."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/19 18:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3r9wd", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Nasa 2020 robot rover to target Jezero 'lake' crater", "description": "America's next robot rover will be sent to a 50km-wide depression that once had water running through it.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46264383", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11C74/production/_104402827_35549_080716_jezerocrater_hr.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:57:12Z", "content": "Image copyright NASA/JPL/JHUAPL/MSSS/BROWN UNIVERSITY Image caption Jezero Crater shows strong evidence from orbit of past water activity The American space agency (Nasa) says it will send its 2020 Mars rover to a location known as Jezero Crater.

In a straw-poll taken at the end of the most recent site-selection workshop, it came out the clear favourite. Nasa's administration has now endorsed the choice.\n\nJezero is sited just north of Mars' equator. It is named after a town in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In some Slavic languages the word \"jezero\" also means \"lake\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Mars 2020 rover is based on the design of the Curiosity robot\n\nHow does 2020 link to future missions?\n\nAnother of the robot's key objectives will be to select and \"cache\" in small canisters some rock samples that could, at a later date, be collected and returned to Earth labs for analysis.\n\nNasa is working with the European Space Agency (Esa) on this initiative, but exactly when the sample tubes might come home is uncertain.\n\nPlanning with Esa was at an early stage, said Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science chief. \"Depending on how the details come out, it could be in the early 2030s,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The 2020 mission will again use a \"Skycrane\" to put the rover on the surface\n\nIs the 2020 rover a copy of Curiosity?\n\nThe 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012. Curiosity has been a great success, and Nasa wants to repeat it. Using the same \"template\" also saves money; some equipment spares were left over from 2012.\n\nThat said, instrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet.\n\nThe new robot will use the same \"Skycrane\" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process.\n\nWhat else can we look forward to on Mars?\n\nMissions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets.\n\nThe 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021.\n\n\"Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,\" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. \"And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that.\"\n\nUnlike 2020 and Curiosity, Insight is a static lander. It will be the first mission dedicated to \"looking inside\" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for \"Marsquakes\", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure.\n\nEsa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also. European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination. Satellite imagery suggests, as with Jezero and Gale, this ancient terrain came into prolonged contact with water.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Cameroon v Brazil: Indomitable Lions boss Clarence Seedorf relishing 'special' test", "description": "Cameroon boss Clarence Seedorf's first visit to Milton Keynes sees his new side face Brazil at Stadium MK as he looks to build a new career as a coach.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46264782", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1789A/production/_104401469_camerooncoachclarenceseedorf.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:39:51Z", "content": "Seedorf signed a four-year deal when he took charge of Cameroon in August You can hear the full interview with Clarence Seedorf in the World Football Podcast, which is available to download on Friday.

He managed AC Milan between January and June 2014 and Shenzhen FC from July to December 2016\n\nDuring his time in the dug-out, Seedorf has found out exactly how short time can be - his stints in charge of AC Milan, Chinese side Shenzhen FC and Deportivo La Coruna only lasted a matter of months.\n\nBut they have not diluted his enthusiasm or belief he can make his mark as a coach, just as he did as a player, and he sees each of those jobs as being \"positive experiences\".\n\n\"When I went to AC Milan, they were four points away from the relegation zone and by the end of the season we were just one goal away from being in the Europa League,\" Seedorf said.\n\n\"In China I maintained the same results the team had been getting before, and although I could not take La Coruna out of the relegation zone, people who saw the matches saw how we were playing and the evolution of the team.\n\n\"Unfortunately results are the only thing that some people look at, but there is more to defining success than just stats.\n\n\"I am a winner - and I like to win - but I cannot think that, if I lose, I did not do a good job, because there are other external factors involved.\n\n\"I know what I do on a daily basis and how it improves players individually and how my teams have improved. People who really want to understand how I work will appreciate what has been done.\"\n\n'I am ready for the new challenges you get as a coach'\n\nCameroon won the Africa Cup of Nations in February 2017 but they missed out on the 2018 World Cup - the only other time they have missed the finals since 1982 was in 2006\n\nSeedorf's current challenge is to rebuild a national team who won the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations but did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nNo African side made the second round in Russia, for the first time since 1982, and Seedorf says his long-term aim is to change that in Qatar in 2022.\n\n\"Of course African teams are underachieving when you think of what their potential is,\" he said. \"That is one of the reasons I took this job.\n\n\"We want to change things and make a contribution to African football. The potential is incredible, the talent is incredible, so it is really about organising and creating a structure on and off the pitch for that to flourish.\n\n\"This is my life now as Cameroon coach - I am not a player any more so for me it is now about building my career as a coach. It does not only feel like a new career, it actually is one, and I am happy with that.\n\n\"I am very satisfied with what I did as a player so I am not looking back with any strange feeling about that - I am ready for the new challenges you get as a coach - like this one.\n\n\"A lot is new for me now - a different environment, a different country, a different culture and a different mentality, but it is exciting to have to adapt, and it is fun too.\"\n\n'In Cameroon, the national team is like a religion'\n\nSeedorf won the Champions League four times as a player - with Ajax in 1995, Real Madrid in 1998 and twice with AC Milan, in 2003 and 2007\n\nSeedorf is the only man to win the Champions League with three different teams, and has also won domestic titles in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Brazil, so he knows about the power of club football.\n\nBut he is adamant the international game has to remain an important force too.\n\nSeedorf said: \"Unfortunately it has been perceived over the course of the last few years that club football is the most important and the most special.\n\n\"For sure, when we talk about the Champions League, it is very special. But then you have a World Cup and you realise how big it is to play for your country.\n\n\"And coming to Cameroon, for them it is like a religion. Everyone follows the national team and wants them to win. So yes, it is very exciting being part of that.\"\n\nFor the players too, Seedorf believes it is \"fundamental\" that the international game maintains its position at the summit of the sport.\n\nHe explained: \"It brings a lot to a player's development because you have to be able to switch from what you know, your daily philosophy and work environment at your club, to what your national coach is requesting.\n\n\"That is why players are picked, because they have the quality and capacity to be able to adapt quickly, and at the highest level.\n\n\"You see the importance of that when you go back to your club, and play different standards and types of teams in your own championship and then in Europe. There are times when you need to adapt quickly to different tactical demands then too.\n\n\"The national team requests exactly that, so it gives something to the player for their development and also to the club in terms of their experience. We should not forget that.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi death: King Salman speaks but ignores murder", "description": "King Salman praises the judiciary, shrugging off pressure over the murder of writer Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46267278", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18024/production/_104404389_3464eeff-81a9-4d0a-bb80-8e6e0f6151fc.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:30:43Z", "content": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption King Salman has handed over extensive authority to the crown prince King Salman of Saudi Arabia has praised the country's judiciary, as foreign pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi continues to grow.

He later tweeted about the need to guard against foreign vessels who \"steal our fish\".\n\nMany African countries complain that foreign trawlers come into their waters and steal their fish.\n\nFishermen in the West African nations of Senegal and Mauritania say the mass production of fishmeal by foreigners is depleting fish stocks.\n\nPiracy off the coast of Somalia, usually for ransom, reached its peak in 2011 but has reduced significantly in recent years, in part because of extensive international military patrols as well as support for local fishing communities.\n\nSome Somali fishermen turned to piracy after their livelihoods were destroyed by illegal fishing from foreign trawlers, who benefited from the lack of a functioning coastguard in the country following years of conflict.\n\n'Overwhelmed and under-resourced'\n\nAnalysis - Ferdinand Omondi, BBC News\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn the vast Kenyan waters, the underfunded maritime police have been overwhelmed.\n\nThe International Organisation for Migration has named Kenya as a major transit point for human trafficking and the sex trade.\n\nThis new force launches with plenty of optimism, but just one boat. That's hardly enough to patrol Kenya's coastline which stretches over 621 miles (1,000km).\n\nAnd there's Lake Victoria, where Kenyan fishermen have long complained of harassment from Ugandan forces on contested waters.\n\nTo succeed where the maritime police failed, the Kenya Coast Guard will need political backing and resources.

Given the difficulty of reaching their ultimate destination - the United States itself - some migrants may end up spending some weeks or even months in the city.\n\nThe mayor of Tijuana has stoked feelings further by describing the migrants as an \"avalanche\" and saying that the city authorities were struggling to cope, a comment that was immediately seized upon by President Trump. Furthermore there are still hundreds more migrants to arrive in the coming hours from other points in northern Mexico.\n\nAs those who've stuck with the caravan decide their options - between applying for asylum in the US, settling in Mexico or trying to cross the border undetected - they're being housed in a sports centre and similar facilities across Tijuana.\n\nAfter a trip of over 4,000km (2,485 miles), it seems the last few hundred metres will prove the hardest leg to complete.\n\nThe view from US side\n\nAleem Maqbool, BBC News, California\n\nIf, after travelling so far and not being allowed through the legal US channels, some of the Honduran migrants decide to try an illegal route across the border, they may try to come through the hills at the western-most part of the land border.\n\nPeople on ranches in the area have been accustomed to migrants coming across this way.\n\n\"When people are hiding in the bushes, my horse can always detect them, even if I can't,\" Becky tells me. \"But it happens so much less than 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\nShe attributes the fact that only a tiny fraction of the numbers of migrants of 20 years ago is coming across illegally to the many US border patrol units that we see close by.\n\nBecky supports troops being sent here and is vehemently against people coming across illegally.\n\nBut Jessica Winney, who has around 200 horses on her ranches, feels the rhetoric and the troop deployment is unnecessary and purely political.\n\n\"When I have seen migrants coming across our land, which is rare these days, I feel sorry for them.

Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years and we will certainly be doing that.\"\n\nBut Ms Rudd took issue with the findings of a report by the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty who claimed last week that ministers were in a \"state of denial\" about poverty levels.\n\nDespite the UK being one of the world's richest countries, Philip Alston said he had encountered \"misery\" during his 12-day tour.\n\nAsked about the report in the Commons, she said: \"We are not so proud that we don't think we can learn as we try to adjust to universal credit for the benefit of everybody, but that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying.\"\n\nThe government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK.\n\nMs McVey announced earlier this month that claimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit.\n\nAmong a number of other changes, she said they would not have to wait as long for their money and debt repayments would be reduced.\n\nIn the Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra \u00a31bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a \u00a31,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to \u00a31.7bn a year."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Carlos Ghosn: Renault-Nissan's relentless 'cost killer'", "description": "The boss of Renault-Nissan is one of the car industry's big beasts who has revived two global giants.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46263220", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14064/production/_104402028_mediaitem104402027.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:38:03Z", "content": "Image copyright AFP In Japan, Carlos Ghosn's hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of the country's famous cartoon comic books.

He did not disappoint.\n\nMr Ghosn not only turned around Nissan, he became a superstar in the process.\n\nIn a 2011 nationwide poll of who the Japanese would like to run their country, he came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth). Another poll said he was the man most Japanese women wanted to marry.\n\nIt all underlines the shock that Mr Ghosn's glittering career may now be undone by what Nissan claims are \"significant acts of misconduct\".\n\nIn an industry of big corporate beasts, the 64-year-old was up there with the biggest, running an alliance of three global carmakers - Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi - on two continents as both chief executive and chairman. He was in charge of 470,000 employees, selling 10.6 million vehicles last year from 122 factories.\n\n\"It's going to rock the alliance as he is the keystone of the alliance,\" says Satoru Takada, an analyst at Tokyo-based consultants TIW. Mr Ghosn's \"charisma\" glues the alliance together, he says.\n\nCost killer\n\nMr Ghosn started his career at French tyremaker Michelin, spending 18 years in various divisions and countries.\n\nWorried, perhaps, that the top job at the family-owned Michelin might elude him, he moved to Renault in 1996. He was soon put in charge of the loss-making South America division.\n\nThe division's radical overhaul - and return to profitability - earned him a nickname that has stuck: Le Cost Killer.\n\nMr Ghosn doesn't particularly like the moniker, arguing that if corporate survival plans depended only on cutting costs, a company would not survive long.\n\nNevertheless, when Renault came to the rescue of Nissan in 1999 by taking a near 40% stake, Mr Ghosn was parachuted in for a repeat performance.\n\nNissan was heavily in debt and had lost money in seven of the previous eight years. He embarked on a huge restructuring that involved closing factories and shedding one in seven jobs.\n\nDuring the last decade Mr Ghosn championed consolidation and alliances as the only way forward for a global motor industry that was sinking into recession and needed to tackle overcapacity. For years there was speculation he would form a tie-up with one of America's big three carmakers.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Ghosn moved into electric vehicles early, first with the Leaf and more recently with the eye-catching Twizy, above\n\nThat strategy continued in 2016 when he took charge at Mitsubishi after Nissan threw its struggling Japanese rival a lifeline, buying a one-third stake for about $2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn at the time). That three-way alliance has itself formed partnerships with other carmakers in Europe, China and Russia.\n\nOften referred to by his supporters as a \"visionary\", Mr Ghosn embraced electric vehicles sooner than many competitors, launching the Nissan Leaf in Japan and the US at the end of 2010.\n\nHe tells an anecdote about how the founder of computer chipmaker Intel told him 14 years ago that car companies would not make electric vehicles.\n\nThe rationale was that car firms were wedded to the internal combustion engine and would not innovate. The Leaf is now the world's best-selling electric car.\n\nFor years Mr Ghosn has been the archetypal corporate globalist, frequently sleeping on a private jet as he travelled between companies and countries.\n\nHe speaks in his autobiography of always feeling slightly different because of his background.\n\nBorn in Brazil to Lebanese parents, aged six he returned to Lebanon with his mother. He then studied for two engineering degrees in Paris.\n\nThis cultural diversity, he says, made him more willing to integrate and understand other countries. It's one reason he succeeded in Japan's relatively insular corporate environment.\n\nBeing multilingual has also helped. He is fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French and English, and has picked up a good working knowledge of Japanese during his time at Nissan.\n\nNo interference\n\nDespite the globetrotting, Mr Ghosn has spoken of the importance of a good home-work balance for employees - and also himself.\n\n\"I do not bring my work home. I play with my four children and spend time with my family on weekends,\" he told Fortune magazine many years ago.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption France's President Emmanuel Macron (right) was a critic of Carlos Ghosn's 2016 pay package\n\n\"When I go to work on Monday... I come up with good ideas as a result of becoming stronger after being recharged.\"\n\nPeople who have worked with him say his management style is to be quick and decisive. He also once told Fortune that Renault had wasted too much time on \"discussions about everything and nothing\".\n\nMr Ghosn also stresses the importance of bringing together cross-cultural management teams to help drive through projects. But the buck stopped with him.\n\n\"A boss has to have 100% freedom to act and 100% responsibility for what he does. I have never tolerated any wavering from that principle, I will never accept any interference,\" he once said.\n\nCarlos Ghosn\n\nBorn in Porto Velho, Brazil, to Lebanese parents, he fell dangerously ill aged two after drinking dirty water and almost died\n\nHe was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had \"too many jobs\"\n\nHe is a big investor in the Lebanese wine industry\n\nAfter taking over at Nissan, Mr Ghosn controversially changed the official company language from Japanese to English\n\nA car lover from an early age, he reportedly could distinguish vehicles by their horn when aged five.\n\nInevitably, not everything went to plan. Despite being a \"giant on the global business stage\", says Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, Mr Ghosn's vision of creating an \"all-electric world\" is still far off.\n\nAnd his plan that Nissan would capture 10% market share in the US stored up problems, she says. \"That led to bad and unprofitable behaviours including huge discounting and giant fleet sales that resulted in slumping resale values.\n\n\"Nissan also has had its share of quality problems as part of grinding out volume to snag market share.\"\n\nAnd along with praise for his achievements has come criticism over the amount he is paid for them.\n\nIn 2016 the French state joined 54% of voters at the carmaker's annual meeting in refusing to authorise a \u20ac7.25m pay package.\n\nThe vote was overruled by Renault's board, but Mr Ghosn later accepted a pay cut after Emmanuel Macron, then France's finance minister, threatened to step in with a new compensation law.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Ghosn narrowly won a shareholder vote at Renault over his \u20ac7.4m (\u00a36.6m) pay package for 2017.\n\nThat he is now in trouble for, among other things, under-reporting how much he was paid, will be seen by many as ironic."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Wombat poop: Scientists reveal mystery behind cube-shaped droppings", "description": "Scientists discover how the marsupials are the only known species producing cube-shaped faeces.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46258616", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13D44/production/_104402218_049853758-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:34:25Z", "content": "Image copyright EPA Image caption The Australian native produces up to 100 cube-shaped poops a night Scientists say they have uncovered how and why wombats produce cube-shaped poo - the only known species to do so.

But as a fun way of raising awareness about sustainable eating, edible insects are definitely food for thought."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Google halts glucose-sensing contact lens project", "description": "The contact lens was designed to help people with diabetes monitor their glucose levels", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46262520", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/72344000/jpg/_72344952_lens.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:22:08Z", "content": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In this video from 2014, Google said the sensors on the smart contact lens were so small they looked like bits of glitter A firm from Google's parent company Alphabet has stopped working on one of its\u2026 [+969 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In this video from 2014, Google said the sensors on the smart contact lens were so small they looked like bits of glitter\n\nA firm from Google's parent company Alphabet has stopped working on one of its first projects - a contact lens designed to monitor blood sugar levels.\n\nThe device was supposed to assist people living with diabetes.\n\nVerily had partnered with pharmaceutical giant Novartis to develop the lens in 2014.\n\nIn a blogpost, it said its measurements of the glucose levels found in tears, compared with the levels found in blood, were not close enough.\n\nThe lens consisted of a tiny wireless chip and glucose sensor, embedded between two layers of lens material.\n\n\"Our clinical work on the glucose-sensing lens demonstrated that there was insufficient consistency in our measurements of the correlation between tear glucose and blood glucose concentrations to support the requirements of a medical device,\" Verily said.\n\nThe firm said it had faced various challenges getting reliable readings from the eye, but added that it would continue to explore other uses for the Smart Lens technology - which include a lens to improve eyesight after surgery for cataracts."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "UK industry to make new 'Hotbirds'", "description": "British industry will build new spacecraft for telecoms operator Eutelsat's flagship TV distribution network.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46263970", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16378/production/_104400019_whbranded_newsubject.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:12:43Z", "content": "Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption The BBC World Service and World News Channel go out over the Hotbirds at 13E British industry is going to build two new spacecraft for the big Paris-based telecoms operator Eutelsat.

Monday's procurement represents two of only seven big platforms that have been openly competed globally in 2018.\n\nNicolas Chamussy, the director of space systems at Airbus, said he thought the market would bounce back eventually, and that Neo especially would prove popular as operators started to overhaul their ageing fleets.\n\n\"This new-generation platform is of extreme importance because it is the inception of a new product. It's top of the class with very high performance. This puts us - and especially British industry - ahead of the market,\" he told BBC News.\n\nWhat's different about Neo satellites?\n\nNeo uses ion thrusters to position itself in the right part of the sky. This type of propulsion system, which produces thrust by accelerating atoms of xenon through a nozzle, is highly efficient. Much less fuel is carried on a mission in comparison with the needs of established chemical thrusters.\n\nThe savings in weight and volume can either be used to pack in more payload and performance, or to produce a lighter platform that can ride a smaller, cheaper rocket to orbit.\n\nIn the case of the new Hotbirds, they will go to the launchpad in 2021 weighing 4.5 tonnes each. Without electric propulsion they would easily top six tonnes.\n\nAirbus says the new modular design of the satellites means their production timelines can also be trimmed, from 30 months to 24 months.\n\nThe development of the new spacecraft architecture was supported by Esa's Artes programme which aims to find the technologies to keep European manufacturers competitive on the world stage.\n\nThe UK is the member-state that makes the largest contribution to this agency programme, investing \u20ac500m over the period 2016-2021.\n\nImage copyright AIRBUS Image caption Sam Gyimah (C) is flanked by Rodolphe Belmer (R) and Nicolas Chamussy (L)\n\nWhat's the Brexit context?\n\nSix of Eutelsat's next seven spacecraft are bing built in Britain, which includes another Esa-Artes-inspired project called Quantum. This will be a \"software defined\" telecoms satellite, meaning its coverage, bandwidth, power and frequency can all be reprogrammed from the ground. This flexibility will enable Eutelsat to move Quantum to a different part of the globe and service its markets, instead of launching another bespoke satellite.\n\nEutelsat CEO Rodolphe Belmer commented: \"We continue to be hugely impressed by the expansion of the UK space sector, particularly its growing industrial capabilities, the development of cutting-edge technology, and the quality of the people working in the sector.\"\n\nScience Minister, Sam Gyimah, was present at the Airbus-Eutelsat contract signing in London. With a nod to the political turbulence that presently surrounds Brexit, he said the Paris company's inward investment represented a very positive development for the space sector.\n\n\"At this particular time, it's good to see a vote of confidence in the UK space industry, in terms of the talent and the skills we have here to deliver world-class contracts.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "How I set out to catch a romance scammer", "description": "Panorama's Athar Ahmad tracks down the fraudsters who are trying to get their hands on people's cash.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46260729", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/229B/production/_104395880_d0d96b74-fa67-45a2-a415-6108523d8b2f.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:11:48Z", "content": "Image copyright Empics Image caption Catfish victim Roy showing reporter Athar Ahmad conversations he had with someone pretending to be someone else.

But the romantic emails she's been receiving are really coming from a small town in Nigeria.\n\nLaura Lyons has to break the bad news.\n\nShe's a private investigator who specialises in tracking down online romance fraudsters, otherwise known as \"catfish\".\n\n\"When you have to go back to individuals and explain to them that this person doesn't exist, they're not real, that is really hard to do,\" she says.\n\nThe catfish are often based in Africa and work from pre-written romantic scripts in internet cafes.\n\nTheir stories are designed to tug at the heart strings and to empty bank accounts.\n\nMore than a quarter of new relationships now start through a dating website or app, so there's no shortage of potential victims.\n\nMost victims are too embarrassed to go to the police, but there are still 10 catfish crimes a day reported in the UK. Those affected by such scams lose on average around \u00a315,000.\n\nThe mark: A victim who is targeted by romance fraudsters\n\nImage caption Laura Lyons specialises in tracking down online romance fraudsters.\n\nRoy Twiggs shows me the stream of email conversations he had with someone who pretended to be a US woman called Donna.\n\nRoy thought they were in love and were going to get married. Then she started asking for money to help with a building project in Malaysia.\n\n\"The money seemed to be for plausible things. When you're sending \u00a33,000, \u00a34,000, it sort of all adds up.\n\n\"After I'd worked everything out I'd actually paid her the best part of \u00a3100,000.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old from Doncaster should be enjoying a comfortable retirement. Instead he's paying off creditors each month using his pension.\n\n\"I'm broke. You're whitewashed, you're totally devastated, you're finished, you just don't want to be bothered anymore.\"\n\nWhile we are filming we spot a worrying entry on Roy's calendar. He has written \"$500\" next to the name Sherry.\n\nImage caption Roy's calendar with a $500 payment to \"Sherry\"\n\nSherry is Roy's new American girlfriend. He met her online.\n\nWhen I check the messages Sherry has sent, it's clear she's using the same language and methods as the original catfish.\n\nIt's far from unusual, as catfish are ruthless with their victims. If you have been hooked once, you are more likely to be targeted again.\n\nThe bait: A fake profile used to hook someone online\n\nI want to catch a catfish by setting up my own fake dating profile. Nearly two-thirds of reported victims are women, so I have become Kathryn Hunter - a wealthy divorcee looking for love.\n\nIt's not long before the catfish begin to bite.\n\nFour men approach me online and they all claim to be US soldiers. It's an immediate red flag. The military profile is a commonly used cover story which gives catfish an excuse not to meet in person, as well as providing a seemingly legitimate reason to ask for money to be sent overseas.\n\nOne of the soldiers, who calls himself Paul Richard, comes on strong. On day two, he tells Kathryn he's in love. On day three, he wants to marry her.\n\nHe takes the conversation away from the dating site and bombards me with texts. There are messages late into the night and more waiting for me in the morning.\n\nAfter a week, Paul Richard says he wants to speak on the phone. My producer takes on the role of Kathryn for the call. The number he rings from has a Nigerian dialling code.\n\nAfter a brief silence, a man with a thick African accent comes on the line. He doesn't sound like the American soldier whose picture he is using. But Paul explains away his accent by saying he has a cold.\n\nThe easiest way to prove someone is a catfish is to find the real person whose pictures they are using. An online reverse image search can show where the pictures came from on the internet.\n\nThe first three photos Paul sends us don't work, because the meta data has been stripped from the picture. But we get a result on the fourth, a selfie Paul claims is him in his army uniform.\n\nIt leads us to the Instagram page of Juan Avalos, a real life marine whose page features the same pictures sent to us by Paul. He has uploaded a warning about catfish because so many fraudsters have been using his photos to scam people.\n\nImage caption This is the image of \"Paul Richard\" we were sent by the catfish. His real name is Juan Avalos and his picture is being used by romance fraudsters. He's trying to raise awareness @shreddedmilitary\n\nJuan told us: \"These guys will say anything to anybody and lie. I run into so many messages, even if I show them it's not me they still don't believe it because they are so deeply in love.\"\n\nFor the next few weeks, my producer continues to speak to Paul Richard on the phone as I listen in.\n\nPaul talks gushingly about their future life together and his plans to move to the UK to be with Kathryn once his army service finishes.\n\nThe conversations grow longer and more frequent, punctuated with kisses, flirtatious comments and a regular request for pictures.\n\nThere's just one thing standing in the way of our future happiness - Paul's son is sick and desperately needs medical attention. He asks for $800 (\u00a3620) to pay for young Rick's treatment.\n\nPaul says we should pay the cash to his nanny in the US, a woman called Marcy Krovak.\n\nIt's a breakthrough because, unlike Paul Richard, Marcy Krovak is a real person.\n\nMule: Someone who transfers money or goods for the catfish\n\nCatfish need real people to pick up cash for them as some form of identification has to be shown when collecting transactions. Some of these money mules are innocent victims tricked into forwarding on cash, others are in on the scam.\n\nWe don't know whether Marcy is in on it or not, so we head to Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, where she lives.\n\nWe send her a small amount of cash to see if she will pick it up.\n\nThe next three days are spent sitting in a blacked out van outside Marcy's local Western Union.\n\nWe spot a number of women who look like her going inside but each time it's a false alarm..\n\nThen, just as we think our sting has failed, we receive a notification telling us the cash has been picked up using Marcy's ID.\n\nBut it's been collected 400 miles away - in New York.\n\nWhen we ask Marcy what's going on, she claims she's also a victim of our catfish: \"I never was going to go to Western Union and pick that money up but now somebody's used my info and gone and picked it up. It was not me, I did not do it. Please find this person.\"\n\nThe reveal: Unmasking the catfish\n\nIt seems like we have hit another dead end, but then our catfish makes a mistake.\n\nPaul Richard accidentally leaves a name tag - Dan Coolman - on one of his WhatsApp pictures.\n\nWe search through all the Dan Coolmans in Nigeria and we find one who runs a barbershop in Ibadan. He's using the same number that our catfish has been calling us from.\n\nDan Coolman is another false name, but we discover the phone is registered to Daniel Joseph Okechkwu.\n\nWe then find a Twitter account with that name and the same profile picture as the one used by Dan Coolman.\n\nWe have finally uncovered the real identity of our catfish.\n\nImage caption Daniel Joseph Okechkwu - the man pretending to be Paul Richard.\n\nWe head for Ibadan, but by the time we get there he's gone. The doors to the barber shop are locked and locals say it's been closed for weeks.\n\nThere is a photo of our catfish posing with a customer on the side of the building, but no-one seems to know where Daniel Joseph Okechkwu has gone.\n\nAfter three months of talking to our catfish, we decide to call him and tell him who we really are.\n\nImage caption Reporter Athar Ahmad confronting the catfish on the phone\n\nSurprisingly, he doesn't hang up straight away. He sticks to his story about being a US soldier and insists his name is Paul Richard. He denies scamming anybody and then ends the call.\n\nIt feels like a disappointing end to our search, but later that night he calls back.\n\nThis time, Daniel Joseph Okechkwu confesses. He claims it's the first romance scam he's ever pulled and that he has been forced to do it because of the closure of his barber shop.\n\nHe sounds sincere and he apologises for the way he has treated us.\n\nOur catfish says he wants to stop being a romance fraudster. But he needs us to give him money, so that he can afford to stop tricking other people out of their cash.\n\nIt's a classic catfish twist. They never give up on the scam even when they have been rumbled.\n\nYou can watch BBC Panorama's Billion-Pound Romance Scam on Monday 19th November at 8:30pm on BBC One, or afterwards on BBCiPlayer."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "AFC Wimbledon: 80 applications for managerial vacancy", "description": "AFC Wimbledon say they have received about 80 applications to replace former first-team boss Neal Ardley.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46264411", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/14C07/production/_104399948_afcwimbledonrex.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:05:12Z", "content": "Kingsmeadow-based AFC Wimbledon are 23rd in League One, seven points from safety AFC Wimbledon say they have received about 80 applications to be their new manager following the departure of long-serving boss Neal Ardley.

Twice in his first three years at Maranello, he lost out on the championship at the final race. Each time, he had got himself in that position despite not having the fastest car.\n\n\"From mid-2010 to 2014,\" one Ferrari insider said, \"Fernando was the best driver in the world. There's no argument about that.\"\n\nThose championship defeats were very difficult to take.\n\nIn 2010, after overhauling a 47-point deficit and then taking the championship lead with a remarkable victory in the soaking gloom of South Korea, the team made a mistake in calling him in for an early pit stop at the final race in Abu Dhabi. He got stuck behind the Renault of Vitaly Petrov, which was faster on the straight, and finished seventh as Vettel won in his Red Bull and grabbed the title from under Alonso's nose.\n\nBy the end of the 2010 season a third title had slipped away from Alonso and a first championship was in the hands of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel\n\nTwo years later, it was even more galling.\n\nIn the fourth-fastest car, Alonso led the championship for much of the season, taking three outstanding victories along the way in Malaysia, Valencia and Germany. He was overtaken by Vettel in a burst of four consecutive wins by the German in a run of races in Asia in the closing stages of the season. But Alonso lost the title only because of two instances of bad luck.\n\nHe was taken out at the start of both the Belgian and Japanese Grands Prix: in Spa by Romain Grosjean's flying Lotus after the Frenchman tangled with Lewis Hamilton's McLaren; at Suzuka when the front wing of Kimi Raikkonen's Lotus punctured his left rear tyre.\n\nHad only one of those incidents not happened, Alonso would have been champion.\n\n\"Despite not having the best car, the team did fantastic work,\" Di Montezemolo says. \"So I am sad that the combination between Ferrari and Alonso - who for me is still one of the two or three best drivers in the world, even now - didn't work. For nothing, for a few details, a few elements.\n\n\"If he had won just one championship with Ferrari, he would have entered into history - 2010, 2012, he was able to win twice.\n\n\"Having said that, I have a very good memory of Alonso because he was able to put Ferrari on the top, win or not win, for four seasons.\"\n\nAlonso was taken out in a multi-car crash at the start of the 2012 Belgium GP, triggered by Lotus driver Romain Grosjean\n\nStefano Domenicali, Ferrari's team boss from 2008-14, adds: \"The car was not really very strong and despite that he was able to come very, very close to winning the title with Ferrari because of a lot of things he did as a driver. And therefore, even if it is not correct to say that in life, he was very unlucky.\"\n\nDomenicali says 2012 was especially difficult to take: \"To achieve that situation with the level of performance we had on the car was remarkable.\n\n\"That's why it was really very difficult at the end of the season to see, after such a fight with not really a good car, to be in that position and to lose not because it was your fault, but because you were in a place where you shouldn't be.\n\n\"I remember when there was the shunt with Grosjean, first corner at Spa, we said, 'OK, things are happening.' Then it was a big sense of frustration when, immediately after, we had the same situation in Japan with the tyre cut by Kimi in the first corner.\n\n\"That was really a very difficult moment. But it was even worse in India, where [Vettel won again and] there was this feeling of: 'Come on, this is not possible, recovering 60 points on the other side because of something you can really not fight.' The emotions were quite high at all levels.\"\n\nThe seeds of Alonso's departure from Ferrari were sown right there.\n\n'He is a guy who needs the support of the team'\n\nDomenicali described Alonso as a \"very strong force\" when then pair worked together during the Spaniard's spell at Ferrari\n\nDomenicali says: \"Fernando was really motivated to make sure he won with Ferrari. In the most difficult moments, he had that objective very clear in his mind, and that kept his motivation very high. He was always trying to push for all the details.\n\n\"So he was very interested in what was happening in Maranello. He was always connected with his engineers, and he had a very good relationship with his group of people. That was very special and it was important for the guys. And he had a very good relationship with all the world around Ferrari.\n\n\"In the period I was there, he tried to do everything to make sure he could win.\n\n\"He always pushed very hard in all conditions. Of course, he is a driver who really understands what racing is all about and he is a guy who needs the emotional support of the team. That was very important for him.\"\n\nDomenicali says Alonso's reputation as being difficult to manage, someone who drove the team apart, is \"unfair\".\n\n\"There are people with different personalities, of course,\" he adds. \"When you have someone who is - how can I say? - a very strong force, you need to manage the fact that he has a great personality. You need to handle it. It is something you need to work on with all the big drivers.\n\n\"I know sometimes people said he was putting negative pressure on the team. But when you have a champion, you have to understand his sensitivity and his point of view. And it was up to me and the team to handle that.\n\n\"He was very unlucky not to win the title because I do believe he deserved that. And of course with a title, the history of that period would have been changed dramatically.\"\n\nA slow loss of faith\n\nAlonso sent his home fans into raptures after victory at the Spanish Grand Prix in 2013 - he hasn't won an F1 race since\n\n\"Fernando was always very correct, tried to push the team to improve,\" Di Montezemolo says. \"But he entered in crisis with himself in his mind in the second half of 2013 and the first half of 2014.\"\n\nThings began to go downhill in the summer of 2013 as Alonso started to question whether Ferrari would ever be able to deliver him a car in which he could win a third world title.\n\nAt the start of the season, Ferrari's car was not absolutely competitive, but it was gentle on tyres, which were especially sensitive in early 2013, and Alonso won two of the first five races.\n\nBy the time of the eighth race, the British Grand Prix, Alonso was second in the championship. He was already 36 points behind Vettel - but closer than he had been to the lead than at the same point in 2010.\n\nThe Silverstone race saw a series of major tyre failures. Pirelli responded by making the tyres more robust. Ferrari's competitiveness fell back, and Alonso's frustration grew.\n\nIn July, his management held talks with Red Bull. Alonso believed a contract would be forthcoming. But it never materialised and, according to a Ferrari insider, Alonso's mood was dark over the weekend of the Hungarian Grand Prix as a result.\n\nAfter the race, an Italian TV interviewer asked him what he wanted for his birthday. He replied: \"La macchina degli altri\" - meaning someone else's car.\n\nDi Montezemolo was livid. He arranged for a press release to be put out the following day - Alonso's actual birthday - saying he had phoned his driver to wish him a happy birthday, but also to \"tweak his ear\" for his \"latest comments\".\n\nDi Montezemolo professes not to remember that incident now, but he does say: \"Sometimes for me it was necessary to work on him to avoid a situation where some declarations, some ideas, started because he wanted to win, [and] could create problems in the team.\n\nA Ferrari statement in 2013 said Alonso was reminded by Di Montezemolo that \"all the great champions who have driven for Ferrari have always been asked to put the interests of the team above their own\"\n\n\"I disagree when somebody says: 'Alonso is a driver that destroys, no, creates troubles in the team.' No.\n\n\"For sure, the biggest difference between Michael Schumacher and Alonso is that Michael in the best and in the worst moments was always very, very close to the team.\n\n\"Fernando is a guy that in comparison with Michael is more concentrated on himself than on the atmosphere of the team.\n\n\"This doesn't mean he is not good for the team. But I was obliged to work a lot with him on his mind, on his attitude. Because for him it was more easy to make criticisms. Not outside, but inside the team sometimes, when it is better to be more close with the team to avoid somebody in the team going: 'Oh, but Alonso is not happy.'\n\n\"Fernando was not against the team. Not. But in the worst moments he was more looking at himself, [he had] more doubts: 'What do I have to do? Maybe my race driving is not at the best. Maybe the engine designer\u2026' More conscious of himself than the team.\"\n\nHe doubted himself as a driver?\n\n\"No,\" Di Montezemolo says. \"'What can I do in this team to be more competitive? Maybe' - I give you an example - 'I have to change my race engineering, maybe it is better to convince Domenicali to change the engine guy. Maybe it is better to say to this boy I don't want to see you any more in the pits.'\n\n\"He was more doubtful regarding the overall competitiveness of the team, but always, always very strong, very pushing, trying to do from himself the maximum even in the difficult conditions.\"\n\nThat summer, Domenicali became concerned that Alonso would take a break from F1 at the end of the year. Ferrari had kept Massa as his team-mate at the end of 2012, despite misgivings about his performance, to keep Alonso happy. But they had already committed to dropping the Brazilian at the end of 2013.\n\nSo, with fears Alonso might quit, Domenicali felt he could not risk having two drivers with no experience of the team - and he re-signed Raikkonen as an insurance policy if Alonso was to walk away.\n\nThere was one final meeting with Red Bull. At the Belgian Grand Prix in late August, Alonso sat in a car at Spa airport with team boss Christian Horner and technical chief Adrian Newey and discussed a move.\n\nIn the end, it came to nothing. Alonso stayed at Ferrari for 2014.\n\nOn track, he set his mind to destroying Raikkonen, and he achieved it, out-qualifying him 16 to three at an average of more than a half a second a lap, and being beaten by him in a race only once on merit all year.\n\nBut off track, Alonso was increasingly not sure that staying at Ferrari was a good idea.\n\nDi Montezemolo says: \"In his mind, he was thinking: 'Maybe this is not the best moment to stay in Ferrari because maybe McLaren can be better, maybe (Nico) Rosberg can leave a seat at Mercedes' - that was two years before Rosberg signed the new deal with Mercedes. 'Maybe I can go to Red Bull.' He started to think about other possibilities.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "The F1 great who couldn't catch a break - part two: secrets and lies", "description": "In the second of a five-part series, we revisit the moment of madness in Hungary when Fernando Alonso held up Lewis Hamilton - and the rest of his career.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46226823", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/122A0/production/_104400447_alonso_02_v2.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:08:40Z", "content": "Fernando Alonso: the F1 great who couldn't catch a break - part two of five The second part of our series on the key moments of Fernando Alonso's career reveals new secrets about the tempestuous events that ended his first spell at McLaren.

Alonso threatened to reveal potentially incriminating emails to do with the 'spy-gate' case. Dennis phoned FIA president Max Mosley to tell him what Alonso had said.\n\nThat led to a second 'spy-gate' hearing, which re-analysed the claim that McLaren had benefited from secret Ferrari technical information. There, unlike at the first hearing, McLaren were found guilty, fined $100m and thrown out of the constructors' championship.\n\nBut people forget what triggered all that. And, until now, exactly what Alonso said to Dennis in that fateful meeting has never become public. This is the full story.\n\nA trick - and then payback\n\nHungary was the 11th round of the championship. Tensions at McLaren were higher than ever. Dennis and Alonso were no longer really talking. And, six races on from Monaco, the drivers were in exactly the same position in the championship - Hamilton leading Alonso by two points.\n\nLewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso both finished the 2007 season with 109 points, a point behind title winner Kini Raikkonen\n\nFinal qualifying that year ran to a bizarre and complicated procedure whereby drivers began the session with the fuel load with which they would start the race. They then drove around doing what were called 'fuel-burn laps' before setting the lap times that defined the grid. Before the race, drivers were allowed to refill their tanks with the amount of fuel used on the 'fuel-burn laps'.\n\nThis system could only cause tension in a team, especially one with two drivers going for the championship.\n\nFirstly, there was the question of how much fuel was in the car when the driver did his final qualifying laps - more fuel means a slower lap time.\n\nSecondly, there was always an optimum time for a first pit stop in the race - and therefore an optimum number of fuel-burn laps. But two drivers in the same team could not stop on the same lap in the race. So how to decide who got to choose the optimum strategy?\n\nMcLaren's solution to this after the controversy of Monaco was to ensure both drivers had equal fuel loads for their qualifying runs - and to alternate who had the favourable race fuel strategy. In Hungary, it was Alonso's turn to have priority.\n\nThat should have meant that he left the pits first and did the most fuel-burn laps. This conferred a double advantage - it would not only give him a lighter car when he did his final qualifying run, but also more fuel for the first stint of the race.\n\nBut that is not what happened.\n\nHamilton left the garage first and was at the head of the queue waiting to go out at the start of the session, with Alonso behind. As soon as the cars had left the pits, the team radioed Hamilton to let Alonso past so they could run to the plan. But he ignored repeated requests. Dennis even came on the radio to him, but still Hamilton did not comply.\n\nAlonso was now at a disadvantage - he would not only have more fuel in his car when he did his qualifying runs, but he would get less back for the start of the race. He was shouting on the radio, asking why Hamilton was not letting him by. Then, he took matters into his own hands.\n\nRealising he had been tricked, Alonso worked out a way to pay Hamilton back. He slowed down, gauging it so that he was almost a lap behind Hamilton at the end of the fuel-burn phase, and pitted before him.\n\nThey went out to do their first qualifying laps, with Hamilton setting a faster time, before returning to the pits, Alonso a few seconds ahead on the road.\n\nThe team prepared to 'stack' the cars - service Alonso with fresh tyres before waving him out and then do the same for Hamilton, who was waiting behind him.\n\nMcLaren did not collect any constructors' championship points during 2007 after the 'spy-gate' scandal\n\nBut after his tyres were fitted, Alonso stayed where he was. Ten seconds went by before he accelerated away - just long enough to ensure there was not enough time for Hamilton to get back on track in time to complete a second lap. On his own second lap, Alonso took pole.\n\n\"The problems had started before,\" a source says. \"This was just the final volcanic eruption. But Lewis started it. Let's not forget that. If he had let Fernando past, there would not have been an explosion.\"\n\nHamilton's father Anthony went to see the stewards and lobbied hard for Alonso to be punished. The stewards called up the two drivers and asked them what had happened. They took everything into account, and gave Alonso a five-place grid penalty.\n\nAlonso's demand to Dennis revealed\n\nThe next morning, Alonso was still furious.\n\nFor some time he had been telling Dennis that he and Hamilton should not be racing each other. The pattern was obvious. They were taking points off each other, and the Ferrari drivers were still too close for comfort. If they were not careful, Alonso believed, they would end up losing a title they should win.\n\nAlonso decided to play his hand. With his manager Luis Garcia Abad also in attendance, he had a meeting with Dennis a few hours before the race.\n\nAlonso told Dennis he needed to right the wrong Hamilton had caused him the day before. Hamilton had double-crossed him on the fuel-burn laps, Alonso said, and now he had a penalty and was sixth on the grid. It was not right.\n\nThe relationship was already broken after Monaco. But what Alonso said next ensured on the spot that he would have to leave the team at the end of the year.\n\nIt is well known that Alonso threatened Dennis that if the team did not do what he wanted, he would reveal to the FIA emails he had that were relevant to the 'spy-gate' case, in which McLaren had recently escaped censure for one of their engineers possessing a document of confidential Ferrari technical information that ran to nearly 800 pages.\n\n\"Hi Lewis, Fernando wants to say something.\" Ron Dennis puts on a happy face\n\nBut what exactly he asked them to do has previously been known only by a handful of privileged insiders.\n\nAlonso insisted that McLaren make Hamilton run out of fuel in the race.\n\nDennis asked Alonso to stop talking. He called in Martin Whitmarsh, his second in command, and asked Alonso to repeat what he had just said. He did. Dennis sent Alonso and Abad away, turned to Whitmarsh and asked what he thought they should do.\n\nDennis said he thought they should phone FIA president Max Mosley. Whitmarsh agreed. They also both agreed that they could not allow Alonso to race. They could not have a driver blackmailing the team.\n\nDennis phoned Mosley and told him what had happened. Mosley asked him what he was going to do, then advised Dennis not to take Alonso out of the car.\n\nThen FIA president Max Moseley with Ron Dennis at the 2007 Belgian Grand Prix\n\nIt is widely believed that phone call led to the second spy-gate hearing, at which McLaren were heavily punished. But Mosley says that is not true.\n\n\"I already knew about the emails,\" Mosley says. Alonso had told Flavio Briatore, his former Renault team boss and his manager. Briatore, Mosley says, had told F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone about them, and Ecclestone had told Mosley, who had seen them before Hungary.\n\nAbout half an hour after the meeting, Abad went back to Dennis and said that Alonso wanted to apologise - he had lost his temper and completely retracted everything he said.\n\nHamilton won the race from pole. Alonso finished fourth from sixth on the grid. After the race, Alonso shook Dennis' hand and apologised in person for what he had said at the meeting that morning. Dennis said at the subsequent FIA hearing: \"I put it down to the heat of the moment, in which he was angry.\"\n\nMosley decided to launch a second spy-gate investigation. He demanded access to all McLaren's emails and, a month after Hungary, the team were summoned to attend a second hearing. They were thrown out of the constructors' championship, and fined $100m, less the money they would have earned from whatever position they finished in the championship.\n\nNot long afterwards, Dennis met Alonso on neutral ground with their lawyers and negotiated an early release from his contract.\n\nBoth Alonso and Hamilton won one more race each that year, and ended up losing the title to Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen by a single point.\n\nAs the championship reached its climax, the arguments Alonso had been making to Dennis about his fight with Hamilton came true.\n\nAlthough his relationship with the team was now totally broken, Alonso beat Hamilton in both Belgium and Italy. That left Hamilton leading Alonso by two points with three races to go.\n\nIn Japan, Alonso, his car damaged and lacking downforce after a collision with another driver, crashed in the wet trying to keep up with Hamilton, who won.\n\nIn China, Hamilton crashed in the pit lane coming in to change badly worn tyres on which the team had left him out too long trying to ensure he beat Alonso. Had they brought him in earlier, he would have been champion that day at the end of probably the greatest season by a rookie in history.\n\nHamilton won one world title during his six-year spell with McLaren - he should have had two\n\nThen, in the final race in Brazil, Hamilton ran wide on the first lap trying to pass Alonso around the outside, dropped to the back of the field with a brief electronics glitch and recovered to finish seventh. Alonso's race was trouble-free but he could not keep up with the Ferraris.\n\nFelipe Massa dominated, but Ferrari delayed him at his final pit stop, allowing Raikkonen to win the race and the championship. Alonso and Hamilton were tied, one point behind, Hamilton classified ahead by virtue of having more second places.\n\nA month after that, Alonso officially left McLaren, and for a long time no-one thought he could ever go back."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Alonso: the F1 great who couldn't catch a break - personality clash", "description": "In the first of a five-part series looking back at Fernando Alonso's F1 career, Andrew Benson explains when it all started to go wrong at McLaren in 2007.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/46225204", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/10F49/production/_104394496_alonso_01.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:08:38Z", "content": "Fernando Alonso: the F1 great who couldn't catch a break - part one of five Fernando Alonso retires from Formula 1 this weekend at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as one of the sport's biggest stars but arguably its greatest enigma.

Alonso's story will be published in a series of episodes this week, based on interviews with the key people directly involved in the various incidents at the time. Some spoke on the record, some on condition of anonymity.\n\nThis opening part is about the first serious flashpoint in a year in which two of the all-time great F1 drivers went head-to-head in the same team, and how their team boss' desire to control the situation only made it worse.\n\nA clash of personalities\n\nAll smiles: oh, OK, maybe not... Ron Dennis, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso share the podium at Monza after a McLaren one-two in 2007\n\nIn popular perception, Alonso's relationship with McLaren was broken by events at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, when a dispute over tactics in qualifying led to Alonso blocking Hamilton in the pits, a grid penalty, and a seismic row with team principal Ron Dennis, in which Alonso threatened to blackmail the team.\n\nIn fact, it was already terminally damaged before that. Ten weeks before that, in fact, in Monaco, where Alonso was so angered by a post-race argument that his relationship with Dennis never recovered.\n\nIn many ways, Alonso's 2007 season with McLaren has come to define perceptions of his career - the intense fight with Hamilton, the fall-out with Dennis, the 'spy-gate' scandal, in which Alonso was involved in the team eventually being thrown out of the constructors' championship and being fined $100m for possessing nearly 800 pages of Ferrari technical information.\n\nBut not everything happened in the way most remember it.\n\nAlonso's move to McLaren began as he and Dennis were about to go out on the podium in Brazil in 2005. Alonso, then at Renault, had just clinched his first world title, by finishing third behind McLaren drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen. As they waited for the ceremony, Dennis asked Alonso whether he would like to drive for McLaren one day.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Fernando Alonso - F1 becoming too predictable\n\nSince he was a boy, watching the dominant McLaren-Hondas of Alain Prost and, particularly, Ayrton Senna, Alonso had dreamed of exactly that. What had started as an off-hand remark quickly became serious negotiations. A deal was struck that winter for Alonso to drive for McLaren for three years from 2007.\n\nHe joined as a double world champion. He was the driver who had ended five years of domination by Michael Schumacher and Ferrari, and his two world titles with Renault were won the hard way. First, against Raikkonen in a faster but more fragile McLaren in 2005, and then in a man-to-man duel with Schumacher in 2006.\n\nHe had established himself as a fast, tough, relentless competitor. Following Schumacher's retirement at the end of the 2006 season, Alonso was F1's new 'main man'.\n\nBut his relationship with his new team started to go wrong from very early on.\n\nExpectations unrealised\n\nMcLaren announced their shock signing of Alonso in 2005 for the 2007 season, after the Spaniard had won his first world championship with Renault\n\nAlonso signed for McLaren long before they decided to promote Hamilton, who they had nurtured since he was 11 years old, as his team-mate. When they did, Alonso wondered whether employing a rookie was a good idea for a team that had aspirations of winning the constructors' championship, but he was not worried.\n\nFirst of all, his self-confidence assured him he would have no problem beating a driver in his rookie season. Equally, although there was nothing about it in his contract, Alonso believed Dennis had verbally promised him priority status in the team. Dennis has always insisted it was not the case.\n\nOnce at McLaren, Alonso soon began to question how things were working.\n\n\"He came expecting to be treated like a king,\" remembers one senior figure at the time, \"and it was even small stuff. Like, in those days, in the trucks at a test, there was nowhere the drivers could get changed privately. They just got changed at the end of the race truck, in a corner. And I think he came expecting to have a room.\n\n\"Fernando is an emotional character and people like that want to feel like they're treated as the best even if there is no substance to it. But McLaren being very British was all, 'Well, we're very correct in everything we do.'\n\n\"So from the beginning there were all sorts of misses in terms of his expectation of how he should be treated. Which are not necessarily unreasonable, by the way.\"\n\nMcLaren fans show their appreciation for Hamilton in 2007\n\nThat would not have been an issue if he had been decisively faster than his team-mate. But he wasn't. Hamilton was immediately on the pace, giving Alonso a hard time on track, and the older man did not like it.\n\nIn the first race of the season in Australia, Hamilton announced his intentions by passing his team-mate around the outside of the first corner just after the start, before Alonso re-passed him in the pits to take second behind Raikkonen's Ferrari.\n\nAlonso won next time out in Malaysia, but team harmony was already fracturing.\n\nHamilton's performances were unsettling Alonso. Hamilton's father Anthony was arguing his son's case vehemently and consistently with Dennis and his number two Martin Whitmarsh. And Alonso was beginning to make the point to Dennis that the two drivers should not be racing each other. The cocktail was combustible.\n\nAt the third race of the season, in Bahrain, Dennis chose to have one of his 'supportive chats' with Alonso while his driver was sitting at a table outside the McLaren motorhome in full view of the paddock. The photographers lapped it up. Dennis tried his best, but already any hope of maintaining a pretence that everything was hunky dory was gone.\n\nMonaco one-two sparks almighty row\n\nAlonso's second win of the 2007 season in Monaco: rage nicely concealed on the podium there\n\nBy Monaco, the fifth race, tension was high. Hamilton had taken four consecutive podiums and was leading the championship by two points from the man who believed he was supposed to be team leader. Ferrari drivers Raikkonen and Felipe Massa, with a win apiece, were close behind.\n\nHamilton was quickest through practice, but it was Alonso who took pole position, and went on to dominate the race.\n\nBut when the drivers got back to the pits, all hell broke loose.\n\n\"There was a row,\" one senior McLaren insider says. \"Somehow Lewis felt he could have won the race and I don't remember being entirely convinced that he could have done. I seem to remember the right guy won it.\"\n\nPublicly, the narrative - partly propagated by Dennis' interviews - was how McLaren had manipulated the result to secure a one-two, but prevent the battle between the two drivers playing out.\n\nDennis said he \"virtually had to decide in advance\" who won the race. Hamilton did nothing to play that down when he said in the post-race news conference: \"It is something I have to live with. I've number two on my car and I am the number two driver.\"\n\nThe implication - or at least the inference taken by many - was that Hamilton was the rightful winner.\n\nTo say the least, Alonso was not happy with this interpretation of events.\n\nWhy Alonso was annoyed\n\nThe two McLaren drivers were closely matched in the first part of the 2007 Monaco Grand Prix\n\nAlonso had led from the start and had built an eight-second lead within 17 laps, as Hamilton suffered more badly with tyre graining - where the surface tears and causes a loss of grip.\n\nAlonso then lost time lapping backmarkers but was just over four seconds in front by the time of his first pit stop on lap 26.\n\nThese were the days of refuelling. Hamilton believed he was stopping five laps after Alonso, but was brought in after only three. Alonso said he had saved enough fuel in his opening stint to make his stop two laps later than planned.\n\nBut the idea that Hamilton could have gained enough time on empty tanks before his stop to pass Alonso had he stayed out longer was undermined when Alonso returned to the track, 15 seconds behind his team-mate.\n\nAt this point, on empty tanks and with durable Bridgestone tyres with negligible performance drop-off, Hamilton's car should have been quicker than Alonso's after a stop for fuel. But Alonso first flying lap with a full fuel load and fresh tyres was within 0.1secs of Hamilton's time on empty tanks.\n\nIn other words, even if Hamilton had stayed out for another couple of laps, he would not have taken the lead.\n\nAt the second stops, it was a similar story. Alonso was nearly 11 seconds in front when he pitted. Hamilton was brought in two laps later, but even if he had stayed out for another few, he was unlikely to have been able to make up that deficit.\n\nFrom there, Alonso backed off, to protect overheating rear brake calipers, which were known before the race to be a vulnerability on both cars. Hamilton quickly caught him up and followed closely behind to the flag.\n\n\"Lewis was putting on pressure,\" an insider said, \"and Fernando had to speed up and he was very annoyed. He said: 'Imagine if my brakes failed. What is the point of that? He was never going to overtake me. I was just cruising.'\n\n\"So Fernando was not happy to have to push at the end of the race, because of reliability problems.\"\n\nWhen Alonso climbed out of the car, he was met by Dennis, who told him he'd had to control the race, and tell Hamilton to back off, and that Alonso should be gentle with Hamilton about it.\n\nWhat Dennis meant was, this is my problem, let me deal with it. But Alonso did not take it that way. He thought Dennis was implying he was not the rightful winner, that he had only won because the team had slowed Hamilton down and controlled his pit stops. Alonso was furious.\n\nDennis did not realise it at the time - and may still not do now. But, according to a source close to Alonso: \"That was the divorce. That moment onwards it was full divorce.\"\n\nHamilton was not happy either.\n\nHe had been the quicker man through practice. He felt he had only lost pole because he had been held up by Mark Webber's Red Bull in qualifying - although this was not certain, as Alonso had himself been slowed by Nico Rosberg's Williams in the closing corners of his lap.\n\nThen, in the race Hamilton had been brought in earlier than expected at both his stops, so had not had the chance to run his strategy - which had been to fill up with more fuel in qualifying with the idea of running longer than Alonso. And he had been called off attacking Alonso in the closing laps. The fact that, the way the race panned out, he was probably not going to beat Alonso anyway was irrelevant to him.\n\nDennis, in making a perfectly understandable decision to call off the race after the final stops and then justifying it, had inadvertently annoyed both his warring drivers.\n\nThe consequences of that would be immense."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/19 12:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3qldm", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Can Scotland finally lift Hampden hoodoo in the Nations League?", "description": "Scotland haven't qualified for a tournament since Hampden was redeveloped, but is the national stadium jinxed?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46253903", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1451D/production/_104392238_5442608.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:59:19Z", "content": "Scotland's results at Hampden since France 98 Scotland stand three wins away from a place at Euro 2020.

Then they posted a 3-0 victory over Lithuania in the first game back at the swanky new pad.\n\nAnd then the new home became haunted by ghosts of the past.\n\nJinxed?\n\nIt all began with a 2-0 defeat by England at Hampden in the Euro 2000 play-offs. A 1-0 win at Wembley could not salvage qualification or indeed halt the downward spiral that would follow.\n\nScotland have played 46 competitive games at Hampden since its re-opening. They have won 22 of them, a win rate of 48%. The more telling statistic has been the 11 defeats.\n\nIn the three competitive home games played outside Hampden - two at Celtic Park and one at Ibrox - Scotland have won all three, scoring eight goals and conceding none.\n\nIn friendlies, Scotland's record at Hampden is poor. In 17 games, they have won just four. Yet, in friendlies elsewhere - at Pittodrie and Easter Road - they boast seven wins from 10.\n\nAll in all, in 63 games at Hampden in front of the upgraded main stand, Scotland have 26 wins. A win record of 41%.\n\nScotland's home record since the revamped Hampden was opened in 1999\n\nSigns for optimism?\n\nScotland were temporarily deposed from their home due to the 2014 Commonwealth Games. They boasted Euro 2016 qualifying wins over Georgia at Ibrox, Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park, and a friendly win over Qatar at Easter Road. There was just one defeat, in a friendly to England.\n\nBack to Glasgow's south side they went. A 6-1 thrashing of Gibraltar began a return to form in competitive games.\n\nNine games, five wins, three draws, and just one defeat - to the then-world champions Germany.\n\nThey have lost a few friendlies, but another three points against Israel would boost their win percentage to 60% in competitive games since returning to Hampden after the Commonwealth Games."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "World sport: 10 photos we liked this week - 12-18 November", "description": "A selection of the most striking sports photographs from around the world this week.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/46254280", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/70ED/production/_104390982_handball_getty.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:59:00Z", "content": "A selection of some of the most striking sports photographs taken around the world this week: Levi, Finland, 18 November: The men's slalom course under lights during the most recent leg of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup.

He has been credited with turning around both Renault and Nissan, before going on to become the linchpin of the Renault-Nissan Alliance.\n\nThat Franco-Japanese axis, which also now includes Mitsubishi, is one of the world's biggest carmakers.\n\nThe question is what happens now. Mr Ghosn had already begun shedding some of his responsibilities - he stepped down as chief executive of Nissan last year, and recently offloaded some day to day responsibilities at Renault as well.\n\nBut he was expected to remain chief executive of Renault and to continue in overall charge of the Alliance for the next few years.\n\nToday's announcements seem to undermine that strategy.

Researchers were surprised to learn some sounds, such as the tea trolley, brought a degree of comfort to patients - as a signal of social interaction\n\nPatients and families need clear information about probably noise levels during admissions, so they are better prepared in advance, and can consider simple solutions such as bringing their own headphones or earplugs\n\nDr Xyrichis questions whether sound \"is considered\" when creating or redeveloping hospital infrastructure.\n\nBut he stresses that modifications can be made to existing environments at a relatively low cost.\n\nInterventions such as sound-absorbing panels and noise-warning systems \"have provided some benefit\".\n\nElsewhere, small trials have shown that sound-masking - the use of background sound (such as white noise) in particular environments to reduce noise-induced disturbance - can significantly improve sleep.\n\nMost importantly, says Dr Xyrichis, research should \"be more aware of the patients\".\n\nHe says research made clear that much of patients' agitation over noise was often caused by \"not knowing what the noises were\".\n\n\"It can be very frightening in hospital.

Of that number, 352 have seen their deficits increase since 2017-18.\n\nAll schools are expected to submit their financial plans for each school year to the EA.\n\nThe budget pressures faced by schools are \"quite intense\", according to Northern Ireland's most senior civil servant.\n\nDavid Sterling said the Department of Education was \"doing all it can\" to make sure \"our schools are suitably and sufficiently funded\".\n\nBut he admitted it was \"difficult\" and said there needed to be \"long-term planning\" and \"major transformation\" for public services.\n\n'Support at-risk schools'\n\nIn 2018, for the first time, the EA has put schools into a number of categories depending on their budgetary situation.\n\nIn the most serious category, 97 schools have increasing deficits of more than 5% of their total yearly budget and do not meet key sustainability criteria.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The EA says budget categories are not a judgement of school management\n\nA total of 130 schools have increasing deficits of more than 5% of their total yearly budget but are judged to be sustainable.\n\nAs a result, the EA is to appoint specialist staff to work with each of those 227 schools on their budget.\n\nThe EA said the category given to a school \"is not a judgement on their financial management or stewardship\".\n\n\"The categorisation is to enable EA to target its support to those schools at most financial risk,\" it added.\n\nThe EA had previously warned that schools in Northern Ireland were set to overspend their budgets by about \u00a333m in 2018-19.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Audit Office has said that school budgets have reduced by 10% in real terms over the past five years.\n\n'Beyond a joke'\n\nA number of school principals have said they cannot afford to send teachers to training that would enable them to help pupils with speech and language problems.\n\nThe EA's language and communication service has organised more than 30 training courses for teachers in the next five months but cannot pay schools for the cost of substitute teacher cover to enable staff to attend.\n\nThe principals of Dromara Primary School and Comber Primary School in County Down and Maghaberry Primary School in County Armagh are among those who cannot send their teachers to the training.\n\nImage caption Graham Gault, principal of Maghaberry Primary School, told MPs that parents were donating toilet roll to his school\n\nThey estimate that it would cost about \u00a3200 to send a teacher to one session of the training.\n\nAndy Armstrong, the principal of Dromara Primary School, said the situation was \"beyond a joke\".\n\n\"I just felt so deflated that while courses are being offered we can't afford to send anyone,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the EA acknowledged that schools faced \"unprecedented pressures\".\n\n\"Many school leaders have told us of the intolerable strain that the deteriorating financial position has placed upon them,\" they said.\n\n\"EA will continue to advocate for additional funding for schools and services to support schools, children and young people.\"\n\n'Spiralling out of control'\n\nDeidre Gillespie, principal of St Mary's Grammar in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, said there needs to be a \"root and branch review\" of how money is spent in the education system.\n\n\"Over the past six to seven years, schools have embarked on a series of cost-cutting measures and we've got to the stage now where there are no longer any savings to make within our budgets,\" she said.\n\n\"Ninety percent of our costs go to staffing, which increase every year and upon which we have very little control.\n\n\"It means that last 10% to 15% of our budget, where we've made those cost-saving measures over a number of years, we're really not able to create any more cost-saving.\n\n\"We're in a crisis situation and we're getting to the point very, very soon where the system is spiralling out of control.\"\n\nComber Primary School principal Chris Logan said that the funding relied on by the EA was being pared away.\n\n\"Our school, like many others, would also be unable to attend [training] due to lack of funding and the need to closely monitor and limit expenditure due to our deficit position,\" he said.\n\n\"I look forward to the time when we are able again to access incredible training opportunities and not turn them down due to lack of funding.\"\n\nGraham Gault, of Maghaberry Primary School, had previously told a Westminster Committee that

In such a period you don't go to elections,\" he said of recent escalation of tensions in the region.\n\nA push to the right?\n\nBy Yolande Knell, BBC Jerusalem correspondent\n\nNaftali Bennett's surprise decision to remain in the coalition is likely to mean a push for more legislation and action in the coming weeks to prove the government's right-wing credentials.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu appears keen to avoid going to the polls early next year at a time when the attorney general is expected to decide whether to charge him in relation to a series of corruption cases. If he's charged, it would inevitably lead to calls to step down.\n\nAn election would also complicate plans by the Trump administration - which has promised it will soon unveil its peace plan to end the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nWhere does Netanyahu's coalition stand?\n\nUnder the law, elections are not due until November 2019 at the latest.\n\nIf Mr Bennett had withdrawn his nationalist Jewish Home party from government, Prime Minister Netanyahu would have been left with a minority government, making snap elections more likely.\n\nHowever, as it stands he still has 61 out of 120 of the parliamentary seats in the Knesset - which means further disagreements between coalition parties could still collapse the government.\n\nThe current government has been in power since March 2015. It comprises mostly nationalist and religious parties which take a hard line towards dealing with the Palestinians and reject the idea that giving up occupied land will lead to peace.\n\nAll Israeli governments are coalitions because of Israel's system of proportional representation, meaning no single party can govern alone.\n\nRecent polls show Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has won four elections, is a favourite amongst the electorate and his Likud party has the most support.\n\nHow did the crisis come about?\n\nMr Lieberman and Mr Bennett both opposed the prime minister's decision to cease fire with Palestinian militant group Hamas last week after an escalation in violence between Israel and the militants in Gaza.\n\nOn 11 November, an undercover Israeli unit was intercepted in Gaza and an ensuing firefight - involving Israeli tanks and aircraft - left seven Palestinian militants and one Israeli commando dead.\n\nHamas unleashed some 460 rockets and mortars at Israel over the next 48 hours - the heaviest barrage since the two sides fought a war in 2014. Israel responded with 160 air strikes, targeting militant sites in Gaza.\n\nThe violence killed seven more people in Gaza and one person in Israel.\n\nLast Tuesday, Hamas and Israel agreed to cease fire after Egyptian mediation - a decision which Mr Lieberman and Mr Bennett called \"a surrender\".\n\nMr Lieberman said it made his position untenable, while Mr Bennett demanded to become defence minister \"so that Israel will go back to winning\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/19 09:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3q757", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'I fought to speak to the man who stabbed me'", "description": "After Janika Cartwright's ex-partner tried to murder her, she wanted to confront him face to face.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46210384", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B15C/production/_104340454_janikahospitalbed1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:59Z", "content": "Image copyright Janika Cartwright After Janika Cartwright's ex-partner tried to murder her, she wanted to confront him face to face and ask him why.

The BBC's Nitin Sr\u2026 [+6756 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Migrant families fled following the attacks that lasted more than a week\n\nTens of thousands of migrant workers fled India's western state of Gujarat in October in the wake of attacks targeting them. The BBC's Nitin Srivastava reports from Himmatnagar town on what led to the violence.\n\n\"I had to run six miles to catch a bus at midnight,\" said Ram Pyare, who worked in a factory in the town.\n\nThe 33-year-old took the bus to the capital, Ahmedabad, and went to the train station - but all the trains were full. It was another eight hours before he had borrowed enough money to buy a ticket to go home to his village in Jaunpur district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHe was among the thousands of migrants - estimates range from 50,000 to 80,000 - who fled Gujarat after the attacks. The violence, which lasted for more than a week, began after a migrant labourer was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-month-old girl.\n\nNo-one died in the violence, but the fear among the migrant workers was evident as they queued up at railway stations and bus stops to escape.\n\nThe attacks were sparked by the alleged rape but they also exposed economic anxieties in a state where local traders and businessmen are struggling and joblessness is on the rise. And migrants - who account for a significant portion of the workforce and whose cheap labour keeps wages low - are often seen as the problem.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Estimates said 50,000 to 80,000 migrant workers left Gujarat after they were targeted\n\n\"All my savings are gone,\" Ram Pyare told me over the phone from Jaunpur. He is yet to find a job but he vows he will never return to Gujarat, where he lived for six years.\n\n\"I had planned to bring my family there but not anymore.\"\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nRam Pyare used to work in a factory that manufactured ceramic tiles in Himmatnagar in northern Gujarat.\n\nHe had just finished dinner on 28 September - it was a breezy night, he recalls - when he heard a commotion outside. More than 20 locals stormed inside, he says, \"armed with bamboo sticks and iron rods\". They beat up the workers while hurling abuses at them and warning them to never return to Gujarat.\n\n\"I would have been lynched if the security guard had not helped me sneak out of the back door,\" he adds.\n\nGujarat, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi and current Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has long been heralded as an example of economic development. Its labour-intensive industries - such as textiles, jewellery and ceramics - draw a large numbers of migrants from poorer states in the north. An estimated 10% of Gujarat's more than 60 million people are believed to be migrants.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gujarat's labour-intensive industries attract migrant workers from poorer states\n\nBut growth has stalled in recent years because of the twin shocks of demonetisation and the goods and services tax. The surprise cancellation of 86% of currency notes by the government in November 2016 hit small traders and businesses; and the new, uniform tax code also cost them as they struggled to adapt to it. Many cash-only businesses in the informal sector were forced to close or register for the first time.\n\nGujarat's farmers too, like those across the country, have been struggling in the face of stagnant incomes and crop prices.\n\nWith general elections round the corner, opposition political parties have been banking on this frustration.\n\nDemands for job quotas have played an increasing role in the state's politics. Days prior to when the attacks began on 28 September, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said his government was drafting a law to ensure that 80% of the jobs went to people from Gujarat.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nAccording to local media reports, police arrested some 500 people, including a lawmaker, in connection with the violence.\n\nBut tension still persists. Nearly two months later, it's hard to say how many of the workers who left have returned.\n\nThe factory Ram Pyare used to work in was set on fire by a mob as were the residential quarters in the compound.\n\n\"The situation turned so bad that police officers who were on leave were ordered to report back,\" said constable Pravin Sinh.\n\n\"We had never experienced such animosity from locals,\" Ram Pyare said, adding that he was shocked to find that many of the attackers included people from neighbouring villages that he had interacted with in the past.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The cancellation of 500 and 1000-rupee notes two years ago hurt small traders and cash-only businesses\n\nAngry villagers in the area downplayed the violent reaction but told the BBC that \"if something like this ever happens again, we won't hesitate to kill and defend our honour\".\n\nThey also talk about their deep-seated resentments against the migrants.\n\n\"Our lands are gone and 90% of the factory workers are non-Gujaratis,\" said Rajendra Sinh Rathod, a former village head in the Sabarkantha district, where the alleged rape happened.\n\n\"They should hire migrants, we never objected to that. But what about locals? We need to be given preference.\"\n\nThe state's industrial policy says that 70% of a factory's workforce must comprise locals. But migrant workers remain the first choice for factory owners as they are believed to work longer hours for lower wages.\n\nBut Gujarat's interior minister Pradeep Sinh Jadeja denies that employment norms have been flouted.\n\n\"We have never compromised on labour laws. Some businesses may have flouted norms but necessary action is being taken against them. As far as the migrants workers are concerned, most will return. They have always felt safe in the state,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNot everyone agrees with that statement.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The attacks in Gujarat sparked protests in different parts of India, including in Delhi\n\n\"Gujarat has a history of opposing migrants - right from the days when people from southern India arrived here to do accounting jobs back in the 1960s and 1970s,\" said Professor Gaurang Jani, a sociologist.\n\n\"Be it [over] vegetarian or non-vegetarian [food], be it [over] religion or community, Gujarat has seen a continuous process of intolerance. It's not visible from outside but it escalates into a big issue even after a minor incident.\"\n\nThe anti-migrant violence has once again put the focus on the deep fissures that exist in Gujarat.\n\n\"What happened is scary. Thousands sold off their gold jewellery and valuables at throwaway prices and ran away. But the state needs migrants to keep factories running,\" said Shayam Thakur who runs an organisation to protect the interests of migrant workers from the northern states.\n\nMany locals echo Mr Thakur's sentiment and worry that the \"anti-migrant\" attitude may set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\"The guilty should be punished but why hold all accountable for some?\" said Payal Thakor, a nurse in a private hospital in Sanand city.\n\n\"They came here for a livelihood and cannot be thrown out like this.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/19 07:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3pznz", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T07:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Scottish Gossip: Alex McLeish, Scotland, Hearts, Rangers", "description": "Tartan Army urged to turn out in force for key Nations League match, Scotland call-off are \"totally genuine injuries\"...", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46258209", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/5844/production/_102969522_fgsdgd.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T06:53:27Z", "content": "FOOTBALL GOSSIP Scotland manager Alex McLeish urges the Tartan Army to turn out in force for clash against Israel tomorrow after giving them \"something to cheer about\" against Albania.

That would be the verdict had New Zealand, Ireland, Wales, or any other top-drawer international side been troubled by Japan for 55 minutes or so.\n\nThe visitors are tenacious, fit and have some fabulous individual skills, but are ultimately limited. They are not, or should not be, powerful enough in the tight and set-piece to trouble the best teams in the world.\n\nEddie Jones protested afterwards that he was happy to see his England team tested. There are certain amounts of spin that any head coach has to do and I am sure it would have been very different behind closed doors.\n\nHe stressed the impact of England's self-inflicted short preparation time and the changes he made in personnel.\n\nThat is no excuse for me. England don't put out scratch sides anymore. The Rugby Football Union handsomely compensate Premiership Rugby clubs to free up the players for all sorts of camps and get-togethers.\n\nIn addition, nearly three years into his England reign, there should be a certain style of play that is almost a reflex for Jones' teams.\n\nJones himself outlined what England's DNA should be - telling BBC Sport in October 2015 that a strong set-piece, strong defence and excellent discipline would be the basis of the national team.\n\nThey may make tweaks dependent on team changes and the opposition, but the key elements of their play should be ingrained and immutable regardless of who comes in.\n\nEngland Japan Possession 37% 63% Territory 36% 64% Penalties conceded 12 9 Turnovers conceded 16 13 Metres made 385 549 Clean breaks 11 18 Defenders beaten 18 32\n\nLow errors and a low penalty count are the foundations for building Test-match pressure.\n\nEngland gave away 12 penalties to Japan's nine. They conceded 16 turnovers to Japan's 13. Hooker Jamie George was sin-binned in the first half.\n\nThe best teams in the world just do not do that and, when the opposition do, they will convert that quantity of free ball to field position, points and victory.\n\nIndividually, there were disappointing afternoons for those fringe players hoping to stake a claim.\n\nAlex Lozowski struggled to get into the match, having possession only five times, running once and failing to gain any metres\n\nSaracens centre Alex Lozowski was making only his third start for England and his first in nearly a year, but was replaced at half-time.\n\nHe is a very talented all-round player, but that does not necessarily translate into the walking into a team and performing.\n\nHenry Slade made his international debut in August 2015, but it is only in the past six months that he has established himself as a first-choice international midfielder.\n\nLozowski is going through a similar phase to Slade, struggling to get a foothold in the team. It is a shame, but I think he is good enough to get another opportunity.\n\nZach Mercer did not last much longer. The Bath number eight was replaced in the 49th minute. With England lacking front-foot momentum, he was perhaps trapped doing jobs that he is not best suited to.\n\nHe hardly had any carries in open field.\n\nOn a brighter note, Joe Cokanasiga did himself no harm at all. He has the size, strength and power to make yards or buy time for his support even in congested areas of the pitch.\n\nThat physicality is something that none of the other England wing options offer. He also showed good composure and awareness in England's third-minute try.\n\nJapan's fly-half Yu Tamura prodded a kick over the top of England's defensive line and towards the left touchline.\n\nCrucially, though, the chase was fractured with only wing Akihito Yamada applying real pressure to Elliot Daly as the England full-back fielded the ball just outside his 22m.\n\nCokanasiga had worked hard to get himself in play, giving Daly a passing option and adding width to the counter-attack...\n\n..as Daly drew his man and released the ball to Cokanasiga, hooker Jamie George, number eight Zach Mercer and scrum-half Danny Care all modified their movement to anticipate the wing gaining significant ground.\n\nCokanasiga didn't let the adrenaline get the better of him, picking out Jamie George's support line inside as fly-half Tamura came across to challenge him...\n\n...and Care was just one of a clutch of England players queuing up to carry in the game's opening score.\n\nEngland could not maintain that clarity of thought and dynamism though.\n\nIt was noticeable that the introduction of some of England's first-choice players in the second half improved the hosts' variety and control.\n\nThere were too many simple one-out runners around the fringe in the first half that played into the hands of a Japan defence that was more committed than organised.\n\nHere in the 55th minute, however, first receiver Kyle Sinckler had options off both shoulders.\n\nThe defence came up fast in his face, but the Harlequins prop showed deft hands to flick the ball onto Sam Underhill, changing the point of attack and making yards.\n\nThe combination generated quick front-foot ball for the next phase. Japan's defence just about numbered up, but was stretched with full-back Will Tupou sprinting up from backfield to cover Cokanasiga and, crucially, George Ford able to run at space outside Michael Leitch.\n\nWith Japan number eight Kazuki Himeno unable to match Wilson's effort on Ford's inside, the Newcastle back row was able to run in unopposed as England finally regained the lead.\n\nJones will be pleased by those glimpses of quality, but they book-ended England's most concerning period of play so far this autumn.\n\nOver in Dublin...\n\nAuckland-born Bundee Aki, who was the subject of jibes from the All Blacks coaching staff in the build-up to Saturday's match, celebrates Ireland's win\n\nIn the aftermath of their defeat by Ireland in Chicago in 2016, New Zealand arrived in Dublin two weeks later and avenged the loss with a hugely physical performance.\n\nAaron Smith and Malakai Fekitoa were shown yellow cards and Sam Cane was fortunate to escape serious punishment for a high hit on Robbie Henshaw as the Kiwis ground out a 21-9 win.\n\nIreland made sure that was not going to happen again.\n\nJoe Schmidt's side physically dominated the All Blacks for most of the game with a performance of exemplary details and cohesion.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World Cup favourites?

Joe Schmidt laughs off Steve Hansen's 'banter'\n\nSchmidt masterminds Stockdale's match-winning try\n\nThe Ireland coach can take most of the plaudits for masterminding the pre-planned move that led to the only try of an absorbing Test match at the Aviva Stadium.\n\nIn the 49th minute, Ireland won a line-out on the New Zealand 10-metre line and worked the ball right towards Johnny Sexton before Bundee Aki dramatically switched back against the grain with a long pass to the waiting Stockdale.\n\nThe Ulster wing was left facing three All Blacks forwards but the rest of their team-mates had drifted in field, leaving Stockdale with acres of space to collect his own chip and finish off a brilliantly executed move.\n\n\"Jacob Stockdale, what do you say?\" said Schmidt.\n\n\"He got some good space down that short side but once he controlled that chip ahead and it was reminiscent of the Twickenham one where he went down the short side with Conor Murray and got that chip over the top to get that try, which was crucial in giving us a bit of scoreboard separation against England.\"\n\nNew Zealand's Ben Smith, who had come off his wing to defend in midfield, said: \"They manipulated us a wee bit with bringing me up and then kicking behind where there was space.\n\n\"I think they worked that pretty well in the way they got into that part of the field and they all played their part to execute that try.\n\n\"It was well done and when they score a try like that you've just got to acknowledge that it was well played.\n\n\"As a team they have got a lot of tricks up their sleeve but we've probably got to be a bit more into it with how we defend those tricks and that was an example.\"\n\nStockdale chipped 6ft 7in Brodie Retallick on the way to scoring his 12th try in his first 14 Tests\n\nStockdale's 12th try in 14 Tests\n\nThe move may have come from the Schmidt playbook - although the Irish coach claims he steals most of his moves - but in Stockdale it had the perfect executor.\n\nThe Lisburn man had a similar kick blocked down by Kieran Read just minutes earlier but he showed no hesitation in chipping 6ft 7in Brodie Retallick before using his speed and power to beat Aaron Smith to the bouncing ball and stretch to score his 12th try in 14 Test appearances.\n\n\"There's no doubt that we have a lot of quality players right across the board,\" said Ireland captain Rory Best, who was on Stockdale's shoulder when he attacked.\n\n\"We prepare really well to make sure that we can execute things and when they don't necessarily come off first time it does take a little bit of, how do you say it, confidence to chip that over again.\n\n\"Jacob's a fantastic player, like a lot of players are in this squad, and he got his opportunity.\n\n\"I think it shows that he doesn't necessarily look the fastest until you go to keep up with him: that big long stride on him, and, as has happened to him over the last 12 to 18 months, the ball bounced his way - but I do think you make your own luck with those bounces and he is at the right place at the right time.\"\n\nSchmidt 'always on the lookout' for moves\n\nStockdale says he is 'obsessed' with building Lego models to stave off boredom between training sessions with the Ireland team - he's made a couple of Star Wars spaceships and a replica of the Manhattan skyline recently - but Schmidt seems to find other ways to fill his time off.\n\n\"I'm always on the lookout, I'm always keeping my eye out,\" said the Ireland coach when asked how he develops his 'strike plays'.\n\n\"I watch Mitre 10 Cup, they've always got a couple of good ones. There was a really good one it looked like the Highlanders played recently and I showed that to the coaches and said 'we could maybe do this' because it's hard to get patents on moves!\n\n\"One of the things with the All Blacks, they work so hard, they work in to get into that chip line, they work across so they can get the far side of the defence up, so we felt we could go back down that short side.\n\n\"Now, sometimes they work and sometimes they don't but it's always nice when you do put them together and it's nice when everyone knows their role and they come off.\n\n\"The other coaching staff, they come up with some as well. But I've come up with some incredibly poor moves in my time - Besty will probably testify to that - they looked really good on paper though!\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Scotland's papers: 'Race to be the next prime minister'", "description": "'Race to be the next prime minister' and calls for a winter ban on alcohol advertising make Scotland's front pages.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46258319", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/50A9/production/_104394602_times.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T06:36:33Z", "content": "PM: Brexit deal to stop migrant 'queue jumping' Theresa May says her draft Brexit deal will mean a migration system based on \"talents and skills\".", "fulltext": "Image caption\n\nThe Daily Mail leads on claims that the backgrounds of thousands of foreign doctors are being checked after a woman with no qualifications was allowed to work as an NHS psychiatrist for more than 20 years."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "One dead after 'suspicious' flat fire", "description": "Police say they are treating the fatal fire in a block of flats in Perth as suspicious.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-46258200", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EC85/production/_104394506_stcatherinessquare_emergencyvehicles.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T06:27:39Z", "content": "Image copyright Stuart Cowper One person has died after fire in a block of flats in Perth.

That is difficult to hear and pretty scary.\n\n\"You go from fear to anger asking, 'why did this happen to me?' The first thing doctors say is not to smoke, lose weight, work out and get fit - well that is what I was doing when this happened - and eat right. I was doing all the right things so I was pretty angry for half a day.\n\n\"Doctors said the best chance of recovery was to immediately get into physical therapy. I did that two days after the stroke and I got out of bed with assistance and got behind the walker around the hospital - and ironically it was around 200m. I timed it and it took me around 15 minutes to cover that distance.\n\n\"Ordinarily that would be very disconcerting and I would have no hope, - having been the fastest person in the world at that distance - but I was very encouraged. With every step I took, I could feel myself relearning.\n\n\"For the next few weeks I went back into an Olympic mindset and focusing on having the best training session I can today and using it to be better and get better.\n\n\"I could regain co-ordination and balance which I had lost.

I used to be a civil servant, but I've chosen to resign. Do you know how weird it is to be able to talk about my political opinion? I've been holding it in for three years now.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? I support it, but I'm hoping for a good deal. I think it's all a bit unsettling at the moment.\n\nWhat was your initial impression on seeing Magid? I was quite surprised. I was expecting a suited and booted minister. When he said he was a mayor, I thought, 'Gosh, he's really different'. But that's good, that he's bucked the trend.\n\nWhat did you talk about on the date? He said he supported a second referendum. But you can't keep having elections until you get a desired outcome. You've got to to stick through it as a country. There are going to be people who never understood the full consequences, but you vote for an outcome, not a process.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zara tells Magid: Older people \"have a more informed vote\"\n\nWhat was the best thing about the date? I've now made a friend, and my friend is Lord Mayor! Our personalities got on very well. There are not many people you can open up to politically, but I could with him.\n\nWhat was the worst thing? The anticipation of who it was going to be. I thought it was going to be Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nWhat was your biggest disagreement? His support for lowering the voting age. I think it would be amazing to have 16-year-olds able to vote, but I don't think we're there yet. The first step is to educate young people, and try and engage them in politics. Don't run before you can walk. I've spoken to thousands of young students [doing talks in schools], and some have no idea what government is and what it consists of.

But I don't fit the mould of what someone would expect from a Lord Mayor. People either generally really quite like me, or they just kind of loathe me.\n\nWhat are your views on Brexit? I think we should let the people decide. Give more control back to the people - rather than politicians. Even if I was a Brexiteer, I'd want another referendum. It's the sensible thing to do.\n\nWhat was your initial impression on seeing Zara? Thank God it wasn't Katie Hopkins.\n\nYou chose to bring flowers? Yeah. I'd like to think they were appreciated. It was almost a peace offering, an olive branch to begin our chat. They had a hint of the EU in them too with the colours, but I don't know if she got that.\n\nHow was your date? I probably didn't learn anything new, but it was interesting. There are no Tories in Sheffield, so it was good to get a different view on things. You can get stuck in your own echo chamber sometimes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Magid: \"I think austerity is repulsive\"\n\nWhat was the best thing about the date? Just her. She was the best thing. She was understanding - a lovely, sweet person.\n\nAny awkward moments? Just at the very beginning, we were probably thinking, 'Who the hell is that person?' I'm not a Love Island viewer. But I tried to not make it awkward.\n\nAny common ground? Yeah, that politics should be part of the curriculum. I like that she's trying to engage young people in politics. And also we both thought that Theresa May is not doing the best job, though for different reasons.\n\nWhat was your biggest disagreement?

Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs.\n\nAnd now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal.\n\nEurope was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community.\n\nAfter becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels.\n\nHowever, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption David Owen - then a Labour MP - was among the rebels\n\nEven though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big.\n\nBut within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across.\n\nThe six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971.\n\nIt was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing).\n\nUnlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult.\n\nOn October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote.\n\n\"Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,\" he growled at Day.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Edward Heath and Robin Day in a 1969 encounter\n\nBut the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move.\n\n\"Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the \"Jenkinsites\" could justify defying a Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,\" Clarke told me.\n\nThe logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government.\n\nOne of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen.\n\n\"It was typical Heath,\" Lord Owen says now.\n\n\"No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament.\n\n\"And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now.\"\n\nLord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found.\n\nAccording to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise.\n\n\"Both parties are shattered into fractions,\" he says.\n\nHow the numbers stack up for May\n\nAs things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes.\n\nOn the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs.\n\nAlthough 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions.\n\nFor MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter.\n\nThere are differences of course.\n\nToday, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975.\n\nImage caption Jeremy Thorpe, Ted Heath, Roy Jenkins and Labour peer Lord Harris campaigned to keep Britain in Europe in 1975\n\nThere was then a binary choice between in or out.\n\nToday, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic.\n\nNor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt.\n\nBut if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons.\n\nEdward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.\n\nListen to '71: The Vote to go In on Monday, 19 November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 - or after it has been broadcast on BBC Sounds."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/19 05:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3pr5q", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T05:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'My husband ran up a \u00a358,000 debt in my name'", "description": "Government should press ahead with plans to define such behaviour as domestic abuse, say campaigners.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46182050", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15431/production/_104298078_annienails.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T04:37:14Z", "content": "Image caption Annie says her husband abused her both physically and financially When she had her first baby, just before she turned 29, Annie had been married for eight years, managed 19 staff, and earned more than her husband.

They work on you slowly at first so you will put up with being hit...\n\n\"I was so isolated... you're so controlled by that point.\"\n\nAnnie went full-time at work in a bid to bring in more money, but says: \"I still didn't have enough money to pay for his lifestyle or for the food for all of us, so I got an evening cleaning job\".\n\nFor five years she worked 60 hours a week, sleeping only four or five hours a night.\n\nAfter a full day at work, she would put the children to bed and go to her cleaning job at 21:00, finishing there at 01:00 and getting up again at 06:00 as her husband didn't like the youngsters waking him.\n\nNot only that, her husband would insist on dinner, just for himself, all paid for and cooked by Annie, ready on a tray when he came in from work every night.\n\nFailure would result in a beating.\n\n\"It makes me cringe now, thinking that I had actually got to that state.\"\n\nBroken shoes\n\nHe blamed her for their financial problems, accusing her of being unable to manage her money, so she felt guilty even replacing a pair of broken shoes.\n\nThe bank encouraged her to take out a loan to pay off a \u00a37,500 overdraft on the joint account, but they failed to close the overdraft so he ran it up again.\n\nShe took out another loan and this time the bank did cancel the overdraft.\n\nBut with no overdraft, his spending quickly emptied the joint account, so the bank turned to her account and, with this emptied too, it finally drew funds from his account, provoking fury.\n\nThe couple met one lunchtime in the town centre to discuss it and he swung a punch at her face.\n\n\"I ran off to go back to work and he said: \"You can run but I am going to finish the job when I get home.\"\n\nAt work, Annie broke down in a meeting and her boss took her aside and handed her the number of a women's refuge.\n\n\"I just picked the kids up from school and we just drove - and that was it.\"\n\nShe stayed in the refuge for six weeks before returning home once her husband was persuaded to leave.\n\nImage copyright 'Annie' Image caption Annie and her children stayed in the refuge for six weeks\n\nShe had to get an injunction and a panic alarm to stop him coming to the house, screaming abuse and attacking friends.\n\nBut, she says, even with the loss of his income, the family were \"instantly\" better off once her ex-husband, and his out-of-control spending, had gone.\n\nOverall, once all the credit cards, store cards and direct debits had come in, Annie was left with debts of about \u00a358,000.\n\nShe also took over the mortgage, determined to keep her home.\n\nThe bank tried to repossess the house but she won on appeal and they wrote off \u00a38,000 of what she owed.\n\nIn 2017, she finally cleared the debt - 12 years after the marriage ended - and has almost paid off the mortgage.\n\nThe house is shabby and bare but at least it is hers, she says.\n\nThere are questions she thinks people in a similar position should ask themselves. \"Are things equal? Do they spend their money on luxuries while you don't have any kind of money? Can you talk freely about finances without anyone kicking off?\"\n\nAs a volunteer with Surviving Economic Abuse, she now realises it was a key factor in keeping her in the relationship for so long.\n\n\"I had no money whatsoever. I couldn't magic any credit out of anywhere,\" she says.\n\n\"In my head I hated him. I didn't stay with him because I loved him.\n\n\"I was just like a shell but there was a tiny something in there that knew what he was doing was wrong and I had to get away.\"\n\n\"Annie\" asked the BBC not to use her real name."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'I don't want to be the UK's only black female history professor'", "description": "Dr Olivette Otele is the first black woman to be made a professor of history in the UK and she's on this year's BBC 100 Women list.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46247776", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9B3A/production/_104383793_0ec0fc6a-4138-4113-9e31-91152a772099.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T04:35:36Z", "content": "Image copyright Bath Spa University The UK's first black female history professor says she hopes she's not \"the only one\" for long.

We asked the band to look back at a scrapbook of their first seven years; to reflect on the highs, and lows, of pop stardom.\n\nWinning The X Factor - December 2011\n\nImage copyright Rex / Shutterstock\n\nLeigh-Anne: I want to start by saying that, for some reason, my extensions don't match my hair.\n\nJesy: That's genuine shock on our faces. There was a girl band curse on X Factor so we would psyche ourselves up for going home every single Sunday - but we were never in the bottom two. Every week, we were like, \"This is mental\".\n\nPromoting their debut single - December 2011\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nLeigh-Anne: That was winners' week. I remember when we won, we literally had 20 minutes with our mums, then we were whisked away to a hotel. Up at 3am the next morning and we haven't stopped since.\n\nPerrie: When I see that I think how proud I was to be in HMV in South Shields [where she grew up] signing a CD.\n\nDid you move all the Little Mix CDs to the front of the racks?\n\nPerrie: I still do that now! If I go into any shop, I put our CDs right in front of everyone else's. Scatter them all around. I love it.\n\nCaught by the paparazzi - December 2011\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nJesy: This is so funny!

Me and Jade shared a room, Jesy and Leigh-Anne shared a room, and it was just madness. I felt like when Annie goes to see Daddy Warbucks.\n\nBut this is the day we moved out - and it's a time in my life where I, obviously, didn't care what people thought of me because I'm in a onesie with my hair scruffy. I didn't understand the consequences back then. I didn't even know what the Daily Mail was. But it was actually the happiest time of my life because I didn't care. I was just living the dream.\n\nFilming the Wings video - July 2012\n\nImage copyright Syco\n\nJesy: Our first video!\n\nLeigh-Anne: When we first started, we all had icons: So Perry had a flower, Jade had a bow-tie, Jesy had a boombox and I had a cap!

I found it really hard.\n\nWere you old enough to get served in bars?\n\nLeigh-Anne: I was, but Perrie wasn't.\n\nPerrie: Maybe that's why they had a good time and I didn't.\n\nUS TV debut - June 2014\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nJesy: That's performing on the Today Show in America, in Times Square.

I'll go out shopping with my best mate James and I'll say: \"Do you like this?\" and he'll go, \"Do you know what? Normally I'd say 'no' but you're a pop star and you can wear whatever you want!\"\n\nLeigh-Anne: I love that!\n\nJesy: Me too!

We've done some incredible things!\n\nGet Weird album goes platinum - January 2016\n\nImage copyright Little Mix / Twitter\n\nLeigh-Anne: We're very lucky because our fan base is so dedicated that they want to have a hard copy of our album.

They'll buy the standard and the deluxe and the super-deluxe and one for their friends and one for their cat.\n\nThat's impressive, because a lot of your fans are quite young.\n\nLeigh-Anne: Someone said to me the other day, \"I love the fact that your ticket prices aren't ridiculous, so young fans can actually go and see you\". That's really important for us.\n\nPerrie: Our first tour, I remember going to the merch[andise] stand and thinking, \"How much?\" I thought it was really expensive - so every tour since then, we've brought the prices down.\n\nBrit Awards - February 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nJesy: We only had two days to rehearse because we were touring America at the time.\n\nLeigh-Anne: We were bricking it.

But th\u2026 [+6074 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe amount spent on schools is a source of frequent controversy. So, where does all the money for educating the country's children go?\n\nSchool spending is watched closely - as Chancellor Philip Hammond recently discovered when his announcement of \u00a3400m for teachers to spend on \"little extras\" was met with anger.\n\nIt is a fact that the amount spent on education is much higher than it was 20 years ago. But that's not the full picture in a country which has seen a population boom coincide with a squeeze on public finances.\n\nSpending per pupil is actually lower than it was in 2010 in today's prices - as is the case across the UK. All in, the education of young people in England who turned 21 in 2015 cost an average of about \u00a373,000 - more for those who went to university.\n\nWhere the money goes\n\nSpending on schools is not shared out equally. The amount spent on each primary school child in England in 2017-18 was \u00a34,700, compared with \u00a36,200 for secondary school children.\n\nHowever, priorities have shifted, with per pupil spending on primary schools increasing by 135% since 1990 after accounting for inflation, compared with 86% for secondaries. Early years education has also become a growing area of spending, but remains relatively small.\n\nThere has been less money for older children, with spending on further education students aged 16-18 up only 10% since the early 90s.\n\nAll of this money for nurseries, schools and colleges comes from the government, although most of it is spent via local authorities and other bodies.\n\nSpending on nursery age children has doubled\n\nOne of the biggest changes in education spending has been for very young children.\n\nParents of all three and four-year-olds are now entitled to 15 hours a week free childcare, for 38 weeks a year.\n\nAnd since 2017, all working parents in England have been allowed 30 hours a week, although this is not always available and there has been criticism of nurseries adding \"extras\".\n\nThe expansion of free childcare has seen spending per child double between 2004 and 2017, from \u00a31,600 to \u00a33,200 in today's prices.\n\nThe population boom\n\nDay-to-day spending on schools in England was \u00a342bn in 2017-18 - about the same as in 2009-10, after accounting for inflation.\n\nHowever, over this time the number of schoolchildren has grown by 700,000 - more than the population of a city like Sheffield. As a result, spending per pupil has fallen 8% in real terms since 2009-10. It is now due to be frozen until 2019-20.\n\nClass sizes may also be growing, as the number of pupils per teacher rose from 15 in 2010 to 17 now.\n\nLooking across the UK, real terms cuts in school spending per pupil have been largest in Northern Ireland (9%), where pupil numbers have also grown. Cuts have been smaller in Wales (5%) and Scotland (3%), where pupil numbers have been steady.\n\nSpending on deprived schools\n\nSchools with a high proportion of children from deprived backgrounds - those eligible for free school meals - receive more money per pupil than others.\n\nThis gap is about 30% per pupil between the schools with the highest and lowest number of poorer children, following reforms introduced by Labour and the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government.\n\nBetween 1999-2000 and 2013-14, up to 25% of this extra spending went on recruiting more teachers and paying higher salaries.\n\nA larger share - 35% at secondary school and nearly 50% at primary schools - was spent on teaching assistants and non-teaching staff.\n\nThe total number of teaching assistants in England rose from 80,000 in 2000 to about 260,000 in 2017.\n\nThe squeezed teens\n\nThe number of young people continuing in full-time education after the age of 16 has more than doubled - from four out of 10 in the mid-1980s to eight out of 10 now. This is largely because young people in England now have to continue in education or training until they are 18.\n\nHowever, the reduction in per pupil spending has been greater for this group than others, with sixth forms and further education colleges seeing the smallest increases over the past 30 years.\n\nAmong sixth formers the amount available for each pupil has fallen 20% in real terms, from \u00a36,300 a year in 2010 to \u00a35,000 in 2017 - lower than at any point since at least 2002.\n\nFunding per young person in further education colleges is at about the same level as it was in 2006. It had been 50% higher than in secondary schools, but is now 8% lower.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe tuition fees boost\n\nAlthough controversial, tuition fees have led to an increase in funding at universities. For each full-time student, English universities received about \u00a39,400 in 2017-18.\n\nThis is up nearly a fifth in real terms since 1990, despite the number of undergraduates more than doubling.\n\nThe government provides most of this funding for higher education up front, either in the form of grants to universities for teaching, or loans to students for tuition fees.\n\nOver the long run, the cost to government is lowered as student loans are repaid, with graduates paying more if they earn more. However, most graduates won't repay all of their student loans by the time they are cancelled after 30 years - amounting to a government subsidy for graduates.\n\nWhat difference does spending make?\n\nThere have been big changes over the past 20 years.\n\nJust a decade ago, about \u00a36,000 less was spent educating children from poorer families than it was for those who were richer. There is evidence that suggests increased spending on education leads to higher earnings later in life and that this change of focus could boost the life chances of more children.\n\nBut hard decisions do have to be made and 16- to 18-year-olds have clearly borne much of the cuts to education spending.\n\nCalculating the effects of such choices is not easy. The impact of decision made now may only become clear years later, as children enter adult life.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nLuke Sibieta is a Research Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institute that aims to inform public debate on economics.\n\nMore details about its work can be found here and on Twitter.\n\nEdited by Duncan Walker"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Women's World Twenty20: Highlights - Windies edge England in last-over thriller", "description": "Watch highlights from a thrilling final game in Group A as West Indies pass England's total of 115-8 in their final over in St Lucia to win by four wickets and finish top of the group.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/cricket/46256526", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T02:29:01Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Watch highlights from a thrilling final game in Group A as West Indies pass England's total of 115-8 in their final over in St Lucia to win by four wickets and finish top of the group.\n\nMATCH REPORT: England edged out by West Indies\n\nWATCH MORE: 'So close it's unreal' - England's Jones gets lucky"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "Bbc News", "title": "Giving blood: 'We are reliant on blood donors to keep Henry alive'", "description": "Blood donors urged to keep appointments to avoid a dramatic slump in stocks over the festive period.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46220676", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9F83/production/_104353804_mediaitem104353803.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T02:15:26Z", "content": "Image copyright NHS Image caption Since his birth, Henry Alderson, two, has relied on blood donors to keep him alive Every blood donation \"can save up to three lives\", yet come December thousands miss vital appointments to give blood, as the festivities kick \u2026 [+3845 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright NHS Image caption Since his birth, Henry Alderson, two, has relied on blood donors to keep him alive\n\nEvery blood donation \"can save up to three lives\", yet come December thousands miss vital appointments to give blood, as the festivities kick in.\n\nIt can make a huge difference to patients like two-year-old Henry Alderson who needs blood transfusions every two weeks.\n\nLast year, more than 9,000 people cancelled donor appointments at short notice in the week before Christmas.\n\nWhen donors drop out in such numbers, bloods stocks inevitably dwindle.\n\nFor Henry, from Harwich, Essex, it could mean the difference between a Christmas spent waiting up for Rudolph and crashing his toys into the tree - and a Christmas spent in bed.\n\nHe has a rare condition called Diamond-Blackfan anaemia. It means he can't make his own red blood cells and needs blood transfusions every four weeks to keep him alive.\n\nHis mum Zoe said: \"Transfusions are absolutely critical for Henry. We are reliant on blood donors... just to keep him alive.\"\n\nIn the days before each blood transplant, Henry's energy levels \"plummet\" according to his mum.\n\n\"When he gets this magical transfusion of blood, he's transformed into a healthy little boy,\" his mum says.\n\nImage copyright NHSBT Image caption Henry, pictured with his mum and dad, requires regular blood transfusions\n\n\"For Henry - and people like him - it's being able to celebrate their birthday [next week], it's giving us the opportunity to tuck into bed on Christmas Eve and watch him wake up on Christmas morning. It's the gift of life.\"\n\n\"If you can donate blood, please, please do.\"\n\nMike Stredder, director of blood donation for NHS Blood and Transplant., said: \"Demand for lifesaving blood doesn't stop for Christmas. We need our loyal donors more than ever at this time of year.\"\n\nMissed appointments rise in the middle of December, as people's diaries fill up with parties and shopping excursions.\n\nThe cold weather can also put people off going out.\n\nIn the worst pre-Christmas period last year, one in 10 people couldn't even be bothered to cancel and just failed to turn up for their appointment altogether.\n\nAnd this year, amid fears of a predicted cold spell - from the end of November to the second week of December, the situation could be worse than ever.\n\nShould we pay people for donating blood?\n\nScientists 'turn type-A blood into type-O'\n\nBlood donation rules eased for gay and bisexual men\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Transfusions are typically used to treat a blood condition or cancer or due to surgery, childbirth or an accident\n\nNHS Blood and Transplant needs to collect 1.4 million units of blood each year to meet the needs of patients across England.\n\nAnd autumn donations were also unexpectedly low this year, further fuelling fears over a Christmas shortage.\n\nNew donors will take too long to process in the run-up to Christmas, meaning blood banks will be dependent upon those already registered.\n\nSo the NHS Blood and Transplant are calling on regular donors to make an appointment - and keep it.\n\nDonors who need to cancel are being asked to give at least three days' notice so the slot can be given to someone else.\n\n\"Please keep your appointment to give blood,\" says Mr Stredder.\n\n\"We need... to make sure hospitals have the blood that seriously ill children and adults will need over Christmas and the new year.\"\n\nHow do you register for blood donation?"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"},

are being charged more for buying from big-chain convenience stores, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nIn one case, a trolley of groceries cost almost \u00a310 more in a smaller shop than at the company's superstore.\n\nBBC's Inside Out looked at a mix of own-brand and branded items from two types of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose.\n\nThe supermarkets said the price difference was due to the higher costs of running the smaller branches.\n\nAt Marks and Spencer the same trolley of shopping cost \u00a3103.26 at the Birmingham High Street store and \u00a3112.44 at Simply Food in Birmingham New Street Station.\n\nIn the Tesco superstore on Camden Street, Birmingham, a banana cost 9p, but was priced at 25p at the Tesco Express in Fredrick Street, a mark-up of 177%.\n\nThe shops were visited between September and October this year.\n\nAt Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer stores in Birmingham, and Waitrose shops in Shropshire, 45 of 50 items cost more in the convenience location.\n\nAnd at the Tesco Express, 39 of 50 items cost more than in the superstore.\n\nShopper Maggie Henning said she found she was spending more at Tesco Express after a Tesco supermarket she previously used in Birmingham, at Fiveways, closed.\n\nShe said: \"I think that's terrible.\n\n\"It's people like me, who need a convenience store because they haven't got a car or can't get to a large supermarket, that are actually paying the price for that.\"\n\nImage caption Maggie Henning said the charges were impacting on people who could not travel to larger supermarkets\n\nAnalysis by Sylvia Rook - Lead officer, Chartered Trading Standards Institute\n\nWith normal economy and supplier demand, it is often the case that smaller shops, and those in more remote areas, will charge more.\n\nI always think that when you look at service station petrol prices on motorways, that is very telling, because they are normally hugely more expensive but they are open 24 hours and have higher overheads.\n\nWith smaller stores, deliveries are also harder to get to them.\n\nIt is something which has always happened and something that will always happen in future.\n\nThe law says shops must not mislead people, it is something that they must be clear about if they are advertising nationally.\n\nShops must indicate if an offer does not apply to small stores as well and sometimes you will see in small print \"not available in local stores\".\n\nThe Price Marking Order 2004 orders that the price must be clear, consumers should never have to ask the price of anything and it should be clearly available without having to ask, which supermarkets are largely very good at.\n\nImage copyright Google Maps Image caption The larger supermarkets visited were found to charge less for groceries than their convenience counterparts\n\nIn statements, the supermarkets all agreed the increase in prices was because of higher operating costs in the convenience stores.\n\nSainsbury's said that was due to the smaller shops being placed in town and city locations.\n\nWaitrose also said that higher rent and increased rates for longer opening hours were among the reasons for higher costs, but said it did offer \"promotions\" in smaller stores.\n\nTesco said it worked hard to offer customers \"great value\".\n\nMarks and Spencer said it tried to \"keep prices competitive\", but \"in line with other retailers\" prices could be higher in convenience stores.\n\nThe full investigation can be seen on BBC Inside Out West Midlands at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 19 November and for 30 days after on the BBC iPlayer."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Pharmaceutical standards change after BBC

examining rooms and shooting videos and photos of the premises.\n\nThe group, who arrived at the club in half a dozen trucks led by a police van, quickly left when confronted by members. Police later said they were tracking signals from the mobile phone of a wanted man they thought was in the building.\n\nThe next day, security agencies arrested a senior journalist at his home on charges of keeping Islamic State group material.\n\nThe club responded by saying the arrest was made to justify the raid and defuse protests by journalists, which have been held in all Pakistan's major cities.\n\nBut while the mainstream media has largely avoided turning it into a major controversy, the country's reporters and editors remain in shock.\n\nNever in the club's 60-year existence has a security agent been allowed to so much as take a stroll on its premises. It is an inviolable rule of the club.\n\nImage caption Under club rules, uniformed personnel and intelligence officials are forbidden to enter\n\nIn December 1958, a small group of pioneering journalists got together to acquire an impressive mansion built by a Parsi family in 1883, and there they set up the country's first press club.\n\nThose pioneers, like most journalists of their time, were political activists linked to the progressive left-wing, and had a strong trade union.\n\nThe club was inaugurated just months after the country's first military takeover, and served as an early base for journalists to test their muscle against a regime that was soon to set up a National Press Trust (NPT) to control the media. A number of newspapers were later taken over by the NPT and used to propagate policies of the regime.\n\nMany of the Karachi Press Club's rules were set up in this environment, and the club's strict adherence to those rules over decades has given it an iconic status among journalists around the country.\n\nOne such rule relates to annual elections. Even in the worst of circumstances, the KPC has never failed to elect a new governing body every single year since 1958.\n\nAnother is a complete ban on the entry of uniformed personnel and intelligence officials.\n\nMujahid Barelvi, a veteran journalist based in Karachi, recalls an incident in the 1970s during the third military regime - that of General Zia-ul Haq - when a senior military official, Siddique Salik, walked into the club to have a cup of tea. He was forced to leave.\n\nKnown for his famous book, Witness to Surrender, which describes events that led to Pakistan's defeat in the 1971 Bangladesh war, Mr Salik was looking after the Zia regime's public relations at the time.\n\nMr Barelvi remembers that as the official left the KPC, he was taunted by a Dawn newspaper journalist and later club president, the late Sabihuddin Ghausi. \"You should write another 'Witness to Surrender' now,\" he quipped.\n\nImage copyright Akhtar Baloch Image caption Benazir Bhutto, who would later become prime minister, greets a popular waiter, Sattar, at the club in 1988\n\nSome other KPC rules which have endured to this day are rooted in the secular, urban culture of 1950s Karachi. This culture was mainly a product of the mixing of the city's older Catholic and Parsi populations with educated Muslim urbanites from northern India, who moved to the city in droves after the partition of India in 1947.\n\nTogether these groups supplied Karachi's - and for the most part Pakistan's - first generation of journalists. Most of them were involved with left-leaning political groups and were fiercely opposed to the mixing of religion with politics.\n\nOne of those rules was - and still is - that the club's dining hall never closes during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, even though eating in public places during the month is a criminal offence. More surprisingly, the KPC remains the only place in today's Pakistan that has a formal bar where alcoholic drinks are served.\n\nMore from Ilyas on Pakistan\n\nWhen the Zia regime embarked on its programme to Islamicise Pakistan in the late 1970s, it banned bars and discotheques - which had survived in Karachi until then - and also introduced the Ramadan ban on eating in public places.\n\nThe KPC was an obvious target.\n\nMr Barelvi, who was the club's secretary-general in 1978, recalls the day before the advent of Ramadan, when the club received orders to close the dining hall and the bar.\n\n\"We let them know that it was not going to happen, and that they will have to walk over us to enter the club,\" he said. \"Next morning we gathered outside the KPC gate and waited. But they had sensed our mood and nobody came.\"\n\nGen Zia banned political activity all over the country, but the club was one place where his writ did not run. It continued to offer its premises for resistance leaders to hold their meetings.\n\nThis prompted the regime's information secretary, General Mujibur Rahman, to famously describe KPC as \"enemy territory.\" In an equally famous retort to the general, one of the most celebrated Urdu poets of the post-1947 era, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said it was \"the only liberated territory\".\n\nBut much water has flowed under the bridge since then.\n\nThe policy of Islamicisation, and the subsequent spread of militancy, has not only divided the nation, but also divided and weakened journalists' unions.\n\nIn the meantime, many believe the growth of the military's business and industrial empire since the 1970s has strengthened its desire to keep control over political decision-making.\n\nImage caption The club has clung to secular traditions over decades\n\nThese developments have come at a time when major business houses have started their own media wings. The owners are replacing professional editors, and framing policies aimed more at profit-making than robust and probing journalism.\n\nThese media outlets have easily complied with the security establishment's need to curb objective reporting across large parts of the country, where the military is accused of indulging in gross human rights violations.\n\nThe government is now planning to introduce a new regulator - the Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority - to ensure centralised control of the media.\n\nThe purpose, as one official told me, \"is to ensure more backing and support for the national security institutions which has been lacking so far, unlike the rest of the world where the media is free to criticise the government but it protects state policies\".\n\nFew veteran journalists agree with this contention. They fear that the state is trying to set up a \"China model\" of media management, where the interests of the ruling circles take precedence over wider public interest.\n\nOne journalist suggested the raid on the Karachi Press Club may have been an attempt to provide a release valve for whatever resistance remains among journalists - so their protests run out of steam before the intended legislation is tabled.\n\nWhile many tend to agree, some are hopeful that the journalistic fraternity still has some fight left in it.\n\nSalim Asmi, a retired journalist in his seventies and the former editor of Pakistan's prestigious Dawn newspaper, is one of them.\n\n\"Let's see who runs out of steam first, us or them,\" he said.\n\nM Ilyas Khan is a former member of the Karachi Press Club and is currently a member of the Islamabad Press Club."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "The young women constructing their careers", "description": "Women make up just 1.5% of apprenticeships in the construction industry but is change coming?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46241882", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06s06pc.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:22:15Z", "content": "Media caption More women urged to join construction industry Technology is changing the way buildings are constructed but can it also help to change who builds them?

He brought back Sharia, or Islamic law, which had been suspended in 1985.\n\nAmal Habbani, a rights activist with the group No to Women's Oppression, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper that between 43,000 and 50,000 women are arrested and flogged every year by public order police because of their clothing.\n\nA few days before the afro outrage, opinion was divided on the way a former TV presenter and women's rights campaigner responded to a prominent imam and Islamic law scholar who said sexual harassment and child marriage could both be justified.\n\nThey were taking part in a debate on DW TV about what women in Sudan want.\n\nThe singer who took on the imam\n\nWe'am Shawogi told the imam that he should discuss things like equal pay instead of focusing on a woman's appearance, and that what was in a woman's wardrobe was her own choice.\n\nSome people on social media were angered at what they saw as Ms Shawogi's disrespectful attitude towards the imam - but others said her tone reflected the frustration many women feel about what they see as an outdated outlook.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nIn the wake of the TV debate, Ms Shawogi received death threats from Sudanese men on social media for expressing her forthright opinion.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who also runs a cafe that has been a hub for artists and musicians in Khartoum, had to go into hiding.\n\nThe debate has not tempered the actions of the Public Order Police, who last month arrested singer Mona Magdi Salim after people shared pictures of her on social media singing at a concert in Khartoum wearing trousers.\n\nShe has been charged with dressing indecently and faces punishment by flogging if found guilty.\n\nAccording to a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey last year, Sudan was one of the five worst countries when it came to women's rights in the Arab world - coming 17th out of 22.\n\nThis chimes with a 2016 Human Rights Watch report that notes that the Sudanese security forces have used sexual violence, intimidation and other forms of abuse to silence female human rights defenders across the country.\n\n'Humiliated for years'\n\nWinni Omer is a journalist and rights campaigner who is another example of a vocal woman in Sudan facing persecution.\n\nShe was arrested last year while walking on the street with her friends for wearing indecent clothing - although she was wearing a long skirt at the time. In the end, she was found not guilty.\n\nMore Letters from Africa:\n\nA few months later, the police arrested her again, with others, while visiting her friend. They were all accused of being prostitutes and banned from travelling outside the country.\n\nAfter spending the past year or so in and out of court, Ms Omer managed get permission last month to leave the country for her postgraduate studies in human rights abroad. Her case is still pending.\n\nThe long history of the Public Order Police in Sudan shows that the establishment is afraid of any form of change, regarding it as a threat to their authority.\n\nNow it seems that young men expressing their individuality by wearing afros, dreadlocks or low-hanging trousers may also be facing the same fate as women who have been humiliated for years for wanting to break with Islamic and Arabic traditions.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Holly Willoughby makes I'm A Celebrity debut - and is full of jokes", "description": "Taking her place standing on the left of Dec, Holly Willoughby is filling in for Ant on the ITV show.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46236289", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06s5m4b.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:19:29Z", "content": "Media caption Holly Willoughby took Ant McPartlin's place alongside Declan Donnelly in the jungle Holly Willoughby made her I'm A Celeb debut in classic style... by making jokes about co-host Dec's height.

Despite continued UK government real terms cuts to Scotland's resource budget, we have treated local government very fairly - and in the current financial year they received a real terms boost in both revenue and capital funding.\n\n\"We have made clear that we are open to further dialogue on options for local tax reform.\n\n\"The finance secretary will present the Scottish Government's tax plans in the Scottish Budget later this year.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "'You'll fail a lot, but failure is hollow'", "description": "You'll fail a lot but you'll learn as an entrepreneur from your failures, says Mohamed Al Awadhi.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-46224418/you-ll-fail-a-lot-but-failure-is-hollow", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14C99/production/_104354158_p06rwm2b.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:07:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nYou'll fail a lot but you'll learn as an entrepreneur from your failures, says Mohamed Al Awadhi.\n\nMohamed and his brother Peyman are serial entrepreneurs, with experience ranging from restaurants to video production \u2013 and they know a thing or two about launching a business in Dubai.\n\nFilmed and edited by Paul Blake\n\nSee more at CEO Secrets"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Four things to know for the week ahead", "description": "Your Monday briefing on some of the most important stories coming up over the next seven days.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46236112", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D2F7/production/_104370045_compoweekahead.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:07:41Z", "content": "It's Monday, it's a new week, and while we won't pretend to know everything that's going to happen over the next seven days, we have some sense of what's coming up.

It has a fascinating job to do.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nOnce it is up and running on Mars, the lander will study the interior of the Red Planet. This will be the first time the interior of any planet apart from Earth will have been examined.\n\nNasa say Mars will be given \"its first thorough checkup since it formed 4.5 billion years ago\", looking at tectonic activity, how the planet formed and what effect meteorites have had on its surface. It may even give us some clues about how our own planet was formed.\n\nLanding it will be a challenge though - because the atmosphere is so much thinner than our own, there will be very little resistance to help slow it down as it descends.\n\n3) Brexit, Brexit and more Brexit\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nThe UK is leaving the European Union in four months. You may have heard about it. This past week has seen political turmoil on a new scale as the British government scrabbles to strike a deal on how to leave.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe uncertainty over whether the UK would be able to reach a Brexit deal with the EU, as well as a number of resignations from PM Theresa May's cabinet, caused the pound to suffer its worst day in two years on Thursday.\n\nSpeculation continues over whether enough of Mrs May's Conservative Party MPs will submit letters of no-confidence to trigger a vote on her leadership.\n\nMrs May will head to Brussels later in the week to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, but says the talks will be about the future relationship with the EU rather than the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe EU is itself holding a number of meetings before Sunday, when it expects to announce its final backing for the withdrawal agreement.\n\nAre you struggling to understand what Brexit is actually all about? Don't worry, we've tried to answer your questions here.\n\nWhat is in the Brexit deal the UK hopes to strike?

This week we speak to serial Dutch entrepreneur Kees Koolen, whose latest company is battery manufacturer Lithium Werks.\n\nAfter Kees Koolen and his motorbike somersaulted down a rocky hillside in Western Sahara in 2006, the local ambulance crew said there was nothing they could do to save his life.\n\n\"They said I would die for sure,\" says Mr Koolen, looking back on the crash. \"So they didn't want to do anything.\"\n\nAt the time the Dutch businessman was 41, and had taken time off from his job as chief operating officer at travel firm Booking.com to compete in a long-distance motorcycle race in north Africa.\n\nHe was nearing the end of a day's riding when, overtaking a car and another motorbike, he didn't notice the sharp drop to the side of the road.\n\nPlunging down, he broke 22 bones, and suffered serious head trauma after his helmet cracked open.\n\nImage copyright The Next Speaker Image caption He was brought up in a remote part of the Netherlands where they didn't speak Dutch\n\nThankfully for Mr Koolen, he had some friends with him, and they forced the ambulance crew to at least try to save his life. \"My friends got into a big fight with the ambulance men,\" he says.\n\nMr Koolen was ultimately flown back to the Netherlands by private plane for emergency surgery, and a very slow recovery.\n\n\"Not only had I broken 22 bones, but I lost my memory,\" says the 53-year-old. \"I still don't remember anything from the next year of my life.\"\n\nIn hospital for six months following the crash, Mr Koolen was eventually able to walk again and return to Booking.com.\n\nOne of the company's earliest investors, he went on to be its chief executive from 2008 to 2011.\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nThen from 2012 he advised another company he had invested in - US taxi-hailing firm Uber - on its global rollout, while also looking after his investments in scores of other tech firms.\n\nAnd while most of us would never have gone motorcycle racing again after a crash like he had, Mr Koolen decided to up the ante and start competing on his bike in the annual Dakar Rally, which can be as long as 9,000km (6,000 miles) and mostly on unpaved roads.\n\n\"When I'm working, I do 20-hour days every day,\" he says. \"I can't stop, so taking three weeks off every year to compete in the Dakar forces me to switch off from work.\n\n\"And then I always make the best business decisions when I return to work because I'm fresh.\"\n\nImage copyright Kees Koolen Image caption Mr Koolen takes three weeks off work every year to compete in the Dakar Rally\n\nToday Mr Koolen's main focus is his lithium-ion battery business Lithium Werks, which is based in the city of Hengelo, in the eastern Netherlands.\n\nAlthough the company was established only at the start of this year, after it bought existing US firm Valence and fellow Dutch business Super B, Lithium Werks already has two factories up and running in China, and another on the way.\n\nThe rechargeable batteries are aimed at both electric vehicles - everything from taxis, to ships, forklift trucks and lorries - and for power storage at solar panel installations and wind farms.\n\nWith global demand for such batteries predicted to grow by as much as 16 times current levels by 2030, as the world turns away from burning fossil fuels, Mr Koolen wants Lithium Werks to be one of the biggest suppliers.\n\n\"Turnover this year will be $80m (\u00a363m), and I predict close to $1bn next year, and then growing further from there,\" he says. \"Demand for batteries is going to be huge going forward.\"\n\nEngineer to Ironman\n\nBorn and raised on a small dairy farm in the south of Netherlands, beside the Belgian border, Mr Koolen says he didn't leave his village until he was 11.\n\n\"I also never spoke Dutch until I went to secondary school and had to learn it,\" he says. Until then he had only spoken the Brabantian dialect.\n\nImage copyright Lithium Werks Image caption Lithium Werks was formed earlier this year after it bought two existing battery producers\n\nAfter finishing school Mr Koolen studied mechanical engineering at a university in the city of Eindhoven. It was around this time that he started to compete in Ironman triathlons - a 2.4-mile (3.9km) swim, followed by a 112-mile (180km) bike ride, and then running a marathon.\n\nHowever, after his knee was injured in a car accident when a drunk driver ploughed into his car, he switched to motor sports.\n\nMr Koolen then studied for an MBA (master of business administration qualification), before starting a successful career as a consultant, advising a host of companies that he also started to invest in. One of these was Booking.com, which was formed in the Netherlands in 1997, and last year had revenues of $12.7bn.\n\nMr Koolen's investments over the years have made him a multimillionaire, with a Dutch newspaper estimating in 2013 that he had a personal fortune of \u20ac115m ($130m; \u00a3101m).\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lithium Werks' batteries are being fitted to Amsterdam's canal tour boats\n\nBut is he right to be so bullish about Lithium Werks and the global demand for lithium-ion batteries?\n\n\"Lithium-ion batteries are absolutely key in the move to electric vehicles, but they also allow us to realise the full potential of solar and wind power through cheap and easy energy storage,\" says Richard Anderson from technology think tank RethinkX.\n\n\"So there's no question demand for these batteries will rocket, but of course that doesn't mean that everyone producing lithium-ion batteries will be successful.\n\n\"This will be an incredibly competitive marketplace where a number of big, well-established companies such as Tesla and Panasonic already operate.\"\n\nImage copyright Lithium Werks Image caption The company's batteries are also fitted to several bus fleets across Europe\n\nNo matter how busy Mr Koolen is with Lithium Werks his enthusiasm for competing in motor sport rally events is undimmed.\n\nHe has now entered the Dakar Rally nine times, and is the only person to have completed the race in all four main categories - motorcycle, quad bike, car and truck.\n\nThe risk of injury doesn't bother him, he says, even remembering the time in 2013 when he broke his back while training on his quad bike.\n\n\"I was about to go over a jump and the throttle got stuck,\" he says. \"I fell from the bike and broke four vertebrae.\n\n\"I believe in fate though. Everyone dies when it is their time.\""}]
