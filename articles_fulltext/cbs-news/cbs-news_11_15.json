The cost of building a new utility-scale solar or wind farm has now dropped below the cost of operating an existing coal plant, according to an analysis by the investment bank Lazard. Accounting for government tax credits and other energy incentives would bring the cost even lower.\n\n\"There are some scenarios, in some parts of the U.S., where it is cheaper to build and operate wind and solar than keep a coal plant running,\" said a Lazard banker who was involved in the report. \"You have seen coal plants shutting down because of this.\"\n\nEvery year, the investment bank analyzes the cost of different types of energy using a metric called the levelized cost of energy, or LCOE. This analysis factors in the cost of components and the cost of operations, as well as the cost of debt, to come up with the smallest dollar amount, per unit of energy, for an investor in the project to see a 12 percent return.\n\nThe LCOE for coal this year is between $27 and $45 per megawatt. That figure is $29 to $56 for a wind farm and $31 to $44 for a solar farm, depending on the technology used.\n\nWind power costs have dropped as utilities have turned to bigger and bigger turbines, which can produce more energy. The largest turbines installed today can produce double the power they could've a decade ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, dramatically increasing the amount of power a parcel of land can produce. Wind and solar installation has also gotten more competitive, driving the development of more efficient technology.\n\nLazard also noted that wind and solar farms typically require fewer people to run than a coal or nuclear plant, further decreasing their cost.\n\nThe bank noted that this analysis applies to developed economies, and excludes places like India and China, parts of which are very dependent on coal. But in the U.S., coal plant construction has ground to a near halt, and many utilities are successfully making the case for renewables to their customers.

The 33-year-old former staff sergeant is now pursuing an MBA under the GI Bill at Colorado Technical University, but had to stop taking classes this semester because of an outstanding balance with the school.\n\nWashington said the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has not distributed $7,000 in benefits, including $3,000 she needs to cover tuition. The shortfall has left her worried about paying for everyday items, like groceries for her three kids.\n\nWashington's predicament is one many veterans are now facing, and veterans groups and members of Congress from both parties are demanding answers from the VA. There are currently 73,000 benefits claims that have yet to be processed, an increase of nearly 27 percent from this time last year, a VA official told lawmakers Thursday.\n\nNot all claims represent delays, and the number of outstanding claims has decreased from its peak. But about 10,000 payments have been delayed more than 30 days, and the wait has left many vets struggling to cover bills and expenses.\n\n\"The GI Bill is something we worked for. I've been deployed and been to wars, so I feel like I shouldn't have to stress over something that I worked for and risked my life for,\" Washington said.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe VA blames an outdated IT system and complex change in how payments are distributed for the delay. But critics say the VA failed to prepare for the change in the law and were slow to respond when the extent of the failure became apparent.\n\nAt a hearing of a subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs on Thursday, lawmakers grilled department officials about the delays, blasting the VA for repeated failures.\n\n\"Congress consistently has provided the VA with record budgets. That's clear,\" said Republican Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas, the subcommittee chairman. \"I think the vague answers we've gotten \u2014 we've sent a lot of letters, we've had inquiries, we've had personal meetings \u2014 I think that the answers we're getting and the delays, and the promises that we'll have it fixed that end up not happening are unacceptable.\"\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke, Democrat of Texas, implored officials to come up with tangible solutions for fixing the problem.\n\n\"I think I speak for everyone in saying that we're all frustrated and want to see something happen,\" O'Rourke said. \"You failed to account for the problem, and minimized the problem.\"\n\nThe original GI Bill, signed into law in 1944, covered education and training costs for veterans returning from World War II. More than 8 million World War II vets received benefits under the program.\n\nIn 2017, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, known as the Forever GI Bill, which expanded those benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families.\n\nOne of the provisions in the Forever GI Bill changed how the VA pays monthly stipends to cover housing costs. Previously, payments were tied to the ZIP code of a school's main location. Under the new law, payments are matched with the ZIP code where students actually attend classes.\n\nThe VA had about a year to prepare for that change ahead of a deadline of Aug. 1, but the department now says its outdated IT platform wasn't equipped to deal with the complex update.\n\n\"Essentially, the law requires a 50-year-old IT platform that was designed to do the equivalent of basic math to instead perform something akin to calculus in short order,\" a spokesperson told CBS News.\n\nThe department found several errors when testing the system ahead of the August deadline and decided to delay launching the new system. But a backlog of claims crippled the VA's existing IT system and delayed the payment of thousands of benefits claims, just as students began heading back to school for the fall semester.\n\nPatrick Murray, legislative deputy director for the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), told CBS News veterans were left in the dark about the IT issues, even as they started questioning why their payments weren't coming through.\n\nIn September, Murray said the VFW was hearing from more recipients whose payments had been delayed and reached out to the VA for answers. In a statement for the record submitted for Thursday's subcommittee hearing, Murray said the VFW had been misled about the extent of the problem.\n\n\"After repeated inquiries, the VFW was told time and again, even as late as October 3, 2018, that all students were receiving some form of payments and the only issue was whether or not the amount of money students were receiving was correct,\" Murray wrote.\n\nMurray said it took until Oct. 10 for the VA to reveal there were 180,000 pending claims due to the IT issues.\n\n\"These two different statements are wildly inconsistent and show a true breakdown in communication and transparency within VA,\" Murray said in his testimony.\n\nSome veterans have been waiting more than two months for their payments, leaving many unable to cover expenses for housing, childcare and more. Murray told CBS News one couple had to borrow money to keep a roof over their heads before they finally started getting the money they were owed.\n\nRepublican Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said the delays were unacceptable.\n\n\"This is, to be kind, a train wreck,\" he said, according to NBC News. \"This discussion started over a year ago.\"\n\nThe VA now says an additional 202 workers have been assigned to work on improving processing times, and employees have been working mandatory overtime to fix the problem.\n\nIn the meantime, the VA encourages student veterans facing a genuine financial hardship because of delayed payments to call the customer service number at (888) 442-4551. The department said hardship claims would be processed within the next business day and available for use within seven days.\n\nFor Washington, the Air Force veteran in Colorado, the delay in payments have been stressful for her and her children.\n\n\"I don't want them to be hungry or have to worry about things that I need to be worrying about,\" she said. \"We're on a very tight budget right now.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "At least one county misses Florida recount deadline", "description": "Florida's third-largest county, Palm Beach, missed Thursday's deadline to complete a machine recount for the state's races for governor, senator, and agriculture commissioner.

NBC reported the consideration includes directions to the Justice Department and FBI to reopen an extradition case. The Turkish government blames Gulen for a bloody July 2016 coup in Turkey.\n\n\"The NSC has not been involved in nor aware of any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi,\" a spokesperson for the National Security Council told CBS News.\n\nState Department spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters that Gulen and the question of the Saudis are unrelated, and claimed reports have tried to \"conflate the two.\" Nauert said the U.S. has received multiple requests from the Turkish government related to Gulen, and the U.S. continues to evaluate materials that the Turkish government presented.\n\nThe case, Nauert said, is being handled out of the Justice Department.

Now, according to media reports, the Turkish government is attempting to turn the tragic murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi into a bargaining chip for its illegal demand. Sending Mr. Gulen to Turkey almost certainly would lead to his death. We hope and expect that the United States government will abide by all conditions of its laws and treaties to ensure that due process is followed.\"\n\nIn a rare interview with NPR last year, Gulen said he would not protest if the U.S. decided to extradite him, though he suggested doing so would harm the U.S.' reputation.\n\n\"With regards to the extradition demand by Turkey, I think the United States is mindful of its reputation for democracy and the rule of law. And if they are willing to risk that reputation by extraditing me based on the request and claims made by Turkey, I would never say no,\" he said (through an interpreter), even though he expects the worse, should he be forced to return to Turkey. \"I would go willingly. I am living my final years, even if they decide to kill me or poison me or bring back the death sentence to hang me.\"\n\nBut, he added, should he be extradited and sentenced to death in Turkey, he has a final wish.\n\n\"I will say the person who caused all this suffering and oppressed thousands of innocents, I want to spit in his face,\" he told NPR.

Khalil purchased a floor sample from a David's Bridal store in February, paid for her alterations in advance and the tailor was set to begin later this month.\n\nBecause it was a sample rather than a regular custom order, the store offered to clean it, but then the store temporarily lost the dress with no explanation for two months.\n\nDurrah Khalil\n\nWith her dream dress back in her possession, she's reluctant to hand it over in case she can't get it back.\n\n\"I still don't trust it at this point, I'd rather just cut my losses,\" Khalil said in a telephone interview with CBS News on Thursday. \"It's not just the money, but the actual dress that I love. I don't want to lose it.\"\n\nWhen Khalil asked David's Bridal for her money back, nearly $300, the company refused.\n\nKhalil said knew she wanted to buy a David's Bridal dress long before an engagement was on the table. While living in London, Khalil went to the store's opening in 2012 with a friend and was in awe.\n\n\"It was plush and really quite luxurious, just such a nice experience,\" Khalil said.\n\nBut when it was her turn to find a dress, Khalil said the experience was underwhelming and a bit disappointing. \"I feel that's hemorrhaged along the way,\" Khalil said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Jeff Glor", "title": "Hero killed in California shooting honored by fellow officers", "description": "Ron Helus was killed when he responded to a shooting at a crowded bar in California", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ron-helus-heroic-sergeant-killed-in-california-shooting-honored-at-funeral-by-fellow-officers/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/576f1e47-56d9-415c-9b69-ef4b8a5d875e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/2c7fd5fef10233fc6ed28e8993d6000d/ap-18319819453623.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:39:40Z", "content": "Law enforcement members turned out in force in Southern California Thursday to say goodbye to one of their own.

U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced the indictment Thursday in Louisville against 51-year-old Gregory Bush. Bush is charged with three hate crimes, one for each person who was killed and one for attempting to shoot another person based on race or color. He was also charged with three firearms counts. He could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nGregory Bush was indicted previously in state court on two counts of murder and other charges. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nWLKY-TV\n\nBush had stopped at a historically black church in suburban Louisville Oct. 24 before going to the supermarket, where 69-year-old Maurice Stallard and 67-year-old Vicki Lee Jones were shot at close range. Bush was seen on surveillance video trying to enter the church, but the door was locked and he left.\n\nPolice said Bush walked into the Kroger grocery store and shot Stallard, then killed Jones in the parking lot before exchanging fire with an armed bystander before fleeing. He did not appear to know either of the victims.\n\nColeman said there has been a \"specter that reared its head and laid across this community\" since the shootings.\n\n\"This is not acceptable,\" Coleman said at a news conference Thursday. \"No Kentuckian should be frightened to go shopping, no Kentuckian should be frightened to go worship, no Kentuckian should be frightened to go to school.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that Bush \"committed the offenses after substantial planning and premeditation, that he killed more than one person in a single criminal episode, and that he knowingly created a grave risk of death to others on the scene,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nColeman said the FBI has been involved in investigating the shooting since the day it happened.\n\n\"The crimes alleged in this indictment are horrific,\" Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement. \"We cannot and will not tolerate violence motivated by racism. We will bring the full force of the law against these and any other alleged hate crimes against fellow Americans of any race.\"\n\nSadiqa Reynolds, president of Louisville's Urban League, said after the U.S. Attorney's announcement Thursday that \"we cannot live in a community with hate, and there must be severe consequences for that.\"\n\n\"Racism is real and we see that our country is very, very divided,\" Reynolds said. \"That is not going to go away.\"\n\nPolice and Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney Thomas Wine previously identified the shooting as a hate crime, though Kentucky statute does not allow prosecutors to charge Bush separately with a hate crime at the local level \u2014 that designation would be up to a judge at the sentencing phase. Wine, along with religious leaders, the Louisville mayor and some legislators, have called for the state's hate crime law, which doesn't cover homicides, to be strengthened in the wake of the Kroger killings and the shooting rampage days later that left 11 dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nThis week, the FBI announced data showing hate crimes across the U.S. were up 17 percent between 2016 and 2017, marking an increase for the third year in a row. Hate crime offenses in 2017 were most commonly motivated by hatred over race, ethnicity or ancestry, at a rate of nearly 60 percent. The data also showed an increase in hate crimes targeting the Jewish community.\n\nBush is being held on a $5 million cash bond. Prosecutors have not made a decision on seeking the death penalty.

The nasty weather wasn't finished yet by the Thursday evening commute as it dropped more than an inch of snow on New York City and headed through New England.\n\nSo far, eight deaths have been attributed to the storm, including two people who died when a tour bus overturned in Mississippi on Wednesday. There were three deaths in Arkansas, one in Indiana, one in Ohio and one in Maryland.\n\n\"Definitely not ready for this weather. Going to go hibernate today and hope for the best,\" Dana Periste, of Mendham, New Jersey, told CBS New York.\n\nFlakes started flying midday in New York City. A mix of snow, slush and rain is expected well into the night.\n\n\"We didn't have a fall, so it's too cold right now,\" Macey Decker, of Pennsylvania, told CBS New York.\n\nWinter storm fast facts\n\nStorm-related deaths: 8 (2 in Mississippi, 1 in Indiana, 1 in Ohio, 3 in Arkansas and 1 in Maryland)\n\nPower outages in the Northeast: approximately 189,916 (across five states: Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania)\n\nSnowing across Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire\n\nStorm spans about 911 miles wide\n\nWinter officially begins Dec. 21\n\n1,300 flights throughout the U.S. canceled\n\nSome 5,500 flights delayed\n\nNew Yorkers posted images and video on social media showing the crowds waiting at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n\nHere is the video from PABT just now. pic.twitter.com/N07IOJEb3D \u2014 Ajoy Singha (@AjoySingha) November 15, 2018\n\nThere were \"significant\" flight delays throughout the Northeast Corridor, according to Flightware. The airports most impacted are Newark, LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport (BWI), Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and John F. Kennedy International Airport. Nearly 5,500 flights within/to/from the U.S. have been delayed as of 5:15 p.m., and 1,300 flights have been canceled.\n\nSouthwest Airlines canceled 258 flights so far today accounting for about 6 percent of its daily schedule, another 22 percent of its schedule, or 955, of its flights are showing delayed, CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports. The bulk of the rest of the cancellations are regional carriers serving American, United and Delta.\n\nEighty-seven flights for Friday have already been canceled.\n\nIn counties around Philadelphia, hundreds of accidents were reported, CBS Philadelphia reports. In Montgomery County, the Department of Public Safety has reported more than 250 accidents in the county since noon Thursday. There have also been 350 disabled vehicles in Montgomery County. In Delaware County, officials have reported around 150 accidents. Most of the accidents are people stuck on the side of the road. In Chester County, around 60 accidents have been reported.\n\nIn New England, the majority of the snow is predicted to fall between the Thursday evening and Friday morning commutes. This storm is what is called a classic front end \"thump\" of snow, according to CBS Boston meteorologist Terry Eliasen. For example, the area will get 3-5 hours of solid snowfall and then suddenly a flip to sleet and rain and the snowfall is done just like that.\n\nAs much as 8 inches of snow blanketed the St. Louis area, and forecasters predicted up to 6 inches in parts of southern New England as the storm made its way east. They also predicted northern New Jersey could see 4 to 8 inches of snow before the system exits the region by early Friday, while 2 to 5 inches is expected in the central region of the state.\n\nRoads in Ohio were clogged by midday Thursday, where officials reported at least one traffic death that was likely weather-related. Indiana State Police also reported a death early Thursday, which they said was caused by the 60-year-old woman driving too fast on a slick road.\n\nIn North Carolina, the National Park Service closed the Blue Ridge Parkway to traffic because of dangerous road conditions stemming from snow, sleet and freezing rain. The park service said the closure Thursday includes the so-called \"Asheville commuter zone\" between mileposts 389 and 375, Asheville Citizen Times reported.\n\nSchool districts closed or sent students home early across the lower Great Lakes and the Northeast. The University of Connecticut canceled classes starting at 3:30 p.m. or later at its main campus, satellite campuses and law school.\n\nThe South, where weather officials said the overnight trace in Alabama missed setting a record for earliest snow by about two weeks, began to clean up.\n\nIn Mississippi, a tour bus bound for a casino overturned, killing two people and injuring 44 others. And in the Little Rock, Arkansas, area, three people were killed in separate crashes on icy roads Wednesday night, while Interstate 40 was shut down overnight in the eastern part of the state because of several crashes. The interstate reopened shortly before daybreak Thursday, but officials said traffic was slow-going because some drivers had fallen asleep.\n\nWitnesses told Mississippi investigators the tour bus driver lost control after crossing an icy overpass and the bus rolled over on its driver's side, coming to rest in median of Interstate 269 in Byhalia around 12:35 p.m., said Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Capt. Johnny Poulos.\n\n\"All of a sudden the bus started swerving then it spun around two times, hit the rail and then flipped over,\" bus passenger Veronica Love told news outlets as she left a hospital after the wreck. \"The second spin, it started picking up speed. It was, I mean, what could you do?\"\n\nThe crash happened about 35 miles southeast of downtown Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nKilled were Betty Russell, 70, and Cynthia Hardin, 61, both of Huntsville, Alabama, said DeSoto County Coroner Joshua Pounders. The injured were taken to Memphis-area hospitals, with at least three listed in serious condition Wednesday evening.\n\nOfficials said the group was traveling from Huntsville, Alabama, to gamble at a casino in Mississippi's Tunica County, about 40 miles to the west.\n\nIn Virginia, the planned launch early Thursday of an unmanned cargo rocket to the International Space Station had to be rescheduled by one day because of the weather, NASA said. The unmanned Cygnus cargo craft is now scheduled to lift off early Friday from Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore carrying supplies and research materials for the astronauts at the space station."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "U.S. sanctions 17 Saudis over Khashoggi's murder", "description": "The U.S. is sanctioning 17 Saudis for their alleged role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Green, a one-time defensive standout for the Atlanta Falcons and now best-selling author, will speak in his first interview since rev\u2026 [+2106 chars]", "fulltext": "In football circles, Tim Green has always been known as a Renaissance man. He was an All-American defensive lineman at Syracuse University and an English major who graduated magna cum laude. He spent eight years sacking quarterbacks for the Atlanta Falcons, and picked up a law degree in his spare time and, during a decade in the broadcast booth for Fox Sports, he started writing books. Six became best-sellers. Then, two months ago the man who seemed to be able to do anything sent us news he could no longer hide. He is suffering from ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, one of a growing number of NFL players to receive that diagnosis. His body is starting to fail, and his voice has lost its timbre. But his story now is even more compelling than it was when we first met him back in 1996, upon the publication of his football memoir \"The Dark Side of the Game.\"\n\nTim Green in 1996: You cannot go through an NFL season without doing serious damage to your body\u2026\n\nCBS News\n\nTwenty-two years later, Tim Green spent this fall, as he has most falls. On the football field, coaching the young Skaneateles Lakers. He wasn't able to march up and down the sidelines or yell out instructions the way he used to. But he was still out there, encouraging his players, most of whom had little idea what their coach is facing.\n\nSteve Kroft: When did you first realize that there was something wrong?\n\nTim Green: It was a small thing. I couldn't use my nail-clipper.\n\nSteve Kroft: Nail-clipper?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. I couldn't do that. And then it got hard to open things.\n\nGreen didn't make much of it then. Just a few more battle scars from his days in the NFL. The first time we met him, he told us he had a lot of them.\n\nTim Green in 1996: I have enough aches and pains to know that I played the game\u2026\n\nHe was three years removed from a playing career in which he roamed the field like a predator, first in college at Syracuse\u2026\n\nAnd then as number 99 with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. He was a vicious tackler and a voracious reader, a man who devoured \"War and Peace\" in the locker room before going into battle. In retirement he kept his body fit and his mind sharp by writing novels for young and old at the upstate New York home that he shared with his wife and children.\n\n\"Life can never be long enough.\"\n\nBut by the summer of 2016, at age 52, he finally admitted to his son Troy that he felt something was off.\n\nTroy Green: He was saying to me you know, 'My hands, you know, it's getting hard for me to hold the weights,' And I'd make a joke, 'Oh, you're getting old,'\n\nTim decided to see a prominent hand surgeon.\n\nTim Green: And he looked. He said, 'I think you have ALS.' I said, 'No, I don't.'\n\nThat same day he went straight to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City to meet with a neurologist.\n\nTim Green: And, you know...\n\nSteve Kroft: What'd he tell you?\n\nTim Green: Get your affairs in order.\n\nTroy Green: He basically said, that the end is near, you better get affairs in order.\n\nSteve Kroft: Not what you wanted to hear?\n\nTim Green: No.\n\nALS, the three letters he didn't want to hear, stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare disease that New York Yankee legend Lou Gehrig gave a name and a face to 80 years ago and that recently claimed the life of physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking. It destroys the nerves that move muscles, eventually making it impossible to walk, speak or breathe. Tim understood that he'd been given a death sentence. He also had no interest in doctors, treatments or sympathy.\n\nTim Green: I said, 'We're not talkin' about it.'\n\nTroy Green: It was almost taboo. Even, even around the house, no one, we wouldn't talk about it, we wouldn't address it. It was just kinda like the elephant in the room.\n\nSteve Kroft: Were you in denial?\n\nTim Green: No, I knew I had it.\n\nSteve Kroft: You didn't wanna waste any time thinking about it? You just wanted to live?\n\nTim Green: Exactly.\n\nCBS News\n\nMost ALS patients are given two to five years to live. And Tim Green wanted to enjoy whatever time he had left with his five kids and wife of 29 years in the beautiful town of Skaneateles, which sits at the top of one of New York's Finger Lakes.\n\nTim Green: Life can never be long enough.\n\nSteve Kroft: Life can never be long enough.\n\nTim Green: Yeah.\n\nFew outside Tim's family knew of the diagnosis. He continued making public appearances, like this one in March 2017 on \"CBS This Morning\" alongside Derek Jeter. They were promoting their collaboration on a baseball book for middle school kids.\n\nSteve Kroft: Difficult to tell that there was anything wrong with you.\n\nTim Green: I could still enunciate my words more clearly. But that was a year and a half ago.\n\nTim's condition began deteriorating in the months after that appearance. His family finally convinced him to see a neurologist in Boston. He was examined by Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, the director of the Healey Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nSteve Kroft: What's Tim's prognosis?\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: He has one of the better prognoses because he has a slower form. However, everybody with ALS has a serious prognosis. It is, today, a fatal disease.\n\nSteve Kroft: And there's no cure?\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: There's no cure today But there are some treatments and there's a lot of advances in science and a lot of hope for our patients.\n\nDr. Cudkowicz put Green on a new treatment that can slow the progression of ALS by a third. He says he's noticed the difference.\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: Your mood is okay?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Oh yeah.\n\nCBS News\n\nNo one knows exactly what causes ALS. In Tim Green's case, head trauma is a leading suspect. Scientists caution that the data linking football to the disease is not conclusive but the NFL concussion settlement specifically covers ALS and Tim Green believes there's a connection\n\nSteve Kroft: How much of this do you think has to do with football?\n\nTim Green: I think probably a lot, if not all\u2026\n\nHe says he lost track of the number of concussions he suffered playing football. He stopped counting after ten.\n\nTim Green: I used my head on every play. Every play. Every snap. It was like throwing myself head first into a concrete wall.\n\nSteve Kroft: Did you ever think about it while you were playing?\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nHe even used his head to celebrate on the field. At the time, he says, no one was concerned about possible brain damage. During his NFL career in the late 80s and early 90s, pre-season practices were particularly brutal. Tim's wife Illyssa remembers the pounding he took.\n\nIlyssa Green: His head was so swollen he would put, have to put Vaseline all over his head to get his helmet on.\n\nTim Green: Practice was much worse than the games.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you didn't go easy in practice?\n\nTim Green: No. I was nuts.\n\nSteve Kroft: You seem like such a mild-mannered guy.\n\nTim Green: I am. I am.\n\nSteve Kroft: But not on a football field?\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nCBS News\n\nWhen we interviewed Tim Green in 1996, he addressed the violence and risks inherent in the game and seemed to believe that this day might come.\n\nSteve Kroft: You said, \"I think guys would be\u2026\"\n\nTim Green in 1996: \u2026willing to take ten to 20 years off the end of their lives in order to get out there on a Sunday and play.

I've maybe taken that much off the end of my life. Maybe more. I don't know.\n\nSteve Kroft: You don't have any regrets\u2026\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nTo fully understand, he says you have to know what it was like being out there, doing something you dreamed of and experiencing even for a moment the intensity of 60,000 people screaming for you and your teammates and feeling that energy through every pore in your body.\n\nTim Green: It was as magical and wonderful as I dreamed it would be.\n\nTim Green believes if his football career had started 30 years later, he might not be fighting for his life today. New NFL rules have drastically cut back helmet to helmet contact in practice and it's penalized in games.\n\nHe follows those guidelines with the youth team he coaches, limiting contact during practices. His 12-year-old son Ty is the team's star quarterback. Tim doesn't want him to play defense.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe trophies from his NFL career fill his office, but instead of mounted heads of lions, tigers and bears there are pictures of the big game quarterbacks he's brought down\n\nTim Green: Joe Montana\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah, number 16. 49ers.\n\nTim Green: He was the king back then.\n\nSteve Kroft: And that is Dan Marino?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: I like that (both hands in air)\n\nSteve Kroft: Best time of your life?\n\nTim Green: No. Best time of my life is right now.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right now?\n\nTim Green: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: Why?\n\nTim Green: I have everything.\n\nTim Green was adopted so 'everything' to him means family. The Greens all live in the same neighborhood and they eat dinner together five nights a week.\n\n\"People would say, 'Tim, God bless you.'

He's never\u2026\n\nTroy Green: He doesn't give up in tic-tac-toe, he's not (laughter)\u2026\n\nTim Green: I don't think about about what I can't do.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you can still write?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. And I can write. And, you know, that opens up a universe.\n\nWriting offers him an escape from his illness. He's authored 38 books overall, four since his diagnosis. He wrote the last one on his smartphone using his thumbs, all 300 pages.\n\nSteve Kroft: So this is a new book?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nHis thumbs no longer work that well but his mind is just fine, he's using technology to forge ahead with book number 39.\n\nTim Green: There's a sensor.\n\nThere's a sensor in his glasses that he can move to lock on letters on his keyboard, he then clicks on a mouse and words are formed, letter by letter.\n\nCBS News\n\nSteve Kroft: How far along are you on this, this book?\n\nTim Green: I'm about halfway.\n\nHe's a little behind schedule, the first deadline he's ever missed.\n\nTim Green: I apologized to my editor.\n\nSteve Kroft: I think your editor understands.\n\nTim Green: She did. Yeah.\n\nMore scientists than ever are trying to unlock the mystery of ALS and its causes, but it's still an underfunded disease.\n\nThat's why Tim and his family are starting a social media campaign called Tackle ALS to raise money for research. Current and former NFL stars Matt Ryan, Von Miller and Brett Favre have all joined the team.\n\nBut Tim understands that he may not be around to see the benefits. In the time he has left, however long that may be, he is content to enjoy the power of his boat and the company of his family. He just feels blessed for who he was and what he has.\n\nTim Green: People would say, 'Tim, God bless you.'

On average, their bodies used up 250 extra calories per day over 20 weeks.\n\nThe researchers estimated that over three years, that would translate into an additional 20-pound weight loss for an average-height man.\n\n\"This study refutes the conventional thinking that it's only calorie-cutting that matters,\" said senior researcher Dr. David Ludwig. He is co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nInstead, he said, the source of those calories may make the difference in whether your metabolism \"works with you or against you.\"\n\nAccording to Ludwig, the findings support a theory called the \"carbohydrate-insulin model.\" The premise is that diets heavy in processed carbs send insulin levels soaring, which drives the body to use fewer calories, and instead store more of them as fat.\n\n\"Our study suggests that you'll do better if you focus on reducing refined carbohydrates, rather than focusing on reducing calories alone,\" Ludwig said.\n\nHe and his colleagues reported the findings online Nov. 14 in the BMJ.\n\nMany studies over the years have attempted to answer the question of whether low-fat or low-carb is better for weight loss. Often, they've concluded there is little difference.\n\nBut those studies, Ludwig said, have typically been behavioral studies where people may or may not stick with their diets.\n\nSo his team conducted a \"feeding study\" to carefully control what people ate.\n\nFirst, 234 overweight and obese adults were recruited for a \"run-in\" phase, with the goal of losing about 12 percent of their weight over 10 weeks. Their diets were low-calorie and had moderate amounts of carbs.\n\nOf that group, 164 lost enough weight and moved on to the next phase. They were randomly assigned to either a low-carb, moderate-carb or high-carb diet for 20 weeks.\n\nPeople on the low-carb diet got 20 percent of their calories from carbs like vegetables, fruits and beans; a full 60 percent of their calories came from fat, including sources like meat, whole milk, cheese and nuts. The remaining 20 percent of calories came from protein.\n\nThe situation was flipped for people on the high-carb plan: 60 percent of calories from carbs and 20 percent from fat. The moderate plan divided the two nutrients equally, at 40/40.\n\nAfter 20 weeks, the low-carb group appeared to be burning more calories -- an average of 250 more per day, versus the high-carb group, and 111 more than the moderate-carb group.\n\nThe researchers did not look at the effects on any further weight loss. Instead, each person's calorie intake was calibrated to maintain what they'd already lost. The point, Ludwig explained, was to zero in on the effects of the different diets on calorie burning.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anastassia Amaro, medical director of Penn Metabolic Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, \"The study design is very clever.\"\n\nAmaro, who was not involved in the research, said she already suggests that patients cut back on carbs when they are trying to lose weight.\n\nThese findings, she said, will boost her confidence in that advice.\n\nHowever, Amaro said, the low-carb diet used in this study is not ready for a \"direct translation\" into the real world. For one, she explained, it's not clear whether it's the lack of carbs that was key.\n\n\"This is also a high-fat diet,\" Amaro pointed out. \"Is it the lack of carbs, the fat content, or both?\"\n\nWhat about the nutritional value of such a diet? Ludwig said it's healthy -- allowing fruit, legumes and an \"unlimited\" amount of vegetables, for instance.\n\n\"What it doesn't have is grains and added sugar,\" he said.\n\nLudwig agreed, however, that more research is needed to show whether the approach is the best way to maintain weight loss. He and his colleagues recently started a new trial that will pit a very low-carb diet against one that is high-carb but low in sugar, and another that is high-carb/high-sugar.\n\nAnd what about people who currently have a healthy weight? Would a low-carb, high-fat diet cause their bodies to burn more calories?\n\nThat's a \"good question,\" Amaro said -- but this study can't answer it."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Political satirist says comedy is a source of therapy in the Trump era", "description": "Political satirist Will Durst discussed comedy in the age of Trump in a special edition of \"The Takeout\" podcast", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/political-satirist-will-durst-says-comedy-is-a-source-of-therapy-in-the-trump-era/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/77f3cc43-af4c-48e7-8366-4d7bc6aa3be3/thumbnail/1200x630g2/397807fb4939ad5dcf6a6a8db9b29c7a/img-1863.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:02:30Z", "content": "Political satirist Will Durst discussed comedy in the age of President Trump in a special edition of \"The Takeout\" podcast with CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett recorded in front of a live audience.

That and fear and some other stuff. But no, it's not whipping up the base. There are constitutional scholars who say the 14th Amendment has been misinterpreted and actually the Supreme Court has never gave a solid opinion on this.\"\n\nBut in the days since the midterm elections, the president's riffs on illegal immigration, both on Twitter and in his few public remarks, have diminished.\n\nMr. Trump, who tweeted the word \"caravan\" nine times in the last two weeks of October, hasn't since Halloween, even as the caravan draws closer than ever. He also hasn't tweeted the word \"immigration\" since before the midterms. He's also tweeted the word \"border\" just once since the midterms, when he signed a presidential proclamation tightening asylum claims last week.\n\nMeanwhile, the military has dispatched thousands of troops to the border at the Trump administration's request, meaning many won't be home for Thanksgiving festivities next week. Although the Pentagon says it's essentially \"peaked\" in terms of the number of troops at the border, according to Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, there are still 5,900 troops at the border. Before the election, the president said that number could go as high as 15,000.\n\nA splintered group of migrants from the first caravan has reached the southern border at Tijuana, but the president has said nothing publicly about it.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters last week he still plans to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship, but he hasn't given a timeline for when that might happen.

I needed my family, and I had them.\"\n\nHer personal feelings about the president remain tethered to the office he holds and what that office represents but she said she still found it hard to listen to Mr. Trump's repeated attacks on her husband, which included calling Sen.

So by the time it's diagnosed it's late stage and difficult to treat,\" Julie Fleshman, president and CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, told CBS News.\n\nThe early symptoms of pancreatic cancer are also non-specific and often benign, so many patients don't know something is seriously wrong.\n\n\"Things like stomach ache, lower back pain, unexplained weight loss, jaundice, or the yellowing of skin and the eyes, new onset diabetes,\" Fleshman said. \"Those are some of the things where if you have more than one of those symptoms, you should talk to your doctor about pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nCertain risk factors also make a person more likely to get pancreatic cancer. These include a family history of pancreatic cancer or other cancers, chronic and hereditary pancreatitis, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, and a poor diet.\n\nAfrican-Americans have a higher incidence of pancreatic cancer compared to those of Asian, Hispanic or Caucasian descent.\n\nThe risk of pancreatic cancer also increases with age. The majority of people are diagnosed over the age of 60.\n\nWhile survival rates are low, some treatment options are available.\n\n\"Usually it's treated through some sort of chemotherapy and radiation,\" Fleshman explained. \"If it's detected early enough and hasn't spread, some patients are eligible for surgery.\"\n\nShe emphasizes that more research funding is needed to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer and to support individuals and families affected by the disease."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Embattled ex-deputy is a no-show at Stoneman Douglas safety hearing", "description": "Scot Peterson never entered the high school during the shooting that killed 17 -- he was expected to testify Thursday", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scot-peterson-ex-officer-who-didnt-confront-marjory-stoneman-douglas-shooter-nikolas-cruz-is-a-no-show-at-safety-hearing/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/a6074ce8-6488-47ed-825e-e4b7599d1369/thumbnail/1200x630/a8e7d9973da83d44ddd62e508a4447d9/scot-peterson-parkland-shooting-surveillance-video.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:30:12Z", "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The then-sheriff's deputy who was on campus during the Parkland, Florida high school massacre but failed to confront the shooter didn't show up to answer an investigative panel's questions Thursday.

In an increasingly routine feat, the booster's first stage fell away and flew itself back to a pinpoint touchdown on an off-shore drone ship, the company's 31st successful recovery.\n\nThe stage first flew last July when it helped boost a Telstar communications satellite into orbit. The booster is one of six \"block 5\" stages launched so far by SpaceX featuring a variety of upgrades to improve performance and enable multiple flights.\n\nWhen the booster launched Thursday might fly again is not yet known, but SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said the block 5 version is designed to fly up to 100 times with overhauls every 10 launches or so. Another Falcon 9, scheduled for launch Monday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, will be the first to fly three times.\n\nWhile important to SpaceX's business model, booster recoveries remain a strictly secondary objective.\n\nSpaceX\n\nThe primary goal of Thursday's flight was to boost the 11,685-pound Es'hail 2 relay station into orbit for the Qatari company Es'hailSat to provide government and private sector communications across the Middle East, including direct-to-home television and data services.\n\nEs'hailSat's first satellite entered service in December 2013 and currently provides television content, business communications and other telecommunications services. Es'hail 2 features high-speed Ku- and Ka-band transponders, a military communications payload and sophisticated anti-jamming capabilities.\n\nIt also features the first Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation \u2014 AMSAT \u2014 payload to fly aboard a geostationary satellite, providing coverage stretching from Brazil to Thailand.\n\nMitsubishi Electric\n\nThe mission got underway at 3:46 p.m. EST (GMT-5) with ignition of the booster's nine Merlin 1D engines, generating a brilliant burst of fiery exhaust and a billowing cloud of steam from water sprayed on the launch stand to cool the structure and lessen the acoustic shock of engine ignition.\n\nAfter a final lightning-quick round of computer checks, the slender 229-foot-tall rocket was released from the pad, quickly climbing away under a partly cloudy sky.\n\nSmoothly accelerating as the rocket gulped propellant and lost weight, the Falcon 9 arced away to the east over the Atlantic Ocean, rapidly gaining altitude and slowly fading from view, leaving a crackling roar in its wake.\n\nTwo minutes and 35 seconds after liftoff, the first stage separated and dropped away, followed a few seconds later by ignition of the second stage's single engine. Two firings were required to put the Es'hail 2 relay station into the required elliptical \"transfer\" orbit, one with a predicted low point of just 115 miles and a high point of about 22,370.\n\nThe satellite is bound for a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the equator where spacecraft take 24 hours to complete one orbit and appear to hang stationary in the sky, allowing the use of fixed antennas on the ground \u2014 a key requirement for affordable commercial communications.\n\nTo get there, the satellite's on-board propulsion system will be used to raise the low-point of the orbit and maneuver the spacecraft into the proper position to serve the Middle East. If all goes well, the Es'hail 2 will enter service at the end of January.\n\nSpaceX\n\nThe first stage landing, meanwhile, followed SpaceX's normal script for recoveries. The rocket fired up three of its engines to slow down for entry into the thick lower atmosphere, using titanium \"grid fins\" at the top of the rocket for steering and attitude control.\n\nPlummeting back to Earth tail first, the rocket's four landing legs unfolded moments before a single engine re-started to slow the vehicle for landing. Television views provided by SpaceX showed the stage smoothly descending to touchdown about eight minutes and 15 seconds after liftoff.\n\nThe landing was SpaceX's 31st successful recovery, its 19th on off-shore drone ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. One stage landed back at its Vandenberg Air Force Base launch site and 11 others landed at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nOverall, Thursday's launching marked SpaceX's 18th flight so far this year \u2014 22 are planned \u2014 and the company's 63rd Falcon 9 launch, the 64th counting the February debut of the three-core Falcon Heavy."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Survey finds people love falling asleep to Coldplay, Ed Sheeran", "description": "Sixty-two percent of respondents in a new survey told researchers they use music as a sleep aid to help them relax or block noise", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/survey-finds-people-love-falling-asleep-to-coldplay-and-ed-sheeran/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/038689e3-16f4-4027-a76f-5583bb3277fc/thumbnail/1200x630/8f1543b51539baf580fad61362b0dbc1/1115-ctm-morosoundsofsleep-ash-1712791-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:18:21Z", "content": "A new study suggests that a lot of people listen to music to help them fall asleep \u2014 especially Ed Sheeran and Coldplay.

Soak about 20 minutes until softened. Drain and reserve the soaking liquid. Chop the mushrooms and set aside.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Press\n\nIn a large, heavy pot, heat the sunflower oil over medium-high heat and brown the meat pieces in batches, seasoning with salt and juniper. Be careful not to crowd the pan. Cook each batch about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the browned meat to a platter.\n\nReduce the heat and add the onions, mushrooms, oregano and sumac, and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft and the mushrooms release some of their liquid, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped, reconstituted wild mushrooms and the soaking liquid and the stock, stirring to dislodge any brown bits that stick to the pan.\n\nReturn the meat to the pot, bring to a simmer, and cook, partially covered, until the meat is fork tender, about 2 hours. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Remove from the heat and let sit a few minutes before serving.\n\nCorn Stock\n\nSave the corncobs after you've enjoyed boiled or roasted corn on the cob, or you've cut the kernels for use in a recipe. Put the corncobs into a pot and cover with water by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil and partially cover. Reduce the heat and simmer until the stock tastes \"corny,\" about 1 hour.\n\nDiscard the cobs, and store the stock in a covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.\n\nFish, Game, Meat Stock\n\nWe make stock with just about everything in the larder, including vegetables (except greens) and bones (even smoked fish bones). Essential seasonings:\n\nJuniper\n\n\n\nSage\n\n\n\nCedar\n\n\n\nMint\n\n\n\nJuniper and cedar are aggressive flavors, so add seasoning with a light touch. You can always add more later on. Then, add enough water to cover the ingredients completely and set over a low flame until the stock is flavorful. Cooking time will vary depending on the amount of liquid and the ingredients, but most stocks require cooking at least 2 to 3 hours.\n\n\n\nRecipes from \"The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen\" by Sean Sherman with Beth Dooley. \u00a9 2017 Ghost Dancer, LLC.

Vitiello over the Trump administration's controversial \"zero-tolerance\" family separation policy, the agency's detention of pregnant women and reports that the government is considering a new proposal that would again separate migrant children from their parents.\n\nDuring his Thursday confirmation hearing to become the director of the agency he has lead on an acting basis since June, Vitiello faced pointed questions and scathing criticism from Democratic members of the U.S Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Some of the fiercest questioning came from California Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, who asked the ICE chief if he recognized how his agency is perceived in many immigrant communities.\n\n\"Are you aware that there's a perception that ICE is administering its power in a way that is causing fear and intimidation \u2014 particularly among immigrants and specifically among immigrants coming from Mexico and Central America?\" Sen. Harris asked, after a heated exchange with Vitiello over an alleged comment he made on Twitter comparing the Democratic Party to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nVitiello's admitted that his tweet \"was wrong to do\" because it included \"offensive words.\" Pressed by Harris, the Acting ICE Director also stressed that he saw no parallels between the perception of the work undertaken by his agency's officers and the \"fear and force\" he said the Ku Klux Klan employed to \"change the political environment.\"\n\nThe junior senator from California also pressed Vitiello on an agency directive from December of last year that effectively ended the practice of auto-releasing pregnant women from ICE detention. Asked for the number of pregnant women in ICE custody, including those in their final trimester of pregnancy, Vitiello said he did not have statistics with him, but that the number is \"very small.\" He added that detention of women in their third trimester is \"rare.\"\n\nSen. Harris asked ICE's Acting Director if the agency had commissioned an assessment of the treatment of pregnant women under its custody. \"A specific assessment, I'm not aware of,\" Vitiello responded.\n\nReferring to the government's practice of forcibly separating migrant children from their parents near the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 which President Donald Trump was forced to rescind by way of an executive order after a massive uproar \u2014 Democratic Senator from New Hampshire Maggie Hassan asked Vitiello if he was aware of the psychological trauma that could be inflicted on children if they are separated from their families.\n\n\"I would like, like I said earlier, that we weren't in a situation where large numbers of families with children are approaching the border,\" Vitiello replied. \"But that's not the situation that we're in.\"\n\nSen. Hassan accused the ICE chief of portraying children as \"tools\" to punish their parents who cross the border illegally. \"We have the capacity in the United States of America to control our borders without harming children,\" she said.\n\nHer Democratic colleague, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan brought up reports that the administration is considering a modified deterrence policy proposal that would again lead to family separation. The proposal would force apprehended migrant families to choose between voluntarily relinquishing their children to foster care or opting to remain in custody together and waiving their children's right to be released from detention within 20 days \u2014 as guaranteed by the Flores court settlement.\n\nVitiello, who used to head the U.S. Border Patrol, confirmed \"discussion is underway\" within the administration on the proposal. When asked by Sen. Peters if he supported the policy, Vitiello noted that \"it is a way for people to have a due process opportunity and remain in custody.\"\n\nRepublican members of the committee focused their line of questioning on how Vitiello would confront the reluctance by local \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions to cooperate with ICE's immigration enforcement operations and on his approach to curtail the opioid epidemic across the country.\n\nTowards the culmination of the hearing, Delaware Democratic Sen. Tom Carper scrutinized the administration's thought process behind the \"zero tolerance\" practice, which he noted Vitiello played a role in implementing.

Though Britain voted in 2016 to exit the bloc, how -- and even if -- that will happen remains unclear. The U.K.'s future relationship with the EU is also uncertain.\n\nHere are three possible scenarios:\n\nThe government's proposal passes\n\nThe U.K. government, led by Prime Minister Theresa May, has been negotiating with the EU for over a year. On Wednesday, it released its proposed withdrawal deal. The transitional deal has been criticized by those on both sides of the debate in Britain, but if it is approved, it will be the only legal agreement between Britain and the EU until another one is negotiated after March.\n\nOne of major sticking points in any Brexit scenario is the border between the Republic of Ireland (which is part of the European Union) and Northern Ireland (which is a part of the United Kingdom). There is no hard border -- an arrangement that came after decades of violence during which Northern Irish nationalists fought against loyalists for a united Ireland, independent of the U.K. There is concern that a hard border could reignite tensions.\n\nThe government's draft deal would ensure continued free movement of goods and people between Ireland and Northern Ireland by committing Northern Ireland to the EU's single market trade and customs rules. In order to make that work, the rest of the U.K. would also adhere to the EU's single market rules for goods, as well as some of its some customs regulations for an undefined period of time.\n\nCritics have said that would effectively leave the U.K. subject to the same EU regulations as before Brexit, except it would no longer have any power in the bloc.\n\nOther parts of the deal call for the U.K. to honor its financial commitments to the EU for at least the next two years. The deal also includes protections for EU citizens living in Britain and a transition period lasting until at least 2020, during which time future trade agreements could be negotiated.\n\nA number of government officials have resigned over the proposed deal, and some members of Theresa May's ruling Conservative Party have called for a vote of no confidence. If enough Conservative lawmakers make similar calls, there could be a vote for a new party leader, which would force May out of her position as prime minister.\n\n\"No-deal\" Brexit\n\nIf no agreement between the British government and the European Union is reached as of March 29, the U.K. will simply cease to be in the bloc. The terms of its trade with the EU would then be set by World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\n\nEU countries enjoy tariff-free trade with one another. Without a U.K.-EU deal, tariffs would come into effect after Brexit.\n\nSome economists say a \"no-deal\" Brexit would cost each member of the British public approximately 800 pounds (about $1,000) per year, given the expected higher prices for goods. However, hardline Brexit supporters argue that it would be best for the U.K. in the long run, as fewer commitments to Europe would make it easier for Britain to negotiate direct trade deals worldwide.\n\nA no-deal Brexit could also cause delays at borders, as new customs agreements with nearby countries in Europe would take time to negotiate and implement.\n\nA second referendum\n\nSome in Britain, including lawmakers on both sides of the debate, have been calling for a second public vote on any deal that the U.K. Parliament approves. If a new referendum is called, it is possible that the government could include an option on the ballot that would essentially give voters another chance to reject Brexit completely.\n\nLate last month, about 700,000 people marched through London in support of a grassroots campaign called \"People's Vote,\" and three of the four former prime ministers who are still living have come out in support of a second referendum. The EU, for its part, has said it would be open to the U.K. reversing its decision to leave.\n\nTheresa May has, however, repeatedly ruled out the possibility of a second vote on Brexit, saying the people have already spoken.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, there will not be a second referendum,\" she told reporters late Thursday.\n\nShe said her government's proposed \"deal delivers what people voted for, and it is in the national interest. ... If we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Caitlin O'Kane", "title": "Man shouts \"Heil Hitler\" in theater during \"Fiddler on the Roof\"", "description": "Witnesses say the remark set off a moment of panic among some members of the audience", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-shouts-heil-hitler-heil-trump-during-fiddler-on-the-roof-performance-in-baltimore/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/b017ee49-956b-49ef-9a6b-52478faa1aeb/thumbnail/1200x630/9194db6214d4aa5d0127aaca37131bc5/screen-shot-2018-11-15-at-1-24-58-pm.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:31:44Z", "content": "A man shouted \"Heil Hitler, Heil Trump\" in a crowded Baltimore theater Wednesday, setting off a moment of panic among some members of the audience.

The country music and comedy show's last episode aired in 1993, though reruns continued for a few years thereafter.\n\n\"'Hee Haw' won't go away. It brings a smile to too many faces,\" he said in 2004, when the show was distributed on VHS and DVD for the first time.\n\nClark played the guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and other instruments. His skills brought him gigs as guest performer with many top orchestras, including the Boston Pops. In 1976 he headlined a tour of the Soviet Union, breaking boundaries that were usually closed to Americans.\n\nMARK HUMPHREY\n\nAnd of course, he also was a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nHis hits included \"The Tips of My Fingers\" (1963), \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" (1969), \"Come Live With Me\" (1973) and \"Honeymoon Feeling\" (1974). He was also known for his instrumental versions of \"Malaguena,\" on 12-string guitar, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky.\"\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and emotionally told the crowd how moving it was \"just to be associated yourself with the members of the Country Music Hall of Fame and imagine that your name will be said right along with all the list.\"\n\nIn his 1994 autobiography, \"My Life in Spite of Myself,\" he said \"Yesterday, When I Was Young\" had \"opened a lot of people's eyes not only to what I could do but to the whole fertile and still largely untapped field of country music, from the Glen Campbells and the Kenny Rogerses, right on through to the Garth Brookses and Vince Gills.\"\n\nClark was guest host on \"The Tonight Show\" several times in the 1960s and 1970s when it was rare for a country performer to land such a role. His fans included not just musicians, but baseball great Mickey Mantle. The Yankees outfielder was moved to tears by \"Yesterday When I Was Young\" and for years made Clark promise to sing it at his memorial \u2014 a request granted after Mantle died in 1995.\n\nBeginning in 1983, Clark operated the Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre in Branson, Missouri, and was one of the first country entertainers to open a theater there. Dozens followed him.\n\nHe was a touring artist as late as the 2000s. Over the years, he played at venues around the world: Carnegie Hall in New York, the Sporting Club in Monte Carlo, the Grand Palace in Brussels and the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow.\n\nClark was born in Meherrin, Virginia, and received his first guitar on his 14th Christmas. He was playing in his father's square dance band at age 15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Clark played in bands in the Washington, D.C., area. In 1960, he got the chance to front the band of country singer Wanda Jackson. He also performed regularly in Las Vegas. He got his first recording contract, with Capitol Records, in 1962.\n\nHe appeared on Jimmy Dean's TV show \"Town and Country Time\" and took over the show when Dean left.\n\nIn 1997 he released \"Roy Clark's Christmas Memories.\"\n\nClark and Owens worked together for years, but they had very different feelings about \"Hee Haw.\" Owens, who left the show in 1986, later referred to it as a \"cartoon donkey,\" one he endured for \"that big paycheck.\" Clark told The Associated Press in 2004 that \"Hee Haw\" was like a family reunion.\n\n\"We became a part of the family. The viewers were sort of part owners of the show. They identified with these clowns, and we had good music.\"\n\nClark said the hour-long program of country music and corny jokes capped off his career.\n\n\"This was the icing on the cake.

They weren't being in their own clique, they weren't being selfish, they took their time to reach out to somebody who might be different. And you know, you never know what a child is going through \u2014 maybe they've got a bad home life, maybe they're depressed, and there's a kid sitting by themselves and they noticed that,\" Kay said. \"The peace I have now at lunch I don't feel like I need to text him and check on him.\"\n\nWhat started as a small act of kindness has even gone beyond the lunchroom.

To dry-brine, generously season with salt, maple sugar, sumac and juniper. Place on a roasting pan or deep plate in the refrigerator, uncovered, overnight.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Press\n\nPreheat the oven to 500\u00b0F.\n\nPlace the pheasants breast-side up in a medium roasting pan. Rub a generous amount of the duck fat under the skin of the birds and over the outside of the skin. Put half the cranberries into the cavity of the pheasants and spread the rest in the pan. Pour the stock and vinegar into the roasting pan.\n\nRoast for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350\u00b0F and baste the pheasants with the pan juices. Continue roasting until the skin is crisp, the juices run clear, and a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reaches 155\u00b0F, about 30 to 45 more minutes.\n\nAllow to stand at least 10 minutes before carving.\n\nCarve and drizzle with the pan juices before serving with the griddled apples.\n\nYou can substitute 2 Tablespoons cider vinegar and 1 Tablespoon maple syrup for the maple vinegar.\n\n\n\nFor the griddled apples, slice the apples in half horizontally, brush with a little sunflower or walnut oil, and griddle cut side down in a hot skillet or frying pan until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nRendered Duck Fat\n\nCarefully remove all the skin and fat from the duck breasts, cutting close to, but not touching, the meat. Once the fat and skin are removed, cut into 1-inch chunks. Place the skin, with its fat, into a heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven. Set the pan over low heat and slowly cook, stirring occasionally, until the skin has crisped and its fat has changed to liquid, about 45 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the crisped skin (cracklings) and drain them in a bowl lined with paper towels. Allow the liquid fat to cool to room temperature, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a bowl or a clean glass jar.\n\nCorn Stock\n\nSave the corncobs after you've enjoyed boiled or roasted corn on the cob, or you've cut the kernels for use in a recipe. Put the corncobs into a pot and cover with water by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil and partially cover. Reduce the heat and simmer until the stock tastes \"corny,\" about 1 hour.\n\nDiscard the cobs, and store the stock in a covered container in the refrigerator or freezer.\n\nFish, Game, Meat Stock\n\nWe make stock with just about everything in the larder, including vegetables (except greens) and bones (even smoked fish bones). Essential seasonings:\n\nJuniper\n\n\n\nSage\n\n\n\nCedar\n\n\n\nMint\n\n\n\nJuniper and cedar are aggressive flavors, so add seasoning with a light touch. You can always add more later on. Then, add enough water to cover the ingredients completely and set over a low flame until the stock is flavorful. Cooking time will vary depending on the amount of liquid and the ingredients, but most stocks require cooking at least 2 to 3 hours.\n\n\n\nRecipe from \"The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen\" by Sean Sherman with Beth Dooley. \u00a9 2017 Ghost Dancer, LLC.

If it does, it would shatter the record set by Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog,\" which sold for $58.4 million in 2013.\n\nIn an interview at his Los Angeles studio two years ago, Hockney told Mason he doesn't know why it's been so popular over the years, and aptly pointed out, \"If there were a formula for that, there'd be a lot more of them, wouldn't there.\"\n\nHockney said he was drawn to California by the sunshine, far from his hometown of Bradford, England, which he described as having a \"gothic gloom.\" California is where he found his sense of color and where he developed a fascination with pools.\n\n\"It's always an interesting thing. How do you paint water? How do you paint something transparent?\" Hockney said.\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" is perhaps Hockney's most famous pool picture. It's also the only one to include his other most prominent theme, the double portrait.\n\n\"This one is actually a very personal story. Because it's about his love and his lost love. Or his love that he's about to lose,\" explained Alex Rotter of Christie's auction house.\n\nThe story is told in the 1974 film, \"A Bigger Splash,\" which captured Hockney working on a first version of the painting, which he'd later abandon and destroy, then showed him photographing his estranged lover, Peter Schlesinger, for the second painting, which he finished.\n\nAlthough the British pop artist became popular in America, for a long time art historians were unsure where to place Hockney.\n\n\"The market took a long time to come around, because he found his real \u2013 his language, just when he moved to America. And then was seen in a funny way in the context of American paintings,\" Rotter said. \"He didn't fit anywhere.\"\n\nBut at 81, Hockney, who's still at work, may have lived long enough to become the priciest living painter.\n\n\"You just go on and on 'til you fall over,\" Hockney said. \"I'm still a smoker. I mean I just go on and one day I'll fall over, yeah. I don't mind.\"\n\nThursday's winning bid is expected to more than double the previous record paid for a Hockney painting, which was $28.5 million at a Sotheby's auction earlier this year."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Maine election officials declare that Democrat wins contested House race", "description": "Maine election officials found that Democrat Jared Golden defeated incumbent Republican Rep.

The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company.\"\n\nSoros, who is often the target of anti-Semitism, has been critical of Facebook before. In a Jan. 25 speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros called Facebook and Google a \"menace\" and called for \"regulatory authorities to protect society against them.\"\n\nFacebook said in its statement that it ended its contract with Definers Wednesday night. In a statement to CBS News, a Definers spokesperson said the company \"proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services.\"\n\n\"All of our work is based on publicly-available documents and information. The document referenced in the Times story regarding the anti-Facebook organization's potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records, including public statements by one of its organizers about receiving funding from Mr. Soros' foundation,\" the Definers spokesperson said.\n\nAs news of Facebook's use of Definers reached Capitol Hill, one senator implied that Facebook's efforts to push back against critics may add to the company's woes.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, told reporters she will be sending a letter to Facebook and the Justice Department.\n\n\"I think it's very important that we get to the bottom of that, because it's very clear they went all out against their critics,\" Klobuchar said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Kevin McCarthy promises to resist Democrats' agenda as new House minority leader", "description": "Newly elected House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy says he will resist the Democratic majority's agenda come January.

That would put Walmart, which includes Jet.com and Sam's Club, behind only Amazon and eBay. Apple is forecast to take in 3.9 percent of spending, up from 3.8 percent last year.\n\nNo retailer comes close to Amazon in ecommerce. EMarketer pegs the company's share of online spending at roughly 48 percent. But Walmart's latest earnings show that's it making headway in areas where Amazon has been weaker, such as letting customers buy groceries online.\n\n\"Walmart's ecommerce business has been firing on all cylinders lately,\" eMarketer principal analyst Andrew Lipsman said in a blog post. \"But more than anything, Walmart has caught its stride with a fast-growing online grocery business, which is helped in large part by the massive consumer adoption of click-and-collect.\"\n\nWalmart posted profits of $1.7 billion on revenue of $124.9 billion for the third quarter, slightly higher than analysts expected. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.4, down from 4.5 percent at Walmart's U.S. division -- the latter figure marked its best performance in more than a decade. The measure, an indicator of a retailer's health, was boosted by a 1.2 percent increase in customer traffic and a 2.2 percent rise in transactions.\n\nSince buying Jet.com for more than $3 billion two years ago, Walmart has been expanding its online business by acquiring brands and adding thousands of items. It's also been ramping up grocery delivery and pickup options. Grocery pickup is now offered at nearly 2,100 of its 4,700 U.S. stores, while grocery delivery is available in nearly 600 locations.\n\nWalmart has also revamped its website to focus on fashion and home furnishings. That all helped to drive a 43 percent increase in online sales in the U.S. during the latest quarter.\n\n\"We're feeling confident going into this holiday season,\" Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran told the Associated Press last week. \"I think the standards, the flow of merchandise, our pricing are feeling better than it was a year ago.\"\n\nUnder Foran, Walmart is creating a tech-powered shopping experience at its stores, while transforming them into more efficient distribution hubs that can fill online orders to reduce shipping costs and speed up deliveries.\n\nAmong other enhancements, customers can also use digital maps on their smartphone to help locate items in stores. Workers, armed with new apps on their mobile device, will also be able to manage routine tasks, freeing them to serve the customer or check them out in key areas of the store.\n\n\"We can provide a much better customer experience because we are in stock of the right item, at the right time at the same time it is going to help us be much more precise,\" Foran said.\n\nLike other retailers, Walmart is benefiting from a strong job market and rising consumer confidence. Home Depot and Macy's raised annual profit expectations this week. They're also benefiting from the misfortunes of others. Toys R Us and Bon-Ton Stores have gone out of business, while the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings Corp. is creating more opportunities to grab sales.\n\nIn fact, in the free shipping arena, Walmart found itself the laggard during the start of the holidays. Target announced last month that for the first time it was getting rid of its $35 threshold for two-day delivery for the holidays. That move was followed by Amazon, which announced earlier in the month that it was going to make two-day shipping available to all shoppers including non-Prime customers, without the spending requirement of $25.\n\nAmazon is also expanding its cashier-less physical stores, pushing Walmart and others to speed up checkout, a source of frustration for many shoppers. In time for the holidays, Walmart has rolled out a program that allows its staff to check out customers and provide receipts right on the spot in the busiest sections of the store.\n\nBut the first big test this holiday season is Black Friday weekend.\n\n\"If you run a good store, it's an event,\" said Foran, who will be on a plane from 2 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving visiting stores and monitoring the sales. \"It's a proxy for stores. If you run good stores, people will want to go them.\"\n\n-- CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed reporting."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Andrea Park", "title": "Carrie Underwood reveals baby's sex at CMA Awards", "description": "Carrie Underwood continued a pregnancy tradition at the CMA Awards Wednesday night", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrie-underwood-reveals-babys-sex-at-the-cma-awards/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/b660c09f-226a-4184-95e1-763ea5d86ce6/thumbnail/1200x630g2/880f9002ce0f42114243fc92234155de/gettyimages-1061534034.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:11:29Z", "content": "Carrie Underwood continued a pregnancy tradition at the CMA Awards on Wednesday.

Argo believes its technology would have avoided the crash.\n\n\"I'm very confident that the car will do the right thing just because of how we've designed the system,\" said Argo CEO Bryan Salesky.\n\nThat's important, said CNET Road Show's Tim Stevens, because this could be the future not only for Ford, but for transportation in general.\n\n\"I don't think you necessarily need to be first, but you certainly need to have a plan in place and some technology in place,\" Stevens said.\n\nThe next phase will be to expand autonomous operations to a second city -- Washington, D.C. Eventually, Ford plans to put passengers in the back seat and begin autonomous deliveries."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Man pleads guilty in hoax \"SWATting\" call that turned deadly", "description": "\"SWATting\" is a form of retaliation sometimes used by gamers in which a false report sends police to an opponent's home", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tyler-barriss-pleads-guilty-in-hoax-swatting-call-that-turned-deadly/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/2103dfc2-ff77-4c00-89b0-66d4d4c2ac53/thumbnail/1200x630/000fc7cde069130399c2dd9844115f82/tyler-barriss.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:49:02Z", "content": "WICHITA, Kan. -- A California man pleaded guilty Tuesday to making a hoax call that ultimately led police to fatally shoot a Kansas man following a dispute between two online gamers over a $1.50 bet in a Call of Duty WWII video game.

Barriss, 26, admitted to making the false report resulting in a death, as well as cyberstalking and conspiracy related to the deadly \"SWATting\" calls in Kansas. The deal with prosecutors will send him to prison for between 20 and 25 years, if the judge accepts it. He had previously pleaded not guilty in Kansas.\n\n\"SWATting\" is a form of retaliation sometimes used by gamers, who call police and make a false report to send first responders to an online opponent's address.\n\nKWCH\n\nAs part of the plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Barriss pleaded guilty to a total of 51 charges that included federal charges initially filed in California and the District of Columbia related to other fake calls and threats.\n\nDefense attorney Richard Federico told the court his client is accepting responsibility and is attempting to \"clear the deck\" of all federal charges.\n\nBarriss, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, stood with his hands folded in front of him as he entered his pleas.\n\n\"Without ever stepping foot in Wichita, the defendant created a chaotic situation that quickly turned from dangerous to deadly,\" U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said in a news release. \"His reasons were trivial and his disregard for the safety of other people was staggering.\"\n\nIn the case from the District of Columbia, Barriss pleaded guilty to two counts for making hoax bomb threats in phone calls to the headquarters of the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the California case, he pleaded guilty to 46 counts for making false reports that bombs were planted at high schools, universities, shopping malls, and television stations. He called from Los Angeles to emergency numbers in Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Massachusetts, Illinois, Utah, Virginia, Texas, Arizona, Missouri, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Michigan, Florida and Canada.\n\nHis sentencing was set for Jan. 30.\n\nAlso charged as co-conspirators in the federal case in Kansas are online gamers Casey Viner, 18, of North College Hill, Ohio, and Shane Gaskill, 20, of Wichita. They have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice, wire fraud and other counts. Their trial is scheduled for Jan. 8 in U.S. District Court in Wichita.\n\nViner allegedly became upset at Gaskill while playing the popular online game. Authorities say Viner then asked Barriss of Los Angeles to \"SWAT\" Gaskill at an address that Gaskill had previously provided him.\n\nBarriss is accused of calling Wichita police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017, to report a shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita address. Authorities say Barris researched the address Viner had given him for Gaskill and verified it was a home. When Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he began communicating with Barriss through direct messages in which he also gave him that same old address and dared him to \"SWAT\" him.\n\n\"Please try some s---. I'll be waiting,\" Gaskill wrote in the direct messages cited in the indictment.\n\nA police officer responding to the call fatally shot the new resident Andrew Finch, 28, after he opened the door.\n\nIt is unclear what will become of separate state charges. Barriss is scheduled for a separate Jan. 7 trial in Sedgwick County District Court on state charges of involuntary manslaughter, giving a false alarm and interference with a law enforcement officer."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Facebook reportedly delayed revealing Russia's election interference", "description": "Facebook is facing renewed public scrutiny after a New York Times investigation revealed the company delayed sharing evidence of Russia-linked activity on the site prior to the 2016 election.

He had observed miners eating pepperoni with bread, and decided to combine the two, to make it more portable. The bakery he founded, Country Club Bakery, is still in operation today.\n\nHomemade Pepperoni Rolls\n\nRecipe by Emily Hilliard, adapted from Kendra Bailey Morris\n\nMakes about 20 rolls, depending on size\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the rolls:\n\n1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast\n\n1\u20442 cup warm water\n\n1\u20442 cup plus 1\u20442 teaspoon sugar\n\n1-2 white potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces\n\n1\u20442 cup unsalted butter, very soft\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1 egg\n\n7-8 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1-1\u20442 (about 1 pound) pepperoni stick, cut into thin slices\n\nFor the glaze:\n\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n\n2 teaspoons sugar\n\n1 large egg\n\nInstructions:\n\nIn a small bowl, combine yeast, warm water, and 1\u20442 teaspoon sugar until yeast dissolves. Let stand at room temperature for 45 minutes until foamy.\n\nWest Virginia University Press\n\nMeanwhile, place potatoes in a pot with at least three cups of water (enough to make approximately 2 1\u20442 cups leftover potato water) and cook until tender.\n\nPulse cooked potatoes and 2 1\u20442 cups potato water in a blender. Add the 1\u20442 cup sugar, butter, and salt, blending well. Add the egg and blend 5 seconds more. Let mixture cool to lukewarm.\n\nOnce cool, pour potato mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitting with the paddle attachment, mixing in the yeast. Slowly add 4 cups of flour and beat until smooth. Add 3-4 more cups of flour and knead until the dough is fairly stiff but still a little sticky. Place dough in a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or overnight. (Note: the dough will keep in the fridge for 5 to 6 days. Be sure to push down the dough at least once per day.)\n\nWhen you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Turn dough onto a floured board and cut into quarters. Continue to cut into roughly 20 small pieces. Take a piece of the dough and push it flat into a rectangle. Place 2-3 slices of pepperoni in the middle (overlapping and not stacking) and roll, pinching the ends of the dough to hold the pepperoni inside. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat until you've used up all of your dough and pepperoni.\n\nIn a small saucepan, melt the butter and sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Add your egg and mix well. Brush tops of the rolls with this mixture, then bake them until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Norton), believes the classic key lime pie originated not in the Florida Keys, but in a test kitchen at the Borden condensed milk company in New York City, where it was made with lemons. (The limes were a later Florida variation.)\n\nShe writes: \"Homemade graham crackers and stovetop condensed milk give my Key lime pie a freshness you won't find in other recipes, and a more balanced sweetness. From the earthy crunch of the crust to the tangy yet creamy filling, these DIY ingredients take the pie to the next level.\"\n\nStella Parks' Magic Key Lime Pie\n\nActive time: 15 minutes plus 4-hour refrigeration\n\nMakes one 9-inch pie, 8 to 12 servings\n\nIngredients:\n\nKey Lime Custard:\n\n\n\n1/2 cup | 5 ounces egg yolks (from about 8 large eggs)\n\n2 Tablespoons lime zest\n\n3/4 cup | 6 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice (from 1 pound or 6 to 9 large supermarket limes)\n\n1 recipe Quick Condensed Milk, at room temperature (see below)\n\n1 fully-baked Graham Cracker Crumb Crust (see below)\n\nWhipped Cream:\n\n\n\n1/4 cup | 2 ounces sugar\n\n1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)\n\n3/4 cup | 6 ounces heavy cream\n\nInstructions:\n\nW.W. Norton\n\nPrepare the custard: In a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, whisk together egg yolks, lime zest, juice, and Quick Condensed Milk. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking gently, until the custard is steaming hot, about 5 minutes (or 125\u00b0F). Increase heat to medium and continue cooking until custard begins to bubble, about 5 minutes more (it won't seem terribly thick).\n\nPour into the prepared crust and refrigerate, uncovered, until cold and firm, at least 4 hours. (Covered loosely in plastic at this point, the pie can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\n\nFinish the pie:\n\nTo make the whipped cream, combine sugar, salt, and cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on medium-low speed for a minute to dissolve the sugar, then increase to medium-high and whip until the cream is thick and stiff, about 5 minutes.\n\nTransfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip and pipe decorative stars or swirls around the edges of the pie. Cut into wedges with a chef's knife, wiping the blade clean between slices. Loosely covered in plastic, leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.\n\nMake ahead: In a glass or ceramic container (not metal or plastic), the lime zest and juice can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. The most delicate citrus compounds will be altered by cooking, so extreme freshness isn't as important here compared to raw applications.\n\nQuick Condensed Milk\n\nHomemade sweetened condensed milk traditionally requires ultra-low heat and up to 6 hours of constant stirring, but with a splash of heavy cream added to prevent scorching, I can crank up the heat and be done in 45 minutes. The result is thicker, creamier, and more luscious than anything from a can, with a rich dairy flavor and subtle notes of caramel. If you like chai tea, be sure to try the cinnamon-spiced variation.\n\nYield: 2 cups\n\nIngredients:\n\n4 cups (32 ounces) milk (any percentage will do)\n\n\u00be cup (6 ounces) heavy cream\n\n1 cup sugar\n\n1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)\n\nInstructions:\n\nCombine milk, cream, sugar and salt in a 50-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat-resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it's almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scales, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started,\n\nPour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to one month. To mimic the consistency of canned milk, bring to room temperature before using.\n\nGraham Cracker Crumb Crust\n\nCombine 2 cups (9 ounces) of finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) melted unsalted butter.

The agency also announced Thursday that it will impose new restrictions on the sales of flavored e-cigarettes in retail stores, limiting them to closed-off areas that are inaccessible to minors.\n\nThe proposal still has to go through several regulatory phases and it could be years before the rules take effect, but it's a move advocates have been urging for years.\n\nWhy menthol?\n\nWhile traditional cigarettes contribute to serious health issues, including an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, and an early death, adding menthol to them comes with additional concerns.\n\nA 2013 report from the FDA concluded that menthol is associated with increased addiction. Due to its cooling effects, menthol reduces the harshness of cigarette smoke, making it more appealing and easier for new smokers to pick up the habit and get hooked.\n\nThe FDA also points out that younger people have the highest rate of smoking menthol cigarettes. \"More than half (54 percent) of youth smokers ages 12-17 use menthol cigarettes, compared to less than one-third of smokers ages 35 and older,\" the agency reported, adding that the rate is even higher among African-American youth: 7 out of 10 young black smokers select menthol cigarettes.\n\n\"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes,\" FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Thursday. \"The menthol serves to mask some of the unattractive features of smoking that might otherwise discourage a child from smoking.\"\n\nPaul Sakuma / AP\n\nIn addition to concerns about young people, health advocates have long been concerned about the impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community. Research shows that 85 percent of all African-American smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, compared to just 29 percent of whites.\n\nAccording to the NAACP's Youth Against Menthol Campaign, the tobacco industry \"intentionally markets to youth and African American communities to attract new 'replacement' smokers and keep current smokers addicted.\"\n\nActivists contend this is reflected in higher levels of nicotine dependence in the African-American community, as well as higher death rates. According to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, research shows that while African-American smokers are more likely than white smokers to have made an attempt to quit and to have used counseling services in the previous year, they are less likely to successfully quit smoking. The campaign also estimates that by 2020, 4,700 excess deaths in the African-American community will be attributable to menthol cigarettes, and that 460,000 African-Americans will have started smoking because of menthol cigarettes.\n\nLincoln Mondy is an activist and filmmaker behind \"Black Lives / Black Lungs,\" a short film exploring all the routes the tobacco industry took to target the black community. He said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" regarding the news that the FDA plans to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes.\n\n\"The tobacco industry has a well-documented history of infiltrating the black community with menthol products,\" Mondy told CBS News. \"The industry has poured billions into political activity, philanthropic donations, and predatory marketing. This news signals that the industry may no longer enjoy unfettered access to devastate entire communities.\"\n\nIn a joint statement released last week, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Heart Association, American Lung Association and Truth Initiative called the FDA's expected action on menthol cigarettes \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"There is overwhelming scientific evidence that menthol cigarettes have had a profound adverse effect on public health in the United States, resulting in more death and disease from smoking,\" the organizations said.\n\nFDA targeting e-cigarettes\n\nThe FDA is also expanding its crackdown on e-cigarettes, proposing new restrictions on sales of flavored vaping products on the grounds that they are highly addictive and have become hugely popular with minors.\n\nThough stopping short of banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations -- as was expected based on earlier reports last week -- the FDA's proposal would limit the sale of these products in retail stores to closed-off areas that are inaccessible to minors. The proposal does not include mint and menthol flavors of e-cigarettes, though Gottlieb notes he will revisit this if evidence shows that kids' use of mint or menthol e-cigs isn't declining. The FDA will still allow all flavored e-cigarettes to be sold online.\n\nExperts say these products, with flavors like mango and fruit, are particularly concerning because of their appeal to young people.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said. \"This is a large pool of future risk. ... The data make unmistakably clear that, if we're to break the cycle of addiction to nicotine, preventing youth initiation on nicotine is a paramount imperative.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement praising the FDA's actions but calling for further steps to protect children from tobacco products.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions announced today by FDA preventing flavored e-cigarettes from being sold at certain brick and mortar storefronts, teens will still find ways to access them,\" the doctors' group said. \"E-cigarette products that appeal to children have no business in the marketplace, period. FDA must take stronger action to protect young people. Pediatricians will not rest until these dangerous products are off the market and out of the hands of children and adolescents.\"\n\nIn September, the FDA set a 60-day deadline for several major e-cigarette companies to prove they could keep these products away from kids or risk having them pulled off the market.\n\nOn Tuesday, Juul Labs, which holds more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market share and has become overwhelmingly popular with minors, announced it will stop selling its flavored nicotine pods, including mango, fruit, creme, and cucumber, at more than 90,000 retail stores nationwide. These products will still be available for sale online, but the company will impose additional age-verification measures and third-party verification to block sales to anyone under age 21.\n\nJuul also announced it was shutting down some of its social media accounts, which are popular with young people."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Recipe: Totchos", "description": "Food blogger and tater tot advocate Dan Whalen offers the dish that started the tot renaissance", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/recipe-totchos-dan-whalen/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/4506f046-a052-4109-abec-849bbe114ebb/thumbnail/1200x630/45865104e7d9ba3bd6ea7420aaf2b498/totchos-promo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:30:37Z", "content": "From Dan Whalen comes the dish that started the tot renaissance.

Add the lime juice and the salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate the pico de gallo until ready to use (up to 3 days).\n\nWorkman\n\nMake the guacamole: Scoop the avocado into a medium-size bowl and mash with a fork. Add 2 tablespoons of the pico, along with the lime juice. Stir and add salt to taste. Cover with plastic wrap touching the surface of the guacamole and refrigerate until ready to use (up to 1 day).\n\nMake the totchos: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a plate with paper towels.\n\nHeat the oil in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and swirl to coat. Add the tots to the skillet in batches of about 20, so as not to crowd the pan, and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Gently stir and toss the tots, being careful not to break them, until they are browned on all sides and crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer the cooked tots to the prepared plate and repeat with the remaining tots.\n\nWhen the final batch of tots is just about browned, pile the rest of the cooked tots back into the skillet. Top evenly with the cheese and pickled jalape\u00f1os and transfer the skillet to the oven. Bake until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.\n\nRemove the skillet from the oven and top the totchos with the pico, guac, and sour cream. Serve immediately right in the skillet with a big serving spoon and plates and forks for everyone to dig in. Remember that the skillet is hot!\n\nVariation:\n\nTo scale this recipe up for a crowd, double the pico de gallo and guacamole. Use 4 pounds of tots and divide them between 2 sheet pans (18\" x 13\"). Double the cheese, pickled jalape\u00f1os, and sour cream.

The auto club warned that drivers shouldn't think that the systems make their vehicles self-driving, and that they should always be ready to take control.\n\nAAA also said that use of the word \"pilot\" by automakers in naming their systems can make some owners believe the vehicles can drive themselves.\n\n\"These systems are made as an aid to driving, they are not autonomous, despite all of the hype around vehicle autonomy,\" said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering. \"Clearly having 'pilot' in the name may imply a level of unaided driving, which is not correct for the current state of the development of these systems.\"\n\nThe test results released Thursday come after several highly publicized crashes involving Tesla vehicles that were operating on the company's system named \"Autopilot.\" The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating some of the crashes, including a March fatality that involved a Model X that struck a freeway barrier near Mountain View, California.\n\nThe AAA findings are the second tests showing that the systems can't handle every situation in real-world driving, including some that are relatively common. In August, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released tests that showed similar problems to the AAA study.\n\nThe auto club tested the systems on four vehicles that had adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. Vehicles tested included the 2018 Mercedes-Benz S Class, the 2018 Nissan Rogue, a 2017 Tesla Model S and a 2019 Volvo XC40. In addition to Tesla's Autopilot, Volvo calls its system \"Pilot Assist,\" while Nissan's is named \"ProPilot Assist.\n\nAAA said all four vehicles drifted out of lanes and hugged lane markers, struggling with moderate traffic, curved roads and streets with busy intersections. Three of the four would have failed to avoid a crash when the vehicle ahead of them changed lanes and a simulated stopped vehicle was ahead.\n\n\"As a result we had to take evasive action,\" said Brannon. He wouldn't identify the vehicles that failed to stop in time.\n\nThe vehicles' owner's manuals say that spotting a stationary vehicle after a lead vehicle changes lanes is a design limitation for the systems, Brannon said. But he said researchers expected the vehicles to see stopped vehicles and react in time.\n\nAutomakers generally say that the systems are designed to supplement a human driver and they make it clear the vehicles don't drive themselves.\n\nNissan said its system name contains the word \"assist,\" showing that it's designed to help the driver.\n\n\"Mercedes-Benz has always stressed that this technology is designed to assist the driver, not to encourage customers to ignore their responsibilities as drivers,\" the automaker said in a statement.\n\nTesla said that it reminds drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. \"Tesla has always been clear that Autopilot doesn't make the car impervious to all accidents,\" the company said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nBrannon said that despite their shortcomings, the systems have great potential to save lives and stop crashes from happening. \"Anything that can serve as a backstop to a good driver is going to enhance the safety of the system, of the driver,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Recipe: Chicken Tot Pie", "description": "A twist on one of the most classic comfort foods there is", "url": "http://feeds.cbsnews.com/~r/CBSNewsSundayMorning/~3/_eGZVgVMq5U/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:25:04Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "What you need to know about the Florida recounts", "description": "Races in the state for governor and U.S. senator are deadlocked in a series of legal battles over recounts", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-florida-recounts/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/25/9d5b3eca-d605-4e66-b6c5-a7c1ec5417db/thumbnail/1200x630/ae12c82a5564472c6adfe363066e583d/gettyimages-1053055226.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:24:47Z", "content": "Florida faces a 3 p.m. deadline Thursday to complete the machine recount of the U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races, while half a dozen lawsuits over the election are being waged in Tallahassee.

Rick Scott and Sen. Bill Nelson, as well as the agriculture commissioner race moved on to another recount Thursday.\n\nBut Nelson's path to victory narrowed significantly Friday morning when Judge Mark Walker ruled that guidelines provided by Florida law to election canvassing boards as to how to determine voter intent in a manual recount are constitutional. Walker also denied a request for Scott to recuse himself from election matters.\n\nHere's a rundown on the latest developments.\n\nMachine recount completed\n\nFlorida's deadline for the machine recount was 3 p.m. Thursday, and while most of the 67 counties finished and submitted the new results in time, Broward County missed the deadline by two minutes, submitting its machine recount at 3:02 p.m. The state rejected Broward's submission.\n\n\"Since Broward did not meet the deadline required by law, the first unofficial returns take the place of the second unofficial returns,\" the Department of State said in a statement Thursday. Now, the initial results submitted on Saturday will be considered instead.\n\n\n\nBroward Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes has faced sharp criticism for her handling of the midterm elections. Among other reasons, Broward's votes were counted more slowly than the majority of the other counties in the state. People on social media have been harassing Snipes, posted Snipes' home address and phone number sites including Facebook.\n\nPalm Beach County also failed to make the 3 p.m. deadline and submitted its original results instead. Its tallying machines overheated, causing mismatched results with the recount of 174,000 early voting ballots and forcing staffers to redo their work.\n\nHillsborough County, too, chose to submit its original results, rather than its machine recount. Craig Latimer, the elections supervisor for Hillsborough, said the county's recount came up with 846 fewer votes than the first count, according to the Tampa Bay Times .\n\n\"We are not willing to accept that votes go unreported,\" Latimer said, in explaining why the county submitted its original count to the Department of State.\n\nVoting irregularity claims\n\nThe Florida secretary of state alleges voting irregularities occurred in four counties, including Broward. The Florida Department of State on Friday asked U.S. attorneys to investigate the irregularities, attaching an example that appeared to show a Florida Democratic Party volunteer advising a mail-in voter to deliver a voter affadavit by 5 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 8, two days after the election. However, that information was incorrect, since the affadavits were due on the day before the election, on Nov. 5.\n\nFour county supervisors turned over information that showed Democratic Party operatives changed official forms to say that voters had until two days after the election to fix any problems with mail-in ballot signatures. Under current law, a voter has until the day before Election Day to fix a problem.\n\nThe legal battles\n\nWalker ruled Thursday that voters whose mail-in or provisional ballots were rejected because the signatures didn't match those on file will now have until Saturday at 5 p.m. to fix their ballots. Soon after the ruling, Scott appealed it.\n\nIn granting the preliminary injunction, Walker wrote that the issue \"is whether Florida's law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures\u2014with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection\u2014 passes constitutional muster. The answer is simple. It does not.\"\n\nDemocrats and Nelson argued that rejecting the ballots without standards for fixing them violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. They wanted all the voided ballots to be counted, a proposal rejected by Walker.\n\nThe state of Florida argued that Nelson had waited too long to file the suit and that delaying the results would cause irreparable harm.\n\nState officials said the matching requirement led to the voiding of nearly 4,000 ballots, although that figure did not include larger counties such as Miami-Dade, and it is smaller than the margin of about 13,000 votes separating Scott and Nelson. That's a margin of 0.15 percent. Should that margin hold, there will be a hand recount, and the deadline for that is currently Sunday. It is not clear how or whether the court's extension will affect Thursday's deadline for the machine recount.\n\nWalker ruled on Thursday afternoon in another case denying a request by the Nelson campaign to extend the machine recount deadline for all 67 counties in Florida.\n\nWhere it goes from here\n\nGillum is still calling for every legal vote to be counted by the state. \"As today's unofficial reports and recent court proceedings make clear, there are tens of thousands of votes that have yet to be counted,\" he said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We plan to do all we can to ensure that every voice is heard in this process. Voters need to know that their decision to participate in this election, and every election, matters. It is not over until every legally casted vote is counted.\"\n\nScott agreed to step down from the state panel responsible for certifying the final results. Scott has also suggested fraud may be taking place in some counties. Critics have said Scott should have no role in overseeing the election given his close contest.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida and another group had filed a lawsuit that sought to remove Scott from any official control over the election. Scott appoints the state's chief election official responsible for ordering recounts.

Along the way, Amazon reaped something from more than 200 cities who submitted proposals to house the new headquarters that might be even more valuable: Data. Lots of it.\n\nIn its 14-month search for HQ2, Amazon received 238 proposals from cities hoping to lure the online retailer, with the promise of 50,000 jobs and billions of dollars in investments. Those bids included exhaustive data about nearly every aspect of civic life, including zoning codes, land ownership, population demographics, mass transit ridership, infrastructure plans, the progress of development projects and much more.\n\nFor a company looking to expand its empire with new facilities \u2013 and to find new ways to reach customers faster \u2013 that data could prove priceless.\n\n\"I think they had this in mind from day one,\" Richard Florida, a University of Toronto urban studies professor who tracked the HQ2 process, told CBS News. \"This was about crowdsourcing data ... This was never about an individual HQ2.\"\n\nFlorida called the bidding process a \"game\" that gave Amazon leverage on cities it could use for future business opportunities, even if those cities had little chance of winning the second headquarters.\n\nIndeed, some smaller cities that didn't meet the company's criteria for HQ2, such as a having population of at least 1 million people, submitted bids anyway in hopes of attracting Amazon's attention. And some cities that made the list of 20 finalists \u2013 like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis \u2013 did not meet requirements like mass transit, but Amazon still engaged them through the final parts of the process and collected more information.\n\nIt's impossible to know the full scope of city data that Amazon picked up, since most cities have kept their bids secret. But the few that released them give an idea of what Amazon learned thanks to HQ2.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area bid included chapters on the region's education, transit and housing demographics, along with encyclopedic entries about every potential place where HQ2 could go. The Camden, New Jersey proposal detailed billion-dollar infrastructure improvement projects that are in the works, some of which are years away from completion. The bid from Boston provided the most minute details about the city's residents, such as how many live near a park and how many walk to work.\n\nBeyond this, Amazon also learned how far cities will go to woo the company \u2014 something it can use the next time it wants to expand operations. The bids laid out the incentive packages that Amazon would get from the cities, and the two eventual winners were not even the most generous. Newark, New Jersey, offered Amazon incentives worth $7 billion, the largest in state history and of any city in the bidding process.\n\nThe HQ2 announcement came with something of a consolation prize for Nashville, Tennessee, which will house an operations center expected to bring as many as 5,000 jobs. The next time Amazon looks for another center, it already knows some of the most valuable information it would need.\n\n\"They know cities' best and final offers for HQ2,\" Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin government professor and coauthor of \"Incentives to Pander: How Politicians Use Corporate Welfare for Political Gain,\" told CBS News. Amazon also has \"personal contacts at economic development\" in these cities and knows \"the limit\" of what it can expect from them, Jensen said.\n\nSome cities even made clear that they would shuffle their own governments for Amazon's approval. Boston said it would set up an \"Amazon Task Force\" of city employees who would work on Amazon's behalf. Fresno, California, proposed putting most of the money generated by Amazon into a fund that would be overseen by both city officials and Amazon officers, who would decide how to spend it. The mayor of Stonecrest, Georgia, suggested creating a city called Amazon and installing Jeff Bezos as a permanent mayor.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Amazon said, \"Economic incentives were one factor in our decision \u2014 but attracting top talent was the leading driver.\" The company also said that it has announced more than 6,000 jobs in locations that submitted bids for HQ2 but were not selected. An Amazon representative said the company will not use any data from cities to target customers for products or advertisements."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Caitlin O'Kane", "title": "Students buy colorblind teacher special glasses so he can see color for first time", "description": "Alabama teacher is directing a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" \u2013 and he's never seen the colors of the rainbow before", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/students-buy-colorblind-teacher-special-glasses-so-he-can-see-color-for-the-first-time/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/84ff8d24-25d9-4ce0-bae4-af276341d079/thumbnail/1200x630/2aef9c16e98abdf7e0c140875755c9dc/untitled-collage-54.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:03:08Z", "content": "A high school choir director from Alabama walked into a balloon-filled auditorium and was shocked by a life-changing gift from his students.

I couldn't really hold it in,\" he said. \"The only thing I tried to say to as many of them as possible was that I loved them and how grateful I was, and that was about the only words I was able to get out at the time.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Why Iran executed the \"Sultan of Coins\" for hoarding gold", "description": "Islamic Republic's currency has plummeted under U.S. sanctions with Trump's withdrawal from nuke deal, and regime is cracking down on hoarders", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-executes-sultan-of-coins-economic-crisis-us-sanctions-trump-nuclear-deal/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/92adb0b8-d316-4a0a-b664-d598e9071dba/thumbnail/1200x630g8/2346a980c0ae062179e1cd5f5fbc3877/iran-gold-coins-ap-18255455165237.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:59:53Z", "content": "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran executed the so-called \"Sultan of Coins\" and his accomplice on Wednesday for hoarding gold coins and other hard currency, signaling zero tolerance as it tries to shore up its currency in the face of an economic crisis.

Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith made the remark in a video that surfaced Sunday. She praised a cattle rancher at a Nov. 2 campaign event in Tupelo by saying: \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\"\n\nMississippi has a history of racially motivated lynchings.\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy said Wednesday in Jackson that Hyde-Smith's comment was \"hurtful and harmful.\"\n\n\"It was hurtful to Mississippians of good will who know better,\" said Espy, who is seeking to become Mississippi's first black U.S. senator since Reconstruction. \"But it was also harmful because it reinforced all these negative stereotypes \u2014 the stereotypes that I've been working all my life to try to overcome.\"\n\nHyde-Smith, the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, said in a statement Sunday that the hanging comment was an \"exaggerated expression of regard\" for a supporter and \"any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\"\n\nShe would not answer reporters' repeated questions about it Monday during a news conference at the Mississippi Republican Party headquarters.\n\n\"That was curious what she said. But even more than that, after being asked six times to explain it, clarify, whatever, she didn't,\" said Espy, who spoke to reporters after appearing at a luncheon sponsored by a nonpartisan group called Working Together Jackson.\n\nHyde-Smith was also invited to the luncheon, but she was in Washington because the Senate is in session. Her campaign did not respond to Espy's criticism Wednesday.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy are competing in a Nov. 27 runoff, and the winner will get the final two years of a six-year term started by Republican Thad Cochran.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to temporarily succeed Cochran when the longtime lawmaker retired in April.\n\nDemocrats haven't won a U.S. Senate seat in Mississippi since 1982, and Republicans hold most statewide offices. Both national parties are putting money and effort into the special election. Hyde-Smith and Espy each received about 41 percent in a four-person field Nov. 6 to advance to the runoff.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has endorsed Hyde-Smith and traveled to Mississippi to campaign for her in October. A person with knowledge of White House thinking who is not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that the White House is looking at holding a rally in Mississippi before the runoff, but plans are still not definite.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is scheduled to campaign for Espy on Saturday in Mississippi, Harris' spokeswoman said.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Espy and his twin sister, Michelle, were among the 17 black students who integrated what had been a white public high school in their hometown of Yazoo City.\n\n\"It was W.E.B. Dubois that said the issue of the 20th century was the issue of the color line,\" Espy said Wednesday. \"So, now it seems the issue of the 21st century is also the problem of the color line. I know here in Mississippi, we've had these issues all of my life. I was (called) the N word in high school because my twin sister and I \u2014 we were 17 black students in a student body of 800.\"\n\nEspy in 1986 became Mississippi's first black U.S. House member since Reconstruction. In 1993 and 1994, he was U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\nSpeaking of Hyde-Smith's \"public hanging\" remark, Espy said some politicians think apologizing is a form of weakness.\n\n\"I really think it's a sign of strength,\" Espy said. \"I mean, nobody's perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. When you make mistakes, you've got to own up to it, and you ought to say, 'I'm sorry.'\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Crews recover more wildfire victims with dozens still unaccounted for", "description": "California officials say they've identified most of the 59 people known to have died in devastating wildfires", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/fires-in-california-camp-woolsey-paradise-wildfire-evacuations-death-toll-map-2018-11-15-latest/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/3b9b3370-143d-49c8-a14f-3826df0a49b0/thumbnail/1200x630g1/1f14b9145a3333db7915f9c8fedcd01a/california-wildfires-1061531612.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:49:49Z", "content": "CBS Los Angeles teamed up with the Los Angeles Rams and the United Way to raise money for victims of the massive wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and Wednesday's day-long effort brought in more than $1.1 million.

Buses will probably get a little bit slower. There are going to be more people traveling at a specific time of day to a specific place,\" said Eric Guerra, assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. \"But at the same time, they will create a lot of jobs where people are.\"\n\nLong Island City, the New York City neighborhood that will be home to one of the new headquarters, sits across the river from the busy world of midtown Manhattan. The growing area is crisscrossed by subways and buses and surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The other headquarters will be in the Washington suburb of Arlington in northern Virginia, a part of the country known for its mind-numbing traffic.\n\nAmazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices. Still, the complaining has already begun.\n\nAmong the sticking points: Amazon has won the rights to a helipad at its Long Island City location, allowing some senior executives to get through rush hour in style, though the company had to agree to limit landings to 120 per year.\n\n\"For the city and state to greenlight a helipad for the wealthiest man in the world and one of the richest corporations in the world is a slap in the face to all New Yorkers, but particularly the people in Queens who have to fight to get on the 7 train in the morning,\" said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents Long Island City. \"And furthermore, if there were 25,000 to 30,000 Amazon employees in Long Island City, that fight to get onto the train is going to get a lot more intense.\"\n\nRising commute times\n\n\n\nFrustration levels already are high among New York City subway riders. More than a quarter of residents spend more than an hour getting to work, and 57 percent ride public transit to commute, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nA key subway line that runs through Long Island City has been often criticized for delays, though long-awaited upgrades to allow trains to run more frequently are on track to finish as soon as this month, and a new ferry connection to Manhattan opened in August. Still, Van Bramer insisted the area isn't sufficiently well served, and there are complaints about noise pollution from helicopters and sea planes.\n\n\"The entire city is in a mass transit crisis, and nothing that I've seen about this deal makes me think it will help,\" New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said at a press conference Wednesday. \"Western Queens transit infrastructure is already strained, and the 7 train in particular is a mess every morning, so this definitely adds to existing transportation concerns.\"\n\nNew York City commuters have been clamoring for subway improvements for years, and some on Wednesday tweeted photos of packed subway stations near Amazon's proposed new office and reported having let several overcrowded trains go by before they were finally able to squeeze into one.\n\nStill, some see the dire warnings about New York's transit system as premature.\n\n\"Even as stressed as our system is right now, an investment in growth of this magnitude doesn't overwhelm the transportation network because it's such a robust and large system,\" said Tom Wright, president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy organization.\n\nFrequent fires\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C.'s subway system, which will serve Amazon's headquarters in Arlington's Crystal City, is at capacity on many lines and has serious maintenance problems, said Tom Rubin, a transportation consultant based in Oakland, California. Repair work to the subway station closest to Amazon's new office resulted in a disastrous commute last week as people missed flights and stood in long lines for buses that never arrived, said Thomas Cooke, professor of business law at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nFires have broken out so many times in Washington's Metro system that a developer created a Twitter account to automatically tweet suspected fires in stations.\n\n\"We have an embarrassing Metro system here that I hope will benefit by this relocation,\" Cooke said, adding that taxpayers will be footing the bill for the transit improvements that Virginia agreed to in its deal with Amazon.\n\nDevelopment along major highways in Northern Virginia and Washington have led to \"unreasonable traffic delays on a daily basis\" in the past few years, with drive times that used to take 40 minutes ballooning to up to 90 minutes, Cooke said.\n\nIn the nation's capital, more than a third of commuters ride public transit, and most spend at least a half-hour getting to work, according to the Census Bureau. Commuters in the suburbs surrounding Washington face even longer commute times.\n\nPrivate transit\n\n\n\nElsewhere, companies use van pools and private buses to entice talented employees who want to live in hipper neighborhoods away from their offices. Google and Yahoo began running private buses from downtown San Francisco and elsewhere to their headquarters in Silicon Valley more than a decade ago. In the Los Angeles area, Disney, Nickelodeon and Warner Bros. run shuttle buses to carry employees from public transit stations to their Burbank studios, said Keith Millhouse, a transportation consultant and principal at Millhouse Strategies.\n\nSome hoped Amazon would invest in transit upgrades as part of the deal. But it's hard to imagine Amazon volunteering to chip in for transit improvements when so many cities -- 238 submitted proposals -- were competing for the company's second headquarters, Guerra said.\n\n\"If anything, they're getting benefits out of it,\" the University of Pennsylvania's Guerra said. \"They're unlikely to be paying for new services.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "FBI probing American woman's death on Aruba-bound cruise ship", "description": "The FBI is investigating the mysterious death of an American woman aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean.

Mia Love sued to halt vote counting in the Utah race where she is trailing her Democratic challenger by a razor-thin margin, saying her campaign must be allowed to issue challenges if they dispute the validity of mail-in ballots.\n\nIn a contest where \"every single vote is crucial,\" the Love campaign claimed poll-watchers have seen a few cases where voter signatures on ballots accepted by election workers did not appear to match those on file in Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County.\n\nCounty attorneys pushed back in court documents, arguing state law gives the campaign no right to interrupt the vote count, and letting the campaign question signatures could violate voters' rights by revealing who they cast their ballots for.\n\nDemocratic challenger Ben McAdams, meanwhile, said the lawsuit \"smacks of desperation,\" and elections officials, not candidates, should decide what votes should count.\n\nLove's campaign is \"not accusing anyone of anything,\" but they believe a few instances deserve more scrutiny, campaign attorney Robert Harrington said in a statement. Voting is done primarily by mail in Utah.\n\nCounty Clerk Sherrie Swenson, a Democrat, said Love's campaign staff was granted access to observe the tallies but is not allowed to be interactive participants in the signature verification process. Results her office released Wednesday night sliced into McAdam's lead, putting Love less than half a percentage point behind him. Her campaign manager Dave Hansen cheered the news, saying she is on a \"path to victory.\"\n\nA judge is set to hear arguments on Thursday.\n\nMcAdams is leading Love by less than 900 votes as counting continued more than a week after Election Day. He is the mayor of Salt Lake County, where 85 percent of voters in the district live.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called out Love by name in a news conference last week where he bashed some fellow Republicans, saying she and others lost because they didn't fully embrace him. His comments came despite the outcome of the vote being in doubt.\n\nUtah law allows challenges to a voter's eligibility if they are suspected of trying to vote in someone else's name, but it is unclear how that applies to mail-in balloting recently adopted by most counties in the state. Utah Elections Director Justin Lee declined to comment.\n\nLove, who became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress in 2014, argues there must be a process for challenging a signature on an envelope swiftly, since after it's confirmed the ballot is permanently separated from the envelope to be tabulated. Salt Lake County has signaled it may complete its vote count by Thursday, the suit said.\n\nBut nothing in their petition shows any violation of election law in Salt Lake County, the county said in a motion asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nWhen tabulating mail-in ballots, county elections workers compare signatures to verify a voter's identity. If a worker decides a voter signature doesn't match the one on file, the person gets a letter informing them and asks them to sign and return an affidavit confirming their identity.\n\nIt's not the first lawsuit Swenson's office has faced from Republicans this election cycle. A few days before the vote, two GOP candidates accused her of failing to send thousands of ballots to voters in a timely manner, but the case was tossed out after a hearing.\n\nA similar lawsuit was filed in New Mexico on Tuesday by a Republican who lost her bid for a U.S. House seat. Yvette Herrell asked a county judge to impound absentee ballots so her campaign could inspect them after the county canvassing board certified that Democrat Xochitl Torres Small had won."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "First group from migrant caravans reaches U.S.-Mexico border", "description": "Mexican officials in Tijuana are scrambling to accomodate hundreds of Central Americans who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Several major property casualty insurers began hiring out private fire departments roughly a decade ago to protect their high-end clients.\n\nThis coverage comes with a high price tag, but it can be worth it given the death and destruction from the \"Camp Fire\" still burning in Northern California, as well as other mega-fires that have devastated the U.S. in recent years.\n\nJust this week, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's $60 million home in Hidden Hills, California, was saved from the Woolsey fire by a private firefighting force the couple hired.\n\n\"One of our clients had his house burned down,\" said Bruce Gendelman, chairman of a high-net worth insurance broker who sells policies for the PURE Group of Insurance Companies. \"But the two people next door didn't get out.\"\n\nThese high-end insurance policies have drawn criticism, with some noting that most homeowners can't afford them. In a city like Malibu in Southern California, an \"ultra deluxe\" policy would range from $2,500 to $8,000 a year depending on construction, fire protection systems, deductibles and a home's contents, among other factors. And while insurers normally refuse to discuss the cost of their policies, Gendelman said carriers typically only offer high-end fire protection on homes worth $2 million and up.\n\nBy contrast, the use of private fire services doesn't appear to have drawn complaints from CAL FIRE, California state department dedicated to fighting the infernos that have killed scores of people in the state, torched 1.5 million acres and wiped out entire communities.\n\n\"We always work with local authorities to make sure that our service is supplemental,\" said Frances O'Brien, who heads North American Personal Risk Services for Chubb. \"We are subject to the fire department's 'incident command,' take their direction and obey evacuation orders.\"\n\nChubb was one of the first insurers to enter the private fire fighting field in 2008, and might be considered the model for similar services. The Pure Group also has a Wildlife Mitigation Program that includes on-the-ground services by fire professionals.\n\nBoth companies offer the fire service as part of their policies in wildfire-prone states, while acknowledging the significantly higher costs. Pure Group bills itself as \"high net worth insurance\" that's \"not for everyone.\"\n\nAllianz, a German-based insurer, also offers \"proactive services to mitigate loss\" for its commercial clients, a spokesperson said. It partners with Consumer Fire Products Inc. (CFPI), a private company formed by firefighters in 1998 that describes itself as \"a brigade of trained fire professionals dedicated to wildfire property protection.\"\n\nSounding the alarm\n\nWhile the services offered by these insurers may be beyond the financial reach of many, the way they operate offers pointers to the millions of Californians and homeowners in 17 other U.S. states who live in fire zones. That starts with meeting with clients and inspecting the property to remove brush, firewood and anything flammable near the home. Sprinkler systems are appraised so that houses can be doused before blazing embers reach them.\n\n\"Insured locations are then patrolled by CFPI to take precautionary measures,\" the Allianz spokesperson said.\n\nAs fire appears on the horizon, the first response is one or more phone calls from the insurer telling the homeowner to take action to protect their property \u2013 or immediately evacuate, often suggesting a safe escape route. Then private fire crews arrive on the scene. Patio furniture, the most dangerous flammable, is removed and house vents are plugged so burning embers can't get in.\n\n\"Fire often burns a house from the inside out,\" Chubb's O'Brien said.\n\nIn addition to bringing their own water, the fire crew will spray red fire retardant around the house and on the roof, the same material dropped from planes on burning trees.\n\n\"It's environmentally safe and biodegradable,\" the Allianz spokesperson said. It also tells the local fire department that house has been protected.\n\nIn some cases, of course, even money can't buy protection.\n\n\"The 'Woolsey fire' moved so fast that it was impossible to get ahead of it,\" said Gendelman, referring to a Southern California blaze that has caused thousands to flee their homes and an evacuation in Malibu."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "With nowhere to go, fire evacuees set up camp in Walmart parking lot", "description": "For many who called Paradise home, the magnitude of this disaster is just starting to sink in", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-wildfires-paradise-camp-fire-residents-stay-walmart-parking-lot/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/ed421122-687b-499e-8459-a59267498b84/thumbnail/1200x630/63e79b1b7492b8dfcc36a811c370dfa5/nfa-villarreal-ca-fires-needs-tracks-frame-833.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:35:18Z", "content": "California officials say they've identified most of the 59 people known to have died in wildfires that started a week ago.

Saudi Al-Mojeb told journalists in a rare press conference in Riyadh on Thursday that Khashoggi's killers had set in motion plans for the killing on Sept. 29, three days before he was killed inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe prosecutor said the highest-level official behind the killing was Saudi former deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri, who has been fired for ordering Khashoggi's forced return. The prosecutor made no mention of the man who many have accused of ordering the murder, the Saudi king's son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Al-Assiri is thought to have been very close to the crown prince.\n\nThe prosecutor said 21 people were in custody, with 11 indicted and referred to trial.\n\nCBS News correspondent Holly Williams reported on Thursday the Saudi prosecutor also gave the kingdom's first official acknowledgement that Khashoggi's body was dismembered after he was killed inside the consulate -- though that is what Turkish officials have been saying for weeks.\n\nTurkey has blamed the highest ranks of power in Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's brutal death, saying the kingdom sent an assassination squad for him.\n\nSome in the U.S. intelligence community, and some senior U.S. lawmakers, have said they believe it is not credible to suggest a Saudi operative would have undertaken such a dramatic operation without approval from a top royal family member. Al-Assiri was known to be a close associate of Crown Prince Salman, who is widely suspected of having some role in the killing.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on Oct. 19 that al-Assiri could end up getting the blame for the alleged killing. CBS News was able to confirm that Saudi officials were considering blaming al-Assiri for the murder.\n\nAccording to the Saudi prosecutor, when Khashoggi arrived at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, a fight broke out, and he was roughed up and injected with a high dose of anesthetic which led to his demise. His body was then dismembered and moved outside the consulate building by five of the people in the team sent by al-Assiri.\n\nThe team then handed the body over to a local \"collaborator\" for disposal, the prosecutor said. Turkey has pressed Saudi officials to explain who this local person was, and where the journalist's body is now. Turkish media have said his body was likely dissolved in acid, prompting his widow to ask if his killers were even \"human beings.\"\n\nI'm unable to express my sorrow to learn about dissolving your body Jamal!

Previously officials had said he died as a result of asphyxiation during a \"fight\" in the consulate. The mention of a drug being administered was new on Thursday, and as Williams reported, it contradicts the previous official Saudi statement that the Washington Post contributor died in a fight.\n\nAs Williams noted, it took Saudi Arabia more than two weeks to acknowledge that Khashoggi was even killed, after first issuing angry denials.\n\nPressed by Williams at a news conference later Thursday in Riyadh over the kingdom's changing explanation of the killing, Saudi Foreign Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir insisted that the government had merely reported the information it was learning in the case as it gathered the facts.\n\nIn response to another question, Al-Jubeir denied that Crown Prince Salman had any knowledge of the operation which led to Khashoggi's killing, saying the blame rested entirely with the individuals named by the prosecution on Thursday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Alleged victims of predatory Dartmouth teachers break their silence", "description": "Women's accusations last year led to the ouster of three prominent professors in the psychology and brain sciences department at the school", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dartmouth-women-file-lawsuit-alleging-administrators-ignored-misconduct-complaints-for-more-than-a-decade/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/84f1d3de-531e-4aa8-bc25-c0f402d36b00/thumbnail/1200x630/4663fca9b54e73ce4c869b9bd48713dc/nfa-duncan-dartmouth-lawsuit-needs-gfx-frame-7565.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:01:20Z", "content": "Seven women filed a $70 million federal lawsuit Thursday morning accusing Dartmouth College officials of ignoring numerous complaints about sexual misconduct going back more than a decade.

Six of the plaintiffs in the class action suit spoke out for the first time to CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan.\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Vassiki Chauhan and 30-year-old Kristina Rapuano are budding cognitive neuroscientists. Chauhan is working on her PhD at Dartmouth and Rapuano received hers this year. Both said they were raped by former Dartmouth professors. It's something that's still difficult for them to process.\n\nWhile attending a conference in California in 2015, Rapuano alleges she was raped by William Kelley, a professor who had taken her under his wing.\n\n\"Essentially, I have no memory of this night,\" Rapuano said. \"I didn't even remember waking up\u2026.I had thought that I had just been drinking heavily. Now I'm unsure.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nAccording to Rapuano, Kelley told her they had sex. She had no memory of it. \"But I was very clear about how I didn't want that to ever happen again,\" she said.\n\nChauhan said she was raped last April at the home of Paul Whalen, another star professor.\n\n\"I tried to get out of the situation as soon as possible. It was only when he started reaching for more intimate parts of my body that I was unambiguous about the fact that this is not something I wanted,\" Chauhan said.\n\nKelley and Whalen resigned this summer after Dartmouth hired an outside investigator. A third professor, Todd Heatherton, retired. Dartmouth said the men did not receive any severance payments.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit filed Thursday morning, seven women, including Rapuano and Chauhan, say Dartmouth administrators knew about the \"animal house\" culture in the department since at least 2002. \"These professors leered at, groped, sexted, intoxicated, and even raped female students,\" according to the class action complaint.\n\nAnnemarie Brown, Andrea Courtney, Sasha Brietzke, and Marissa Evans are also plaintiffs. None of them felt supported when they went to administrators about what happened.\n\n\"These men had all of the power in the department. They controlled all of the resources\u2026.Opting out of the boys club culture meant that you were cut off from those resources,\" Andrea Courtney said.\n\nWhile at her first academic conference in March 2017, Sasha Brietzke said she was at a karaoke bar with other graduate students when an \"extremely intoxicated\" Todd Heatherton came in.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"He grabbed my butt and set me on his lap....And now I had been sexualized in front of a room full of potential colleagues. I felt humiliated and I felt extremely angry,\" Brietzke said.\n\nAnnemarie Brown was in her first year of graduate school when she says Paul Whalen \"openly bragged about retaliation\" to her.\n\n\"I was confused at the time,\" Brown said. \"But the line \u2013 of course you don't bite the hand that feeds you \u2013 was burned into my memory for all of graduate school, and it remained a constant threat.\"\n\nMarissa Evans said she took every course that William Kelley offered.\n\n\"He started to escalate all of those inappropriate text messages and make it more sexual\u2026.I would blow it off the best that I could, but when I did\u2026I was taken off of projects. I would get comments like, 'your honors thesis just got a lot harder,'\" Evans said.\n\nA Dartmouth spokesman told \"CBS This Morning\" they applaud the women for bringing the misconduct allegations to their attention last year. \"However, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth's actions in the complaint.\"\n\n\"It's really intimidating to come out as a victim rather than a brain scientist, which is what we went to Dartmouth to be,\" Chauhan said.\n\nAll of the women feel like their professional careers took a blow by speaking out.\n\n\"We've gotten a lot of professional feedback to just put our heads down and do science,\" Courtney said.\n\nAdded Brietzke, \"I lose sleep at night thinking of, like, all of the discoveries in science that haven't been made because women were driven out.\"\n\n\n\nThrough his attorney, Todd Heatherton denied ever having sex with students. He did admit he \"acted unprofessionally while intoxicated,\" for which he apologized. \"CBS This Morning's\" attempts to reach Kelley and Whalen were unsuccessful."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Brexit Secretary quits in massive blow to U.K. leader", "description": "Hours after PM Theresa May heralded progress in gaining her own cabinet's backing for her draft Brexit deal, the wheels appear to be coming off", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/britain-pm-theresa-may-brexit-secretary-dominic-raab-quits-uk-european-union/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/aafa49c1-27da-45cd-9d2e-6f68b79dcc44/thumbnail/1200x630/97a05d735c8d9d02e6f0456924db6471/theresa-may-1061489738.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:57:22Z", "content": "LONDON -- The morning after the night before was shaping up to be a rough one for British Prime Minister Theresa May.

On Wednesday night, she announced that she'd won her cabinet's backing for her draft proposal on how the U.K. should pull out of the European Union. On Thursday morning, May's Brexit secretary, the man who led her negotiating team in Brussels to hammer out that draft, quit, along with another member of her cabinet and several junior ministers.\n\nDominic Raab, the second of May's Brexit secretaries to quit the role in as many years, said the draft agreement reached with Brussels would effectively leave Britain beholden to the rules and regulations of the European Union and even give the EU the power to stop the U.K. from extricating itself down the road. He said he could not \"in good conscious support the terms\" of the deal he helped to craft.\n\nRaab wasn't the only member of May's government to walk out on Thursday. Her Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, Junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara, junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman, and parliamentary private secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also stepped down.\n\nAll indicated that they could not support the almost-600-page draft deal May presented on Wednesday, which is considered insufficient by both Brexit backers and those who wanted to remain in the EU.\n\nThe prime minister's team made some major concessions to the EU to achieve the draft deal: Britain, for example, would remain tied to the European Union's customs union -- subject to it's collective trading rules and tariffs -- during a transition period, and potentially for much longer.\n\nRaab said the agreement was unacceptable, and he could not support the so-called \"back-stop\" agreement in the draft, under which he said \"the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit\" the union.\n\n\"No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,\" Raab said.\n\n\"I believe with every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people,\" May said at a press conference late Thursday.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAs pro-Brexit Conservatives called for a no-confidence vote in their leader, a defiant May insisted Brexit meant making \"the right choices, not the easy ones\" and urged lawmakers to support the deal \"in the national interest.\"\n\n\"Am I going to see this through? Yes.\" May told reporters late Thursday.\n\nBut the resignations, less than a day after the Cabinet collectively backed the draft divorce agreement, weakened May and emboldened her rivals within her Conservative Party.\n\nParliament still needs to approve the deal and it is unclear whether May has the numbers to push it through, or whether she can even remain in office long enough to bring it to a vote.\n\nWith the ministers on Thursday joining 10 others who have resigned from May's government over the last year, talk of a challenge to her leadership was growing louder.\n\nOne of her most vocal opponents within the Conservative Party, leading hardline \"Brexiteer\" Jacob Rees-Mogg, ripped May on the floor of Britain's Parliament on Thursday over the draft, which he said failed to deliver on the party's promise to pull the U.K. out of the EU.\n\nHe said May's words and actions \"no longer match,\" and confirmed that he had filed a letter of \"no confidence\" in the prime minister as the leader of the party.\n\nIf 15 members of May's Conservative Party submit letters of no confidence in her, it will trigger an internal leadership election in the party, and if she is toppled in that race she would be forced to stand down as British Prime Minister.\n\n\"I cannot overstate the seriousness of the situation the prime minister now finds herself in,\" the opposition Labour Party's Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer told BBC News on Thursday. He said \"now there will be very serious attention to, 'what are the other alternatives.'\"\n\nTalk off another public vote\n\n\"All options need to be on the table, and that includes of option of campaigning for another vote,\" Starmer said, alluding to a growing movement in the U.K. public, and among lawmakers from all parties, for another public referendum on any Brexit proposal eventually finalized by parliament.\n\nCalls are mounting -- and fast, after May herself appeared to indicate on Wednesday night that Brexit wasn't inevitable -- for any hypothetical second referendum to include a \"no Brexit\" option.\n\nAfter months saying the choice facing Britain was either accept her deal with the EU, or crash out of the Union on March 29 with a \"no-deal\" Brexit, May admitted Wednesday that it was still possible the U.K. could remain in the union, in spite of her vows to uphold the will of the public which voted in 2016 to leave it.\n\nShe argued on Thursday that her draft agreement with the EU represented, \"the right choices, not the easy ones.\"\n\nMay was adamant that her government was not planning for any contingency that did not include a British exit of the European Union.\n\nPound hit hard by Brexit chaos\n\nThe British pound fell sharply on Thurday after Raab announced his resignation from the government.\n\nThe currency dropped 1 percent, a relatively large decline for an established currency, to $1.2870 within minutes of Raab's tweet announcing he could not support the proposal."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Aruba authorities probing American woman's death on Princess Cruises voyage", "description": "Investigators in Aruba reportedly looking at 52-year-old passenger's death as possible murder", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aruba-authorities-american-womans-death-princess-cruises-voyage-today-2018-11-15/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/15/75e98d62-5618-46ea-b94d-d149827b3e88/thumbnail/1200x630/5d5eaacf90a980e9835c3f96d3b95a85/royal-princess.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T08:53:01Z", "content": "Authorities are investigating the death of an American passenger on a Princess Cruises ship as it headed to Aruba early Tuesday, the cruise line says.

Roberto Moreno Ramos was condemned for the 1992 deaths of his 42-year-old wife Leticia, 7-year-old daughter Abigail, and 3-year-old son Jonathan at their home in Progreso, located along the Mexico border.\n\nWhen asked by the warden if he had a final statement, Ramos thanked the Mexican consulate for its assistance with appeals in his case and said he was grateful for \"the humane treatment I got in prison in Texas.\"\n\n\"I'm getting my gold watch that it took the governor 30 years to forge,\" he said. \"Thank you God. Lord, send me a chariot. I'm ready.\"\n\nAs the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began taking effect, Ramos took a couple of deep breaths, sputtered once and began snoring. Within seconds, all movement then stopped.\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice via AP\n\nEleven minutes later, at 9:36 p.m. CST, Ramos was pronounced dead.\n\nMexican officials had called for Ramos' execution to be stopped, arguing he was part of a group of Mexican citizens condemned in the U.S. who were never told when first arrested that they could get legal help from the Mexican government.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the punishment Wednesday night when it denied two appeals seeking to halt the execution. Ramos' attorney on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to stop his execution, arguing that Ramos' constitutional rights were violated as lower courts refused to fully review his claims that his trial lawyers failed to present any evidence about his mental illness and abusive childhood that could have persuaded jurors to spare his life.\n\nThree retired justices who had served on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals filed court documents with the Supreme Court on Wednesday in support of stopping the execution. The ex-judges alleged the appeals court appointed an incompetent appellate attorney who early in the post-conviction process failed to investigate Ramos' case.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a federal judge in Austin dismissed Ramos' request to temporarily block the execution. The request had been part of a lawsuit Ramos filed against the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals a day earlier. The suit alleged the appeals court had not allowed Ramos to present claims he had ineffective trial and appellate lawyers.\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously turned down requests to halt Ramos' execution.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday declined to recommend either a commutation of Ramos' sentence or a six-month reprieve.\n\nThe 64-year-old Ramos became the 21st inmate put to death this year in the U.S. and the 11th given a lethal injection in Texas, the nation's busiest capital punishment state.\n\nIn court documents, Ramos' appellate attorney, Danalynn Recer, had argued Ramos suffered from bipolar disorder most of his life, including during the time of his family's killings, as well as brain damage that affected his ability to control his impulses and regulate his emotions.\n\nRecer said Ramos was also brutally beaten as a child by his father.\n\nRamos was born in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and grew up in Guadalajara and Tijuana before his family moved to the United States in 1970.\n\n\"No fact-finder or decision-maker entrusted with Mr. Moreno Ramos' life has ever been provided with evidence of (his) 'diverse human frailties' to assist them in dispensing the most severe punishment under law,\" Recer said.\n\nBut the Texas Attorney General's Office said Ramos' death sentence was appropriate due to his \"violent and dangerous nature.\"\n\nAuthorities said Ramos bludgeoned his family members and then buried them underneath his home's bathroom floor so he could marry the woman he was having an extramarital affair with at the time.\n\nIn court filings, the attorney general's office highlighted testimony from Ramos' then-19-year-old son, who told jurors at Ramos' 1993 trial that his father \"would continue to commit criminal acts of violence.\"\n\nIn 2004, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, found Ramos was part of a group of 52 Mexican citizens awaiting execution in the U.S. who weren't advised of their consular rights under the Vienna Convention when first arrested. It recommended they be tried again to determine if consular access would have affected their cases. Then-President George W. Bush directed states to reopen the cases.\n\nBut the Supreme Court in 2008 overruled Bush's directive, saying only Congress can require states to follow the international court's ruling.\n\nIncluding Ramos, six Mexican citizens have been executed since being named in the international court ruling and all the executions were carried out by Texas, according to the Mexican government.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Challenges facing firefighters battling California's wildfires", "description": "The Camp Fire in northern California has become the deadliest wildfire in the state's history.

Broward's Supervisor of Elections Dr. Brenda Snipes insisted Wednesday her county had \"never missed a deadline,\" CBS Miami reports.\n\nMany counties have wrapped up their machine recount ahead of a Thursday deadline to complete reviews of the U.S. Senate and governor races, but larger Democratic strongholds are still racing to meet the deadline.\n\nWith so much at stake, Republicans are alleging voter fraud and Democrats are crying voter suppression, CBS News' Manuel Bojorquez reports. All of it a reminder of the messy 2000 presidential recount. Broward and Palm Beach counties are two of the most populated, and lean heavily Democratic and with the state politically even split razor-thin vote. margins are amplified.\n\nIn a key court battle related to the recount, a federal judge said he was unlikely to order election officials to automatically count thousands of mail-in ballots that were rejected because the signatures on the ballots did not match signatures on file. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, however, did say he was open to giving voters extra time to fix their ballots.\n\nCARLO ALLEGRI / REUTERS\n\nState officials said the matching requirement had led to the voiding of nearly 4,000 ballots, although that figure did not include larger counties such as Miami-Dade.\n\nWalker rebuffed arguments from lawyers representing the state that allowing people until Saturday evening to fix their ballots would disrupt the recount process and the deadlines to report results. The deadline for hand recounts is Sunday.\n\n\"I don't understand why it's going to completely bring Florida to its knees,\" Walker said.\n\nHe said that, divided among 67 counties, the number of ballots would be only a handful per county, and they'd be considered while the elections supervisors are still counting overseas ballots.\n\n\"What are the possibilities that all 5,000 are going to show up?\" Walker said if people are given an opportunity to correct their signatures. \"I can tell you the odds: Zero.\"\n\nIn Broward County, Snipes has faced strong criticism for the way she handled the midterm elections, CBS Miami reports. Facebook has confirmed that some people posted Snipes home address and phone number online.\n\n\"The sharing of personal information like this is not permitted on our platform and we have removed multiple instances of such information being shared. As we find similar instances, we will also remove those.\"\n\nFacebook statement\n\nMr. Trump also added to the grumblings about the recount by arguing without evidence that some people unlawfully participated in the election by dressing in disguise.\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Daily Caller published Wednesday. \"Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again.\"\n\nThe state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, both run by Republican appointees, have said they haven't seen any evidence of voter fraud of this sort.\n\nBut it was disclosed that a top attorney at the Florida Department of State sent a letter last week asking federal prosecutors to investigate whether Democrats distributed false information that could have resulted in voters having mail-in ballots disqualified.\n\nFour county supervisors turned over information that showed Democratic Party operatives changed official forms to say that voters had until two days after the election to fix any problems with mail-in ballot signatures. Under current law, a voter has until the day before Election Day to fix a problem.\n\nIn other developments, Republican Gov. Rick Scott agreed to step down from the state panel responsible for certifying the final results. Scott is locked in a tight race with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and has already suggested fraud may be taking place in some counties. Critics have said Scott should have no role in overseeing the election given his close contest.\n\nMeanwhile, problems continued in Palm Beach County, where tallying machines overheated. That caused mismatched results with the recount of 174,000 early voting ballots, forcing workers to go back and redo their work.\n\n\"The machines are old,\" said Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher, who said they underwent maintenance right before the election. \"I don't think they were designed to work 24/7 - kind of like running an old car from here to L.A. And so, you know, things happen to them.\"\n\nRight now, Palm Beach County looks like it could miss the Thursday deadline, even though Nelson and Democrats filed lawsuits seeking to suspend it.\n\nNo less than six federal lawsuits have been filed so far in Tallahassee. Nelson's campaign has also filed a lawsuit seeking public records from a north Florida elections supervisor who allowed voters in GOP-heavy Bay County to email their ballots in apparent violation of state law.\n\nWalker, citing a well-known \"Star Trek\" episode about rapidly-reproducing furry aliens, said during one election lawsuit hearing Wednesday that \"I feel a little bit like Captain Kirk in the episode with the Tribbles where they start to multiply.\" He began his third hearing of the day by correcting himself: \"The lawyers are multiplying like Tribbles - not the lawsuits.\"\n\nThe developments are fueling frustrations among Democrats and Republicans as the recount unfolds more than a week after Election Day. Democrats have urged state officials to do whatever it takes to make sure every vote is counted. Republicans, including Trump, have argued without evidence that voter fraud threatens to steal races from the GOP.\n\nThe Republican candidates for governor and Senate, Ron DeSantis and Scott, hold the narrowest of leads over their Democratic counterparts, Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson.\n\nScott was in Washington, D.C., while the court battles rage on. He stood at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's left shoulder Wednesday when the Kentucky Republican welcomed GOP senators who will take their seats in January when the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nDuring the brief photo-op in McConnell's Capitol office, Scott did not reply to a question about whether he contends there was fraud in the election.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor's contest, unofficial results showed DeSantis ahead of Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the machine recount is complete, a hand recount will be ordered in any race where the difference is 0.25 percentage points or less, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nIf the Senate race does go to a hand recount, the deadline for counties to finish is Sunday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Marie Antoinette's pearl pendant sells for record price", "description": "Before being killed on the guillotine, Marie Antoinette had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pearl-pendant-marie-antoinette-record-sothebys-auction-today-2018-11-14/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/27/76ea8eba-6f2a-49c6-a4f3-1af4fe3c4355/thumbnail/1200x630/bfa60f998847decec78ea454e0f87c8b/marie-antoinette.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T03:00:26Z", "content": "GENEVA \u2014 A large, drop-shaped natural pearl pendant sold for more than $36 million Wednesday at a rare auction of jewelry that once belonged to French Queen Marie Antoinette, which Sotheby's is calling a record price for a pearl at auction.

Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn't been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nLike many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale, the pendant obliterated the pre-auction estimate \u2014 in its case, $1 million to $2 million. It sold for a hammer price of 32 million Swiss francs ($32 million), but with the buyer's premium and fees, the total sale rose to more than $36.1 million.\n\nThe buyer wanted to remain anonymous, the auction house said.\n\nAll told, the Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nThe diamond and pearl jewelry of Marie Antoinette that went under the hammer epitomized the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the uprising. The wife of King Louis XVI, she was executed in France's revolutionary fervor in 1793.\n\nBefore falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives amid rising the revolutionary fervor that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France's centuries-old monarchy.\n\n\"The Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,\" Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the sale. \"This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette's jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.\"\n\nThe queen's jewelry also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring bears a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.\n\nNearly all of those lots far outstripped the pre-sale estimates, a testament to the difficulty in assessing the value of such rarely available jewels.\n\n\"It was really the Bourbon-Parma factor, plus certainly the Marie Antoinette factor,\" said Daniela Mascetti, Sotheby's chairman for jewelry in Europe. \"Prices really rocketed.

Along the way, Amazon reaped something from more than 200 cities who submitted proposals to house the new headquarters that might be even more valuable: Data. Lots of it.\n\nIn its 14-month search for HQ2, Amazon received 238 proposals from cities hoping to lure the online retailer, with the promise of 50,000 jobs and billions of dollars in investments. Those bids included exhaustive data about nearly every aspect of civic life, including zoning codes, land ownership, population demographics, mass transit ridership, infrastructure plans, the progress of development projects and much more.\n\nFor a company looking to expand its empire with new facilities \u2013 and to find new ways to reach customers faster \u2013 that data could prove priceless.\n\n\"I think they had this in mind from day one,\" Richard Florida, a University of Toronto urban studies professor who tracked the HQ2 process, told CBS News. \"This was about crowdsourcing data ... This was never about an individual HQ2.\"\n\nFlorida called the bidding process a \"game\" that gave Amazon leverage on cities it could use for future business opportunities, even if those cities had little chance of winning the second headquarters.\n\nIndeed, some smaller cities that didn't meet the company's criteria for HQ2, such as a having population of at least 1 million people, submitted bids anyway in hopes of attracting Amazon's attention. And some cities that made the list of 20 finalists \u2013 like Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis \u2013 did not meet requirements like mass transit, but Amazon still engaged them through the final parts of the process and collected more information.\n\nIt's impossible to know the full scope of city data that Amazon picked up, since most cities have kept their bids secret. But the few that released them give an idea of what Amazon learned thanks to HQ2.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area bid included chapters on the region's education, transit and housing demographics, along with encyclopedic entries about every potential place where HQ2 could go. The Camden, New Jersey proposal detailed billion-dollar infrastructure improvement projects that are in the works, some of which are years away from completion. The bid from Boston provided the most minute details about the city's residents, such as how many live near a park and how many walk to work.\n\nBeyond this, Amazon also learned how far cities will go to woo the company \u2014 something it can use the next time it wants to expand operations. The bids laid out the incentive packages that Amazon would get from the cities, and the two eventual winners were not even the most generous. Newark, New Jersey, offered Amazon incentives worth $7 billion, the largest in state history and of any city in the bidding process.\n\nThe HQ2 announcement came with something of a consolation prize for Nashville, Tennessee, which will house an operations center expected to bring as many as 5,000 jobs. The next time Amazon looks for another center, it already knows some of the most valuable information it would need.\n\n\"They know cities' best and final offers for HQ2,\" Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin government professor and coauthor of \"Incentives to Pander: How Politicians Use Corporate Welfare for Political Gain,\" told CBS News. Amazon also has \"personal contacts at economic development\" in these cities and knows \"the limit\" of what it can expect from them, Jensen said.\n\nSome cities even made clear that they would shuffle their own governments for Amazon's approval. Boston said it would set up an \"Amazon Task Force\" of city employees who would work on Amazon's behalf. Fresno, California, proposed putting most of the money generated by Amazon into a fund that would be overseen by both city officials and Amazon officers, who would decide how to spend it. The mayor of Stonecrest, Georgia, suggested creating a city called Amazon and installing Jeff Bezos as a permanent mayor.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Amazon said, \"Economic incentives were one factor in our decision \u2014 but attracting top talent was the leading driver.\" The company also said that it has announced more than 6,000 jobs in locations that submitted bids for HQ2 but were not selected. An Amazon representative said the company will not use any data from cities to target customers for products or advertisements."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Report warns U.S. could lose a war against China or Russia", "description": "A new report by a bipartisan commission selected by Congress says the U.S. has lost its military edge and could lose a war against China or Russia.
