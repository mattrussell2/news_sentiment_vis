Local, state, tribal, and federal jurisdictions can begin submitting data to the FBI via a web application on Jan. 1, 2019. Once the information is collected, it will be released at least twice a year.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across the country have come under fire for high-profile incidents of deaths and injuries by police officers. No statistics have been available to track the incidents on a national scale, though some agencies collect their own data at the state and local level.\n\nThe FBI says the data collection, a first-of-its kind effort, will allow the law enforcement community to identify areas of improvement when it comes to training and tactics. Members of a use-of-force data collection task force convened by the FBI also say they hope the data will increase transparency and in turn strengthen trust between the community and law enforcement.\n\n\"This transparency is not all the time easy -- it may involve us owning up to, 'We could have made a better decision, we could have better policies, we could have better tactics, we can train better,'\" Fayetteville, N.C. Chief of Police Gina Hawkins, a member of the FBI's use-of-force data collection task force, said in a video released on the FBI's website. \"Being transparent leaves us vulnerable, but being vulnerable means we want you to trust us, because we need your support, because we work for the community.\"\n\nThe FBI says the data won't assess whether the officers acted lawfully or within the bounds of department policy or include the final adjudication of the incident, but will aim to \"offer a comprehensive view of the circumstances, subjects, and officers involved in such incidents nationwide.\" Data collection criteria include age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, and weight for the officer or officers and the person killed or injured. Jurisdictions will also be asked to detail information such as why officers initially approached the person, whether the person was armed or threatening an officer or someone else, and the type of force used against the person.\n\nWhile the data collection effort will help departments identify mistakes, it will likely prove problematic because participation is voluntary, according to Charles Gruber, a police practices expert and federal police reforms monitor with the U.S. Department of Justice. Departments across the country are also \"all over the map\" when it comes to defining use-of-force, said Gruber, a former police chief.\n\n\"We're going to get something from [the data collection,] but we're not going to be able to maximize it, to use it to the extent that we could if we collected the data better and made everybody do it,\" Gruber said.\n\nSome jurisdictions may not track use-of-force incidents within their own departments at all, rendering them unable to participate, while others may be reluctant to report data that will be widely publicly available, Gruber said.\n\nThe data collection program will be administered under the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, the same arm that collects and releases national hate crime data. That data, which is also based on voluntary reporting by law enforcement agencies, has repeatedly faced criticism of being incomplete or inaccurate. While participation is improving --about 1,000 additional law enforcement agencies contributed data in 2017 as compared to 2016 -- the Anti-Defamation League says a \"serious gap\" in reporting remains. At least 92 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 either did not report data to the FBI or reported zero hate crimes, according to the group.\n\nLast month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the Justice Department's new hate crime initiative was \"taking on the challenging task of addressing the gap in hate crime statistics\" and officials were reviewing the \"accuracy of those reports,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe FBI has said is doesn't have legal authority to mandate reporting of any data to the Uniform Crime Reporting program. For the use-of-force data collection effort, it says it's working with major law enforcement agency organizations to \"obtain broad support and forge commitments from these members to report this critical information.\"\n\nThe FBI also says they will offer data collection training for departments who participate."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Top Saudi official denies crown prince's involvement in journalist's death, but says \"nobody\" is above the law", "description": "In an interview with CBS News, a top Saudi official denied Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

She'll join what may be the chamber's smallest group of female GOP lawmakers since the early 1990s \u2014 as few as 13 of at least 199 Republicans. Democrats will have at least 89.\n\nNumbers like those have Republicans searching for answers to the glaring gender disparity in their ranks \u2014 and fast. The concern is that Democrats' lopsided edge among women voters could carry over to 2020, when President Trump will be seeking a second term and House and Senate control will be in play. If the current trend continues, Republicans risk being branded the party of men.\n\n\"You will see a very significant recruiting effort occur\" for women candidates, said David Winston, a pollster who advises GOP congressional leaders. \"It's a natural conclusion. An environment has got to be created where that can be a success.\"\n\nEvidence of the GOP gender gap was just as clear in the 100-member Senate, where Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn will be the only Republican freshman. If Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith wins a runoff later this month there will be record-setting seven GOP women in the Republican-run Senate. But even that record is less than half the class of 17 Democratic women, which includes two freshmen.\n\nThe search for answers leads to some familiar places. President Trump's fraught history with women, combined with the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, helped motivate Democratic women to seek office but did not appear to have the same effect with GOP women, politicians and analysts say. More broadly, the president's brash style doesn't sit well many women voters or potential candidates.\n\n\"Women don't like the tweets,\" said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a moderate GOP group. \"I don't know how to tone down the rhetoric. If I could have a fantasy, one wish, that would be my one wish.\"\n\nWomen backed Democratic candidates over Republicans on Election Day by a telling 57 percent to 41 percent, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. Women broke by similar margins in the crucial suburbs, where Democratic victories in swing districts helped power the gains they needed to win House control. Men supported Republicans over Democrats, 51 percent to 46 percent.\n\nStrategists note the issue isn't just about current personalities; it's about party infrastructure.\n\n\"We as a party have to make recruiting women candidates who can win a high priority,\" said Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a fledging GOP group that tries bolstering female Republican candidates. She added, \"Unless people in leadership really make it a priority, I don't think it will happen.\"\n\nA record number of women ran for the House as major-party candidates this year. But Democrats outnumbered Republicans by nearly 3 to 1, according to AP data, and Democratic women were more likely to win their primaries.\n\nOf those contenders who ran in November, 183 were Democrats, the most ever, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Fifty-two were Republicans, a near-record but a fraction of female Democrats running.\n\nThat partisan imbalance was aggravated by Democrats' superior campaign infrastructure for helping women candidates.\n\nWinning for Women, created in early 2017, says it spent more than $1 million helping women candidates for the recent election. That and other GOP groups assisting women candidates couldn't match Democrats' 33-year-old Emily's List, a well-financed organization that poured tens of millions into primaries and general elections and provided recruiting, training and other services to female candidates.\n\n\"Democrats have been doing a much better job of getting women elected,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nAsked to explain her success against other female candidates' defeats, West Virginia's Miller sent an email lauding Mr. Trump and other Republicans and GOP women's groups and saying \"liberal special interests\" had spent heavily to defeat Republican women. Officials at the White House and the GOP did not provide answers to requests for comment.\n\nRepublicans have displayed a sensitivity this year to their overwhelmingly male numbers. That includes hiring a female prosecutor to question Kavanaugh's chief accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and its all-male Republicans.\n\nWithin days of the elections, Republicans vaulted women into congressional leadership positions.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, will be No. 3 House GOP leader next year, that chamber's highest-ranking woman ever. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, will be vice chairwoman of the Senate GOP conference, a lower-tier post, making her the first Republican woman in a Senate leadership job in eight years.\n\nCheney said Republicans must better communicate that their policies on national security, the economy and health care are best for men and women. She called it \"fundamentally offensive and paternalistic\" to think women's votes are driven by their gender.\n\nAsked on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" last week whether Mr. Trump's rhetoric alienated women, Ernst said, \"We could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Los Angeles prosecutor declines felony case against Michael Avenatti", "description": "Los Angeles district attorney referred allegations that he roughed up his girlfriend to the city attorney for a possible misdemeanor case", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/los-angeles-prosecutor-declines-felony-case-against-michael-avenatti-2018-11-21/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/05/cb27c681-57c9-4633-8056-08c24afab6cf/thumbnail/1200x630g2/6aedf9d63ec866b1e07a6f57029d5a66/ap-18150582851545.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:50:43Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles district attorney declined to prosecute attorney Michael Avenatti on felony domestic abuse charges on Wednesday and referred allegations that he roughed up his girlfriend to the city attorney for a possible misdemeanor case.

Apple and the other five horsemen of today's Internet economy -- Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix -- together have lost nearly $1 trillion in market value in recent weeks, dragging down not just the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite but also the Dow Jones industrials index and the S&P 500-stock index.\n\n\"The tech sector has been hit particularly hard in the recent stock market pullback,\" noted Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist, Gregory Daco. \"Concerns broadly revolve around slower demand, rising trade tensions and fears of greater regulation.\"\n\nHere's what's specifically alarming investors most right now:\n\nConsumer and corporate sales are sagging\n\nDisappointing to downright dismal earnings reports earlier this month from Alphabet and Amazon included company forecasts that signaled a slowdown in longtime growth markets. Evidence of a reduced appetite for Apple's latest iPhones was among the more distressing sales stories in the sector. The company offered a less-than-cheerful outlook for holiday sales in its fourth-quarter earnings report, hinting at softer-than-expected demand in the U.S. and abroad for its new $1,000-plus iPhones. The stock prices of Apple's biggest suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Asia tumbled on the news.\n\nGovernment regulations are coming\n\nFacebook and other major tech companies with broad consumer reach have tumbled on thinking that heightened government regulation will hit profits, with social media companies especially on the defensive amid the proliferation of fake news and security breaches. \"Eight international parliaments, including the U.K., Canada, and Australia, have requested hearings with Facebook leadership over the negative impact the platform has had on the democratic process,\" Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein wrote in a client's note. Almost no one on Wall Street sees the pressure easing anytime soon.\n\nTrade winds are blowing through supply chains\n\nThe imposition of tariffs this fall on key products like semiconductors already is leading to heightened costs for businesses and disrupting global supply chains as suppliers and their customers seek new locales to avoid both the latest tariffs and a new round of retaliations threatened for January, according to Oxford Economics' Daco.\n\nAdditionally, he noted an \"increasingly active effort\" by the Treasury Department to scrutinize U.S. exports in certain new tech sectors, such as artificial intelligence and robotics. \"These rules could have a severe impact on U.S. exports, business investment and GDP, if imposed,\" Daco wrote.\n\nGlobal economic growth prospects are slowing\n\nGrowth forecasts for 2019 have been revised downward for most of the world's major economies, with global GDP now expected to expand by 3.5 percent next year, compared with the 3.7 percent forecast in May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, said Wednesday.\n\nEven a seemingly small 0.2% shift in a $75 trillion global economy can add up fast. \"Trade growth and investment have been slackening on the back of tariff hikes,\" the OECD noted. \"Higher interest rates and an appreciating U.S. dollar have resulted in an outflow of capital from emerging economies and are weakening their currencies.\"\n\nGravity always wins in the end\n\nAfter years of delivering gravity-defying returns, high-flying tech stocks had become among the most popular to own among mutual funds, hedge funds and other large investors. But just as the Wall Street pack bought the stocks on the way up, the herd is heading for the exits en masse as well.\n\n\"There's no doubt that tech companies are widely owned, people have made a lot of money on them and we're finally seeing for the first time where the rotation is having some legs,\" Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, told the Associated Press. \"They're selling the winners and redeploying the money somewhere else.\"\n\nWhere the so-called smart money ultimately redeploys all that money remains to be seen."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Christopher Brito", "title": "Obama surprises food bank volunteers ahead of Thanksgiving", "description": "Former president hugged volunteers and even bagged potatoes with them", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barack-obama-thanksgiving-2018-volunteers-chicago-illinois-cook-county-food-depository/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/9ce32c57-a963-4d06-87fd-83e27f41f185/thumbnail/1200x630/78c5f1b04ae2cb8d9dc272f18fa15614/screen-shot-2018-11-21-at-2-47-06-pm.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:08:49Z", "content": "Former President Barack Obama got into the holiday spirit this week, surprising star-struck volunteers and helping them prepare Thanksgiving meals at a Chicago food bank.

He can challenge the ruling within 30 days.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had travelled to the UAE last week and discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. He described the situation as \"unacceptable\" and said the case would have consequences for bilateral relations.\n\n\"I regret the fact that we have reached this position and I urge the UAE to reconsider,\" Hunt said.\n\nThe harsh verdict is unusual for a British national in the UAE who is not accused of a violent crime. Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada, who was in court, said she was in \"complete shock.\"\n\n\"Matthew is innocent,\" she said. \"The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them.\"\n\nUrging the British government to make a stand for him, she added: \"I am very scared for Matt. I don't know where they are taking him or what will happen now. Our nightmare has gotten even worse.\"\n\nThe Federal Appeals Court of Abu Dhabi said Hedges was found guilty of \"spying on the UAE and providing sensitive security and intelligence information to third parties.\"\n\nLocal papers said police secured evidence of his activities from Hedges' electronic devices and surveillance by Emirati intelligence. Durham University, meanwhile, said that there was no reason to believe Hedges \"was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research.\"\n\nThe emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are home to large numbers of British nationals who work in a range of positions, from top management jobs and public relations to teaching and athletics. Ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE run deep, dating back more than 200 years. The British were among the first contracted to help build the UAE's infrastructure after oil was discovered there in the early 1960s and retain a multimillion dollar arms trade.\n\nThe Muslim country on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula prides itself on being tolerant of foreigners, and of being tourist-friendly. But British nationals have run afoul of local customs and laws, which prohibit public intoxication, kissing in public and cursing at someone \u2014 which can all lead to arrest and deportation.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Hedges was detained at Dubai International Airport as he was preparing to leave the country following two weeks in the UAE. His wife said he was doing fieldwork for his doctoral thesis on the impact of Emirati security and foreign policies. The academic was charged after more than a month in detention, the group said.\n\n\"UAE rulers cannot claim to preside over a global knowledge and education hub while locking up academics for months in solitary confinement,\" Michael Page of Human Rights Watch said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Dogs greet college kids home for Thanksgiving", "description": "College kids around the U.S. are coming home for Thanksgiving \u2013 and it's making for a lot of happy dogs.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/dogs-greet-college-kids-home-for-thanksgiving/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/71b577b6-43a7-4459-ac9d-a08377ac6055/thumbnail/1200x630/983c9558fcc7a8be6c48ccd185a4cf87/pupsthanksgiving-1717862-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:25:22Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Rescue turkey helps teach kids how to read", "description": "A rescue turkey from California named Sadey was spared this Thanksgiving, because she has a greater purpose in life: helping kids learn how to read.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rescue-turkey-helps-teach-kids-how-to-read/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/225cdc8c-c292-4484-aa96-58b327dfb2bd/thumbnail/1200x630/ce580b8c441c0a33cd32ec76367168b3/turkey-rescue-1717845-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:19:53Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Police officers salute soldiers returning home from Afghanistan", "description": "Colorado Springs police officers on motorcycles stopped to salute soldiers returning home after deployment in Afghanistan.

The assessment is based mainly on an understanding of how the Kingdom operates \u2014 the tight control the crown prince holds \u2014 and that several of those involved in the murder are close to him.\n\nBut President Trump released a statement Tuesday, saying \"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams, Al Jubeir used Mr. Trump's statement to support his government's claim that the crown prince isn't responsible for Khashoggi's killing.\n\n\"What we've heard is the president say that the CIA report is not what people say it is and so we have to go by this,\" he said. \"If you have any evidence, or any government has any evidence that it would like to make available to the Saudi courts, I'm sure the courts would be pleased to receive it.\"\n\nThe full transcript of Williams' interview with Al Jubeir is below:\n\nHolly Williams: President Trump said there will be no more punishment for Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi government must be very happy to hear that.\n\nAdel Al Jubeir: Well we've always said that the Saudi government was not involved with this. It was a rouge operation. These individuals were officials of the government who exceeded their authority and committed a crime. We have said that we will investigate what we have. The public prosecutor brought charges against individuals including the death penalty against five. We have said that we will put in place mechanisms to ensure this does not happen again. This is how normal countries deal with a situation like this.\n\nThis is a terrible mistake and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again and we want to make sure that those responsible are held accountable.\n\nWilliams: What lessons have been learned by the Saudi government?\n\nAl Jubeir: We are in the middle of a review of our procedures and policies with regards to intelligence operations, make sure people understand their responsibilities and what they can and cannot do very clearly. And to make sure the lines of authority are clear so that we don't have a mistake like this.\n\nWilliams: That's a pretty extraordinary breach of authority -- murdering somebody inside a Saudi consulate.\n\nAl Jubeir: Absolutely. Yes. And we take it very seriously and we're very concerned about it. But unfortunately these things, mistakes like these happen with other governments.\n\nWilliams: President Trump did not clear the crown prince's name. In fact he said that the prince might have had knowledge of the killing. In President Trump's words, \"Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.\" Does that matter to the Saudi government?\n\nAl Jubeir: We have made it very clear that his royal highness the crown prince is not involved with this at all. We have made it very clear that the senior officials who were involved with this were dismissed from their roles. We have detained the individuals who conducted this operation. And as I mentioned we have the prosecutors filing the charges against 11, five of whom he is asking for the death penalty.\n\nWilliams: When you've said that the crown prince has been exonerated has the crown prince been investigated?\n\nAl Jubeir: We looked at how this issue came about and how the operation was launched and the people who launched who were part of the operation and what they did. And it has nothing to do with the crown prince.\n\nWilliams: Can he be investigated or is he technically above the law?\n\nAl Jubeir: In Saudi Arabia nobody is above the law but we have an investigation, we have information that we received from our Turkish friends, unfortunately we received it after it had been leaked to the media. We have said that if they have more information to provide that we would look forward to receiving that information. Our public prosecutor launched his own investigation in the kingdom. He came to certain conclusions, and based on that he took action.\n\nWilliams: Have Saudi officials listened to the audio recording that Turkey says it has of Jamal Khashoggi being killed?\n\nAl Jubeir: I believe one of our officials has in the law enforcement and intelligence area, and we have asked the Turks to provide us with a copy of it so we can do voice recognition and we can do forensics and establish for certainty who the voices on the tape are, but we have yet to receive a copy.\n\nWilliams: U.S. officials have told journalists that the CIA assessment is that the crown prince gave the order to kill Jamal Khashoggi. One of the officials who was fired and then sanctioned by the U.S. was an adviser to the crown prince. And the former deputy head of intelligence who apparently sent the team to Istanbul and was then fired was also apparently close to the crown prince. Isn't that quite damning for the crown prince?\n\nGetty\n\nAl Jubeir: Look this is a huge tragedy and we're making sure that it doesn't happen again and we want to make sure that those who are involved get their due punishment. The CIA report that you talk about I haven't seen it so I can't assess it. The CIA report that has been talked about in the media, we've heard different versions of it. What I do know is the spokesperson for the State Department said that the reporting on the CIA report is inaccurate, and what we've heard is the president say is that the CIA report is not what people say it is. So we have to go by this. If you have any evidence or if any government has any evidence that would like to make available to the Saudi courts I am sure the courts would be pleased to receive it.\n\nWilliams: There are rumors that the crown prince could be replaced because he's become a liability for the Saudi government. Does the crown prince still have the confidence of King Salman?\n\nAl Jubeir: The crown prince has the confidence of every Saudi citizen, including King Salman. The crown prince is the architect and driving force behind the reform program in Saudi Arabia and the vision of 2030. Between turning Saudi Arabia into a modern country to which normal people can lead normal lives. He is the architect between restoring the true Islam to Saudi Arabia. The Islam of moderation and tolerance in which women are empowered and youth are empowered. Where there's a focus on excellence and achievement and serious work against extremism that has been a plague in many countries. And he's the architect of our economic diversification program, attracting foreign investment, opening up new areas for investment, expanding Saudi investments abroad. So he has the support, as I said, of every Saudi citizen.\n\nWilliams: Wouldn't the best way for Saudi Arabia to clear the crown prince's name be to have an international investigation and to allow outside investigators to question the crown prince, to question Saudi officials, and to question the men who have now been indicted?\n\nAl Jubeir: We have a public prosecution officer that is capable of conducting investigations and we have a legal system which is capable of adjudicating these cases. So the idea of an international investigation is completely unacceptable to Saudi Arabia. Would any other government allow an international investigation? Did the United States allow an international investigation into Abu Ghraib? Did other countries allow investigations when other issues happened? Of course not. We are a sovereign country, we want to make sure that this doesn't happen again. We have come out from day one to say that this was not authorized. And we have added or told the story based on the information we have and as the information is re-obtained, becomes more complete, we came out and said no, what we said first was not accurate. Here's what actually happened.\n\nWilliams: There was initially a cover-up at least by some Saudi officials. That has shaken people's confidence in the Saudi government, hasn't it?\n\nAl Jubeir: The individuals who conducted this operation came back and gave a report that turned out to be false. And then the king ordered an investigating team to go to Turkey and work with our Turkish friends. In doing their work there it turned out that the information that the individuals provided was not correct so his majesty directed that the investigation be launched in Saudi Arabia. The public prosecutor began that investigation and was able to establish that a killing did take place and so we came out and announced it.\n\nAs the investigation proceeded and it became more clear how the killing was conducted and who the people responsible were, the public prosecutor came out and to the press and said here is the story that we have been able to put together and here are the steps that will be taken against 11 of the 18 individuals.\n\nWilliams: From the outside it looks as though Saudi Arabia's story has just kept on changing from week to week. First the denial, then the suggestion that Jamal Khashoggi died in a fist fight, then most recently that he was killed by a lethal injection.\n\nAl Jubeir: It was based on the information that we were able to obtain. And the testimony or the confessions of the people in detention. And when the public prosecutor was able to put the pieces together a clearer picture emerged that was different from the picture that we had, that we thought was clear, in the beginning. This is not unusual when you have crimes that the facts or the storyline can change. If you look at the Oklahoma City bombing initially people blamed, I believe, the Palestinian American for the crime and they even talked about how he escaped. Then it turns out it was Timothy McVeigh. Does this mean that Oklahoma police and the FBI were covering up? It just means that as more of the facts were obtained the story becomes more clear and then that's what our prosecution office shared with the world.\n\nWilliams: As a result of this crisis is Saudi Arabia going to change what it is doing in Yemen? Where Saudi Arabia is accused of targeting civilians with air strikes and exacerbating a deadly famine?\n\nAl Jubeir: We have our policies the same in terms of domestic policies. Our foreign policies the same. Our security policy is the same. In Yemen we are there to protect humans from being taken over by radical militia allied with Iran and Hezbollah that has hijacked the country that uses child soldiers, boys 9, 10, 11 years old, puts them in the battlefield. That uses starvation as an instrument of policy by laying siege on towns and villages and preventing aid from coming in. By robbing humanitarian assistance and selling it to fund its war machine. By launching ballistic missiles indiscriminately at towns and cities including more than 200 missiles at Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe're trying to move Yemen towards a peaceful situation. We're trying to move Yemen towards a political settlement based on UN Resolution 2216 and the outcomes of the national dialogue agreement and the GCC initiative. We are working very closely with the UN in order to achieve that.\n\nWilliams: So no change?\n\nAl Jubeir: The policy in Yemen has always been designed to minimize casualties and to maximize humanitarian support. No country in the world has provided more aid to Yemen than Saudi Arabia. The amount of aid has succeeded $13 billion since the conflict began. Two days ago we announced another 500 million to alleviate food shortages in Yemen. We are committed to providing war assistance to Yemen, and we're committed to rebuilding Yemen when the war is over.\n\nWilliams: Just over two years from now the U.S. could have a Democrat in the Oval Office. Both houses of Congress could be controlled by the Democrats. And then the U.S. government might take a much greater interest in finding out who gave the order ultimately to kill Jamal Khashoggi. Is that worrying for the Saudi government?\n\nAl Jubeir: We deal with U.S. governments ... U.S. presidents whether Democrat or Republican. Our relationship is bipartisan. It began with a historic meeting between the late King Abdul Aziz and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who is a Democrat. And it continued and grew stronger and deeper and broader with every passing decade, irrespective of who is in the White House.\n\nI believe that America appreciates Saudi Arabia's central role in the Arab world and the Islamic world. Appreciates Saudi Arabia's central role in the financial markets, and in the energy markets. I believe America appreciates Saudi Arabia's central role in the fighting of extremism and terrorism. And I believe America appreciates Saudi Arabia's partnership in solving the problems of the region if not the world. Every American president has understood this since the late FDR.\n\nWilliams: You're confident that Saudi Arabia's alliance with the U.S. is safe despite the killing of Jamal Khashoggi?\n\nAl Jubeir: God willing, yes. Because we as a government had nothing to do with it.

But the nature of a day centered around shopping can almost inevitably lead to overspending. Here are three ways to tell whether participating in Black Friday is really right \u2014 or actually wrong \u2014 for you.\n\nConsider what you're buying\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is known for long lines, big crowds and low prices. And while the shopping holiday often does deliver unbeatable deals on things like electronics, certain items are cheaper at other times of the year.\n\nClothing is generally a bargain on Black Friday, but some clothing reaches its lowest price off-season, according to Charlie Graham, founder and CEO of Shop It to Me, a sale alert app.\n\n\"If you're really penny-pinching, you can find better deals when items go on clearance outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday,\" Graham says of some apparel.\n\nThink buying swimsuits at the end of winter or sweaters in the middle of summer.\n\nTIP: Consider the items you want this Black Friday and write them down. Then, check Black Friday ads to see if those products will be on sale. Retailers usually release their ads ahead of time \u2014 online, by email or in the mail. If you don't see what you want at the price you want, think about waiting to buy.\n\nConsider why you're buying\n\nOf those who plan to shop in stores this Black Friday, 42 percent said they plan to do so because they enjoy the in-store hype (e.g., doorbuster deals, camping outside of stores the night before), according to the NerdWallet study.\n\nEnjoying this annual tradition is one thing, but going shopping \"just because\" isn't always a good idea. Even if you've set a budget before putting on your comfiest sneakers and standing in the cold, you may be susceptible to making additional purchases once you're among the merchandise.\n\nOn Black Friday, retailers compete for a share of your wallet, says Jeff Inman, a marketing professor at the University of Pittsburgh and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Consumer Research.\n\nTraditionally, retailers draw in Black Friday shoppers with a few great deals \u2014 called \"loss leaders\" \u2014 and hope they'll buy additional items as well. Imagine going for a TV and leaving with clothing and Christmas decorations, too.\n\nWhile Inman says he hasn't always seen shoppers with huge baskets on Black Friday, he does point to toys as one category where shoppers may spring for something even if they didn't see it in a Black Friday ad.\n\nFor example, while in the store, you may come across a toy and decide to buy it for your niece for Christmas. This isn't necessarily an impulse purchase; you already planned to buy a gift for your niece. But since you didn't know the exact item you wanted to buy, he calls selecting this toy an \"impulse allocation\" of your holiday shopping budget.\n\nThis isn't a problem if you can afford it, but be conscious of this possibility when you step foot in the store.\n\nTIP: Think about why you want to shop on Black Friday, and whether you're financially prepared. If you're not sure you can resist the temptation to overshoot your budget, consider skipping.\n\nConsider when you're buying\n\nFinally, plan your timing. With deals launching earlier each year, some Black Friday sales really happen the whole week of Thanksgiving, according to Graham from Shop It to Me.\n\n\"To compete with each other, the retailers have been pushing their sales earlier and earlier during that week,\" Graham says.\n\nBecause of this, sometimes shoppers can get Black Friday-level prices before Black Friday.\n\nTIP: Although this might not be true for every product category, monitor sales in the days leading up to Black Friday for an early shot at a good deal.\n\nTo stay or to go?\n\nOnce you decide the what, why and when of your Black Friday shopping, you'll be able to decide whether you should join the crowds or stay on the couch.\n\n-- This article was written by the personal finance website NerdWallet and was originally published by the Associated Press."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Aerosmith\u2019s Joe Perry cancels tour following hospitalization", "description": "On Twitter, Perry thanked his fans for their \"kind messages\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aerosmiths-joe-perry-cancels-tour-following-hospitalization/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/11/83b609fd-b98c-40ee-9158-2ea3d4d8a1fa/thumbnail/1200x630g2/290728ab696ea7e8e052ddf4e90dc753/gettyimages-452531988.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:20:34Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Joe Perry is taking time off from the road following his hospitalization earlier in November.

That's not because last year's tax overhaul limited these donations -- most are still deductible, just as they were in prior years.\n\nHowever, the new tax law did increase the standard deduction and limited the deduction for state income and property taxes. That means more filers will find they're better off simply claiming the standard deduction rather than itemizing deductions, including those for charitable donations. Here are the details behind the changes -- and what you can still do to gain tax breaks from your charitable donations.\n\nA new standard deduction\n\n\n\nThe new tax law increased the standard deduction for single filers to $12,000 from $6,350 and for married filers to $24,000 from $12,700. It also limited the deduction for state income and real estate taxes to $10,000. Because of these changes, some of the 45 million taxpayers who itemized deductions on Schedule A with their 2017 tax return will no longer do so.\n\nBut many Americans still plan to make charitable donations. If you're among them and you'd like to get a tax break, consider bunching the donations you planned to make for the next several years and make a single large donation now, before 2018 ends. If the charitable donation is more than your standard deduction, you can claim the entire amount as an itemized deduction on your 2018 tax return.\n\nYou can do this is via a donor giving account or under a charitable giving program or donor advised fund. Major financial firms, including Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard, all offer charitable giving programs that are easy to set up.\n\nDonations of stocks\n\n\n\nIf you also own stocks or mutual funds with significant gains in a taxable account, here's another valuable tax strategy to consider. You can donate appreciated shares of stock or a mutual fund that you've owned for more than a year instead of writing a check and giving cash.\n\nIf your donation of stock is worth $1,000 or more, the tax benefits can really reduce the aftertax cost of the gift. That's because when you donate shares of an investment that has appreciated, you avoid ever reporting the gains as taxable income.\n\nThis tax benefit stems from the general rule that when you donate long-term property (owned more than one year), the deduction is equal to the donated property's fair market value. This results in two potential tax benefits: a charitable donation deduction, plus the avoidance of tax on the capital gains.\n\nDonations from an IRA\n\n\n\nFor anyone who has an IRA and is required to take minimum distributions from it each year, there's a way to make charitable donations that will reduce taxable income dollar-for-dollar, even if you plan to claim the standard deduction and not itemize. Here's how, and who, can do it.\n\nIf you're required to take minimum withdrawals from an IRA or retirement plan because you're age 70\u00bd or older, you can use the pretax dollars in your IRA to make direct donations to a nonprofit, religious organization or other qualified charity.\n\nThis is called the IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution rule, and it allows IRA owners age 70\u00bd or older who are subject to the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules to use the untaxed money in an IRA to donate to a charity tax-free. But you can't also claim this charitable donation on your tax return (sorry, no double dipping allowed).\n\nNote that the money withdrawn from an IRA and donated to charity stays out of your adjusted gross income only if you make a direct transfer to the charity. It's not tax-free if you withdraw the money first, deposit it into another account and then donate it to the charity."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Kevin Frazier, Keltie Knight on hosting CBS' Thanksgiving Day Parade show", "description": "Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight of \"Entertainment Tonight\" joined CBSN to discuss what they're looking forward to as the co-hosts of \"The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS.\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/kevin-frazier-keltie-knight-on-hosting-cbs-thanksgiving-day-parade-show/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/8bb2311b-f7ef-4c0c-9a6b-61c92b2cb32c/thumbnail/1200x630/b1163f576e208d70ab550cfe9ad1d25d/1121-cbsn-dta-92ndannualthanksgiving-1717770-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:50:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "American killed by tribe's arrows on remote island is identified", "description": "John Allen Chau was apparently shot and killed by arrows on remote Indian island populated by a tribe known for shooting at outsiders", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-sentinel-island-american-john-allen-chau-killed-by-tribesmen-on-remote-island/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/1d1dc007-ab4d-4f9b-8ec8-984b4ad7ec6f/thumbnail/1200x630/5b9f333cf55286edb9b51219c8760748/north-sentinel-island-ap-041228016428.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:47:28Z", "content": "NEW DELHI -- An American adventurer who kayaked to a remote Indian island populated by a tribe known for shooting at outsiders with bows and arrows has been killed, police said Wednesday.

Dependera Pathak, director-general of police on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, identified the American as John Allen Chau and said he told a hotel he was 26 years old.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can't be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak told The Associated Press.\n\nPathak said seven fishermen have been arrested for helping the American reach North Sentinel Island. The Sentinelese people are resistant to outsiders and often attack anyone who comes near, and visits to the island are heavily restricted by the government.\n\n\"It was a case of misdirected adventure,\" Pathak said.\n\nPolice have approached anthropologists with contacts on the island in an effort to visit and recover the body, Pathak said.\n\nHe said Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed in a hotel while he prepared to travel to the island. It was not his first time in the region: Chau had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016, Pathak said. North Sentinel is in the Andaman Islands at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nChau organized his visit to the island through a friend who hired seven fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, which also towed his kayak, Pathak said.\n\nChau went ashore in his kayak on Nov. 15 and sent the boat with the fishermen out to sea to avoid detection, Pathak said. He interacted with some of the tribespeople, offering gifts such as a football and fish. But the tribespeople became angry and shot an arrow at him, hitting a book he was carrying, Pathak said.\n\nAfter his kayak was damaged, Chau swam back to the fishermen's boat, which was waiting at a prearranged location. He spent the night writing about his experiences on pages that he then handed gave the fishermen, Pathak said. He set out again to meet the tribespeople on Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn't known. But on the morning of the following day, the waiting fishermen watched from a distance as the tribesmen dragged Chau's body. They left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nHe said the family got in touch with Indian police and U.S. consular officials.\n\nPolice charged the seven fishermen with endangering the life of the American by taking him to a prohibited area, Pathak said.\n\n\"I love to explore,\" Chau told the Outbound Collective four years ago. \"So whether it's trekking through dense old growth forests near the Chilliwack River [on the US-Canada border], finding a rumoured waterfall in the jungles of the Andamans, or just wandering around a city to get a feel for the vibes, I'm an explorer at heart.\"\n\nKathleen Hosie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Consulate in Chennai, the capital of India's southern Tamil Nadu state, said she was aware of reports concerning an American in the islands but could not comment further due to privacy considerations.\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese and other Andaman tribes.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable,\" Stephen Corry, the group's director, said in a statement.\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist and a professor at Jindal Global Law School, said North Sentinel Island was a protected area and not open to tourists. \"The exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining. The government has to protect them,\" Viswanathan said.\n\nPoachers are known to fish illegally in the waters around the island, catching turtles and diving for lobsters and sea cucumbers. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore.\n\nAfter a 2004 tsunami devastated the region, an Indian coast guard commander, Anil Thapliyal, said he spotted a lone tribesman on the island.\n\n\"There was a naked Sentinelese man,\" Thapliyal told The Associated Press. \"He came out and shot an arrow at the helicopter.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Caitlin O'Kane", "title": "Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers donating $1 million to wildfire victims", "description": "\"In Northern California, where I was born and raised, the city of Paradise burnt to the ground,\" he said", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/green-bay-packers-aaron-rodgers-donating-1-million-to-california-wildfire-victims-2018-11-21/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/98081637-c6dd-4c04-94cf-14e161dfb3bd/thumbnail/1200x630/66505b1a8670c6759826361537f84434/screen-shot-2018-11-21-at-1-23-30-pm.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:31:31Z", "content": "Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers announced on social media Wednesday that he is donating $1 million to California wildfire victims.

Find out how much each float costs and other expenses associated with this spectacular Thanksgiving Day tradition\n\nTotal costs for the Macy's parade average between $11.6 million and $13.4 million\n\nAnnual costs for parade float supplies, float decorations, property taxes and staff salaries total $2.7 million to $4.5 million. The sheer magnitude of the Macy's parade is overwhelming, and so are the assets associated with the event.\n\nMacy's also has its own studio space and a massive supply of costumes to prepare for the parade. Those assets are worth $8.9 million. Combine the parade's total annual expenses with its total assets and the price tag reaches $10.4 million to $12.3 million.\n\nGiant balloons rack up at least $510,000 in helium costs\n\nInflating balloons that can soar up to five or six stories tall is seriously expensive. Each balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade uses 300,000 to 700,000 cubic feet of helium. Filling every ballon costs a minimum of $510,000.\n\nEach helium-filled giant requires 50 to 90 volunteer handlers, but sometimes that still isn't enough. In 1997, winds up to 43 mph damaged several balloons, including Barney, the Pink Panther, the Quik Bunny and the Cat in the Hat, forcing them to exit the parade route early.\n\nNew balloons cost sponsors nearly $200,000\n\nCompanies sponsoring brand new balloons pay a seriously pricey construction and parade fee, totaling $190,000 at last count. The cost is high, but advertising at the Thanksgiving parade is a huge marketing opportunity \u2014 there's certainly not a shortage of businesses willing to shell out the cash.\n\nSome of the new balloons set to debut at the 2017 parade include the Fantasy Chocolate Factory float, sponsored by Kinder and featuring a Ferris wheel-powered chocolate factory that would give Willy Wonka a run for his money. Other new floats include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Santa's Saint Bernards and a newly designed annual favorite of the longest-running float, Tom Turkey.\n\nSesame Street, Ronald McDonald's red shoe, the Girl Scouts and Build-A-Bear are some of the floats returning to the parade this year.\n\nAndrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nSponsors pay $90,000 for returning balloons\n\n\n\nBacking a balloon in the Macy's parade is a huge investment, so many sponsors opt to participate for several years. Since a new balloon doesn't need to be constructed, the fee to join in this Thanksgiving Day extravaganza drops to $90,000.\n\nSeveral balloons will be returning for the 2018 parade, including the Pillsbury Doughboy, SpongeBob SquarePants and Sinclair's Dino. One major question mark is the absence of Snoopy \u2014 with 39 Macy's Thanksgiving parade appearances, Snoopy has shown up more than any other character. He was replaced by a Charlie Brown balloon in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThis year might be the coldest Thanksgiving on record in New York City. The National Weather Service forecast is calling for temperatures in the 20s with high winds gusting up to 35 mph. If that forecast stays true, it may dampen the celebration, as the parade balloons are not allowed to fly if the wind gusts are more than 35 mph. The Thanksgiving Day parade balloons were last grounded in 1971.\n\nConstruction costs for each float average $30,000 to $100,000\n\nThese Turkey Day spectacles are certainly not your average parade float \u2014 those on display at the Macy's parade can take four to nine months to get from concept to completion. In 2017, a total of 26 extravagant floats were be in the parade, with average construction costs ranging from $30,000 to $100,000 for each float.\n\nParade float supply costs add up fast, especially considering one float can contain 100 to 200 pounds of glitter. One of last year's floats included the three-story Heartwarming Holiday Countdown by the Hallmark Channel featuring a 3-D calendar.\n\nCostumes have a total price tag of $2 million\n\nThe perfect parade float doesn't just boast beautiful construction. Approximately 700 elaborate costumes are designed each year to bring parade float ideas to life. Costumes currently in storage are valued at $2 million. Balloon handlers wear jumpsuits, but those riding on floats are provided with custom-made garments, according to Business Insider.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, 200 costume fitters are on-site to help participants into their outfits. When the parade is over, costumes are packed into 10 trucks and sent back to the warehouse.\n\nKENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAdvance ticket sales for participating Broadway shows have climbed $300,000\n\n\n\nBroadway shows vie for the chance to step into the national spotlight and perform in the Macy's parade. The exposure has boosted advance ticket sales by roughly $300,000 in the past. The casts of Broadway's \"Come From Away,\" \"Waitress\" and \"Cats\" entertained the crowd from the 34th Street stage in recent years.\n\nParade floats cost approximately $780,000 to $2.6 million\n\nThe Thanksgiving parade wouldn't be complete without its fancy floats, but these roving works of art add $780,000 to $2.6 million to the parade's bottom line. Beyond float decorations and supplies, considerable manpower is required.\n\nEach parade float must be collapsed to a width of no more than 8.5 feet to get it through the Lincoln Tunnel, which is part of its journey from the studio in New Jersey to New York City. The floats are reconstructed from midnight to 8 a.m the morning of the parade.\n\nMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade property taxes total $138,573\n\nEven the Thanksgiving parade can't get away from Uncle Sam. Previously located in Hoboken, N.J., the Macy's Parade Studio completed work on its new Moonachie, N.J., home in 2011.\n\nThe 72,000-square-foot, $6.9 million building is nearly double the size of its previous 40,000-square-foot facility. A tremendous amount of space is needed to house each parade float, balloon, costume, accessory and still have room for employees. Large facilities come with considerable expenses, which can explain the sky-high property tax bill of $138,573 \u2014 the highest in the entire nation.\n\nSalaries for Macy's parade full-time staffers totals $1.3 million\n\nDespite taking place just once a year on Thanksgiving Day, the Macy's parade is an enormous undertaking that requires a full-time staff of 26 employees. Temporary staffers are hired during the busy fall months, bringing the total employee count to roughly 40. When combined, their salaries total approximately $1.3 million.\n\nThe Macy's parade team includes painters, sculptors, carpenters, construction workers, metal workers and more. Employees start working long hours \u2014 including weekends \u2014 in September to make sure all preparations are in place for the big day.\n\nKENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThanksgiving parade marching bands apply two years in advance\n\n\n\nFor marching bands, it's an honor to be selected to perform in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The application process requires careful planning, as materials must be submitted nearly two years before the desired performance date.\n\nOnly 12 supremely talented marching bands are selected each year. Some of last year's winners included the NYPD Police Band, the Ohio University Marching 110 and the United States Air Force Band. Groups pay their own way to the parade.\n\nMore than 50 million people watch the Thanksgiving parade\n\nA major Thanksgiving tradition, approximately 50 million viewers tune into the parade from home each year. Another 3.5 million revelers head to the streets of New York City to watch the parade in person.\n\nPutting these numbers into perspective, Game 2 of the 2017 World Series attracted 15.5 million viewers. If you're planning to visit Manhattan but don't want to stand in the crowd, several hotels on the route have rooms overlooking the parade. Do note: Travel site Oyster warns hotels might charge up to three times the price of standard rates.\n\nThe Macy's parade is the joint effort of 10,000 people\n\nPutting on an event as large as the Macy's parade requires a tremendous amount of assistance. A total of 10,000 people work together to make it a success, including more than 4,000 Macy's employees from across the Northeast who volunteer their time to the parade. Staffers serve in a wide variety of roles, including balloon handler and balloon pilot.\n\nFrom the artists who create the enormous helium balloons to the people who work all night to assemble the floats after they arrive in Manhattan, this is a major team effort. Considering roughly 10,000 people march in the Macy's parade, it might seem like it's relatively easy to join in, but it's not. Since this Thanksgiving tradition launched in 1924, participation has been limited to Macy's employees, their families and those with relationships to sponsors or others affiliated with the event.\n\nPerforming talent is the only exception to the rule. There are no reserved tickets available to purchase for the grandstand seating area, so arrive early if you want to stake out a good spot."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Mississippi Sen.

But while people are planning to spend more, they're still seeking a bargain. Almost nine of 10 say they're looking for deals on holiday gifts, the retail coupon site said in a study.\n\nAs consumers plan their shopping strategies for Friday, they may want to educate themselves on retail trends to make sure they aren't missing out on a deal -- or overpaying for their gifts. Contrary to popular opinion, the best values aren't always available on Black Friday. But at the same time, waiting too long raises the risks of encountering out-of-stock products.\n\n\"The timing of the calendar plays a role in when and where consumers do the bulk of their holiday spending,\" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser of NPD Group. \"It's up to retailers to make the most of the days on the calendar by delivering the promotional value, product offerings, and shopping experience that the consumer desires.\"\n\nBut consumers also need to do their research. Here are five surprises experts say shoppers should be aware of when making their plans for Black Friday.\n\nBest place to buy Amazon devices may not be Amazon\n\nIf you're looking for an Amazon Echo or another Amazon device, the best option may not be Amazon itself. That's because Kohl's is offering many of the devices for the same Black Friday price as Amazon, with the addition of $15 back in Kohl's Cash when consumers spend at least $50. Kohl's Cash is a coupon that lets you spend its face value on store merchandise.\n\nFor instance, the Echo will be sold for $69 at both Amazon and Kohl's Black Friday sales, but Kohl's will also provide a $15 Kohl's Cash coupon.\n\nThere are some caveats, said Sarah Hollenbeck, shopping and retail expert at Blackfriday.com.\n\n\"One thing to keep in mind with the Kohl's Cash is that the deal is valid only through Dec. 5, so shoppers should make sure they have plans to spend it quickly,\" she said.\n\nThe other issue to keep in mind is that Amazon is offering an Amazon Smart Plug -- a device that works with Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to add voice control to outlets -- for $5 when shoppers buy an Echo device. The smart plug normally retails for about $25.\n\n\"If you're in the market for a smart plug, that could be a better \"extra\" with your Echo purchase than soon-to-expire Kohl's cash,\" Hollenbeck noted.\n\nFor some products, it pays to wait until after Black Friday\n\nSome products get cheaper closer to Christmas day, which means you may not find a great bargain on Black Friday. Toys are a prime category where it pays to wait until the week before Christmas, when prices may be slashed by as much as 50 percent, according to NerdWallet.\n\nOther categories where patience pays are Christmas decorations, bedding (bargains can be found in January) and winter clothing, NerdWallet said.\n\nIn-store pickup and shipping: Do your research\n\nEveryone wants a deal on shipping -- whether that's free shipping or arranging for in-store pickup, which can avoid the hassle of competing with crowds for doorbuster or other sales. But it's important to understand that in-store pickups have some limits.\n\nAt Macy's, for instance, in-store pickup may apply only to what's in stock in a particular location, rather than the retailer's entire inventory. In-store pickup is also cheaper for retailers than offering free shipping.\n\nAnd speaking of free shipping, not every retailer is offering it this year, which means shoppers should do their research before clicking on \"ship to me.\" Macy's offers free shipping for orders over $99 -- but otherwise charges $10.95 for delivery in the continental U.S.\n\nBeware out-of-stock products\n\nWith a jump in demand, some stores may sell out of inventory. For instance, stores may report being out-of-stock on some electronics like computers, tablets and TVs starting on Thanksgiving Day, according to an analysis from Adobe. Appliances like kitchen mixers could potentially go out of stock on Nov. 25, while apparel is at risk of selling out on Cyber Monday, which is a popular day for clothing sales, it added.\n\nDon't forget \"experiential\" gift deals\n\nConsumers increasingly want \"experiential\" gifts, like bottles of wine, food or event tickets, according to NPD, which found that four of 10 consumer said they would give these types of gifts this year.\n\nThat means consumers shouldn't overlook deals from subscription services like Amazon's Audible or travel deals. For instance, what's termed \"Travel Deal Tuesday\" -- Nov. 27 -- is one of the best days of the year to buy airline tickets, according to analysis site Hopper.\n\nIt's forecasting that tickets to London will be available at a 41 percent discount from their typical price. Airlines such as Icelander and Cathay Pacific are also planning to offer deals on Nov. 27, Hopper said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Teacher allegedly murdered by her ex, a former judge, in front of their kids", "description": "In 2014, then-Cuyahoga County judge Lance Mason attacked Aisha Fraser so badly, she had to have facial reconstruction surgery", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-ohio-judge-accused-of-murdering-ex-wife-aisha-fraser/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/2ef52aed-b1c4-4ebe-b76a-2da1db11b1bb/thumbnail/1200x630/4be4f6b2e28a32589be0845d624900c4/nfa-diaz-judge-wife-murder-needs-trk-and-gfx-frame-2680.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:08:57Z", "content": "Former Ohio judge Lance Mason is under investigation for the murder of his ex-wife.

In four days, a GoFundMe page had raised almost $125,000 for Fraser's daughters, who witnessed their mother's death.\n\nAccording to family, the daughters will be adopted by Fraser's best friend. Fraser made those arrangements recently in case something happened to her, because she feared her ex-husband.\n\n\"Aisha was goodness personified.

An unpiloted test flight currently is planned for March -- a specific date has not been announced -- followed by a piloted flight to the station in August. Boeing will use United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rockets to boost Starliner spacecraft into orbit.\n\nBoth companies still face a variety of technical hurdles, and the dates are tentative at best.\n\nBoeing has encountered propulsion problems in the Starliner's abort system and is behind schedule on key tests while SpaceX faces \"serious difficulties,\" according to the NASA Aerospace Advisory Panel, including concerns about high-pressure helium tanks used in the Falcon 9 booster and parachute issues with the Crew Dragon.\n\nBut SpaceX officials say the company is on track for launch in January and that hardware processing, crew training and ground support preparations are proceeding as planned.\n\nHowever it plays out, NASA managers are hopeful one or both companies will be certified to begin operational crew rotation flights sometime next year, ending the agency's reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, the only available transportation for U.S., European, Canadian and Japanese astronauts since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.\n\nThe unpiloted Crew Dragon flight coming up in January, known as Demo-1 on the SpaceX manifest, will launch from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. Liftoff is expected around 11:57 p.m. EST (GMT-5) when Earth's rotation carries the pad into the plane of the station's orbit.\n\nOnce released from the Falcon 9, the spacecraft is expected to carry out an autonomous rendezvous with the International Space Station, gliding in to a docking at the lab's recently modified forward port where shuttles once berthed. After a short stay, the capsule will undock and return to Earth with an ocean splashdown.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post reported NASA is launching a major review of the safety \"cultures\" at both Boeing and SpaceX. In a statement, NASA said the review is intended \"to ensure the companies are meeting NASA's requirements for workplace safety, including the adherence to a drug-free environment.\"\n\n\"We fully expect our commercial partners to meet all workplace safety requirements in the execution of our missions and the services they provide the American people,\" the statement continued. \"As always, NASA will ensure they do so.\"\n\nThe Post, citing sources, reported the review was triggered in part by the recent behavior of SpaceX founder Elon Musk \"after he took a hit of marijuana and sipped whisky on a podcast streamed on the internet.\"\n\nA SpaceX spokesman told CBS News human spaceflight \"is the core mission of our company\" and \"there is nothing more important to SpaceX than this endeavor.\"\n\n\"We take seriously the responsibility that NASA has entrusted in us to safely and reliably carry American astronauts to and from the International Space Station,\" he said. \"For years, our engineers have worked side-by-side with NASA, creating a strong partnership and guiding the development of Crew Dragon, one of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.\"\n\nHe said the company actively promotes workplace safety and managers are confident \"that our comprehensive drug-free workforce and workplace programs exceed all applicable contractual requirements.\"\n\nFor its part, a Boeing spokesman said the company's culture \"ensures the integrity, safety and quality of our products, our people and their work environment. As NASA's trusted partner since the beginning of human spaceflight, we share the same values and are committed to continuing our legacy of trust, openness and mission success.\"\n\nThe commercial crew program grew out of a NASA-sponsored competition that began in 2011 and ended in September 2014 when the agency announced Boeing and SpaceX would share $6.8 billion to develop independent space taxis, the first new U.S. crewed spacecraft since the shuttle.\n\nSpaceX is building the Crew Dragon under a $2.6 billion contract. SpaceX also holds NASA contracts valued at more than $2 billion for 20 space station cargo missions using unpiloted Dragon capsules. A subsequent contract for an unspecified amount covers another six cargo flights.\n\nBoeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract for CST-100 Starliner development.

It's based on an essay from years ago by Roger Rosenblatt.\n\nIt contains items big and small -- the New Yorkers who texted us when they found our lost dog. Stumptown Coffee Roasters. At the top of my inventory this year are the people you never get to see at \"CBS This Morning\" but whose work you see every time you watch the show. If there's a piece you liked, or a question that helped you learn something, or simply if the show has become a part of your morning, it's these colleagues you have to thank.\n\nThey interrupt their plans to chase stories and bring you the people at the heart of them. They create entire villages in random spots to bring you live reports. They capture just the right shot and make sure the sound and lighting sing. They sit in windowless edit rooms solving a thousand puzzles under hairy deadlines. They stay up all night as stories break while you sleep. They track information so we get it just right, and their graphics helps make the complex understandable.\n\nThey churn page after page of scripts, tweaking words sometimes until just seconds before we say them. They make our hair and makeup and clothes look just so, in order for us to be at our best for the crew that manages the cameras, cables and chaos during the live broadcast.\n\nThose of us in front of the camera work hard to do work that is worthy of that collective dedication.\n\nSo while you gather around your table all those you are grateful for, we are grateful for all those gathered around our table each week. And one final note of gratitude: to all of you out there watching.

Circuit Court rules on the constitutionality of Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel to lead the probe into Russian meddling in U.S. elections.

She is an epidemiologist at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUssery pointed out that sitting may not be bad in itself, but is a proxy for not getting enough exercise.\n\nStudy co-author Peter Katzmarzyk added, \"In recent years, we have begun to understand the health hazards of excessive sitting.\"\n\nAlthough all the reasons why prolonged sitting is unhealthy aren't known, Katzmarzyk speculates that \"when people sit, they deactivate the large muscles in their legs, and this has a host of metabolic consequences that seem to be harmful.\"\n\nMore and better efforts are needed to get people moving, said Katzmarzyk, who is associate executive director of population and public health sciences at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. \"Programs that increase physical activity and reduce sitting might be especially effective at reducing health risks,\" he noted.\n\nAnother health expert agreed.\n\n\"The three leading causes of premature death in the United States over the past quarter-century and more are tobacco use, poor diet and lack of physical activity,\" said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center.\n\nAs smoking has declined, poor diet and lack of exercise are becoming the leading causes of early death and chronic disease, he explained.\n\nMany people sit much of the day, and many do little actual exercise. \"One in 10 miss out on the benefits of both exercise and intermittent daily motion,\" Katz said.\n\nSimply standing up, moving more and sitting less can be beneficial to your health, he noted.\n\n\"With a growing menu of options, from standing and treadmill desks, to walking meetings, to chairs that involve constant motion -- it's a step nearly all should be able to find a way to take,\" Katz said.\n\nThe new edition of the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans says that any amount of physical activity -- even two minutes' worth -- can add up to huge health benefits.\n\nWhen the new guidelines were released recently, Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said, \"Physical activity is about finding opportunities to add movement throughout the day as part of a bigger commitment to healthy living.\"\n\nBeing inactive causes 10 percent of early deaths in the United States, according to Giroir. If 25 percent of inactive people got at least the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week, nearly 75,000 premature deaths could be prevented.\n\nAccording to the new guidelines:\n\nA single bout of physical activity can sharpen your mind, reduce your anxiety, lower your blood pressure, improve your sleep and strengthen your body's ability to convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nRegular physical activity can improve your brain health, reduce your risk of eight different forms of cancer, and lower your risk for excess weight gain.\n\nChronic health conditions improved by physical activity include osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, anxiety and depression.\n\nThe latest report was published Nov. 20 in the Journal of the American Medical Association."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Spike in caste-based violence in India", "description": "In India, there's been a spike in caste-based violence against Dalits, formerly known as untouchables.

He is not Peck, he says, but he will be Atticus. \"So all these people who love this book, all these people who loved Gregory Peck \u2013 delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete,\" Daniels says for effect. \"I'm originating the role as far as I am concerned.

Sorkin and his partners, including director Bartlett Sher and producer Scott Rudin, had to contend with a lawsuit brought by the manager of Lee's estate who accused the production of not being faithful to the \"spirit of the novel.\" The parties settled out of court earlier this year.\n\nThe play is written for today's audience, Sorkin tells Kroft, but says everyone will recognize it. \"There is no event in the play that does not occur in the book.

The new regulations would be an amendment to Title IX, which protects students from sex-based discrimination and provides colleges with guidelines on how to handle sexual assault claims.\n\nCritics argue the proposed changes protect institutions and harm survivors by narrowing the definition of sexual assault, requiring cross-examinations and letting schools have nearly free reign in how they address assault cases, among other aspects.\n\nAnja Chivukula, a sophomore at Columbia University and a student activist, plans to challenge the proposed regulations. Since the start of her freshman year, she has worked on the board of No Red Tape, a campus organization that pushes for campus policies that ensure the safety and well-being of sexual assault survivors. She said the proposed rules threaten her personal safety as well as the safety of other students, starting with the narrowed definition of sexual harassment.\n\nTitle IX currently defines sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. But the proposed regulations define sexual harassment as \"unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient's education program or activity.\"\n\nAyanna Runcie\n\nChivukula said \"the federal government has endorsed a standard which deems some forms of sexual misconduct to no longer be sexual misconduct. And to know that the university may in some ways abide by that standard doesn't make me feel that safe. It's almost like giving carte blanche to people who would perpetuate that type of sexual harassment.\"\n\nShe said the most problematic aspect of Devos' proposal is that schools are not required to investigate student assault cases that occur off campus. \"Just on a practical level, many students live off campus \u2026 so many assaults take place off campus,\" Chivukula said.\n\nAside from living off campus, many students are required to attend off-campus events, said Vassiki Chauhan, a graduate student at Dartmouth.\n\nShe said she was personally victimized in that kind of setting: she alleges she was raped by former professor Paul Whalen last April when he asked her to meet for drinks.\n\nShe and six other students have since filed a lawsuit against Dartmouth because they believe the school mishandled years of ongoing sexual assault claims against Whalen and other professors.\n\n\"In our case, some of the most atrocious acts were committed during out-of-state conferences, which are events that sexual harassers treat as hunting grounds,\" Chauhan said. \"Does the new regulation expect women to cower on campus rather than seeking opportunities to further their careers nationally and internationally?\"\n\nChauhan's lawyer, Deborah Marcuse, said the proposed regulations allow schools to evade their responsibility to protect students.\n\n\"Cases like ours are not about a few bad apples tainting a righteous institutional landscape,\" Marcuse said. \"Rather, they are about institutional cultures that foster gender discrimination and sexual misconduct instead of equality and educational opportunity for women.\"\n\n\"These regulations tend to favor institutional interests over the rights of any individuals, victims or accused -- this is what is most troubling to me,\" Marcuse said.\n\nSchools would also have less responsibility in responding to on-campus assaults, according to activists. The new rules say campus administrators could respond in any way that is not \"deliberately indifferent.\"\n\nColumbia's Chivukula said the regulation should mandate schools to do whatever they can to help survivors, instead of allowing schools to do anything above nothing. She also said the lack of accountability for schools creates an \"uphill battle\" for sexual assault survivor advocacy groups.\n\n\"It's frustrating to know that the federal government can enstate these kind of changes and there is nothing I can do about it, except fight it at my local school,\" Chivukula said.\n\nClarissa Brooks, a campus organizer for Know Your IX and regional adviser for It's On Us at Spelman College, believes the new regulations put students in danger and can lead to prolonged investigations.\n\nDuring the possibly prolonged investigations, the accused would be allowed to cross-examine the accuser in campus hearings, as well as review and respond to all evidence. Brooks said she has seen evidence that includes things like financial records, text messages, or physical evidence of assault. She stressed that handing these over to the assailant places more trauma on the survivor.\n\n\"It also gives the assailant access to your friends' phone numbers, your family's phone numbers -- it's just unsafe,\" she said.\n\nChivukula said that one positive thing that can come from the regulation is the ability to resolve a formal complaint informally. An \"informal resolution process\" can be achieved through, for example, mediation that doesn't involve a full investigation, according to the proposed rules. Previously, a formal complaint of \"broadly defined sexual harassment\" could not be resolved through informal resolution, according to Chivukula.\n\n\"But the worry is that education institutions might have motive to nudge survivors towards [informal resolutions],\" she added.\n\nSupporters, however, said the regulations are a positive step in protecting people from being accused unfairly.\n\n\"Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\" Secretary Devos said in a statement. \"We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process.\"\n\nJustin Dillon, who has represented dozens of accused students and is a partner at the law firm KaiserDillon, said, \"There is no better way to test the truthfulness of an accusation than by questioning the accuser during a live hearing.\"\n\n\"If colleges are going to adjudicate what are essentially crimes, then accused students deserve to have the tools to defend themselves effectively,\" he told The New York Times.\n\nSome activists, however, argue Devos is proposing a process that is anything but fair.\n\n\"There were issues with Title IX before Devos got there,\" Brooks said. \"Now we have to not only deal with those issues, but we are being pushed back even further. It's like we took one step forward to take ten steps back.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Reporter's Notebook: Giving thanks this holiday season", "description": "With the holiday season upon us, what better time to reflect on the things and people for whom we are most grateful.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis, however, insisted Wednesday that troops won't use such force.\n\nThe memo, dated Tuesday and signed by White House chief of staff John Kelly, says troops at the border \"may perform those military protective activities that the secretary of defense determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the protection of federal personnel, including a show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention, and cursory search.\"\n\n\"The deployed military personnel shall not, without further direction from you, conduct traditional civilian law enforcement activities, such as arrest, search and seizure in connection with the enforcement of the laws,\" says the memo, which was obtained by CBS News national security correspondent David Martin.\n\nThe Military Times first reported that such a memo existed, and Newsweek later obtained the memo written by Kelly, and another one signed by Mr. Trump. There are currently more than 5,700 troops at the border.\n\nMattis confirmed to reporters Wednesday that Kelly sent him a letter Tuesday evening authorizing new authorities, but he said \"there has been no call for any lethal force from DHS.\" Mattis said he is reviewing what instructions he will issue to troops on the border, but emphasized the the military \"will not be armed, not with a firearm.\" Military police will be armed \"with shields, not firearms,\" Mattis said, adding that troops \"do not have arrest authority.\"\n\nMattis said that if troops do witness someone beating a border patrol agent, they would intervene and hold onto the culprits just long enough \u2014 \"minutes\" \u2014 to turn them over to law enforcement. Mattis also said \"some of the troops\" will be home by Christmas. The total cost so far for deploying thousands of troops to the border is $72 million, although Mattis said he's \"confident\" that number will increase.\n\n\"If an army unit along the border sees an agent in distress or is informed of one, the general view is that they can probably go to their aid to safeguard themselves or the agent,\" George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told CBS News' Sara Cook. \"But in terms of the systemic use of the military like we have today, this is far more problematic, and runs contrary to statutory and constitutional norms. What the president has done would not normally be viewed as a legitimate use of the military. There have been no reports of agents at risk along the border. The use of the military to law down concertina wire and perform tasks gets dangerously close to law enforcement functions.\"\n\nThe White House eventually responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"The brave men and women at Customs Border and Protection willingly put themselves in extremely dangerous situations every day to protect Americans and their families. The president's authorization ensures the Department of Defense can step in to protect those who protect us,\" deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement.\n\nThe memo, signed shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday, represents the Trump administration's latest crackdown on border security and illegal immigration. Mr. Trump has fumed over immigration as a caravan of migrants approaches the southern border, and has, through the Pentagon, directed thousands of troops to support border personnel there.\n\nMr. Trump has appeared to make conflicting comments in the past as to whether he believes troops can use force at the border. In announcing a new asylum policy, the president said in early November that troops should treat any rocks thrown at them like \"a rifle\" and respond accordingly.\n\n\"We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently,\" he said. \"You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We're not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We're going to consider \u2014 and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle.\"\n\nBut he also said he would hope that troops wouldn't use force, and acknowledged that the troops are to support border personnel already there."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Brother arrested over fire possibly linked to mysterious mansion deaths", "description": "Investigation into a mansion fire in a small, affluent New Jersey community where two adults and two children were found dead takes a turn", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colts-neck-new-jersey-deaths-paul-caneiro-jailed-over-blaze-possibly-linked-to-mansion-deaths/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/81d73e7f-d6af-43ab-b6d2-97d0fd1062d4/thumbnail/1200x630/e27e272088c7faac86b1e57aad323577/1121-ctm-njmasionmurders-dahler-1717333-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:08:01Z", "content": "COLTS NECK, N.J. -- The investigation into a mansion fire in a small, affluent New Jersey community where two adults and two children were found dead took a turn Wednesday when authorities arrested the brother of the man who owned the house.

Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!\"\n\nWhile the fall in oil prices doesn't yet match the 2014-2016 slump to $26 per barrel, the current slump should soon make itself felt through the global economy. The international crude benchmark, Brent, has fallen under $65 per barrel from a four-year high in early October over $86, and U.S. crude has dropped below $55 a barrel.\n\nRetailers in the U.S., who depend on heavy Christmas spending, should see a boost as lower gasoline prices give consumers more spare cash to spend on gifts. But falling investment in new rigs in oil-producing U.S. states could offset the overall impact on economic growth.\n\n\"The key point to remember here is that lower oil prices are now a net drag on the U.S. economy. This is a huge break from the past,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nShepherdson said the oil price drop wasn't a major threat to the U.S. economy but would make a difference in growth \"at the margins\" as the U.S. slows once the boost from recent tax cuts fades.\n\nIt's also different this time for Russia, which fell into recession after the last oil slump. Analysts say the major oil and gas producer is more insulated from a market drop because it has found ways to balance the state budget at lower oil prices than before. That's one reason Russia has been pumping oil at top speed recently.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says abundant global oil supplies should be welcomed as insurance against market volatility. It says lower prices are also a big break for people in developing countries who have seen fuel prices rise due to a stronger U.S. dollar, the currency oil is denominated in.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has been driven by calls for major producers to increase production. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Russia have all stepped up output. One reason was fears of a price spike due to sanctions on Iran. But when Mr. Trump imposed them Nov. 5, he added a six-month waiver for several countries that are major consumers of Iranian oil. Instead of spiking, prices have slumped. Concerns about slowing global growth have also weighed on prices.\n\nMr. Trump may have contributed to the price decline with a tweet on Nov. 12: \"Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\" Saudi Arabia's oil minister had said a day earlier the country planned production cuts.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is under pressure over the reported killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey in October, adding another factor to the oil market equation. \"To avoid U.S. sanctions, Saudi Arabia may decide to backpedal on its intended production cuts,\" wrote analysts at Commerzbank.\n\nMore volatility could lie ahead. The IEA has warned that despite the temporary waivers, the U.S. still intends to block Iran's ability to export oil. Meanwhile OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries, could yet announc production cuts at its Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna. Commerzbank's analysts said that \"a production cut of at least 1 million barrels a day will probably be agreed there.\"\n\n\"We see the oil market as being in a phase of exaggeration and expect a noticeable price recovery after the OPEC meeting at the latest.\"\n\nThe U.S. oil contract traded at $54.73 a barrel by in afternoon trading in Europe on Wednesday, up $1.30. Brent crude was at $63.78, an increase of $1.25."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Fearful doctor called 911 moments before ex-fiance killed her, 2 others", "description": "Hospital gunman Juan Lopez fired at least 30 times before killing himself, authorities say", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-hospital-shooting-dr-tamara-oneal-called-911-moments-before-ex-fiance-juan-lopez-killed-her-2-others/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/20/fd84a3a3-5c6c-4999-bd36-0d6c7990e7ad/thumbnail/1200x630/ec6cf7722c5eb49784648a51dd80f87b/tamara-oneal.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:35:39Z", "content": "CHICAGO -- Moments before her ex-fiance fatally shot her in the parking lot of the hospital where she worked, a Chicago doctor called 911 to report that she had spotted the man and feared for her life.

As investigators tried to piece together the events that ended with the deaths of the doctor, a police officer, a hospital employee and the gunman, they were able to fill in details about the attack Monday at Mercy Hospital on the city's South Side.\n\nDr. Tamara O'Neal had recently called off her engagement to Juan Lopez so when she saw him, she called for help. She also told an acquaintance in the parking lot that she was afraid before that person retreated to the hospital to call 911 as well.\n\nWhen Lopez confronted her, the former couple argued about O'Neal calling off the engagement, and Lopez demanded that she return the engagement ring. Then, police said, people inside and around the hospital heard gunfire.\n\nCBS Chicago\n\nO'Neal fell to the ground. Witness James Gray looked out of the hospital window to see where the gunshots had come from and watched as Lopez \"stood over her and shot her three more times,\" he told reporters.\n\nAs a squad car pulled up, Lopez turned his Glock semi-automatic handgun on police, striking the vehicle multiple times before he ran into the hospital. Officers gave chase.\n\nOnce inside the medical center, he kept firing at officers and at one point turned and fired at Dayna Less, a first-year resident in the hospital's pharmacy, when the doors of the elevator she was on opened.\n\nOfficer Samuel Jimenez was struck in the neck, just above the bulletproof vest he was wearing, and soon died. Jimenez had been delivering his station's mail to the post office when he turned and followed other squad cars racing to the hospital.\n\nThere were indications that Lopez wanted to shoot even more people, including an account from one witness, Jennifer Eldridge, who was hiding in the pharmacy, when she heard the gunfire and the sound of the gunman jiggling the handle of the locked door, an apparent effort to get in.\n\nDuring the exchange of gunfire, Lopez was shot once in the abdomen. It was then that Lopez, who fired a total of more than 30 shots and had reloaded his weapon, put the gun to his head and killed himself, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Tuesday.\n\nInvestigators said they found nothing to indicate that Lopez had a criminal record. At the time of his death, he was an employee with the Chicago Housing Authority, and officials there said there had been no reports of any problems in his nine months on the job.\n\nBut there were other signs of trouble in recent years.\n\nIn 2014, Lopez was kicked out of the city's firefighting academy after threatening a female cadet. When the fire department learned of the threats, Lopez was told he would be disciplined. But instead of returning to the academy to meet with department officials, Lopez went AWOL and was fired, fire department spokesman Larry Merritt said Tuesday.\n\nRecords from that same year indicate that a girlfriend of Lopez sought an order of protection against him because he was incessantly texting her. When she reported the texts to police, officers told her to change her phone number and seek an order of protection. Records show that she sought the order but not whether she ultimately received one, Guglielmi said.\n\nCBS Chicago\n\nCBS Chicago reports the requested protection order claimed Lopez \"slept with a pistol under his pillow\" and that she feared her safety was in jeopardy.\n\nLopez had a permit to possess a concealed firearm, and it was unclear if officials knew about the 2014 complaint when the permit was granted, said Guglielmi, who said Lopez had legally purchased four guns in the last five years. It was also unclear whether an order of protection, if granted, would have forbidden Lopez from owning weapons.\n\nWhen it was over, the Chicago Police Department was grieving just days before Thanksgiving for the second officer in less than a year to be killed in the line of duty. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was fatally shot in February while pursuing a suspect in the Loop business district.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson wanted the city to know just how heroic Jimenez and the other officers who chased Lopez were.\n\n\"They saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said late Monday.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel, speaking at the same news conference at the hospital, reminded the city of what had been lost.\n\nThe three victims were \"all going about their day, all doing what they loved,\" he said. \"This just tears at the soul of our city.

Yet in recent weeks, news about lead-contaminated water and sluggish government responses are surfacing across the nation from cities including Newark, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and Milwaukee.\n\nThere is no acceptable level of lead in drinking water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. So why are so many municipalities, homeowners and schools still finding lead in their systems today?\n\nOne reason may be aging infrastructure and the cost to replace old water pipes and lead solder used in household plumbing. Drinking water is delivered via 1 million miles of pipes across the U.S., much of them laid in the early- to mid-20th century with a lifespan of 75 to 100 years, according to a 2017 report from the the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n\n\nThose pipes are being replaced at an average rate of 0.5 percent a year -- at that pace it would take roughly two centuries to renew the whole system at a cost of around $1 trillion, according to one estimate from the American Water Works Association. Meanwhile, a 2016 CNN report found that more than 5,000 U.S. water systems serving roughly 18 million people violated EPA rules for lead in water.\n\nThe last-mile problem\n\n\n\nA September report from the Government Accountability Office outlines one reason it can be difficult to pinpoint when and where lead issues may pop up: Many problems lurk in pipes that link a municipal system to homes, and those links are often at least partly on private property. That makes it hard to locate them, especially given what the GAO notes is a lack of records about the locations of lead service lines.\n\nWhen the EPA's lead and copper rule was first implemented in 1991, the agency estimated that about 10 million lead lines were in service nationwide. An estimated 6.1 million remain in U.S. communities today, suggesting some progress in removing them, according to a 2016 AWWA study. The cost for the remaining removals? About $30 billion, the analysis estimated. Among the lines left, the largest concentration -- 3.4 million -- is in the Midwest.\n\nIn Newark, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council sued earlier this year after the organization said reports showed the city knew of lead in the water beginning in early 2017.\n\n\"The city has really been in denial and shrugged their shoulders and said our water is safe, people should drink it, until just a couple of weeks ago -- until we sued them and asked for an injunction on behalf of the citizens in Newark to clean up the water,\" the NRDC's Erik Olson told CBS News earlier this month.\n\nThe group sued Newark for violating the federal drinking water law, saying lead levels are \"some of the highest\" of \"any large city\" nationally, a problem the NRDC compared to Flint. Newark officials told CBS it's changing the way it treats water at one plant and is embarking on a lead-pipe replacement program.\n\nBut Newark is still looking into how it pays to replace aging lead pipes without putting a big burden on residents, Politico reported. New Jersey freed up $500 million in bonds to help its cities pay for the problem, but many residents still can't afford their share of the bill. Newark can only guarantee replacing lead pipes with copper ones that won't top $1,000 for homeowners. Newark needs more help from the state or EPA to slice costs, Politico said.\n\nCertified testing is best\n\n\n\nLead in water is invisible and odorless. It can enter drinking water when pipes that contain lead corrode. That happens when water is high in acid that induces corrosion in pipes and fixtures.\n\nTesting at the tap using a certified lab is the best way to measure levels in household water, according to the AWWA. And the EPA recommends a state certification officer for consumers who choose to have their own water tested. It can be hard to test for results on your own.\n\nAnother problem, according to the GAO, is a lack of information about the private property locations of lines to homes from public systems.\n\nThe GAO noted that, of 43 states that responded to an EPA inquiry on lead in 2016, 39 reported that they had encouraged water systems to publicize inventories of such pipes. Few, though, completed those plans. Of the 100 largest U.S. water systems, just 12 had provided public information on the inventory of lead service lines as of January 2018, the GAO report found. Among states, the EPA lists Massachusetts and Washington as the leaders in lead line replacement efforts.\n\n\"By sharing information with all states about the approaches that some states and water systems are using to successfully identify and publicize information about lead service lines, including responses to potential challenges, EPA could encourage states to be more transparent to the public and support the agency's objectives for safe drinking water,\" the GAO concluded.\n\nA need for urgent action\n\n\n\nIn April, the EPA announced new funding of as much as $5.5 billion in loans to help fund projects through the federal Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program.\n\nAnd this summer, the EPA's Office of Inspector General said the agency must take steps to react more quickly during public health emergencies. Flint's tap water became contaminated with lead in 2014 after officials switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River.\n\nOne recent EPA update of a \"toolkit\" for schools and child care centers stresses how to address potential contamination more clearly, according to some watchdog groups.\n\n\"Overall, the new toolkit is an improvement,\" the nonprofit advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund wrote in an October post. \"While the protocol itself is largely the same, the new toolkit is more user friendly and written for the non-technical audience, making it more likely that school and child care staff will use it.\"\n\n-- CBS MoneyWatch's Irina Ivanova contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "In shadow of tragedy, Meghan Markle helps bring Thanksgiving spirit to U.K.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex is helping to spread the Thanksgiving spirit in the U.K. Meghan Markle visited Hubb, a community kitchen in London that provides kitchen space and meals for local residents who were hit by tragedy.

He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents released Tuesday by the Justice Department.\n\nThe nonprofit group, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog promoting ethics and transparency. The tax-exempt group is supposed to serve the public interest without supporting or opposing specific candidates for office. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party. The group does not disclose its donors.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe documents show that Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company, which was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor's Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors. Though such tax-exempt groups can legally withhold the identity of their contributors and generally do so, there may be a distinct irony when a group dedicated to transparency keeps its funding sources in the shadows.\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Senate's top Democrat asked the Justice Department's watchdog to investigate communications between Whitaker and the White House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked the inspector general to look into whether Whitaker had access to confidential grand jury information in Mueller's probe. Schumer also wants investigators to examine whether Whitaker shared information with Trump or others in the administration.\n\nJohn Lavinsky, a spokesman for the DOJ inspector general, declined to comment on Schumer's request.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, had been overseeing the special counsel's Russia investigation until Whitaker's appointment. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation, a move that was questioned by skeptics of the Trump administration.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker's past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump's campaign.\n\nAfter Whitaker's appointment, Schumer called for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation and said he would seek to tie a measure protecting Mueller to must-pass legislation if he refuses to do so.\n\nWhitaker's past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump's family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Whitaker also authored an op-ed for CNN in 2017 questioning the scope of Mueller's investigation.\n\nOn Monday, three other Senate Democrats \u2014 Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 filed a lawsuit arguing that Whitaker's appointment was unconstitutional because he has not been confirmed by the Senate. The Justice Department issued a statement Monday defending Whitaker's appointment as \"lawful.\"\n\n\"We are left with no recourse but to seek a court order,\" Blumenthal told reporters earlier this week.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Schumer's request on Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "How to diffuse tension at the Thanksgiving table", "description": "A CBS News poll finds 40 percent of people try to avoid politics on Thanksgiving.

Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are scheduled to discuss the trade situation at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month. If those things transpire, he said, the stock market will settle down.\n\n\"All they have to do is agree on a high-level framework that can delay the increase in the tariffs,\" Young said. \"If the Fed is more dovish and we get some positive news on China, we can have a solid end to the year.\"\n\nMixed messages on trade\n\nStill, analysts question if the world's two largest economies can ease tensions. New national security regulations proposed by the Trump administration, which could limit exports of high-tech products in fields like quantum computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, have weighed heavily on the technology sector.\n\n\"Market sentiment next week will be driven by the tone of the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China ahead of the proposed meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi at the G20 summit at the end of this month,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, said in a note. \"While Trump has appeared confident that a deal is in the making, key members of his administration, including last week Vice President Pence, have taken a much tougher line.\"\n\nA 21-nation summit in Papua New Guinea, which ended without a final communique, has put the trade dispute between the U.S. and China in the spotlight.

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\"Her brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\" said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \"And unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\"\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years : fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg's \u2014 troubles.\n\nZuckerberg indicated Sandberg's job is secure in an interview televised by CNN late Tuesday. \"She has been an important partner for me for 10 years,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I am really proud of the work we have done together and hope we work together for decades more to come.\"\n\nHe also told CNN he intends to remain Facebook's chairman, despite intensifying pressure from some investors who believe he should relinquish that role. \"I am certainly not currently thinking that that that makes sense,\" he said.\n\nSandberg's role\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \"aggressive lobbying campaign\" against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \"heat shield\" for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \"Lean In\" about women and leadership. Her second book, \"Plan B,\" is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\"It's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\" crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \"She has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with 'Lean In.'\"\n\nCambridge Analytica\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\"Every day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\" he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \"public fallout\" over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \"face inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\"\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \"adult\" in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away . But Levick believes Sandberg can begin to restore her image by acknowledging her role in causing Facebook's problems instead of blaming external forces beyond her control: \"The kneejerk response 'poor, poor me' is not the solution.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Meghan Markle cooks with Grenfell Tower fire victims", "description": "The women at London's Hubb Community Kitchen simply call the Duchess \"Meghan\" thanks to a year-long bond formed through food", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meghan-markle-brings-thanksgiving-spirit-to-london-community-kitchen/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/21/683ba98d-9d60-4d40-8e81-adaad972564d/thumbnail/1200x630/adc73876394346fd40b1bcf501aed4c3/gettyimages-1064038960.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:27:46Z", "content": "Meghan Markle is helping to spread the Thanksgiving spirit in the United Kingdom by visiting a community kitchen in London that offers kitchen space and meals for local residents that have been hit by tragedy.

He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China as part of a wide anti-corruption sweep there.\n\nKim, a police official in South Korea, was serving as interim president after Meng's departure from the post and was senior vice president at Interpol.\n\nRussia's Interior Ministry said after the vote that Prokopchuk, who is one of three vice presidents at Interpol, will continue his role in that position.\n\nMost of Interpol's 194 member-countries attended the organization's annual assembly this year, which was held in an opulent Dubai hotel along the Persian Gulf coast.\n\nInterpol was facing a pivotal moment in its history as delegates decided whether to hand its presidency to Prokopchuk or Kim, who were the only two candidates vying for the post.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, the 95-year-old policing body is best known for issuing \"red notices\" that identify suspects pursued by other countries, effectively putting them on the world's \"most-wanted\" list.\n\nCritics say countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists, even though its rules prohibit the use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nThe agency faced criticism two years ago when Interpol's member-states approved Meng as president for a four-year term. Amnesty International has criticized \"China's longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\"\n\nIn 2016, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nStill, member countries can issue requests, known as diffusions, directly to other countries using Interpol's communication system, without going through the centralized Interpol vetting that's in place for red notices. Watchdog groups have urged Interpol to reform the diffusion system too.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, says Russia used the diffusion system against him, which led to his brief arrest in Spain earlier this year.\n\nBrowder and another prominent Kremlin critic warned Tuesday that electing Prokopchuk- who has ties to President Vladimir Putin- would have undermined the international law enforcement agency and politicized police cooperation across borders. Prokopchuk was in charge of facilitating Interpol warrants on behalf of Russia.\n\nA day before the Interpol vote, the White House came out publicly against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying \"the Russian government abuses Interpol's processes to harass its political opponents.\" He said the U.S. \"strongly endorses\" Kim.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was encouraging all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity. \"We believe Mr. Kim will be just that,\" he said.\n\nRussia, however, secured a win for its ally Serbia on Tuesday when Kosovo's bid to join Interpol failed to garner enough votes at the general assembly in Dubai. The move would have boosted Kosovo's efforts at recognition of its statehood. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "9 accused of bribing Skid Row homeless in voter fraud scheme", "description": "L.A.

But on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that she became the latest Republican incumbent to fall in the midterm election's Democratic wave that has seen more than three dozen Republican-held seats flipped across the country. CBS News has not yet estimated a winner in this race.\n\nBen McAdams, a Democratic mayor of Salt Lake County, defeated Love by fewer than 700 votes in a back and forth race that took two weeks to sort out in deep-red Utah.\n\nLove had a built-in advantage with Republican voters outnumbering Democrats three-to-one in the mostly suburban Salt Lake City district, but she never seemed to catch on with voters the way other Republican incumbents have in the state, said Damon Cann, a political science professor at Utah State University.\n\nShe tried to distance herself from President Donald Trump on trade and immigration and she highlighted the times she stood up to the president, like when Mr. Trump used an expletive to describe her parents' home country of Haiti.\n\nMr. Trump won Utah in 2016 but the state's voters have long been uncomfortable with his brash style and his comments about women and immigrants.\n\n\"She seemed to struggle a little bit more how to strike that balance without losing too many votes,\" Cann said.\n\nMr. Trump didn't appreciate her approach, calling her out by name in a news conference the morning after Election Day, where he also bashed other Republicans who he said lost because they didn't fully embrace him.\n\nLove, the first and only black female Republican in Congress, was seeking a third term. She said in a statement she planned to call McAdams, but didn't say if she would concede or congratulate him. She said she's traveling with family for Thanksgiving and won't speak about the race until Monday.\n\n\"Regardless of how you voted, I want to express my sincere appreciation to you for engaging in the process,\" Love said. \"It is one of many reasons this is the greatest country on earth.\"\n\nMcAdams touted himself as a moderate, and not a typical Democrat, in a pitch that seemed to resonate in the district where nearly four in 10 voters are independents. He also benefited from record voter turnout that was driven in part by a medical marijuana ballot proposal that spurred progressive voters to the polls, Cann said.\n\nMcAdams was an excellent candidate and also probably benefited from displeasure with Mr. Trump and the Republican party, Cann said.\n\n\"The winds were all at McAdams' back,\" Cann said.\n\nAP\n\nMcAdams will become the first Democratic member of Utah's congressional district since 2014 when longtime Rep. Jim Matheson retired.\n\n\"This race was about connecting with Utah,\" McAdams said. \"This race was about who was best positioned to serve Utah and working to not get it caught up in a national, partisan election.\"\n\nLove finished about 20 votes short of being able to request a recount in a race where about 269,000 votes were cast.\n\nThis is the second time she has lost a bid for Congress by a razor thin margin. In her first run in 2012, Love lost to incumbent Democrat Jim Matheson by 768 votes. She went on to defeat Democrat Doug Owens in 2014 and again in 2016.\n\nFor McAdams, it's a victory that validates his reputation as an emerging political force in Utah.\n\nHe is an attorney who graduated from Columbia Law School and practiced in New York before returning to his home state of Utah. He has been a political figure in the state for a decade. He was elected as one of the few Democrats in the GOP-dominated state Legislature in 2008 and successfully ran for the Salt Lake County mayor's seat four years later.\n\nHe became known for working with the state's Republican leaders on issues such as homelessness, where he backed a narrow Medicaid expansion to cover treatment and once went undercover as a homeless person when the issue reached crisis mode downtown.\n\nMcAdams said during the campaign he would not support California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker and insisting he'd be able to work with the president. He has already signed a letter along with 15 other Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi.\n\nHe sharply criticized Love's support for the GOP-backed tax overhaul and said she had not been available enough to her constituents at town halls.

The state law was passed a few months after Nagarwala's April 2017 arrest.

While working to undermine U.S. influence, Russia also seeks to weaken its opponents in Europe \u2013 principally by targeting societal and political cohesion, rather than military or defensive capabilities.\n\n\"We don't necessarily have a good answer to that as a defense problem,\" Vickers told Morell. \"It's something we need to work on, both how to defend very far forward or to achieve deterrence.\"\n\n\"But also, then, when they threaten to escalate because they know if the war goes on they will lose,\" he said, \"how do we manage that escalation to where they can't declare victory and go home?\"\n\nFor much more from Michael Morell's conversation with Michael Vickers, you can listen to the new episode and subscribe to Intelligence Matters here."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Genital mutilation charges dismissed in Detroit-area case", "description": "A federal judge in Detroit ruled Tuesday a federal law banning female genital mutilation is unconstitutional.

It is great to have you on the show.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nIt's a pleasure. Congratulations on the podcast.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThank you so much. I should start by telling people, acknowledging to people that you and I are close friends-- which grew out of us spending so much time together in the Situation Room, and grew out of you and I really seeing eye to eye on the importance of putting intense pressure on terrorist organizations that were trying to kill Americans.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo people need to know that you and I are friends here. Let me start by asking a question that I think many of our listeners will have: what is defense intelligence? And how does that differ from national level intelligence or strategic intelligence?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSo many of the intelligence organizations that comprise the 17-member intelligence community are defense organizations, about half of them. So four big national agencies: National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence agency, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and National Reconnaissance Office, and then the intelligence organizations of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corp. So they tend to focus more on defense issues, but also provide national intelligence in their respective domains. NSA and the Signals Intelligence Area and code making, code breaking; NGA in imagery interpretation and mapping.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd so when you were the undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, all of the defense intelligence entities reported to you, you were in charge of all of that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah. I exercised the secretary of defense's authority, direction, and control over the Defense Intelligence Enterprise-- which comprised all those elements, but in the national intelligence realm shared that responsibility with the DNI-- Jim Clapper.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd so some of the leaders of those organizations actually reported to both of you?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYes. Both to the secretary of defense, through me, and then to the DNI.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nMike, I know you're in the process of writing a book about your career-- and I can't wait to read it-- and we will have you back on the show when the book gets published to talk in detail about your time in government and all the things you did. But what I'd love to do today is to concentrate on the world today, what the U.S. is doing that is working, what the U.S. is doing that's not working, what your advice would be for the government going forward on those things. But I did want to ask you a couple of career-related questions just so people get a sense of who you are and what you've done-- all without really taking anything away from your book because I know your publisher wouldn't be happy about that. (LAUGH)\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSure.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBecause I've been through this myself.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYou've been through it, yeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo your time as a C.I.A. operations officer was dominated by working on what is known as the Afghan Program.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe C.I.A. covert action that provided support to the Freedom Fighters in Afghanistan who ultimately drove the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan-- and, quite frankly, which played a significant role in the ultimate fall, in my view, of the Soviet Union. So you have that on your resume, which is really cool thing. In fact, you even have a character in the movie, Charlie Wilson's War, who plays you-- (LAUGH)\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nIndeed.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--this really smart, chess-playing, C.I.A. weapons expert. So that's really cool, too. But I just have two questions about that time in your career. And the first is what role did you actually play in the program? What did you actually do?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSo I was formerly the program officer, which meant I was the principal officer within C.I.A. responsible for that program, reporting up to officers with more senior responsibility, the Chief of South Asian Operations that had not only Afghanistan and Pakistan in the director of the operations, but Iran to Bangladesh, his boss in the Northeast and South Asia division to the Deputy Director of Operations to the Director of Central Intelligence.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd how long did you do that--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI did that--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--for?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--for two years. '84 to '86, those were the divisive years when we decided to go for victory to drive the Soviets out. The strategy change was March of '85. And then--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat was the strategy change?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nIt was to shift from a strategy of imposing costs on the Soviet Union, but really without hopes of defeating them; just making their intervention in Afghanistan expensive to actually driving them out. And this was codified in a national security decision directive, a top secret compartmented directive at the time that since has been declassified-- called NSDD 166 that I helped author.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the change in strategy led to a significant change in what you were doing or how you were doing it and level of what you were doing?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYes. So there were additional resources provided to C.I.A. about a fivefold increase in resources in Charlie Wilson just before that. And that triggered a strategic review, a big interagency review that I know you're familiar with. And then the new strategy led to additional resources.\n\nSo within a scope of a year, the program increased by a factor of 11 times. And the quantity and quality of weapons, training, intelligence support, everything went dramatically up-- culminating in the decision to introduce the stinger surface to air missile system in March of 1986.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhich is critically important because the Soviet helicopters were wreaking havoc.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight. So it along with a lot of other weapons really changed the air balance pretty significantly. But a lot of other things contributed as well. And ironically, the Soviets-- you may remember, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power about the same time as our National Security directive in March of 1985, and he escalated the war; he did his own surge like our Iraq and Afghanistan surges of recent years-- but took his top general from Eastern Europe and put him in there, gave him one year to turn the situation around. So this was really a battle of surges in 1985. And we and the Afghan resistance won.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nGreat for the United States and for C.I.A. and--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nWell, with the tragic-- yes, it's the largest and most people say the most successful covert action program in in C.I.A.'s history -- but not without its tragic consequences eventually leading to 9/11.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So that's the other question I wanted to ask you. And that is did we get the aftermath of that success wrong, right? Did we not do some things that we should have done in Afghanistan-- post-that success, right? Because some of those Freedom Fighters ended up being terrorists. Are there things you think we could've done to prevent that unintended consequence?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah. So it was a series of -- the short answer is yes. I mean, we should've stayed engaged there. It was complicated by the fact that our main objective--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd you don't militarily, you mean politically--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nPolitically--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--and diplomatically--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--diplomatically with aid and also an intelligence presence and some security assistance. I don't mean militarily. But a couple things complicated that. One, Pakistan was on a path to developing nuclear weapons, and there was Congressional legislation that when they crossed a certain threshold toward that goal and the president couldn't certify that they hadn't crossed that threshold, we had a lot of aid to Pakistan and it had to be suspended. That occurred in 1990 right after -- the year after the Soviets withdrew, but there was still the insurgency going on 'till 1992 in Afghanistan.\n\nSecond, you know, as you know, the Berlin Wall fell, East Europe was liberated, the U.S. government, the Bush administration became very focused on consolidating its gains in Europe-- historical gains at the end of the Cold War, and thought Afghanistan and Pakistan was more a regional problem.\n\nEveryone knew there would be continued civil war. How long it would take the Resistance to win was a matter of some debate. But no one imagined at the time that it would become a sanctuary for a new global Jihadist terrorist organization and then with such tragic consequences for us.\n\nAnd then of course the Soviet Union collapsed, and (UNINTEL) turned a lot towards Russia. Afghanistan went into a brutal civil war for some years before the Taliban emerged in 1996 and then Al Qaeda came. So we had several opportunities-- albeit difficult ones to at least stay more engaged than we were-- I think it was a lack of strategic foresight.\n\nAnd then also the second phase of this as the Al Qaeda threat was developing to take more aggressive action across two administrations, just the beginning of the Bush administration, but a lot of Clinton years where we looked at options, but really didn't do much other than--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWe had two embassies attacked, we had a U.S. war ship attacked, and--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight. And so we knew--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--very little response.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYou know, and C.I.A. was warning about this growing threat, but we essentially didn't do enough, and it's one of the big lessons of counter terrorism, as you know, not to let them build up a sanctuary for that period of time. We would-- I hope we would never make that mistake again.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nLet me ask you one more question about the past before we jump to the issues of the day, Mike. You are one of the most non-partisan people that I know. I'm your friend, and I really don't know if you vote more Democrat or more Republican, I just have no idea; that's how non-partisan you are. But like me, you found yourself stepping out of that non-partisan role and endorsing Hillary Clinton. Why did you do that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI thought she was an effective Secretary of State in the years that we served with her with Bob Gates as Secretary of Defense and Leon Panetta at C.I.A., thought it was a very, very strong team-- the first Obama term. And I thought her foreign policy views based on that or national security views were more in line--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nShe was tough.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--with my traditional views.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nShe was--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nShe was pretty--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--tough.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--tough. And so that really shaped my-- I, you know, I'm not an isolationist, I believe the United States has to be engaged. If a Republican had looked just like Hillary Clinton or slightly different, you know, different economic philosophy or something, then I certainly would've remained neutral in that regard. You know, as you say, my tradition is more to be non-partisan. But in this case, I thought it was--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDid you have second --thoughts about doing that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah, it was my first and only, and I have had--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nMe, too.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--second thoughts just--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nMe, too.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n-- about to-- you know, as intelligence officers, we're trained to call it as we see it, but then stop there.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right. Okay, the world today. Mike, overall, how do you think the Trump administration is doing dealing with the national security threats and challenges that our country faces? Sort of what grade would you give the administration? And is there a difference in how you think about that grade between what the administration is actually doing and how the president talks about it? So how do you think in general about how they're doing?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah. So I do think there is a difference between how the president talks about foreign policy and national security strategy and what the administration actually does. There are some fine people in the administration who are doing very commendable work. And as you know, a lot of the business of the U.S. government goes on in the intelligence community; we continue to collect and analyze intelligence-- and prepare for conflict in the Department of Defense-- and engage in operations.\n\nSo overall-- I would give them reasonably good marks on further dismantling the global Jihadist threat both Al Qaeda and ISIS. The challenge will really be the strategic challenge has always been once you take them down, can you prevent their reconstitution?\n\nAnd so the jury is really out on that, and that's nested in the broader Middle East strategy and South and Central Asia strategy that I think there is some cause for concern particularly given the turbulence in the region. With Iran, the other sort of Middle Eastern threat, I think we made a mistake across two administrations by not making life more difficult for them and the Russians and Syria; I think we missed an opportunity.\n\nAnd I think our hands-off, indirect approach to the conflict in Yemen has resulted in a lot of civilian casualties and it's also produced indecisive results. And therefore the Iranians, with their proxy, the Houthis, have sort of hung on. So in terms of the concerns about Iran, in terms of regional meddling-- I don't think we've fully addressed that problem. I think new sanctions won't really address that in the same way as--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So let's maybe take these one at a time. So let's go back to counterterrorism for a second. How do you see the threat today from the global Jihadist movement? How would you characterize the threat today? You know, ISIS has essentially lost its caliphate. But how do you think about the threat today?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah. So as long as they don't have a sanctuary and time where they can plot global attacks, develop capabilities, new technologies, train operatives, that typically is a year to a few-year cycle, unless they have them handy. And so that threat, I think, has been diminished. The global Jihadist movement is either hanging on for dear life in various places or more dispersed, but they have footholds in a lot of different regions, in North Africa and Libya, they still have cells in Europe, in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, and then--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nEast Asia.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--Syria, Yemen, East Asia. The threat has grown some in Southeast Asia actually, which has been generally a more dormant theater. So their ability to mount really sophisticated, catastrophic attacks is certainly down, but not the threat of more local attacks in several regions.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd would you agree that if we don't keep the pressure on them in all of these places, that the risk of them developing the capability to attack us again is a real possibility?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYes. I think that--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat's what we learned at the end of the day--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nThat's what we learned.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--right?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nThat's what we learned at the end of the day. And so it's imperative to keep the pressure on, and that means leveraging our advantages in armed reconnaissance, drone warfare, essentially, but also the global network of partners that we built, and all the intelligence and security sharing with these countries that allow us to more nip threats in the bud, and that's essentially to keep the threat at manageable levels.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd is your sense that the administration is doing a pretty good job on that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI think in terms of keeping on the pressure on, in terms of the precision strikes and armed reconnaissance, yes, I think they're doing a pretty good job on that. In terms of-- and continuing to take some senior leaders off the battlefield, some very important ones, potentially. In terms of sustaining the global network of partners, which is sort of the other side of it, I think the jury's out a bit on that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBecause we're challenging our allies rather than embracing them in some cases?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight, right.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay, so back to Iran for a second. So were you a supporter of the Iran Nuclear Deal? Or did you have concerns about it? How did you think about it?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah, so both. I mean, I was a supporter at the end of the day because I think it was the, in purely nuclear terms, I think it was the best option we had to retard their program for a reasonable period of time. And so in that sense I think as a narrow arms control agreement, for all its faults in that area that it's not indefinite, it did buy us some time, and in that sense it was successful.\n\nIn terms of not being part of a broader, comprehensive Iran strategy where he pressure was taken off across the board, what pressure there had been before, which probably wasn't adequate to begin with-- then I don't think it could meet its intent. And so I think that criticism is fair in terms of not doing anything to restrain their proxy activities, their unconventional warfare--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So there's-- so I have two questions for you. One is, I don't think any administration has pushed hard enough back on what the Iranians do in the region.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI would agree with that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd my question is why do you think is that the case? Why have we not done that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nWell, I think it varies by case. So, you know, if you go back to the Reagan administration where they started building Hezbollah and kidnapping and torturing our diplomats and colleagues in the C.I.A. and--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBombing the--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nAnd bombing the--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--Embassy in Beirut--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\n--embassies, and the Marine barracks --\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYou know, I think that was viewed as a very local conflict, that if we disengaged, the problem would go away. And to some extent, it did, but it was a victory for Iran. And then I think if you look at the Bush administration-- there were just so many other things going on almost like the first Bush administration.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--we had Iran providing sophisticated IEDs to Shia militia groups in Iraq that were killing American soldiers.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight? And not much of a pushback.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight. So for instance, we did things against them in Iraq, but were hesitant about doing muc more than that or certainly some cross border things-- without going into details. And that puts you in the same kind of sandwich we found ourselves in in South East Asia where, you know, you draw the line in the conflict right here, and then you let the enemies on both sides treat you as a punching bag.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI think this is a good Ph.D. dissertation for anybody out there who wants to write about this because it's a really fascinating thing that we haven't sufficiently pushed back for a long, long time. But the strategy now, right, the administration strategy now is to put so much pressure on the Iranians by renewing sanctions that we're able to get a better nuclear deal, and we're able to change their behavior with regard to regional influence. What do you see as the prospects of the success of that strategy?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYou know, I think the goals are reasonable ones. I don't think the likelihood of success is all that high. Now right now the Iranians have a lot of domestic challenges, and so this is an opportune time to put more pressure on them. The challenge is whether we can rally the international community enough, particularly now that you have more great power interest in the Middle East, which hadn't really had in the past couple decades with Russia-- and Russia's not going to do a lot to help the Iranian economy, but others might in some regard.\n\nAnd so I'm not confident that more sanctions of the type we're envisioning will really lead to the outcome we want. They've weathered a lot, you know, in the past, and I don't see any reason to think that they couldn't. I think it would take a combination of hitting them back harder in other places as well as pressure. And then also importantly, rallying the international community, which is much tougher today than it was, say, ten years ago.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. You know, my thought was always let's get the nuclear deal and then let's turn the page to the regional interference and put, you know, internationally and a multi-lateral approach, put as much pressure on them on the regional issues that we put on the nuclear issue.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nAnd I think those should've been entwined. I mean, again, it was a different time, different adversary, much more dangerous. But with the Soviet Union, that's precisely what we did in the 1980s just because we did arms control agreements and some breathtaking ones that were very good things, we didn't take the pressure off in Afghanistan, we didn't take the pressure off globally or rallying our European allies, et cetera.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nExactly. All right, North Korea, where do you think we are?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI think tensions are down, which is good. North Korea is primarily a nuclear threat now, and a growing one, one that's made pretty dramatic progress in the past few years, both in weapons and delivery systems. I think the real danger for us in this is that we have started a process that, diplomatically, that may get out of control for us.\n\nWe have very, very ambitious objectives that are keyed -- very rapid denuclearization -- that are keyed to this warming of relations. But it's not clear at the end that North Korea may be able to use this diplomatically to separate South Korea from us because South Korea looks like they're all in now on this warming of relations. And so if we decide, wait, you're not fulfilling your end of the bargain-- the train may have left the station at that point, and you may end up with a worse position in Northeast Asia than we have now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo would you agree though that testing the proposition as to whether this guy is willing to negotiate a way his nuclear weapons is worth it, makes sense?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYes.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the trick then is if he's not, how do we move forward then? That's the complicating factor here.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight. And still retain your alliances and all your capabilities.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd what's your bet? Do you think he's actually willing to negotiate a way for a price? Or do you think his intent is to hang on to at least some part of his program, to sort of have his cake and eat it, too? What do you think?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nI think it's more cake and eat it, too, and then achieve other diplomatic objectives. To me, the price would have to be so high-- that doesn't have North Korea economically absorbed by South that it just seems implausible in regional terms or U.S. terms that we could sufficiently meet those demands. I mean, this is ultimately his insurance card.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo we may find ourselves back in a situation at some point? Maybe not next week or six months from now or a year from now, but we may find ourselves back at some point and having to make a choice between living with this program or dealing with it militarily?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah. Now again, on the strategic side, this is an area where deterrence does seem to work. I mean, you really have to have a mad man theory to say that because the end result is obliteration for them. The weapons are useful to deter us from changing the regime -- they're not useful for a bolt out of a blue that then ends in the destruction of his regime.\n\nSo I think there's a lot of ways this could turn out. And it's possible there could be, you know, a partial deal of some partial denuclearization, lessening of tensions, that still let them remain a nuclear power, but with trying to achieve the goals of more economic development that still puts us better off than we were before. But that will be a pretty sophisticated diplomatic play to keep South Korea on our side-- the Russians and Chinese who haven't always been helpful. Sometimes the Chinese are helpful, sometimes not; the Russians, less so-- to pull off this diplomatic hat trick.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay, Russia. How should we think about Russia and the threat that they pose to the United States? And what should we do about it?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSo I think Russia actually is our most immediate threat right now and has been. I think what they did in intervening in our 2016 presidential election was brazen. They really didn't care if they got caught in a lot of ways. I think it was quite successful, and they're still at it.\n\nAnd ironically, they're using American tools, American creations, the creation of an open global economy where money and things can flow freely. And then innovation, the invention of social media to attack American weaknesses, our polarization, our economic dislocation and others to heighten tensions that were already there.\n\nSo, you know, in a way it's not cer-- and it also had the benefit of the strategy surprise. This really, I think, wasn't on people's radar screens. And where they were having their biggest effect in social media, we weren't monitoring until too late. I don't think we'll make that mistake again, but at the time, I think all those things conspired to why I think it works so well.\n\nYou know, Russia's strategy is really to restore its great power status; it sees its primary aim as weakening its opponents in Europe and the United States. It knows it really can't compete head to head -- so they're engaged in the strategy attrition campaign, mostly an intelligence war with us with a lot of -- their term for covert actions is active measures -- to essentially weaken us, to attack our will and our cohesion rather than our capabilities. And that's probably the--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo what do we do about that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSo it's a combination, I think, of offense and defense. We're in this with the Europeans. It's fundamentally a political and informational problem to rally people that you're being attacked and you shouldn't like it. You know, intelligence can play its role and law enforcement in terms of discovery and presenting evidence, it's naming and shaming in certain cases. But it's also some elements of hitting back with various tools as well; you just can't play defense.\n\nThe other side of Russian strategy is to, you know, fight wars largely on their periphery where they have time and space advantages or ethnic advantages-- but then also put in hybrid war, both unconventional and conventional, but then escalate to strategic level with a threat in cyber-attack or something else short of nuclear weapons that could bring the conflict to an end.\n\nWe don't necessarily have a good answer to that as a defense problem. That's-- it's something we need to work on, both how to defend very far forward or to achieve deterrence. But also then when they threaten to escalate because they know if the war goes on they will lose-- how do we manage that escalation to where they can't declare victory and go home?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay-- China. If Russia is the most immediate, maybe China is the most long-term--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nNo, by far the greatest most challenging long-term threat.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--about that?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nWell, ultimately it's an economic and technological competition. Unlike the Cold War, it's about who is going to be the global leader-- first with the biggest economy and out of that will come political influence. But then secondarily-- who is the most innovative economy and creating the industries of the future.\n\nAnd then a related risk of that is does some of those technologies that are also creating industries of the future: biotechnology, artificial intelligence, potentially quantum technologies and others, do they have military effects that really can change the military balance.\n\nAnd so that's, you know, whether we're just in essentially a peacetime competition for who's going to have more sway in the global environment, conflict still deterred by nuclear weapons or limited by nuclear weapons-- or is there some breakthrough technologies that could really alter the balance. And that's sort of the 20 to 30-year problem that we have as a nation. How do we solve that challenge?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd we're both taking very different approaches to that competition, right? We're taking a market-based free enterprise approach, and they're taking a state-directed-resource approach to this competition.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nRight, and combinations of intellectual property theft and state directed and-- Xi Jinping has said they want to dominant future biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Now whether they can do that or not--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how do you think this plays ultimately? I know that's a really tough question.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nWell, it really turns-- you know, China's had an economic miracle over several decades that's almost unprecedented in economic history. And so whether they have bumps in the road or political bumps in the road that are associated with the economic downturns I think, you know, remains to be seen.\n\nAnd it also, I think, is contingent on the what's the nature of power and its relation to political stability and political cohesion in the future. So, for example-- China has four times the population we do. Is that an asset or a liability? I think the jury is out depending on how capital intensive or technology intensive, future industries or military power is. And if you can't, just as we see at home, if you leave people behind, you get political consequences to that. So I don't have an answer to that, I just believe it's our most important strategic challenge over the long haul.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nMike you've been incredibly gracious with your time. Just one more question. Like I was, you were deeply involved in the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And I know you'll talk in detail about that in your book. But what I wanted to ask you is what single moment in either the planning for the raid or during the raid or after the raid most stands out for you?\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nThat's tough, but I I can give you a few. So when I was one of the first people inside the U.S. government to be read in on the intelligence in late summer, early fall of 2010 by you, as a matter of fact, with the vice chairman, I was really struck at the intelligence case at that point; still circumstantial, but a lot of evidence pointing that there's really something there. And so--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat was a neat moment in my office, actually. I remember that, too.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nYeah, my adrenaline really went up. And then the same thing when we were directed to start planning-- operational options at Christmas time. It's the first time really I just didn't enjoy a Christmas with my family and wanted to get back right to work and work on those options.\n\nAnd then I remember our first meeting on options with President Obama where he said, \"We're going to do this. We're going to do it sooner rather than later, and we're going to do it unilaterally in the White House Situation Room.\" And we were still, I guess, six, eight weeks away from actually doing the operation, but I thought, holy cow, we better--\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nThis is gonna happen.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThis is gonna happen.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nAnd then I guess the final moment was-- you know all the things can go wrong from our experience with the Iranian and hostage rescue attempt and others, but, once we knew what had happened to that first helicopter that had landed the SEALs got out, I thought the only question remaining at that point was whether he's there or not, and we're going to know that in ten minutes. And so I felt a real sigh of relief when I saw the helicopter hadn't been shot down or-- It had a hard landing, our troops had gotten out, and then-- and now we'll know.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. All right, Mike, thanks for being with us.\n\nMICHAEL VICKERS:\n\nSure. Great pleasure.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump: U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia", "description": "President Trump says he's \"standing by\" Saudi Arabia, despite assessments from the intelligence community who say the country's crown prince played a role in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

They could die any day,\" Juliette Touma, the chief of communication for the Middle East and North Africa told CBS News.\n\nDespite brief halts to the fighting, the war in Yemen rages on. Save the Children's report Tuesday said in Yemen, they \"observed a dramatic increase in airstrikes on Hodeida over recent weeks. Increased fighting has also been reported in Taiz, Saada and Sanaa.\"\n\n\"Just over one year ago, the Saudi-led coalition closed off all access to the country, effectively sealing Yemen off from the outside world,\" the report states. It was not until six weeks later that the Saudi-led coalition announced ports would reopen temporarily, but key food commodities and fuels later fell by half, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Mark Lowcock, told the U.N. Security Council in October.\n\nWar, blockades and bureaucracy slow aid to the starving\n\nOn Friday, Lowcock said aid operations have delivered significant food and supplies but since October, \"What in fact happened was that violence escalated on several fronts.\"\n\n\"Since October 30, U.N. sources have observed nearly 800 separate incidents of shelling, armed clashes, or air strikes across Yemen,\" Lowcock said.\n\n\"Fighting, blockades and bureaucracy\" have forced Save the Children and other aid organizations to bring vital humanitarian supplies for the north of the country through the southern port of Aden, a diversion that can slow delivery times by three weeks, the new report said. That point was made last Friday at the U.N. by World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley, who had just returned from the port of Hodeida.\n\nWith great expectations, the U.K. introduced a draft resolution at the U.N. on Monday, hoping to forge a ceasefire agreement, open all the ports, and infuse much-needed cash into Yemen. With an estimated 14 million civilians at risk of starvation caused by the war between Yemeni rebels and a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, the Saudis and their partners, with Kuwait in the lead on the Security Council, have delayed a British plan for a truce.\n\nAfter a day of negotiations at the \"expert\" level Tuesday, three Security Council diplomats told CBS News it was unlikely a vote would take place before week's end, a delay further delayed by a Council trip to China beginning on Saturday.\n\nStephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, told reporters the Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, along with the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande would travel in Yemen, beginning on Wednesday of this week.\n\nFrance has supported the draft resolution, which was penned by the U.K. and negotiated by all five permanent members of the Security Council. France's Ambassador Francois Delattre made the point about the urgency to CBS News: \"Each passing day is a life and death issue for many civilians in Yemen.

It also desperately needs a strong humanitarian response coupled with major economic assistance.\"\n\n\"Children are dying, as I saw just last week in front of my own eyes.

A mere 15 percent are looking forward to having political discussions, while 40 percent hope to avoid talking about politics over Thanksgiving dinner. There are still 45 percent who don't care either way.\n\nThe lack of appetite for Thanksgiving political discussions spans across all age groups, education and income levels.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats wish to avoid political discussions this Thanksgiving -- a somewhat rare instance of partisan agreement. Forty-two percent of Independents said that they hope to avoid politics.\n\nHowever, a plurality in each party said that they did not care either way.\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone November 15-18, 2018 among a random sample of 1,103 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.\n\nThe poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.\n\nInterviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers.

Bob Corker and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, respectively the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to President Trump demanding he make a determination as to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"In light of recent developments, including the Saudi government's acknowledgement that Saudi officials killed Mr. Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, we request that your determination specifically address whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's murder,\" the letter says.\n\nThe letter requested Mr. Trump investigate the role of the crown prince, known as MBS, under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The act allows the president to impose sanctions on a person or country involved in a human rights violation. The investigation is triggered by a letter to the president from the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Trump in October, Corker, Menendez and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Patrick Leahy used the Magnitsky Act mechanism to trigger an investigation and sanctions inquiry into Khashoggi's disappearance. The first letter did not specifically refer to MBS.\n\nThe CIA has intelligence substantiating an assessment that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing. The CIA's assessment appeared to be largely based on the control held by the crown prince. In other words, the murder could not have been carried out without the knowledge of MBS.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Trump released a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying, \"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\"\n\nHe added, \"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi... the United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\"\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on the White House lawn that Khashoggi's murder was a \"shame,\" but \"it is what it is,\" adding that his administration was \"not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars\" over the Oct. 2 killing in Saudi Arabia's Consulate in Istanbul, referring to a pending arms deal with the Saudis.\n\n\"If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia First, not America First?\"\n\nHis remarks came as several Republican members of Congress denounced the White House's position.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul, an ally of the president but ardent critic of America's relationship with the Saudis, tweeted.\n\nThe lawmaker from Kentucky accused National Security Adviser and foreign policy hawk John Bolton of writing the statement and criticized American assistance to the Saudi-led coalition waging a bloody war against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n\"We should, at the very least, NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians,\" Paul added.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who has largely embraced the administration's doctrine across the world, wrote on Twitter that \"our foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests.\" The junior senator from Florida stressed that defending human rights is vital to America's national security because human rights violations fuel \"mass migration,\" foster extremism and benefit governments hostile to the U.S.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the U.S. can't overlook Khashoggi's high-profile killing and dismemberment, and suggested that there was bipartisan support among lawmakers to sanction individuals involved in the assassination, including members of the royal family.\n\n\"While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the Crown Prince \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,\" Graham added.\n\nConstant Mr. Trump critics Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Bob Corker also condemned the statement. The retiring senator from Arizona said \"great allies\" don't lure their own citizens into a trap, and then have them killed.\n\n\"I am astounded by the type of response that was put out by the White House,\" Corker said in an interview with a local news crew on Tuesday. He acknowledged that it was a \"delicate situation\" with a long-time ally, but said, \"we have a crown prince that I believe directed the killing of a journalist. The language that was used, it was if they were writing a press release for Saudi Arabia, not for the United States.\"\n\nAlluding to the letter to Mr. Trump from himself and Sen. Menendez demanding a determination on the crown prince, Corker said he and his Senate colleagues were \"trying to make sure that the appropriate pressure is placed on MBS.\""}]
