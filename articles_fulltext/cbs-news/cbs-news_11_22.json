Researchers confirmed a 56-year-old man had a hepatitis E strain previously known only in rats in Vietnam. Doctors later found he had a strain of hepatitis that was \"highly divergent\" from other strains found in humans, BBC News reported.\n\nThe second case was found after blood samples from more than 70 hepatitis E patients were tested.\n\nA 70-year-old woman with a compromised immune system was found to have been infected with the hepatitis strain, the Hong Kong Health Department said Wednesday in an emailed response to questions.\n\nShe had been admitted to a hospital in May 2017 with abdominal pain, headache, anorexia and other symptoms. The blood samples collected from her at the time recently tested positive.\n\nBoth patients were hospitalized only weeks apart and live within three kilometers (two miles) of each other.\n\n\"They form a cluster - they're linked in time and space,\" Sridhar said.

In China, many are stricken after eating undercooked pork and innards.

Thomas Bruce of Imperial, Missouri, was arrested Wednesday and charged in Monday's attack at a Catholic Supply store in Ballwin.\n\nDavid Fitzgerald is pastor at Calvary Chapel in Maryland Heights. He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Bruce was a pastor at Calvary Chapel of Cape Girardeau from about 2003 into 2007.\n\nThe Missouri Secretary of State's office identifies Bruce as the operator of a nonprofit church formed in 2003 and dissolved in 2007.\n\nFitzgerald said Calvary Chapels are affiliated under a ministry that originated in Costa Mesa, California. Associated Press attempts to reach church officials Thursday have been unsuccessful.\n\nFitzgerald told the paper has talked to Bruce only occasionally since the church folded, and was shocked he was charged with the crime.\n\n\"It was completely out of character for the Tom Bruce that I knew, completely surprising,\" he told the paper. \"If it wasn't for the amount of evidence against him I would think they've got the wrong guy.\"\n\nThe arrest of 53-year-old Bruce ended a two-day manhunt that followed the brazen Monday afternoon attack that frightened the region and led some schools, churches and businesses to close.\n\nBruce was charged with 17 criminal counts including first-degree murder, three counts of sodomy and three counts of kidnapping, CBS affiliate KMOV-TV reports. Other charges include first-degree burglary, tampering with evidence and armed criminal action. He is jailed without bond, and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney yet.\n\nAt a news conference announcing the arrest, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch called the crime \"heartbreaking,\" a sentiment that was echoed by the county's police chief, Jon Belmar.\n\n\"It shocked the senses,\" a somber Belmar said.\n\nAuthorities allege that Bruce entered the store and said he was shopping, then left briefly before returning with a handgun. He forced the three women into the back room, told them to strip, exposed himself and ordered them to \"perform deviant sexual acts on him,\" detectives wrote in the criminal complaint.\n\nTwo of the women complied but the third, 53-year-old Jamie Schmidt of nearby House Springs, refused, so he shot her in the head, they wrote. The attacker ordered the other women to continue performing the sexual acts on him, and he later fled, apparently able to blend in along the busy street in broad daylight.\n\nMcCulloch said there was no indication the store was targeted because of its religious affiliation.\n\n\"It seems to me a guy like this saw an opportunity \u2014 three women in the store alone,\" McCulloch said.\n\nBruce, who claimed to be a Navy veteran on his LinkedIn page, had no previous criminal record in Missouri beyond a traffic ticket in 2001. McCulloch said his office is checking with other states and investigating whether Bruce might be linked to crimes elsewhere.\n\nAuthorities in Indiana have noted \"similarities\" in the description of the suspect released immediately after the Catholic Supplies attack and the description of an unknown suspect wanted in the February 2017 slayings of Abigail \"Abby\" Williams, 13, and Liberty \"Libby\" Rose German, 14, in Delphi, Indiana, reports the St. Louis Post Dispatch.\n\n\"We're aware of the similarities and we've been in contact with authorities there in St. Louis County,\" said First Sgt. Jerry Holeman, who leads the investigation for the Indiana State Police, the paper reports. \"But it is way too early to tell if this is the same\" person, he said.\n\nBelmar said tips from the public helped lead to Bruce's arrest, though he declined to elaborate.\n\nMcCulloch said the aggravating circumstances make the crime eligible for the death penalty, but he said that decision will be up to the man who replaces him in January. McCulloch, the county's prosecutor for nearly three decades, lost to Wesley Bell of Ferguson in the August Democratic primary.

He wouldn't elaborate on that. He also said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he has faulted for not being tough enough on immigration, is \"in there trying\" to manage the border crisis.\n\n\"It's a tough job,\" he said.\n\nThe president would not discount the possibility of a partial government shutdown early in December over lawmakers' refusal to allocate the billions of dollars he is demanding for a border wall, the central promise of his 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could, and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThat conversation with troops grew from a presidential expression of gratitude for their commitment to protecting the country and its interest and touched on a variety of political topics, including immigration policy, the economy and Mr. Trump's displeasure with court rulings against administration initiatives.\n\nMr. Trump's border threat came days after a federal judge put the administration's asylum policy on hold. Under that new policy, Trump declared no one could apply for asylum except at an official border entry point. Some ports of entry are already facing huge backups, with people waiting for weeks.\n\nThe U.S. government shut down one port of entry, San Ysidro, in California, for several hours early Monday morning to bolster security amid concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members. Most of the lanes were reopened before the morning rush.\n\nMr. Trump's remarks come on the heels of a memo signed by White House chief of staff John Kelly declaring the Pentagon has the authority to allow troops to use force, including lethal force, to protect federal personnel at the border if necessary. The memo, dated Tuesday, says troops at the border \"may perform those military protective activities that the secretary of defense determines are reasonably necessary to ensure the protection of federal personnel, including a show or use of force (including lethal force, where necessary), crowd control, temporary detention, and cursory search.\"\n\n\"The deployed military personnel shall not, without further direction from you, conduct traditional civilian law enforcement activities, such as arrest, search and seizure in connection with the enforcement of the laws,\" says the memo, which was obtained by CBS News national security correspondent David Martin.\n\nMr. Trump confirmed in his wide-ranging Q&A session with reporters Thursday that he has given troops the authority to use lethal force, if needed.\n\n\"If they have to they are going to use lethal force \u2014 I've given the okay, yeah,\" the president said. \"If they have to, I hope they don't have to. But you know you are dealing with a minimum of 500 serious criminals.

Mr. Trump has refused to listen to audio of the killing.\n\nAsked who should be held responsible for Khashoggi's death, the president said Thursday, \"Maybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a vicious place.\"\n\n\"So I hate the crime and I hate what is done and I hate the cover-up,\" Mr. Trump also said. \"And I will tell you this, the crown prince hates it more than I do.\"\n\nThe president has long couched his defense of the Saudis in economic terms, saying the financial relationship between the two nations is indispensable.\n\n\"Do people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs \u2013 and frankly, if we went by this standard, we wouldn't have anybody as an ally,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the week, the president announced there would be no further punishment for the Saudis after Khashoggi's death, a statement that sent shockwaves across Washington and was described by critics as akin to propaganda for the Saudis.\n\n\"It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\" the president said in the statement. \"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump said in his exclamation mark-laced written remarks.\n\nMr. Trump also said he would be interviewing candidates for administration positions over the weekend, although he didn't say whom or what positions.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the president also continued to blast the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the nation's judiciary system. Mr. Trump believes the court rules unfairly against his administration, and his blistering remarks elicited a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts Wednesday.\n\n\"Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster,\" Mr. Trump tweeted Thanksgiving morning. \"It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security......and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death. We want the Constitution as written!\"\n\nAfter teleconferencing with troops abroad, the president visited troops at a nearby Coast Guard center, where they were served sandwiches. Mr. Trump praised them for their work.\n\n\"If you were doing a brand, they would say this is one of the great brand increases,\" he said, adding, \"Nobody has gone up more than the Coast Guard.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Joe Morton and Brandon Michael Hall on \"God Friended Me\"", "description": "The two talked about the new show at the Thanksgiving Day Parade", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-morton-and-brandon-michael-hall-on-the-importance-of-family-in-god-friended-me/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/22/77196616-05dc-4cd0-8dce-530aca15e569/thumbnail/1200x630g2/47850c3c70c2de890738bf01210aeaf1/113906-d1667b.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:59:01Z", "content": "\"God Friended Me\" stars Joe Morton and Brandon Micheal Hall joined Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight at the Thanksgiving Day Parade to talk about their new show.

It said its own internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, found serious misconduct including under-reporting of his income and misuse of company assets.\n\nIt was a stunning downfall for one of the biggest figures in the auto industry, a man who helped drive turnarounds at both France's Renault SA and at Nissan and then managed an alliance between them that sold 10.6 million cars last year, besting its rivals.\n\nNissan said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange that its investigation uncovered misuse of company investment funds and expense money for personal gain.\n\nEarlier this week, Renault voted to keep Ghosn as its chief executive but appointed Thierry Bollore, its chief operating officer, as its interim chief.\n\nAnother Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, was arrested in Japan on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing and also will be dismissed as a representative director, Nissan said. Their replacements will be decided later, it said.\n\nGhosn, 64, is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nNissan's board consists of nine members, including Ghosn and Greg Kelly. The seven other board members voted at the meeting, including two members from Nissan and two from Renault.\n\nGhosn and Kelly will remain on Nissan's board for now as that decision will be up to shareholders. No date has been set yet for a shareholders meeting.\n\nGhosn is also chairman at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese automaker that's partnering with the Renault-Nissan alliance and plans to hold a board meeting next week.\n\nGhosn has been held since his arrest Monday at a Tokyo detention center, under the same Spartan conditions as other detainees, Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto told reporters Thursday. He gave few details about the case.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither has been charged so far. The maximum penalty upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nA French citizen born in Brazil, Ghosn became a corporate superstar in Japan as he led Nissan's revival from near bankruptcy after Renault sent him to help in 1999. Ghosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, in the U.S. in 1988. He became a board member in 2012. His background is in human resources and alliance management.\n\nAnalysts say the future of Nissan's alliance with Renault may be at stake, though Nissan's statement Thursday said the company's leadership was determined to minimize the impact from Ghosn's case on the partnership. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\n\"The longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\" the Nissan statement in English said, stressing the alliance rather than the misdeeds. It also said the board will study setting up a third-party committee to beef up governance in management and compensation at Nissan.\n\nCEO Hiroto Saikawa, in a lengthy news conference on Monday, said too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn, with too little credit given to the many others working for the company's success.\n\nJanet Lewis, managing director and head of industrial research, Asia, at Macquarie Capital Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview that an adjustment was needed to give Nissan more say in the alliance with Renault.\n\nThe partnership remains crucial for both companies, she said, since apart from financial ties the companies share technology and parts. The automakers need to be more like roommates than a married couple, \"So they have to find a way to share their house and share all of their expertise because it's very necessary in terms of new automotive technology, new platform development,\" Lewis said. \"They need to figure out how they can continue this and still live happily together in the same house.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "American missionary killed by tribe on remote island", "description": "The BBC reports an American missionary who traveled to a remote island in India was apparently killed by an endangered tribe who shot him with arrows.

Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul, who share their views on the matter with the president \u2014 have denounced Mr. Trump's decision not to levy harsher penalties on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the death and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday he was \"astounded\" by Mr. Trump's statement and likened it to a press release for Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It is a delicate situation when we have a long-term ally that we've had for decades, but we have a crown prince that I believe ordered the killing of a journalist,\" Corker told Chattanooga TV station WTVC in his home state of Tennessee. \"We don't have a smoking gun. Everything points to the fact that he knew about it and directed it.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump's decision, saying the U.S. has already placed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of involvement in the Oct. 2 killing of The Washington Post columnist, who had been critical of the royal family.\n\n\"We've sanctioned 17 people \u2014 some of them very senior in the Saudi government,\" Pompeo said Wednesday in a radio interview with KCMO in Kansas City, Missouri. \"We are going to make sure that America always stands for human rights.\"\n\nGraham, R-S.C., isn't convinced. \"When we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset,\" he said.\n\nMembers of both parties have accused Mr. Trump of ignoring U.S. intelligence that concluded, according to one U.S. official, that it was likely the crown prince ordered the killing. Several lawmakers have indicated that the U.S. has no \"smoking gun\" that proves he was responsible, but they have called on the CIA and other top intelligence agencies to publicly share what they told the president about the slaying.\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, Trump argued that punishing Saudi Arabia by \"foolishly canceling\" Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. would only benefit Russia and China. Critics, including high-ranking officials in other countries, accused Trump of ignoring human rights and giving Saudi Arabia a pass for economic reasons.\n\nIt's \"America First,\" Trump said.\n\nThat unleashed a tweet Wednesday from Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii who wrote: \"Being Saudi Arabia's bitch is not 'America First.'\"\n\nMr. Trump also said the U.S. needs Saudi Arabia's help to counter Iran in the region, fight extremism and keep oil prices steady. The U.S., Russia and the Saudis have boosted oil production in anticipation of sharply lower exports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions reinstated after Trump exited the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe president publicly thanked Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for plunging oil prices. However, OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries, could announce production cuts at its Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna, nudging prices upward.\n\n\"Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!\" he wrote from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he's spending Thanksgiving.\n\nCriticism of the president will likely resume after the holiday when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill early next week.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans will have to do a gut check,\" Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Wednesday. \"The Republican Party has believed for more than 50 years that morality was one of the reasons why the United States won the Cold War. And the president walked away from that.\"\n\nSome lawmakers are already fighting back. Twenty-two members of the Senate \u2014 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats \u2014have triggered investigations into Khashoggi's death and specifically whether the crown prince was responsible. The investigations were requested under provisions of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.\n\nThe act requires the president to report back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee within 120 days \u2014 in this case by Feb. 7 \u2014 on whether the crown prince was responsible for an extrajudicial killing, torture or other gross violation of internationally recognized human rights against an individual exercising freedom of expression and the administration's decision on whether sanctions are warranted.\n\nMoreover, three Democrats and three Republicans, who say sanctions, which include a ban on travel to the U.S., imposed so far are insufficient, have introduced the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2018. Among other things, the bill calls for suspending weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and imposing mandatory sanctions on all those responsible for Khashoggi's death and those blocking humanitarian access to Yemen.\n\nDemocrats going against the president is expected, but Republican outrage will be more difficult for Mr. Trump to shrug off.\n\nBefore leaving for the holiday, Paul, R-Ky., lamented to The Associated Press that Trump didn't accept the counsel he received from both him and Graham \u2014 two Republicans often at odds on foreign policy.\n\nGraham has said the crown prince is \"irrational\" and \"unhinged\" and warns there will be strong, bipartisan support in Congress for harsher sanctions against Saudi Arabia and members of the royal family.\n\nPaul typically eschews U.S. intervention abroad, but views Khashoggi's death as one in a long line of malign activities by Saudi Arabia topped by its war in neighboring Yemen where civilians are being killed by Saudi airstrikes.\n\n\"He's been hearing from both myself and from Lindsey Graham \u2014 two different sides of the foreign policy spectrum \u2014 and yet we get this,\" Paul said about Trump's statement in support of Saudi Arabia. \"We really have to reconsider what we're doing.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Adenovirus death: Father says dorm mold \"didn't help\" ill daughter", "description": "The University of Maryland is trying to calm fears that recent mold problems on campus could be linked to a virus that caused a student's death.

On the day after Thanksgiving, customers have been known to rush in through retailers' doors, but with major merchants going out of business or shuttering mall locations, retailers are rushing out the door to find shoppers.\n\nThose \"doorbuster specials\" are still there as megastores like Kohl's, Target and Walmart attempt to create scarcity and excitement with those \"first 100 customers to buy a flat-screen TV\" prices. But online shoppers may find those prices aren't that special. In fact, they may already have purchased some pre-Black Friday deals, which started at the beginning of November.\n\n\"The historic Black Friday is ebbing,\" said Fitch Ratings retail analyst David Silverman. \"It's not as necessary as it once was.\"\n\nAmerica's post-Thanksgiving Day shopping frenzy used to start off with bang \u2014 literally sometimes \u2014 as frantic customers celebrated by knocking down security guards and fighting each other to grab toys and electronics. But now the drama (and the media coverage) is likely to be more muted.\n\n\"There will still be an uptick in sales that day,\" predicted Managing Director Jeff Holzmann of Iintoo, a commercial real estate company. \"But you probably won't see elbows flying.\"\n\nBig names fading\n\nThe brick-and-mortar retail sector has sustained major damage. Stand-alone stores like Toys R Us are gone, and many \"anchor stores\" at malls, such as Sears, are shutting down. Other retailers like Gap, J.C. Penney, Lord & Taylor, Macy's and Michael Kors are cutting back on locations. Even home-improvement chain Lowes is closing many stores in the U.S. and Canada, while offering a 40 percent discount on some appliances.\n\nIt's a scary time for retailers, due in part to a phenomenon known as \"cascading,\" or unplanned markdowns. \"Every company has prepared for promotional markdowns during the Christmas season, and they'll grow as you get closer to the holiday,\" said Fitch's Silverman. \"But unplanned markdowns happen when the merchant at the other end of the mall is going out of business, closing the store or simply has to dump inventory whose shelf life has expired. Then everyone has to cut prices and keep lowering them.\"\n\nShrewd merchants have already done this, which is why the Christmas shopping season has begun earlier. The rush is on to beat \"antiquated retailers\" that still believe Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for a shopper's credit card, said Jonathan Cherki, CEO of ContentSquare, a software provider for retailers.\n\nMajor chains used to believe that the post-Thanksgiving holiday was special because it was the date when their balance sheets finally turned from red (losses) to black (profits). Now they see it simply as part of a continuum that starts right after Halloween and continues through the actual holiday -- as more shoppers click online shopping sites even as the turkey is still on the table.\n\nThis trend follows through to New Year's Day as retailers get returns and, they hope, sell a few more items at the same time. That's one reason Kohl's said it will take Amazon's returns, said Silverman. \"Once you get them in the store, there's a 25 percent chance they'll buy something else.\"\n\nGet in the \"Ama-zone\" or perish\n\nAs America's largest online retailer, Amazon remains the elephant in the room, and stores in shopping centers have to get in the \"Ama-zone\" or perish, analysts said. One way is to dispel the traditional Black Friday myth that only a certain amount of inventory is available, and you have to buy it that day to get that price.\n\nThe key words are \"virtual inventory,\" said CEO Frank Poore of Commercehub, which helps online businesses manage their stock. Savvy shoppers can always look online, find the toy or electronics they want and keep clicking until the price drops. Retail stores have to provide the same services as online retailers, such as offering to get items that aren't in-store from another store and providing immediate home delivery after those \"first hundred\" are gone. Otherwise, they'll lose customers to someone else.\n\nWhen Amazon upped the ante by offering free shipping on holiday orders, other retailers had to follow suit. Chief Technology Officer Alex Shvarts of FundKite, a business funding platform, noted that Black Friday store traffic drops by 5 percent to 10 percent a year, while UPS, which shipped roughly 750 million packages during the 2017 holiday season, expects that number to increase by the same rate. The U.S. Postal Service anticipates even more business -- a billion parcels this holiday season.\n\nFor stores to survive, they need to be more customer-friendly, while malls have to provide services like easy or valet parking, and amenities such as free coffee and child care, foot massages and immediate product usage, said analysts. They need to do the things an online retailer can't \u2014 and respect the customer.\n\n\"Black Friday was never an experience that most people enjoyed,\" said Iintoo's Holzmann. Fitch's Silverman agrees. \"Customers want to shop with intelligence, not with fisticuffs.\" Millennials in particular have different buying habits. \"They'd rather have something personal and handmade than a mass-produced item from overseas,\" said FundKite's Shvarts.\n\nFewer competitors\n\nRetailers that have survived the wars with Amazon \u2014 and each other \u2014 have hope. As their numbers dwindle, they'll see fewer of those \"cascading markdowns\" because most of the losers will already be out of business.\n\nAnd the rest will pick up inventory and brand names from the ones that failed. Kroger is already offering 600 Toys R Us \"pop-up shops\" with Toys' mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe, and Walmart is enlarging its already huge toy department.\n\nMany retailers may actually end up \"in the black\" on that Friday after all."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Kate Gibson", "title": "Black Friday \"deals\" to avoid at Best Buy, Target, Walmart", "description": "When it comes to shopping at biggest stores, consumers should avoid some offers \"like the plague,\" expert cautions", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-2018-deals-to-avoid-at-best-buy-target-walmart/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/11/07/843af911-d6ab-4254-85b9-937d955b4378/thumbnail/1200x630/d0b367079461d994154be2b92dd66cba/shopping-rtst7fu.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:59:43Z", "content": "The biggest big-box retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Target, are expected to draw huge traffic the day after Thanksgiving, long viewed as the official start to the holiday shopping season.

But some of the Black Friday deals already announced this month should be avoided \"like the plague,\" according to online shopping expert Phil Dengler of BestBlackFriday.com.\n\nOther products can simply be found for less elsewhere. Here are some of Dengler's tips for Black Friday shoppers this year:\n\nAvoid Walmart's shipping fees ...\n\nOnline shopping for orders under $35 are to be avoided at Walmart, given its main rivals are all offering free shipping with no minimum order size for Black Friday and the rest of the holiday season. Having to pay shipping fees \"is a quick way to kill an otherwise great Black Friday deal,\" Dengler wrote in a recent blog post. If your order is less than 35 bucks, \"shop confidently at Target, Best Buy and Amazon without having to worry or calculate added shipping charges,\" he advised.\n\n... but consider its Apple iPhone deals\n\nThat said, Walmart is the place to go for Apple iPhones. The retailer is offering a free $300 Walmart gift card with purchase and qualifying activation of an iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max or iPhone XR. In addition, Walmart is offering a free $400 Walmart gift card with purchase and qualifying activation of an iPhone 8, iPhone 8+ or iPhone XR.\n\nGiven the retailer sells a broad ranges of products, including electronics, pet supplies, auto parts and groceries, \"a gift card at Walmart is as close to cash as you are going to get,\" Dengler noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Target's gift card offers represent between $50 to $250 less than what Walmart offers for the same phone. \"This is one of the worst disparities for the same deal we have ever seen on Black Friday,\" Dengler offered.\n\nKohl's the spot for Xbox One S 1TB Minecraft Creators\n\nThe Xbox One S 1TB Minecraft Creators bundle is hot this year, and should be purchased at Kohl's, Dengler advised. Here's his math: Of Walmart, Best Buy and Target, it is Target that offers the best deal, for $199.99 plus a free $20 Target gift card. And while Kohl's offer is 99 cents more expensive than at Target, it come with a $60 in Kohl's cash. Hello, extra $39.\n\nTarget's $99 Google Home Hub: less than meets the eye\n\nTarget is offering the Google Home Hub for $99, a savings of $50 and 99 cents cheaper that what it costs at Best Buy. Still, Dengler recommends buying the Google Home Hub elsewhere for extra incentives offered at Best Buy, Walmart and Kohl's.\n\nBest Buy best for Samsung Galaxy Note9, S9 or S9+\n\nBest Buy is the best bet for buying the Samsung Galaxy Note9, S9 or S9+, since the retailer is offering a direct savings of $300 with qualified activation. Walmart and Target both make the offer with free $300 gift cards in their own brands. Given the discounts are the same, best to go with Best Buy's immediate discount as opposed to getting gift cards from the others, Dengler said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Kate Gibson", "title": "Which stores are staying open on Thanksgiving Day?", "description": "More than a dozen big retailers will stay open for the holiday, although many stores are giving workers a break", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-2018-walmart-target-kohls-among-the-retailers-staying-open-on-thanksgiving/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/08/8c81f955-0022-4499-a515-59ea5da24b27/thumbnail/1200x630/9c265db87b20b2db25ad40213d204e69/gettyimages-160235138.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:52:57Z", "content": "More than a dozen national retailers will open their doors early for Black Friday, kicking off sales on Thanksgiving Day.

Olivia's father believes the school could have done more.\n\nUniversity of Maryland freshman Jessica Thompson told CBS News she and her roommate discovered mold on their shoes and clothes in their dorm room in August. She believes the fungus eventually made them sick.\n\n\n\n\"You can't sleep at night because the pillow is right next to mold and you're up all night coughing,\" Thompson said. \"We got to go home on the weekends and we would be totally fine at home, and we would come back and would be sniffling and coughing and then have headaches.\"\n\n\n\nThompson said they repeatedly alerted the issue to university officials who eventually moved them \u2013 and more than 500 other students \u2013 to temporary housing while the school worked to clean the dorms.\n\n\"They had put in a dehumidifier, and the heat had finally turned on and the mold seemed to go away, but it was a good two-and-a-half months,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Olivia Paregol's father, her room also had mold.

It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired the seven fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, which also towed the kayak Chau used to reach the island the first time, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau's friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air on Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday and another trip was planned Thursday. Police officer Vijay Singh said Thursday morning that police were exploring their options since they cannot go directly to the restricted area and confront the tribespeople.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on a tour of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\"He didn't go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\" Staver said.\n\nChau was carrying a Bible that was hit by an arrow when he was first shot at by the tribesmen on Nov. 15, according to notes Chau left with the fishermen that Staver said he has seen.\n\nStaver said Chau's last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nOne of Chau's friends said the American spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India. Casey Prince, 39, declined to discuss what Chau told him about his upcoming travel plans, saying he would rather talk about the kind of man his friend was.\n\n\"If he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\" Prince said, recalling the time Chau told him about being bitten by a rattlesnake.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nPrince described him as easy to like and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n\"He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us,\" the Chau family wrote in its Instagram post. \"To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\"\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese.\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable,\" Stephen Corry, the group's director, said in a statement.\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist and a professor at Jindal Global Law School, said North Sentinel Island was a protected area and not open to tourists. \"The exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining.\"\n\nTribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto shore."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Man jailed in sexual assault and killing at religious store in St. Louis", "description": "Thomas Bruce was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder, kidnapping, sodomy and other crimes in connection with an attack earlier this week", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/st-louis-ballwin-thomas-bruce-charged-jailed-criminal-charges-today-2018-11-22/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/22/51a52097-fc4e-486d-b2cb-1c45aca9f9d8/thumbnail/1200x630/8e29320edb2b0f1ca106c39d0284a433/181121-thomas-bruce-st-louis.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:18:35Z", "content": "ST.

LOUIS \u2014 A man was charged Wednesday with killing one woman and sexually assaulting two others after herding them at gunpoint into the back room of a suburban St. Louis religious supplies shop. The arrest of 53-year-old Thomas Bruce, of Imperial, ended a two-day manhunt that followed the brazen Monday afternoon attack at a Catholic Supply store in another St. Louis suburb, Ballwin. The attack frightened the region and led some schools, churches and businesses to close.\n\nBruce was charged with 17 criminal counts including first-degree murder, three counts of sodomy and three counts of kidnapping, CBS affiliate KMOV-TV reports. Other charges include first-degree burglary, tampering with evidence and armed criminal action. He is jailed without bond, and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney yet.\n\nAt a news conference announcing the arrest, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch called the crime \"heartbreaking,\" a sentiment that was echoed by the county's police chief, Jon Belmar.\n\n\"It shocked the senses,\" a somber Belmar said.\n\nAuthorities allege that Bruce entered the store and said he was shopping, then left briefly before returning with a handgun. He forced the three women into the back room, told them to strip, exposed himself and ordered them to \"perform deviant sexual acts on him,\" detectives wrote in the criminal complaint.\n\nTwo of the women complied but the third, 53-year-old Jamie Schmidt of nearby House Springs, refused, so he shot her in the head, they wrote. The attacker ordered the other women to continue performing the sexual acts on him, and he later fled, apparently able to blend in along the busy street in broad daylight.\n\nMcCulloch said there was no indication the store was targeted because of its religious affiliation.\n\n\"It seems to me a guy like this saw an opportunity \u2014 three women in the store alone,\" McCulloch said.\n\nBruce, who claimed to be a Navy veteran on his LinkedIn page, had no previous criminal record in Missouri beyond a traffic ticket in 2001. McCulloch said his office is checking with other states.\n\nBelmar said tips from the public helped lead to Bruce's arrest, though he declined to elaborate.\n\nMcCulloch said the aggravating circumstances make the crime eligible for the death penalty, but he said that decision will be up to the man who replaces him in January. McCulloch, the county's prosecutor for nearly three decades, lost to Wesley Bell of Ferguson in the August Democratic primary. Bell ran unopposed in the November general election.\n\nDan Stutte, president of Catholic Supply store, which operates three stores in the St. Louis area, said the company was \"deeply relieved\" by the arrest.\n\nSchmidt, of House Springs, was a married mother of three who worked as a secretarial assistant at St. Louis Community College's campus in Wildwood, Missouri. Two of her children are adults and the third is in high school.\n\nKMOV-TV\n\nSeveral members of her parish, St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in High Ridge, gathered for a memorial service Tuesday to remember Schmidt, who sang in the church choir. A friend told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Schmidt may have been at the store to buy supplies to make rosaries for fellow parishioners.\n\n\"She was a great person. Very much kept the family together,\" Schmidt's sister-in-law Cathy Soulon told KMOV-TV Tuesday. \"Just a perfect person. She was a housewife for many, many years. Then she finally started to get a job and get out in the social world and this happens. It's mind-boggling. It just goes to show how messed up this world really is.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Train cars detach as it headed to New York City on eve of Thanksgiving", "description": "None of the passengers or crew were injured and the rail company said a recovery engine was dispatched to transfer affected passengers from the disabled train", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amtrak-train-68-adirondack-new-york-city-cars-separate-passengers-stranded-today-2018-11-21/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/22/b1e358ce-9420-4b1c-9afe-b25b79daa3df/thumbnail/1200x630/5055b9e0f5ec49f21fe6964a31d41c82/181121-cbsnewyork-amtrak-train-car-separates-twitter-pictures.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T04:27:26Z", "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 It was a frustrating and at times alarming Thanksgiving Eve for many train travelers in the tri-state area who were trying to get home for the holiday, CBS New York reports.
