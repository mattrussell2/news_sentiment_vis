The footage was by videographer Lee McEachern.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, about a quarter-million wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) live in California. When the state's Fish and Game Commission introduced thousands of turkeys raised on farms into the wild in the first half of the 20th century, as part of a recreational hunting program, the numbers of turkeys in the wild did not substantially increase. It took the introduction of wild turkeys trapped and imported into the state (and able to adapt to the California wilds) to substantially increase the wild turkey population.\n\nThis has prompted complaints in some quarters. Short-term studies on the turkeys' effect on the ecosystem suggest they can co-exist with other species, like quails, but overpopulation and drought conditions in California may force turkeys to compete with other species for resources.\n\n\n\nSee also:"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "A heartwarming slice of life: Pizza made and served by the deaf", "description": "San Francisco's Mozzeria, ranked among the top pizza places in the city, is also entirely owned and operated by people who are deaf", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-heartwarming-slice-of-life-pizza-made-and-served-by-the-deaf-at-mozzeria-in-san-francisco/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/18/84be59a3-f3d9-4666-8ed9-4e835f58b11c/thumbnail/1200x630/442a7f4b3c549c92c1cbecdbfe63e35f/deaf-pizza-mozzeria-promo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T23:13:38Z", "content": "San Francisco has some of the best restaurants anywhere \u2013 and one of the most unique.

Unlike other restaurants, noise isn't an issue, and neither is communication; pointing at the menu works just fine.\n\nAnd you can even phone in a take-out order. A glowing green light on the wall signals an incoming call. An operator picks it up, and translates your order in sign language via closed-circuit TV.\n\nBut this is about a lot more than serving hungry customers.\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith asked Melody, \"How important is it to you to have an all-deaf staff?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's very important,\" she replied. \"If a hearing person, say, doesn't work out here, they can find a job tomorrow, no problem, while all the deaf people here have to look for years and still can't find a job.

His favorites included Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Rice Krispies (all the varieties, like Cocoa Rice Krispies and Rice Krispy Treats).\n\nSome 20 years later, Fulton is writing for the website Thrillist, where his childhood passion launched a wild article: \"The assignment was basically to eat nothing but cereal for an entire week,\" he said.\n\nAnd so was born a serial cereal eater. For 21 consecutive meals \u2013 breakfast, lunch, and dinner \u2013 Fulton ate nothing but cereal.\n\n\"I ate 82 bowls over the course of the seven days,\" he laughed. He averaged 1,735 calories of cereal a day \u2013 and consumed a lot of milk.\n\nThrillist\n\nAs the bowls stacked up, he started seeing this lark as a social experiment, to answer an existential question: \"What is cereal's place in my life, and in the life of people our age?\"\n\nYale University food historian Paul Freedman suggest that eating cereal \"is a little bit like reminding yourself that you're a child, even though your parents are not there.\"\n\nBut even if cereal's NOT on the menu, Freedman said the first meal of the day is also the best-liked. \"Maybe after waking up, you're grateful to be alive another day? I'm still here. And I'm hungry!\" he laughed.\n\nFor hundreds of years, breakfast was pretty standard fare. Freedman said a typical breakfast in medieval times would have been wheat porridge, vegetables from the previous night, and \u2026 bacon!\n\n\"Good, everyone can relate to that,\" laughed correspondent Susan Spencer.\n\nBut by the early 1900s, W.K. Kellogg revolutionized mornings with corn flakes. And in the 1920s Minneapolis-based competitor General Mills introduced Wheaties. Cereal is such a big deal at General Mills it has its own president, Dana McNabb, who is definitely enthusiastic about cereal, and certainly about breakfast.\n\nCBS News\n\nBut around the country, cereal fatigue may be setting in. Instead, eggs are on a roll, with breakfast sandwich sales up 10 percent, while cereal (though still an $8 billion industry) has dropped $1 billion over the past nine years.\n\nSo, McNabb's team got to work on re-energizing some old favorites. When Spencer asked what \"re-energizing\" means, McNabb replied, \"Bringing excitement back to people's relationship with cereal.\"\n\nExcitement often seems to involve sugar, as with the new Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios. Or as Spencer referred to it, \"breakfast dessert.\"\n\n\"Is the world a better place for having Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios?\" she asked.\n\n\"I would have to say definitely, yes!\" McNabb replied.\n\nShe says another brilliant stroke \u2013 shaping the marshmallows in Lucky Charms into tiny unicorns \u2013 has boosted sales by double-digits.\n\nCBS News\n\nBut is it the most nutritious choice? Probably not, said Wendy Lopez, a registered dietitian, the perfect person to ask the big question: \"What do YOU eat for breakfast?\"\n\n\"I actually have a smoothie,\" Lopez said. \"Usually I'll put some kind of yogurt, and I'll put vegetables in there, too. I know it sounds a little crazy \u2026\"\n\n\"Sounds horrible!\" laughed Spencer.\n\n\"It'll be something like spinach or cucumber, and then I'll balance it with banana.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nSpencer, who recoiled at the suggestion of blending spinach and cucumber in the morning, asked Freedman, \"Is there anything that you just absolutely cannot in your worst nightmare imagine eating for breakfast?\"\n\n\"Pumpkin spice stuff,\" Freedman replied. \"I do draw the line at pumpkin spice.\"\n\nDrawing the line is what Wil Fulton probably wishes he'd done. After 82 consecutive bowls of cereal, he didn't quite feel himself. Go figure.\n\nThe all-cereal diet, he said, \"made me lethargic, it made me confused.\"\n\n\"Of course, in fairness, nobody suggests that anybody eat Lucky Charms exclusively,\" said Spencer.\n\n\"No. This is something I totally brought on myself.\"\n\nSpencer asked Lopez, \"All my life, people have said, 'Breakfast is the most important meal.' Is that true?\"\n\n\"Eating breakfast really helps to set the tone for what you're gonna be eating for the rest of the day,\" Lopez replied.\n\n\"If I could eat my favorite breakfast every day, it would just be bacon and eggs.\"\n\n\"Do you have any favorite vegetables that you enjoy?\"\n\n\"Not that go with bacon and eggs in a smoothie!\" Spencer replied.\n\n\n\nBreakfast recipes from Wendy Lopez:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Amiel Weisfogel.\n\n\n\nFor more recipes from \"Sunday Morning\" visit the 2018 \"Food Issue\" Recipe Index"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Elizabeth Campbell", "title": "Pelosi picks up 2 more Democratic votes in bid for speaker", "description": "Four representatives elect talk the future of their parties and political discourse in America.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-neguse-chrissy-houlahan-announce-support-for-nancy-pelosis-bid-for-speaker-of-the-house-on-face-the-nation/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/18/037cd843-96d3-4258-bfbb-895bb10c704e/thumbnail/1200x630/8e516206ede013cbee0d5b04f6a2a76a/negues-and-houlahan.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:53:50Z", "content": "Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi can add two more yes votes in her hunt to get to 218 to win election as speaker of the House in January.

And right now I believe that she's an effective person in that job.\"\n\nNeguse is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and said the group would be a strong ally for Pelosi, contrasting the dynamic to tea party Republicans who were often thorns in the side of GOP leaders.\n\n\"I think we are all working together rowing in the same direction trying to save our democracy,\" he said.\n\nCrenshaw, the Republican, pushed back on the idea that democracy is in need of saving.\n\n\"We just had an election where we switched power in the House. Democracy is at work,\" Crenshaw said. \"I always ask for examples, and then we can hit those examples one-by-one and if it's worth criticizing, it's worth criticizing, but just kind of this broad-brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining our democracy.

If we have policy disagreements, let's focus on those policy disagreements and I'll be happy to discuss those at any point,\" Crenshaw said. \"But this is what I've been getting at kind of all week, which is we tend to go right at the jugular, right?

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced late Friday that she has added the companies to a state-court lawsuit filed last spring against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and several opioid distributors.\n\nBondi said in a press release that CVS and Walgreens \"played a role in creating the opioid crisis.\" She said the companies failed to stop \"suspicious orders of opioids\" and \"dispensed unreasonable quantities of opioids from their pharmacies.\" On average, about 45 people die nationally each day because of opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"We will continue to pursue those companies that played a role in creating the opioid crisis,\" said Bondi, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement by President Trump for recently ousted U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"Thousands of Floridians have suffered as a result of the actions of the defendants.\"\n\nCVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis called the lawsuit \"without merit\" in a statement Saturday. He said the company trains its pharmacists and their assistants about their responsibilities when dispensing controlled substances and gives them tools to detect potentially illegal sales.\n\n\"Over the past several years, CVS has taken numerous actions to strengthen our existing safeguards to help address the nation's opioid epidemic,\" DeAngelis said.\n\nWalgreens said Saturday it doesn't comment on pending lawsuits.\n\nUntil a law enforcement crackdown at the beginning of the decade, Florida was known for its so-called pain mills. Drug dealers from throughout the country would send associates to storefront clinics where unscrupulous doctors would write opioid prescriptions for bogus injuries and illnesses. At one point, 90 of the nation's top 100 opioid prescribers were Florida doctors, according to federal officials.\n\nAfter receiving the prescriptions, the phony patients would buy the pills from Florida pharmacies \u2014 state law says pharmacists must refuse to fill prescriptions they suspect are not for a valid purpose. Most of the opioids would then be taken out of state to be resold illegally at huge markups, creating a drug crisis in many communities throughout the Eastern United States.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Walgreens has dispensed billions of opioid dosages from its Florida pharmacies since 2006. The Illinois-based chain is the nation's largest drugstore chain and has more than 13,200 stores globally.\n\nThe company distributed 2.2 million opioid tablets from its store in Hudson, a Tampa-area town of 12,000, and in one unidentified town of 3,000, sold 285,000 pills in a month, the lawsuit says. In some stores, its opioid sales jumped six-fold in two years. The company paid $80 million five years ago to resolve a federal investigation that centered on inadequate record keeping of its Florida opioid sales that allowed the pills to reach the black market.\n\nFlorida's accusations against CVS were more general, saying it sold 700 million opioid dosages between 2006 and 2014, including outsized sales in Hudson and two other nearby towns.

Later, hundreds of protesters entered the bottom of the street dotted with luxury shops where the palace is located -- and where Macron lives.\n\nThey were seen on BFMTV talking with riot police when the officers suddenly raised their shields and pushed the group back.\n\nFrench Interior Ministry officials estimated that about 244,000 protesters were involved in several thousand protests around the country, many of them spontaneous.\n\nThe protester who died, a 63-year-old woman, was killed when a driver caught in the blockade accelerated in a panic at Pont-de-Beauvoisin, near Chambery, according to Louis Laugier, the prefect, or top state official, in the eastern Savoie region. According to various French media reports, protesters reportedly knocked on her car as she tried to take her daughter to a hospital. An investigation was opened.\n\nFive people were seriously injured, while the others had more minor injuries, the Interior Ministry said in an early evening statement, raising an earlier count. It said 52 people were detained and 38 held for questioning.\n\nProtesters, wearing yellow safety vests and dubbing themselves the \"yellow jackets,\" pledged to target tollbooths, roundabouts and the bypass that ring Paris. The fluorescent yellow vests donned by the protesters must be kept in the vehicles of all French drivers in case of car troubles.\n\nERIC GAILLARD/REUTERS\n\nThe ministry said security forces used tear gas in several places besides the Champs-Elysees to unblock major routes, including firing about 30 canisters at the entrance to the Mont Blanc tunnel.\n\nThe nationwide protest was unusual due to its grassroots origins. It arose from within the citizenry, backed neither by unions nor politicians, although some took part in a clear bid for supporters.\n\nThe amateur nature of the protests, often spontaneous and therefore illegal, made it tricky for police, who had orders to use dialogue over force but to stop protesters from completely blocking major routes or endangering lives or property.\n\nPolice fired tear gas when a group moved into a street near the presidential palace. Hundreds of protesters took over the Place de la Concorde at the bottom of the avenue, shouting \"Macron resign\" as police looked on. By evening, 1,200 protesters remained in the Place \"protected by police,\" the Interior Ministry said.\n\nThe rise in fuel taxes, notably for diesel fuel, spoke to those French who feel the president has asked ordinary citizens to make the largest efforts in his bid to transform France. The taxes are part of Macron's strategy to wean France off fossil fuels. Many drivers see them as emblematic of a presidency they view as disconnected from day-to-day economic difficulties and serving the rich.\n\nRobert Tichit, 67, a retiree, referred to the president as \"King Macron.\"\n\n\"We've had enough of it.

So good luck, captain. Make sure to Instagram it.\"\n\nKelly took the president's Instagram challenge to heart. On his fourth mission into space, from 250 miles up, he pointed his camera at the planet. Kelly has collected those space photographs in his new book, \"Infinite Wonder.\"\n\n\"You see continents and countries without any political borders. It gives you the impression that we're all in this thing called humanity together,\" Kelly told \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" co-host Anthony Mason. \"Actually, the whole experience makes you feel insignificant.\"\n\nIt offered a unique vantage point on the vastness of it all. From Manhattan to the Milky Way. Kelly would spend 340 days in space. Some of his photography was for scientific purposes, but most was for his own pleasure.\n\n\"Sometimes it was as simple as, 'Hey, that spot looks a little interesting down there.' You know, some dry lakebed in Iran, as an example. Let me take a picture of it and see what it looks like,\" Kelly said.\n\n\n\nThrough his lens he found a lake in Bolivia, wetlands in Brazil, a mountain meeting a desert in Algeria, valleys full of iron ore and manganese in Libya, and a lake in western Australia. Many of his photos look like abstract paintings, which, Kelly said, is exactly what he was going for. He became a master of microgravity photography.\n\n\"So you're looking at a small spot on the Earth and the Earth is going by at five miles a second. You know it takes a very steady tracking motion to be able to take a picture that's not blurry,\" Kelly said. \"A lot of people, when they first get to space, you're very clumsy. \u2026 It's interesting when you see a bunch of new astronauts show up. They're like bouncing off the wall, stuff flying all over the place.\"\n\nThe book also offers a look at life in space. One photo captures Kelly watching his brother on a TV in the International Space Station \u2013 losing on \"Celebrity Jeopardy.\"\n\nKelly, who now has well over a million Instagram followers, shared many of his photos online. \"Which was great because you could see the reaction you got from people,\" he said. \"I could see the comments. I would read the comments sometimes.\"\n\nOne follower commented on the plants he was growing on the space station, writing that Kelly was \"no Mark Watney,\" a reference to the gifted botanist trapped on Mars in the movie \"The Martian.\"\n\n\n\n\"After that, you know, fight's on. I was gonna do whatever it took to make those flowers look better.\"\n\nHe succeeded and posted a picture to prove it.\n\n\"Earth is a beautiful place, whether you're looking at it, you know, all in one view.

On Thursday, on the anniversary of the disappearance, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nArgentina's defense ministry said the submarine was found \"imploded\" about 3,000 feet below the ocean surface, Reuters reports. The defense ministry said it couldn't yet confirm or deny if the discovered submarine could be recovered.\n\nThe San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost. Argentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but the navy has continued searching for the vessel.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15 that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from.

They hope to receive political asylum in the U.S.\n\nWhen asked why, Idenia Molina Rocha held up a newspaper. She said it shows her family on the front page, along with a photo of their home. They support those who are against their president, and they're being persecuted for those beliefs.\n\nRocha claims that pro-government forces opened fire on her 14-year-old son in July and detonated a homemade bomb that lodged shrapnel in his leg, forcing him to hobble on crutches along the caravan route. Rocha's son said he was with a friend when they were shot at. He said his friend pushed him down and was killed. When they retreated to the mountains, he said people helped take the shrapnel out with nail clippers, but he thinks there are still pieces in his leg.\n\nRocha said \"wanted\" signs for her family were posted in town, so they left Nicaragua, traversed Guatemala and eventually made it to southern Mexico. They stayed there a month and then word spread about a caravan approaching.\n\nRocha, appealing directly to President Trump, said, \"I would get on my knees and beg.\"\n\n\"Don't send us back,\" she said. \"We're walking and scared.

She's part of a group of LGBT migrants that is among the early arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border. Many said they were persecuted in their home countries because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nEarlier in the journey in southern Mexico, Diaz met a transgender woman who claims she was targeted in Honduras by gang members and was attacked by more than a dozen armed men who broke into her home. She said she's been beaten up and has a scar from the attack but doesn't like to show it because it traumatizes her more. She fears for her life in Honduras since the gang members know where she lives and have a photo of her.\n\nStill, if she makes it to the U.S. border and presents her asylum case, the odds are against her."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Pence's chief of staff, at age 36, eyed to replace John Kelly", "description": "A seasoned campaign veteran at age 36, Nick Ayers is emerging as a leading contender", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nick-ayers-pences-chief-of-staff-age-36-eyed-to-replace-john-kelly/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/17/c24f30df-7e30-453e-9fa4-05b8ceb9d71d/thumbnail/1200x630/7c21d5fe44679a64f64d484d55e50af8/gettyimages-886408476.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:40:38Z", "content": "Nick Ayers could almost be confused for a college fraternity brother as he flashes a broad grin in a selfie taken with Mike Pence just moments after the Indiana governor was named Donald Trump's running mate.

In fact, the baby-faced campaign strategist in the white undershirt had a pivotal role in Mr. Trump's selection of Pence in 2016. And two years later, Ayers' bond with Pence is stronger than ever, as are his ties to the president.\n\nA seasoned campaign veteran at age 36, Ayers is emerging as a leading contender to replace White House chief of staff John Kelly, whose departure has long been the subject of speculation.\n\nIf selected, Ayers would return a political mind to the role as Trump's presidency enters a new, more perilous phase in which he fights for re-election while fending off new oversight efforts from a Democratic House.\n\nIn any administration, the role of White House chief of staff is split between the responsibilities of supervising the White House and managing the man sitting in the Oval Office. Striking that balance in the turbulent times of President Trump has bedeviled both Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus. If Ayers becomes the third person to tackle the job, it'll be his most significant challenge \u2014 and one friends say he's well-equipped to handle.\n\n\"He manages up as well as anyone I've ever seen,\" said Phil Cox, a former colleague at the Republican Governor's Association who bought Ayers' political consulting business earlier this year.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump is said to have warmed to Ayers in part by watching the effectiveness of Pence's largely independent political operation. The vice president's chief of staff for the last 18 months, Ayers has earned the backing of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president's daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, for taking on the new role, White House officials said.\n\nAyers would be the youngest chief of staff since 34-year-old Hamilton Jordan served under Jimmy Carter.\n\nBut before Ayers can have his crack at leading the White House staff, he first has to overcome opposition from some who may soon work for him.\n\nOn Air Force One on Sunday as Mr. Trump returned to the U.S. from a turbulent two-day trip to Paris, aides argued to the president that Ayers was the wrong person for the job, according to two people familiar with the matter, The Associated Press reports. More than a half-dozen administration aides spoke about Ayers on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter, the AP reports.\n\nIn some corners of the White House, Ayers is viewed skeptically over how he has led Pence's office, which operates largely independent of the Trump West Wing. Some in the White House blame Ayers for planting news stories critical of the administration or its strategies, while others have complaints about his efforts to circumvent the president's political operation. Some aides have taken to calling him \"Tricky Nicky.\"\n\nAyers didn't respond to a request for an interview from The Associated Press. But allies said he is eager to take on the chief of staff job. He and Mr. Trump have been discussing the possibility of making the switch for months.\n\nAllies said that while Ayers isn't as deeply versed in foreign policy as some of his predecessors, he had developed experience advising Pence on global affairs. He has been a frequent participant in Mr. Trump's daily intelligence briefings, occasionally even when Pence wasn't present.\n\nThe timing of Kelly's expected departure isn't clear, though White House aides predict it will occur in tandem with the anticipated exit of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the coming months. Sources familiar with the matter told CBS News Nielsen will be leaving, but say the timing is uncertain. Just last month, Mr. Trump praised her response to devastating hurricanes, and she has been a vocal advocate for the president's policies, including immigration.\n\nBut sources said she could fall victim to the president's frustration that his immigration agenda has stalled.\n\nHowever, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway attempted to cast doubt Tuesday on the anonymously sourced reports about a staff shake-up.\n\n\"Why do they remain anonymous? Could it be that it's not completely verified and true?\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Holiday movie preview 2018: From \"Mary Poppins Returns\" to \"The Favorite\"", "description": "Dozens of new films are hitting theaters over the next five weeks.

Followed by either, 'Does it really have Coke in it?' Or the rarer but hopeful, 'Does it have cocaine in it?'\n\nThree Rivers Press\n\n\"It would be irresponsible of me not to warn you about the Curse of the Coke Cake. Simply put: do not let Coca-Cola Cake anywhere near your wedding. My brother David created the most stunning four-story Coke Cake for his sister-in-law Nicole's wedding with raspberry preserve filling and a fondant icing that would make Martha Stewart's meringues weep. For my first marriage, he baked three elegant tiers of it for my engagement party, which he decorated with fresh flowers. I was married in Scotland for my practice wedding and even had an extremely perplexed local bakery make Coca-Cola \"fairy cakes\" for the rehearsal dinner party.\n\n\"Nicole got divorced. So did I. Let this be a lesson to you. Coke Cake knows. It know The Real Thing when it comes to love and will tank s****y marriages.\n\n\"I believe this cake wants to live as a bundt. My brother loves offering it as a sheet cake, but we all know about the devastation he's wrought through his baking. There's something both sturdy and elegant about the bundt, and you can't beat the way the warm and thick Coke frosting cascades over the sides.\n\n\"So here's my mom's recipe. If the word 'moist' makes you uncomfortable, then don't try this at home. As you know, I always triple the vanilla extract and probably add too many miniature marshmallows, because life can only be made better by pillows of corn syrup. Please enjoy and think of Gail.\"\n\nGail's Coca-Cola Cake\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 sticks butter (salted \u2013 what are you crazy, using unsalted??)\n\n1 \u00bd cups mini marshmallows\n\n3 heaping Tablespoons cocoa powder\n\n1 cup Coke\n\n2 cups sugar\n\n2 cups flour, plus extra for dusting\n\n2 large eggs\n\n\u00bd cup buttermilk\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat over to 350\u00b0F.\n\nIn a saucepan, on medium-high heat, melt the butter with the marshmallows, cocoa powder, and Coke, stirring it until it boils. Then remove it from the heat. In a mixing bowl, pour the cocoa mixture over the sugar and flour and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add the eggs and mix until combined.\n\nOn a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, baking soda and vanilla extract (I use 3 teaspoons). Pour the buttermilk mixture into the batter and beat for about 1 minute.\n\nPour the cake batter into a greased and floured bundt pan. (I use Baker's Joy. If you use two 6 cups bundt pans ((like I do)), then bake for 30 to 35 minutes.) If you use the normal large 12 cups bundt pan, then bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes, then flip it onto a cooling rack.\n\nFor the frosting:\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 stick butter\n\n5 to 6 tablespoons Coke\n\n2 heaping Tablespoons cocoa powder\n\n1 box confectioner's sugar\n\nInstructions:\n\nIn a saucepan over low to medium heat, combine the butter, Coke, and cocoa powder and melt until just boiling, stirring often so the cocoa powder doesn't burn.

Born and raised in the suburb of Brookline, her artist father loved to cook, and she'd help out in the kitchen. She went to cooking school, but may have learned the most from amazing mentors that include Julia Child and Wolfgang Puck.\n\nShe returned the favor by mentoring a new generation of top Boston cooking talent, many of whom worked in the six Boston restaurants she's opened over the years.\n\nHere are some of Shire's signature recipes:\n\nThanksgiving porchetta\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the stuffing:\n\n3 cups cubed cornbread (homemade) toasted in a low oven 300 degrees until slightly dry\n\n1 large Spanish yellow onion diced\n\n2 cups diced inner stalks and leaves of a celery head\n\n\u00bd bunch curly parsley washed , dried and chopped\n\n2 T Bell's seasoning\n\n1 cup light poultry stock\n\n1 + \u00bd cups lightly toasted pecans chopped coarsely\n\n10 oz. fresh chanterelles wiped or washed of all dirt then dried. (Chop coarsely and saut\u00e9 in 3 T. unsalted butter with 1 T. chopped fresh garlic.)\n\n1 T chopped fresh garlic .\n\nDirections\n\n1. Place the pork belly on your cutting board skin down and remove the rib bones. Save. Now turn the belly over, skin side up. With a very sharp knife I use a boning knife as the blade is thinner but rigid and extremely sharp with a very small sharp point. Prick the skin many many many times, all over . You simply want to puncture the skin , do not go to deep.Take your time , every square inch should be poked well . Now , please score the skin into a large diamond pattern approximately 2-inch diamond pattern . Again don't go too deeply, just go through the skin. Place the pork belly skin side up on a cake cooling rack over the sink at an angle .\n\n2. Bring to a boil in a sauce pan 1 qt. water, 1+ \u00bd cup white vinegar , 3 T. salt and lastly 2 teaspoons baking soda (which you add to the boiling mixture just before you want to \"wash\" the poked + scored skin).\n\n3. Once the pork belly is poked and put on a rack over the sink. Add the baking soda (it will bubble fiercely) and start ladling the boiling mixture all over the skin, you will see it turn a bit whitish. All this is for how your skin will be eventually crisp and will 'crackle' at the end .\n\n4. Dry corn bread , saut\u00e9 diced onion and celery in \u00bd stick butter until soft .. add the cooked mushrooms , Bell's Seasoning , the chopped pecans , and the freshly chopped parsley to the cornbread . Mix and add the stock. Taste for salt and pepper. Depending on your palette, you may want to add a bit more melted butter or stock. Refrigerate until cold, it will be easier to roll in the pork belly .\n\n5. Place the belly skin side down and shape the stuffing into a log down the center lengthwise . Bring sides up to meet and tie securely with kitchen twine so that you have a long roll . Place on a rack with the reserved belly rib bones , a few carrots , onion and those outer stalks of celery under the rolled belly .. all this in a 300 degree oven for 1 + 1/5 hour or until it is tender or when a skewer is used to poke through easily . Remove from oven .. let rest while you increase heat to 500 degrees ( or 450 degrees ) . Place the pan back into the hotter oven and roast for approximately 15 or 20 minutes more , until the skin has POPPED !!!! and is a beautiful crisp texture and color .\n\n6. Let rest before you slice it. This does not exactly need a sauce but if you want to deglaze the roasting pan with some white wine scrapping all those goodies, maybe adding a little meat stock. Reduce a bit and add some butter then strain and season. Beware though if the bottom of the pan is too burned , you won't be able to make any kind of a sauce that will taste good\n\nLobster Finnan Haddie Chowder\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n2 X 1+1/2 live lobsters blanched in salted water 5 min. then shocked , meat removed + cut into largish chunks ( save shells )\n\n2 lbs. piece of bone in Finnan haddie\n\nButter\n\nWhole milk\n\nHeavy cream\n\nSavory & James Amontillado Sherry or a good Cream Sherry\n\n1 large Spanish Yellow Onion diced in \u00bd in. pieces\n\n3 medium sized red bliss potatoes also diced into \u00bd in pieces\n\nFresh chopped curly parsley for garnish\n\n1 sliced onion\n\n2 stalks celery cut into 1 in. pieces\n\n2 bay leaves\n\nParsley stalks\n\n2 T. black peppercorns\n\n1 T. celery seed\n\nDirections\n\n1. Place the finnan haddie in a sauce pan and cover with 2 cups of milk, add veggies, peppercorns and celery seed. Place loosely on top a piece of aluminum foil. Put in a preheated 350 degree oven + bake until almost cooked through. Remove from oven, let sit til room temp. Flake the fish into largish flakes. Save the milk and bones and skin\n\n2. Take a sauce/soup pot, add a big nugget of butter and saut\u00e9 the lobster shells until bright red. Deglaze with 1+ \u00bd cup sherry, let reduce slightly. Add 1 + \u00bd cups heavy cream, 2 cups milk and the remaining Finnan Haddie milk. Let simmer gently, add all the fish bones and skin. Season with Sea Salt, freshly ground black pepper and a bit of paprika. Take off the heat after 20 min. Refrigerate overnight unstrained .\n\n3. The day you serve , strain soup . Saute your diced onion in a nugget of butter til soft ( no color ) add diced potatoes , pour in the soup and bring to simmer. Stop the cooking as soon as the potatoes are just a tiny bit al dente. Basically don't overcook the potatoes until mushy.\n\n\n\n4. In sauce pot , add big lump of butter and quickly saut\u00e9 the lobster meat adding a little more sherry , add the flaked Finnan Haddie and ladle in the soup with the potatoes etc. Make sure it is hot.

Split in half using a heavy chef's knife through the stem end and the pointed end . Place all halves cut side down on a sheet pan with sides. Do not remove the seeds. Add a small amount of water from the faucet (1/3 rd cup ) and place the squash in a preheated hot 400 degree oven , middle shelf .\n\n2. Bake until tender (poke with a skewer) and you see brown juices flowing from under the squash. Flip over with a metal spatula to show the cut side, delicately spoon out the seeds and discard. Make some deep cuts into the flesh and plop an insanely lot of unsalted butter onto the flesh making sure it melts all over. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the squash and then put an insanely amount of light brown sugar onto the squash.\n\n3. Lastly cook 1 strip of your best bacon per half squash, cut into 4 pieces. Do not overcook the bacon. Scatter inside the squash with a few drops of bacon fat. Serve hot.

Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, met Mr. Trump as he landed in California to tour the areas affected by the blaze. Mr. Trump toured destroyed homes in Paradise, joined by Paradise Mayor Jody Jones, FEMA administrator Brock Long, Brown and Newsom.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters the federal government would provide \"a lot of money and some expertise, and somehow we'll all pull through it together.\"\n\n\"We do have to do management, maintenance, and we'll be working also with environmental groups,\" Mr. Trump said about how to prevent future fires.\"Hopefully this is gonna be the last of these because this was a really, really bad one. And I know Gavin's committed, we're all committed.\"\n\nLater, in Chico, Mr. Trump declined to say whether climate change directly impacted the fires, saying there were \"a lot of factors.\" He said that seeing the devastation had not changed his opinion on climate change.\n\nBoth Brown and Newsom welcomed Mr. Trump's visit before he arrived, declaring it's time \"to pull together for the people of California.\" Earlier this week, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off federal payments to California.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\"\n\nHe later approved a federal disaster declaration.\n\nEvan Vucci / AP\n\nHe also criticized forest management in an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday,\" saying that while climate change \"maybe contributes a bit,\" the \"big problem we have is management.\"\n\nMr. Trump reiterated those claims as he spoke to reporters on the White House lawn Saturday morning before departing for California. \"We will be talking about forest management. I've been saying that for a long time. And it could have been a lot different situation,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted about his visit shortly before arriving on Saturday. He mentioned that he would be touring the state with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican Reps. Doug LaMalfa and Ken Calvert.\n\nThe president incorrectly suggested that forest management in the state was largely controlled by the state's government, when it's the federal government that owns more than 60 percent of the land in the state.\n\nAccording to Climate Nexus, climate change amplifies the threat of wildfires by creating ideal settings for them to burn.

The filing, discovered Thursday night, said the charges and arrest warrant \"would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\"\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reports, Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in large part out of fear that if he leaves he'll be extradited to the U.S., and this latest revelation could be an indication that his fear is well founded.\n\nThe exact charges Assange faces and when they might be unsealed remained uncertain Friday.\n\nAny charges against him could help illuminate whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. They also would suggest that, after years of internal Justice Department wrangling, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tack against WikiLeaks.\n\nA criminal case also holds the potential to expose the practices of a radical transparency activist who has been under U.S. government scrutiny for years and at the center of some of the most explosive disclosures of stolen information in the last decade. Those include thousands of military and State Department cables from Army Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, secret CIA hacking tools, and most recently and notoriously, Democratic emails that were published in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and that U.S. intelligence officials say had been hacked by Russia.\n\nFederal special counsel Robert Mueller, who has already charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking, has been investigating whether any Trump associates had advance knowledge of the stolen emails.\n\nAssange could be an important link for Mueller as he looks to establish exactly how WikiLeaks came to receive the emails, and why its release of the communications -- on the same day a highly damaging video of Mr. Trump from a decade earlier surfaced publicly -- appeared timed to boost his campaign.\n\nAssange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy under a grant of asylum for more than six years to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was accused of sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Mother in migrant caravan makes an emotional appeal to President Trump", "description": "After using it as an election campaign issue, President Trump is once again focusing on the caravan of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border.

The rocket boosted a Cygnus supply craft into orbit with another 3.7 tons of equipment and supplies bound for the lab complex.\n\nRunning two days late because of stormy weather, the Antares' Russian-built RD-181 first stage engines ignited with a thundering roar at 4:01 a.m. ET, quickly pushing the rocket away from pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport - MARS - at NASA's Wallops Island, Virginia, flight test facility.\n\nArcing away to the southeast as it climbed directly into the plane of the space station's orbit, the Antares put on a spectacular light show, smoothly accelerating through a clear, deep overnight sky. Its fiery exhaust was visible for miles around.\n\nThe liquid-fueled first stage shut down and fell away three minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, followed by ignition of the rocket's solid-fuel upper stage, which fired for a little more than two-and-a-half minutes to complete the climb to orbit.\n\nThe Cygnus spacecraft separated from the spent second stage two minutes later, kicking off a two-day rendezvous with the International Space Station. If all goes well, the spacecraft will carry out an automated approach to the lab complex, pulling up to within about 30 feet early Monday.\n\nAt that point, astronaut Serena Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor, operating the station's robot arm, will lock onto a grapple fixture so the spacecraft can be pulled in for berthing at the lab's centra Unity module.\n\nThe spacecraft is loaded with 2,255 pounds of science gear, 64 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 2,183 pounds of space station hardware, 253 pounds of computer gear and 2,605 pounds of crew supplies, including fresh fruit and ice cream.\n\nAmong the experiment hardware is a commercial 3D printer called the \"Refabricator\" that can process waste materials into filament that can be used to print tools and other components; a \"lab on a chip\" cell culture device to study skeletal muscle cells; research to study how cement solidifies in weightlessness; and another to learn more about proteins involved in Parkinson's disease.\n\nOver the next three months, the station crew will unload the cargo ship and repack it with trash and no-longer-needed equipment. After release from the station in mid-February, the spacecraft will launch three small Cubesats from a commercially-developed NanoRacks deployer before plunging back into the atmosphere and burning up.\n\nSaturday's launch was the 10th operational resupply mission carried out by Northrup Grumman and the recently acquired Orbital ATK under an initial 11-flight contract with NASA that is expected to total $2.89 billion, according to the agency's inspector general. The company also holds a follow-on contract for at least six space station resupply missions at an as-yet-unspecified cost.\n\nSpaceX also holds NASA contracts for commercial resupply totaling $3.04 billion for 20 flights. Like Orbital, SpaceX also holds a follow-on contract for additional flights.\n\nOn Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, launched a Soyuz FG rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, lifting the Progress MS-10/71P cargo ship into orbit. Loaded with 2.8 tons of propellant, crew supplies, water and equipment, the Progress is on track to dock at the Russian Zvezda module Sunday afternoon U.S. time.\n\nThe Progress launch was critical to Roscosmos and NASA because it demonstrated a successful recovery from an Oct. 10 launch abort when problems with the system used to jettison one of four strap-on boosters malfunctioned, forcing the two-man crew of a Soyuz ferry ship to carry out an emergency landing.\n\nWith the successful launch Friday, the Russians plan to press ahead with plans to launch another Soyuz spacecraft on Dec. 3 to deliver vehicle commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian flight engineer David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain to the station, briefly boosting the lab's crew to six.\n\nThe day after the Soyuz launch, SpaceX plans to launch a Dragon cargo ship from Cape Canaveral carrying yet another load of supplies to the space station. Then on Dec. 20, Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor, Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst and Soyuz MS-09/56S commander Sergey Prokopyev plan to return to Earth, closing out a 196-day mission.\n\nKononenko, Saint-Jacques and McClain will have the station to themselves until another set of crew members arrives in early April."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Private funeral held for Stan Lee", "description": "Stan Lee co-created the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and many of the other heroes in the Marvel comic and cinematic universes", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stan-lee-funeral-held-today-pow-entertainment-says-further-memorials-planned-2018-11-16/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/22/e1b4cb69-afb7-4191-9fb7-f2fb9dbf5c22/thumbnail/1200x630/2be78f98e326ca1868b6ca2851c8fe17/ap-02042303291.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T05:18:30Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- A small, private funeral has been held to mourn Marvel Comics mogul Stan Lee, and his company is making more plans to memorialize him. \"Stan was always adamant that he did not want a large public funeral, and as such his family has conducted a \u2026 [+1099 chars]", "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES -- A small, private funeral has been held to mourn Marvel Comics mogul Stan Lee, and his company is making more plans to memorialize him. \"Stan was always adamant that he did not want a large public funeral, and as such his family has conducted a private closed ceremony in accordance with his final wishes,\" Lee's company POW!

Brian Varela had pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, third-degree rape, and unlawful disposal of remains as part of a plea deal in the February death of 18-year-old Alyssa Noceda.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Linda Krese said Thursday she could not sentence Brian Varela to more than 2 years and 10 months because it was the most prison time permitted for someone with no prior criminal record, The Daily Herald reported.\n\nKrese said she was \"surprised, even outraged,\" by the inadequacy of the sentence and suggested that state lawmakers may not have realized the impact of their decision when they set prison sentences for the charges.\n\n\"I'm not sure the Legislature really contemplated something like this,\" Krese said.\n\nVarela told detectives that Noceda came to a party on Feb. 3 northeast of the Seattle suburb of Lynnwood. In Varela's room, he said Noceda snorted Percocet and also ingested liquid marijuana, court documents said. Tests later showed she had taken a fatal mix of fentanyl and alprazolam, a generic name for Xanax.\n\nShe collapsed within a minute of mixing the two, Varela told detectives. Authorities said Varela never sought help for Noceda and instead sent semi-nude photos of her to friends and texting \"LOL, I think she od'd, still breathing.\"\n\nVarela played an online game until he fell asleep, waking up in the morning to find Noceda's lips blue, court documents said.\n\nHe went to work at Dairy Queen and his co-worker contacted police in the following days after Varela said he didn't know if Noceda was still alive when he was having sex with her. Court records say he told a friend that \"she died having sex with me.\"\n\nPolice arrested Varela later that day after executing a search warrant and finding Noceda's body in a plastic crate at the suspect's home.\n\nVarela told investigators he planned to bury Noceda with onions to minimize the odor, police said. He also told detectives that after Noceda died, he used her thumb to unlock her phone Feb. 4 and send messages to make it appear she had run away.\n\nIn court Thursday, Varela said only, \"I'm sorry for my foolish actions. Whatever I get is what I deserve.\"\n\nNoceda's mother and aunt cried when they learned the likely sentence.\n\n\"You might as well let him walk free with that kind of time,\" Noceda's aunt, Rachelle Palmer said.\n\nNoceda's mother Gina Pierson told CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO in February that before the teen left home the night she died, she yelled to each of her family members by name and told them she loved them. Pierson said she had a strange feeling that something bad might happen, but she kept the thought to herself.\n\n\"That was the last person my daughter saw,\" Pierson told KIRO of Varela. \"Just made me sick, made me feel sick.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/16/18: CBSN Evening News", "description": "Officials raise death toll to 66 across state; Rare monkey born at Budapest Zoo.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/111618-cbsn-evening-news/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/17/40d4adf9-9c33-4f40-9a69-eb5fffdeea2a/thumbnail/1200x630/34d1ef6ba9c0388d8059ea622fb71cd7/1116-cbsn-full-1714211-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T03:56:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/16: CBS Evening News", "description": "Trump says he answered written questions from Mueller \"very easily\"; Soldier says a stranger's Christmas card got him through the Vietnam War.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/1116-cbs-evening-news-2/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/17/55e18281-811d-4de2-8fd9-02c26eba7a00/thumbnail/1200x630/198e4b8c286ab132fa448d46ec7fa18c/1116-en-full-1714219-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T03:46:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Hundreds still missing in California's Camp Fire", "description": "President Trump is set to visit Northern California on Saturday to speak with victims and First Responders of the deadly wildfires.
