A linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons, he spent eight years sacking quarterbacks in the NFL. In his spare time, he got a law degree and became an attorney. After he retired from football, he spent a decade covering the NFL as an analyst for Fox Sports, all the while writing books and becoming a best seller.\n\nToday, Green is playing a new, unwanted role.\n\n\"I think it's the same as it was before,\" he told 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft. \"Be the best husband, best dad, lawyer, writer, businessperson I can be. And also to tackle ALS.\"\n\nGreen was diagnosed with ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, two years ago. The disease, which New York Yankee Lou Gehrig first gave a name and a face to almost 80 years ago, destroys the nerves that control voluntary muscle movement. Most ALS patients are given two to five years to live.\n\nThis week on 60 Minutes, Kroft speaks with Green about his diagnosis. Green said he initially realized something was amiss when he couldn't use his nail clippers. After a while, opening things became difficult. When he finally admitted something was wrong and went to see a doctor, a neurologist diagnosed Green with ALS\u2014and told him to get his affairs in order.\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes Overtime, Kroft said he has known Green for about 25 years. He first interviewed Green for 60 Minutes in 1996, when the former Falcon was three years out of the NFL and forging a promising writing career. But Kroft said Green's story today is even more compelling\u2014and offers an insight that viewers can learn from.\n\n\"Commitment, pursuing things that you want to do,\" Kroft told 60 Minutes Overtime's Ann Silvio in the video above. \"That's the secret, to me, of a successful life. Do things you want to do. And try and enjoy them along the way. And also, the importance of family.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nInitially hesitant to speak about his diagnosis, Green has now dedicated himself to raising awareness of and funding for ALS. In an emotional interview with Kroft, Green began to cry. But he told Kroft they were \"tears of joy.\"\n\n\"I don't know anyone more fortunate and blessed than me\u2014even with this,\" Green said.\n\nKroft said Green's sentiment is a way to explain that he doesn't expect or want sympathy.\n\n\"I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this Earth\" \u2013 Lou Gehrig\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe attitude echoes another famous athlete: Lou Gehrig himself, who stood at home plate at Yankee Stadium and proclaimed his gratitude in the face of his own ALS diagnosis: \"I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this Earth \u2026 I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for.\"\n\n\"I think Tim feels the same way,\" Kroft said.\n\nNo one knows what causes ALS. In Green's case, all those blows to the head while bringing down quarterbacks and running backs are a leading suspect. Although scientists caution that the data linking football to the disease is inconclusive, Green believes there is a connection. In his 1996 interview with Kroft, he even hinted that this day may come.\n\n\"I think guys would be willing to take 10 to 20 years off the end of their lives in order to get out there on a Sunday and play,\" Green told Kroft in 1996. \"I don't think that the consideration of your physical well-being in the future is in the forefront of any NFL player's mind.\"\n\nStill, Green told Kroft that he has no regrets. He said the thrill of playing in the NFL was \"magical and wonderful.\" He continues to author books and spends as much time as he can with his family, eating dinner with his children\u2014some of whom are adults now\u2014five times a week.\n\n\"Some people would say, you know, 'Tim, God bless you,'\" Green told Kroft. \"And I'd say, 'He already has.'\"\n\nTo contribute to Tim Green's ALS awareness fundraising campaign, visit TackleALS.com\n\nTo watch Steve Kroft's interview with Tim Green, click here.\n\nThe video above was produced by Ann Silvio and Lisa Orlando.

The first time we met him, he told us he had a lot of them.\n\nTim Green in 1996: I have enough aches and pains to know that I played the game\u2026\n\nHe was three years removed from a playing career in which he roamed the field like a predator, first in college at Syracuse\u2026\n\nAnd then as number 99 with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. He was a vicious tackler and a voracious reader, a man who devoured \"War and Peace\" in the locker room before going into battle. In retirement he kept his body fit and his mind sharp by writing novels for young and old at the upstate New York home that he shared with his wife and children.\n\n\"Life can never be long enough.\"\n\nBut by the summer of 2016, at age 52, he finally admitted to his son Troy that he felt something was off.\n\nTroy Green: He was saying to me you know, 'My hands, you know, it's getting hard for me to hold the weights,' And I'd make a joke, 'Oh, you're getting old,'\n\nTim decided to see a prominent hand surgeon.\n\nTim Green: And he looked. He said, 'I think you have ALS.' I said, 'No, I don't.'\n\nThat same day he went straight to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City to meet with a neurologist.\n\nTim Green: And, you know...\n\nSteve Kroft: What'd he tell you?\n\nTim Green: Get your affairs in order.\n\nTroy Green: He basically said, that the end is near, you better get affairs in order.\n\nSteve Kroft: Not what you wanted to hear?\n\nTim Green: No.\n\nALS, the three letters he didn't want to hear, stands for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare disease that New York Yankee legend Lou Gehrig gave a name and a face to 80 years ago and that recently claimed the life of physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking. It destroys the nerves that move muscles, eventually making it impossible to walk, speak or breathe. Tim understood that he'd been given a death sentence. He also had no interest in doctors, treatments or sympathy.\n\nTim Green: I said, 'We're not talkin' about it.'\n\nTroy Green: It was almost taboo. Even, even around the house, no one, we wouldn't talk about it, we wouldn't address it. It was just kinda like the elephant in the room.\n\nSteve Kroft: Were you in denial?\n\nTim Green: No, I knew I had it.\n\nSteve Kroft: You didn't wanna waste any time thinking about it? You just wanted to live?\n\nTim Green: Exactly.\n\nCBS News\n\nMost ALS patients are given two to five years to live. And Tim Green wanted to enjoy whatever time he had left with his five kids and wife of 29 years in the beautiful town of Skaneateles, which sits at the top of one of New York's Finger Lakes.\n\nTim Green: Life can never be long enough.\n\nSteve Kroft: Life can never be long enough.\n\nTim Green: Yeah.\n\nFew outside Tim's family knew of the diagnosis. He continued making public appearances, like this one in March 2017 on \"CBS This Morning\" alongside Derek Jeter. They were promoting their collaboration on a baseball book for middle school kids.\n\nSteve Kroft: Difficult to tell that there was anything wrong with you.\n\nTim Green: I could still enunciate my words more clearly. But that was a year and a half ago.\n\nTim's condition began deteriorating in the months after that appearance. His family finally convinced him to see a neurologist in Boston. He was examined by Dr. Merit Cudkowicz, the director of the Healey Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nSteve Kroft: What's Tim's prognosis?\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: He has one of the better prognoses because he has a slower form. However, everybody with ALS has a serious prognosis. It is, today, a fatal disease.\n\nSteve Kroft: And there's no cure?\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: There's no cure today But there are some treatments and there's a lot of advances in science and a lot of hope for our patients.\n\nDr. Cudkowicz put Green on a new treatment that can slow the progression of ALS by a third. He says he's noticed the difference.\n\nDr. Merit Cudkowicz: Your mood is okay?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Oh yeah.\n\nCBS News\n\nNo one knows exactly what causes ALS. In Tim Green's case, head trauma is a leading suspect. Scientists caution that the data linking football to the disease is not conclusive but the NFL concussion settlement specifically covers ALS and Tim Green believes there's a connection\n\nSteve Kroft: How much of this do you think has to do with football?\n\nTim Green: I think probably a lot, if not all\u2026\n\nHe says he lost track of the number of concussions he suffered playing football. He stopped counting after ten.\n\nTim Green: I used my head on every play. Every play. Every snap. It was like throwing myself head first into a concrete wall.\n\nSteve Kroft: Did you ever think about it while you were playing?\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nHe even used his head to celebrate on the field. At the time, he says, no one was concerned about possible brain damage. During his NFL career in the late 80s and early 90s, pre-season practices were particularly brutal. Tim's wife Illyssa remembers the pounding he took.\n\nIlyssa Green: His head was so swollen he would put, have to put Vaseline all over his head to get his helmet on.\n\nTim Green: Practice was much worse than the games.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you didn't go easy in practice?\n\nTim Green: No. I was nuts.\n\nSteve Kroft: You seem like such a mild-mannered guy.\n\nTim Green: I am. I am.\n\nSteve Kroft: But not on a football field?\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nCBS News\n\nWhen we interviewed Tim Green in 1996, he addressed the violence and risks inherent in the game and seemed to believe that this day might come.\n\nSteve Kroft: You said, \"I think guys would be\u2026\"\n\nTim Green in 1996: \u2026willing to take ten to 20 years off the end of their lives in order to get out there on a Sunday and play. I don't think that the consideration of your physical well being in the future is in the forefront of any\u2026\n\nSteve Kroft: \"...NFL player's mind.\"\n\nTim Green: Right. I stand by that. I've maybe taken that much off the end of my life. Maybe more. I don't know.\n\nSteve Kroft: You don't have any regrets\u2026\n\nTim Green: No. No.\n\nTo fully understand, he says you have to know what it was like being out there, doing something you dreamed of and experiencing even for a moment the intensity of 60,000 people screaming for you and your teammates and feeling that energy through every pore in your body.\n\nTim Green: It was as magical and wonderful as I dreamed it would be.\n\nTim Green believes if his football career had started 30 years later, he might not be fighting for his life today. New NFL rules have drastically cut back helmet to helmet contact in practice and it's penalized in games.\n\nHe follows those guidelines with the youth team he coaches, limiting contact during practices. His 12-year-old son Ty is the team's star quarterback. Tim doesn't want him to play defense.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe trophies from his NFL career fill his office, but instead of mounted heads of lions, tigers and bears there are pictures of the big game quarterbacks he's brought down\n\nTim Green: Joe Montana\n\nSteve Kroft: Yeah, number 16. 49ers.\n\nTim Green: He was the king back then.\n\nSteve Kroft: And that is Dan Marino?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: I like that (both hands in air)\n\nSteve Kroft: Best time of your life?\n\nTim Green: No. Best time of my life is right now.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right now?\n\nTim Green: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: Why?\n\nTim Green: I have everything.\n\nTim Green was adopted so 'everything' to him means family. The Greens all live in the same neighborhood and they eat dinner together five nights a week.\n\n\"People would say, 'Tim, God bless you.' And I'd say, 'He already has.'\"\n\nHe works out with his sons almost every day at his home gym to keep his muscles functioning.\n\nThe kids say their dad's not going to quit.\n\nTroy Green: He'll never give up.\n\nTessa Green: I don't think I've ever seen that in his\u2026\n\nTate Green: Never.\n\nTessa Green: \u2026things that he does. He's never\u2026\n\nTroy Green: He doesn't give up in tic-tac-toe, he's not (laughter)\u2026\n\nTim Green: I don't think about about what I can't do.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you can still write?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. And I can write. And, you know, that opens up a universe.\n\nWriting offers him an escape from his illness. He's authored 38 books overall, four since his diagnosis. He wrote the last one on his smartphone using his thumbs, all 300 pages.\n\nSteve Kroft: So this is a new book?\n\nTim Green: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nHis thumbs no longer work that well but his mind is just fine, he's using technology to forge ahead with book number 39.\n\nTim Green: There's a sensor.\n\nThere's a sensor in his glasses that he can move to lock on letters on his keyboard, he then clicks on a mouse and words are formed, letter by letter.\n\nCBS News\n\nSteve Kroft: How far along are you on this, this book?\n\nTim Green: I'm about halfway.\n\nHe's a little behind schedule, the first deadline he's ever missed.\n\nTim Green: I apologized to my editor.\n\nSteve Kroft: I think your editor understands.\n\nTim Green: She did. Yeah.\n\nMore scientists than ever are trying to unlock the mystery of ALS and its causes, but it's still an underfunded disease.\n\nThat's why Tim and his family are starting a social media campaign called Tackle ALS to raise money for research. Current and former NFL stars Matt Ryan, Von Miller and Brett Favre have all joined the team.\n\nBut Tim understands that he may not be around to see the benefits. In the time he has left, however long that may be, he is content to enjoy the power of his boat and the company of his family. He just feels blessed for who he was and what he has.\n\nTim Green: People would say, 'Tim, God bless you.' And I'd say, 'He already has.'\n\nTo contribute to Tim Green's ALS awareness fundraising campaign, visit TackleALS.com\n\nProduced by Draggan Mihailovich.

They've developed a campaign to try to change the misperception, called \"Don't Wash Your Chicken.\"\n\n\"People are attached to the idea of washing raw poultry,\" Jennifer Quinlan, Associate Professor in the Nutrition Science Department at Drexel University, said in program materials. \"Some think they're cleaning off germs. Some just want to get slime off, or feel like it's dirty.\"\n\nMuch of the chicken purchased at the supermarket, regardless of which parts or whether or not it has skin, comes with campylobacter or salmonella bacteria. Neither cold or warm water, nor fruit acids will kill those bacteria, which can sometimes cause severe cases of food-borne illness.\n\nThe way to make chicken safe to eat is to cook it thoroughly. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 \u00b0F as measured with a food thermometer, according to FDA guidelines. Whether it's grilled, baked, fried or slow-cooked, it's the exposure to high heat that kills all the bacteria.\n\nThe \"Don't Wash Your Chicken\" program website says: \"If germs were visible to the naked eye, you would see that washing poultry just splashes bacteria all over you, your kitchen towels, your countertops, and any other food you have nearby, such as raw foods or salads. This can make people sick, especially young children, pregnant women, older adults and the immunocompromised.\"\n\nTo illustrate the risk, a mock infrared animation of \"Germ-vision\" shows how these tiny particles of bacteria can spray far and wide when chicken is washed \u2014 a process called aerosolization.\n\nQuinlan said she discovered how prevalent chicken washing is through the course of her research on the quality and safety of food in minority populations, as part of a USDA-funded program. Through surveys and focus groups in the Philadelphia area, the research team found that washing chicken before cooking was common to several groups. Expanded research showed that the practice is almost universal.\n\nThe goal of the campaign is to educate people about the dangers of spreading bacteria and cross-contaminating other foods by washing chicken.\n\nFor those who want to take an extra cleaning step to remove sliminess before cooking, the FDA recommends wiping chicken with a disposable paper towel. Then be careful to wash any utensils, plates, cutting boards or kitchen counters that came in contact with raw chicken to avoid spreading the bacteria while you finish cooking."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Lesley Stahl", "title": "Evzio: The overdose-reversal drug with a $4000+ price tag", "description": "Naloxone can save the life of someone experiencing an opioid overdose, but is it accessible?

The infamous CEO Martin Shkreli hiked the price of Daraprim, a drug used by AIDS patients to fend off infections, from $13.50 To $750 for one pill. The company Mylan raised the cost of the Epipen that reverses anaphylactic shock caused by allergies 500%, from $100 to $600.\n\nAnd now there's the case of Evzio. It's a talking auto-injector with naloxone, the antidote to reverse opioid overdoses. It's easy to use for people with no medical training. The actual drug naloxone can cost as little as a nickel a dose, according to industry insiders. But Evzio costs a lot more: its price tag is over $4,000.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you think about, in the midst of a crisis, shooting the price up like that?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: If you're out there trying to get as far and wide coverage for people and you watch the price escalate, it feels really predatory. And it feels really uncaring.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb, who runs an organization that hands out naloxone in Utah, distributes syringes that cost the least, around $15 each. She says they're just as easy to use as the newer, pricier devices. We decided to try for ourselves.\n\nLesley Stahl: So hand me the syringe for one sec.\n\nCBS News\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Okay.\n\nLesley Stahl: Here I'm trying to do this thinking that I've got a body in front of me and that I'm a nervous wreck.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Sure.\n\nLesley Stahl: And there's a lot of panic in me. So I've done that. I pull this off-- twist-- oh, okay. Already, I've messed up--\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: No, see.\n\nLesley Stahl: --by having a nervous break--\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: See, that's okay, though. Just pull.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you put this down somewhere. Then tip it up?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Uh-huh.\n\nLesley Stahl: And move the needle below the airline.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Okay, now I'm having trouble. This is not as easy as you-- keep saying.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: You don't think?\n\nLesley Stahl: No.\n\nAt least not for me. Next we tried Narcan, the nasal spray. It costs much more than the syringe: $125 for a pack of two.\n\nLesley Stahl: You peel it. Place it in the nose. And push it.\n\nLesley Stahl: So I pushed it way up the guy's nose?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Uh-huh.\n\nLesley Stahl: Or the woman's nose?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Uh-huh.\n\nLesley Stahl: And I plunge?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yep.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh. There you go!\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: There you go. Now, take into account that you might have to deal with a whole lotta yuck in a nose to be able to make that easy step.\n\nCBS News\n\nThen there's Evzio, by far the most expensive option. It's an auto-injector that talks you through the process:\n\nEVZIO TRAINER: To inject, place black end against outer thigh...\n\nI used a trainer without naloxone in it.\n\nEVZIO TRAINER: Five, four, three, two, one. (BEEPING) Injection complete.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: There you go.\n\nLesley Stahl: Wow.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: So you get it, easy to use?\n\nLesley Stahl: I get it.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: It's there.\n\nLesley Stahl: Really easy. I think because-- something's talking to you, it's calming.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: You feel like you have advice.\n\nLesley Stahl: I can see why it's more expensive, not as more expensive, but--\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: I don't know. I bought a card that talks to me at Walmart for $1.49 yesterday.\n\n\"It's 45 to 54-year-old women. That's who's most likely to die today in Utah.\"\n\nAt $4000-plus for a pack of two, even with discounts and donations, Evzio is completely out of budget for organizations like Dr. Plumb's or for first-responders who deal with drug-addicts on the streets. But Evzio's maker has targeted a different at-risk population. It's the group, Dr. Plumb says, that has the most overdose deaths in Utah.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Picture who you think that person is today that someone's planning a funeral for. I picture a 22-year-old jobless, shiftless, maybe homeless young man. Well, here's the demographics: It's me. It's 45 to 54-year-old women. That's who's most likely to die today in Utah.\n\nIt's a fact that middle age women and men are a large vulnerable population all across the country.\n\nThey often die at home from misusing or abusing high-dose prescription pain pills. Also at risk are other household members with access to the medicine cabinet.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: I can tell you multiple stories of kids, of babies that come in not breathing from--\n\nLesley Stahl: Babies?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: --accidental exposures in their homes. If you hang out with kids, they're oral explorers. I love them dearly. But they're buggers. They get into everything, right?\n\nSo doctors, who prescribe opioids, are now encouraged\n\nTo prescribe naloxone at the same time. It's called co-prescribing, and both the opioid and the antidote are supposed to be covered by insurance. That's the lucrative market Evzio's maker, Kaleo, was going after. It priced the injector high to begin with: $575. And then bumped it up more than 550 percent.\n\nCBS News\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: I began my job search the day after they announced the price hike, because it was greedy and a little unethical, in my opinion.\n\nWe talked to over a dozen former Kaleo employees, including these two sales reps, in shadow for fear of being blackballed in the industry.\n\nLesley Stahl: You'd go into a doctor's office and try to convince him to write a prescription for this medication that has just jumped up to $4000. How did the doctors react?\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: The doctors, most of them were disgusted.\n\nLesley Stahl: And how did you feel?\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: I felt slimy. I no longer felt like I'm helping people. Now I feel like I'm taking advantage of people.\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: Now, remember, we're talking about naloxone. Kaleo didn't invent or didn't discover naloxone.\n\nLesley Stahl: Right.\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: Naloxone's been around for 50 years.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's a generic at this point.\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: It costs pennies. Just imagine if you took aspirin, been around forever, and you packaged it up in a fancy box and put a bow on there.\n\nThe price went up after this man was hired by the company.\n\nLesley Stahl: Todd Smith. Who is he?\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: He was a consultant for Kaleo Pharmaceuticals, and he's been a consultant and had other positions with other pharmaceutical companies. And he's kind of notorious for bringing this pricing strategy to those companies.\n\nLesley Stahl: So he had done this at other companies-\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: Yes--\n\nLesley Stahl: --before he got to Kaleo?\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: Uh-huh.\n\nLesley Stahl: \"This,\" being hiking the price?\n\nBOTH: Correct.\n\nTodd Smith wouldn't talk to us on camera, but here's his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: while he was chief commercial officer at Horizon Pharma, this bottle of arthritis pills shot up from around $100 to over a $1000. At a company called Novum he hiked up the price of this skin gel from around $200 to nearly $8,000.\n\nKaleo was just another drug company he advised. Only it was making a life-saving device in the middle of a worsening health crisis.\n\nLesley Stahl: You were called greedy, you were called uncaring. It was called profiteering, as you well know. This was the reputation you were getting.\n\nSpencer Williamson: Lesley, that could be nothing farther from the truth.\n\nMeet Kaleo's CEO Spencer Williamson.\n\nLesley Stahl: You jack the price from the $575--\n\nSpencer Williamson: Lesley, I--\n\nLesley Stahl: --to $4,000! $4,000!\n\nSpencer Williamson: Lesley?\n\nLesley Stahl: What?\n\nSpencer Williamson: I don't love that word. We raised the price to improve access to this product.\n\nLesley Stahl: Okay, now that-- explain that.\n\nSpencer Williamson: Yeah, that--\n\nLesley Stahl: That's hard to get your head around.\n\nSpencer Williamson: The big misperception is that by raising the price of Evzio we reduce the access to this product. The exact opposite is true.\n\nLesley Stahl: More people are getting it at that price?\n\nSpencer Williamson: Yeah, the numbers don't lie. So less than 5,000 prescriptions were filled in the first 12 months. In the second 12 months, over 65,000 prescriptions were filled.\n\nHow can that be? Well, when Kaleo set the initial price at $575, it was warned that would be too high for middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs that negotiate drug prices for health plans. Kaleo thought that its easy-to-use product would be irresistible in an escalating opioid crisis.\n\nBut when it hit the market, Williamson says, the PBMs did try to discourage doctors from prescribing Evzio\u2026 piling on cumbersome paperwork.\n\nSpencer Williamson: A physician had to show that a patient had failed with another form of naloxone before they could get this product.\n\nLesley Stahl: If they failed they'd be dead.\n\nSpencer Williamson: Exactly.\n\nLesley Stahl: I mean, does that make sense?\n\nSpencer Williamson: No.\n\nLesley Stahl: No. Were there other hindrances?\n\nSpencer Williamson: Yes, the second hindrance, the other-- the second tool they use is high patient copays. So they make the patient pay a big number outta pocket. Here's a scenario that played out many times. A patient goes into a pharmacy with her opioid prescription, and they go into the pharmacy with their life-saving product prescription.\n\nLesley Stahl: Co-prescribed.\n\nSpencer Williamson: Co-prescribed. The opioid is prescribed, no problem, a very low co-pay. This gets blocked. The lifesaving product gets blocked.\n\nThat's because there were less expensive alternatives: the syringe and then the nasal spray. So, why didn't Kaleo just lower the price? Well, remember Todd Smith, the consultant? He advised them not to lower the price,\n\nBut to raise it, a lot. And try to work around the roadblocks put up by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nUnder Smith's scheme, doctors, unhappy with excessive paperwork, are told to send prescriptions to specific pharmacies contracted to handle the forms for them. And these pharmacies mail the devices directly to the patient, making a trip to the drugstore unnecessary.\n\nKaleo, meanwhile, tries to get as much money out of the insurance companies as it can. But the heart of Smith's model is that while insurance companies are charged a lot, patients with commercial insurance are charged nothing. If your plan agrees to cover it, Kaleo pays your co-pay. And if your plan refuses, Kaleo will give you Evzio, 100% free.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you saying that if your insurance company won't pay or they jack up the copay, that you'll pay? So patients don't pay anything?\n\nSpencer Williamson: We will step in and make sure a patient pays nothing out-of-pocket. That's correct.\n\nHow can they afford that? The calculation is that even if only a handful of insurance companies agree to pay the high price, Kaleo would still rake in a lot of money, since it costs only about $80 to manufacture a pack of two.\n\n\n\nLesley Stahl: This whole idea was described to us as, and I'm quoting, \"a legal shell game to bilk insurance companies.\"\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: That's correct. Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: And eventually, then, to bilk the rest of us. Don't we end up--\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: Ultimately--\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 1: It raises--the overall health care cost for everybody. You and I, paying our premiums, are the ones paying for it.\n\nFormer Kaleo Employee 2: If you think the insurance company's going to be (laughs) stuck with this bill in the long run? No!\n\nYou and I are stuck with the bill in another way: as taxpayers. Turns out the bulk of Kaleo's revenue for Evzio comes not from commercial insurance companies, but from Medicare.\n\nThis report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Senators Rob Portman and Tom Carper, details how Kaleo made sure that doctors signed forms for Medicare patients, \"\u2026indicating that Evzio was medically necessary\u2026\" With that language Medicare has essentially no choice but to cover the device at near full price.\n\nThat resulted in, \"more than $142 million in charges to taxpayers in just the last four years.\" The report says Kaleo, \"\u2026not only exploits a country in the middle of an opiod crisis, but also American taxpayers\u2026\" Accusations Kaleo denies.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you make a profit. You make a profit?\n\nSpencer Williamson: So, we've actually lost money in our first four years of bringing this product to the market. The good news is we're saving lives. More people have access to this product.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why are you doing it if you're not making a profit?\n\nSpencer Williamson: We're moving in a direction with a model that continues to evolve.\n\nIt seems to be \"evolving\" in the direction of scrapping the high-price plan altogether. Whether it's because the model failed to produce a profit or because they're under Senate investigation for, as the report lays out: exploiting Medicare. Williamson took the opportunity of our interview to make this offer.\n\nSpencer Williamson: We want to reach out to all middlemen, all insurance companies to say, \"We will lower this price to less than the original $575 if you will make sure that when a physician decides a patient is at risk, they can get it and they can afford it.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: But all the insurance companies have to agree for you to get there.\n\nSpencer Williamson: We will work with one insurance company at a time.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have you done it yet?\n\nSpencer Williamson: We have started those conversations. But I'm announcing it on 60 Minutes that our hands are out to offer this price for less than $575 as long as patients won't be blocked when they need it.\n\nTo see part one of 60 Minutes' report on naloxone, click here.\n\nProduced by Shachar Bar-On."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Lesley Stahl", "title": "Naloxone: The life-saving drug more Americans need", "description": "With over 115 Americans dying a day in the opioid epidemic, naloxone has become a necessity for first responders, doctors and everyday people", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/naloxone-opioid-overdose-antidote-60-minutes/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/18/dba00b24-e39c-4504-a87c-083bfc6a459e/thumbnail/1200x630/484d83bdcd3c0b3e3f4b3ae1268fcb31/naloxonepart1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:50:47Z", "content": "In 1971, almost half a century ago, emergency rooms started reversing opioid overdoses using a medicine called naloxone.

It's generic today, and industry insiders told us it can cost as little as a nickel a dose to produce.\n\nIn April, in response to the national opioid crisis, the U.S. surgeon general came out with an advisory calling on more Americans to carry naloxone: elderly patients on painkillers, bartenders and librarians, mothers with addicted children and children with addicted mothers. But making naloxone accessible - getting it to those who need it - is complicated.\n\n\"Can't get high on it. Can't overdose on it. Can't relieve pain with it. You can just save a life with it.\"\n\nJennifer Plumb, an emergency room pediatrician in Salt Lake City, says naloxone is a miracle drug.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Understand, this stuff is really good at what it does. It has one job. Can't get high on it. Can't overdose on it. Can't relieve pain with it. You can just save a life with it. I mean, how amazing is that?\n\nLesley Stahl: Does it really bring people back from death?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: It really does. And it is black and white. It is someone: \"Hey, hey, hey, hey, talk to me, talk to me,\" no response, to up and alert and talking to you.\n\nLesley Stahl: Come on.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: No, I'm serious. It is legitimately the most almost surreal thing. Because not much in medicine, not much in life does that.\n\nYou can see it through police bodycams. This woman in the back of a Salt Lake City PD squad car isn't breathing. The officer sprays naloxone up her nose with a device called Narcan provided to first responders at nearly half price. Watch it take effect. Another case: a young man found on a sidewalk completely unresponsive. Officers administer naloxone, they only need to wait a few seconds.\n\nOut with firefighters in Salt Lake City one cold night, we learned that most of the department's emergency calls are not fire-related, but medical. Utah \u2013 conservative Utah \u2013 is among the top ten states in the country for opioid overdose deaths averaging a funeral a day.\n\nFirefighter: We're going to give a little naloxone to see if it has any effect.\n\nThey're trying to save a man found lifeless in a park. Cause, unknown.\n\nFirefighter: So it very well could have been an overdose, but nobody saw him do it.\n\nLesley Stahl: So, how much time do you have?\n\nMike Fox: Well, about six minutes.\n\nLesley Stahl: How can you get to someone across town in six minutes?\n\nMike Fox: It's hard.\n\n\"It doesn't fix the opioid epidemic... This is merely giving someone a chance.\"\n\nMike Fox is the fire department's medical chief.\n\nMike Fox: We, on average, give Naloxone about two times a day on calls.\n\nLesley Stahl: A day?\n\nMike Fox: A day, in Salt Lake City proper. It's one of our largest expenditures every year.\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you say it's a strain on your budget?\n\nMike Fox: As we see more and more overdoses, it does affect our budgets.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you have to persuade any of the other firefighters that this wasn't, in a way, encouraging more-- addictions?\n\nMike Fox: Sure.\n\nLesley Stahl: And we also hear that you save someone's life and the next day they're right back at it.\n\nMike Fox: They are. This is a disease, and it's a difficult disease to kick. So, if we have to save someone's life three or four times, five times, it doesn't matter to me.\n\nLesley Stahl: So people are overdosing repeatedly.\n\nMike Fox: Nobody wants to overdose. It's not our job to judge. It's our job to save lives, and the medication will save lives. It's not a fix, right? It doesn't fix the opioid epidemic. It doesn't fix the addiction right? This is merely giving someone a chance.\n\nCBS News\n\nIn this case, they got to the man too late.\n\nFirefighter: OK. Let's terminate our resuscitation efforts at this time.\n\nSince speed is essential, nearly all states have now made it legal for anyone to carry and administer naloxone, like these two good samaritans injecting a stranger. By the time emergency responders show up, the woman has already come to. Dr. Plumb runs a program called Utah Naloxone to hand out these emergency kits to anyone. With two vials of naloxone and two syringes.\n\nLesley Stahl: You go into the worst parts of town?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Sure, sometimes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Into sex houses?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Sure.\n\nLesley Stahl: You go into homeless shelters.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nCBS News\n\nPatrick Rezac: Hey, excuse me, do you want Naloxone?\n\nPatrick Rezac, a former drug addict, is part of a network that has helped Dr. Plumb hand out more than 36,000 kits for free, some on the roughest streets of Salt Lake City, in an area called \"Rio Grande.\"\n\nPatrick Rezac: Our goal would be to have everybody have one of these. And so we just ask people if they have heard of Naloxone, if they need Naloxone.\n\nPatrick Rezac: You take the top off, okay and then you put the needle in the liquid and you pull it back, alright? And put it straight in the thigh. Boom!\n\nMAN: Right there.\n\nPatrick Rezac: Yup. Right there, right in the shoulder. Right through the clothes. Doesn't matter.\n\nDr. Plumb's brother, Sam, co-founded Utah Naloxone.\n\nSam on the street: You've got two doses. And you got two syringes. Just put 'em right in a big muscle. No \"Pulp Fiction,\" not in the heart.\n\nLesley Stahl: What if you come upon someone and they're on the ground\u2026\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you think it's an overdose, but it's really a heart attack? And you give them this?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: You won't help them, but you won't hurt them.\n\nSame thing for diabetes, same thing for head injuries.\n\nSame thing for strokes.\n\nCBS News\n\nLesley Stahl: How did you get interested in this? You're a pediatric doctor. You work in the ER.\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yeah. You know, unfortunately, my family went through dealing with addiction in our family. 1996, we lost my brother Andy to a heroin overdose.\n\nLesley Stahl: In his situation, if naloxone had been there, would he have been saved?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: I do think at least in that one night when we lost him, if Naloxone would have been there, I do think he would have had another chance that night. And that was a big motivator.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you give it out free?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Absolutely free, absolutely free, always will be.\n\nLesley Stahl: So how do you get it?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: We purchase it. We-- we get grant money and we have--\n\nLesley Stahl: Grant money?\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Yeah, we get grant funds.\n\nLesley Stahl: People on the street, and I'm including law enforcement, think, \"Why do we have to expend money and extra energy when you're just doing it to yourself?\"\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: Right. You know, I have had the unfortunate experience of losing my dad to cancer and my brother to addiction. And I will tell you, these are both chronic and relapsing conditions, right? If your cancer relapses, you get everything. You get support from your community. You have teams of physicians that sit down and say, \"Alright, we're going to find the next step for you.\" But you look at my brother's addiction, a chronic relapsing condition. And when he would relapse, and I will own that I did it too. That there was this-- very much this, \"Hmmm\u2026 All those tools. All that time. All that money--\"\n\nLesley Stahl: \"And you went right back to it?\"\n\nDr. Jennifer Plumb: \"And you went right back. And you relapsed.\"\n\nDr. Plumb's team also goes into private homes in the suburbs to train people, like the Keetch family: dad, mom, grandma and Ashlee: an addict five weeks clean.\n\nIf she relapses now Ashlee is likelier to O.D. due to lower tolerance. So they want to learn how to use naloxone at home, all except Ashlee: she already knows how to use it.\n\nAshlee: I've used it twice on people and brought them back.\n\nLesley Stahl: Now were you-- were you high?\n\nAshlee: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I was--\n\nLesley Stahl: And you still could do it.\n\nAshlee: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Ashlee, when did you start and how did you start?\n\nAshlee: When I was 19 I started on OxyContin. Switched over to heroin because you couldn't get the other anymore.\n\nCBS News\n\nAshlee was a hardcore drug addict for ten years. After many failed attempts to get clean, her parents told her they couldn't take it anymore and she ended up homeless, in the slums of Rio Grande.\n\nLesley Stahl: This is where Ashlee was.\n\nPatrick Rezac: Yeah. Ashlee's down here. For a year.\n\nLesley Stahl: You used-- you used to see her here.\n\nPatrick Rezac: Yeah, we used to try to put her in motel rooms for the night when I could.\n\nLesley Stahl: What shape was she in when you saw her?\n\nPatrick Rezac: Well, you saw her today. Imagine her 50 pounds lighter.\n\nLesley Stahl: 50 pounds lighter?\n\nPatrick Rezac: Yeah. With sores and-- she was not in good shape.\n\nShe was barely recognizable. Her grandmother often went looking for her with food and offers of a comfortable place to sleep.\n\nKitsy: She was skin and bones and she told me that-- how hard it was to be on heroin and how awful it was and to be addicted to it. For the last ten years, especially through her rough times, we knew it was either going to be mortuary or jail.\n\nAnita: We're always waiting for that call. It's gonna be the jail, or the morgue, or the police.\n\nLesley Stahl: I had a mother tell me that when it's the jail she's relieved.\n\nAnita: I am.\n\nKitsy: We were so happy.\n\nAnita: I was thrilled she went to jail. At least she's off the street and she's safe.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you went down into the homeless areas and--\n\nKitsy: I would take her food. She went and stayed. I mean, she went and stayed with her.\n\nLesley Stahl: You stayed? Where? On the street?\n\nAnita: Yeah. Last summer.\n\nLesley Stahl: Your mother went and s--\n\nAshlee: I know. (LAUGH)\n\n\"We're always waiting for that call. It's gonna be the jail, or the morgue, or the police.\"\n\nAnita: I asked her, \"Hey I want to come understand,\" and I hadn't seen her that much. I just wanted to be with her and I just wanted to try and understand the disease more. And so I said,\"Can I come hang out with you.\" Basically and gave her the choice, to, you know, does she want me to see her at her worst. So she said, \"Yeah, you can come hang out.\" So I went, met her and her boyfriend. And within 30 seconds they were injecting right in front of me.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh, come on.\n\nAnita: And I watched her shoot up, I don't know, countless times - at least 20, and smoke crack.\n\nShe learned how much of a grip the drugs had on her child; she saw how panicked Ashlee would get without them.\n\nAshlee: It's a man drowning trying to get to a lifeboat. Like that's the desperation that you have for thinking that I need this. I need to get this, you know, and I'll go to any cost\n\nLesley Stahl: And your brain is saying, \"Get it for me. Get it for me. Get it for me.\"\n\nAshlee: Yeah. I'll go to any \u2013 this is what you need to live. This is air, you know.\n\nNow the whole family is working together to help Ashlee stay clean and to learn how to save her with a syringe of naloxone if she should relapse.\n\nIn most states now, you can pick up naloxone at your pharmacy, often without a personal prescription. A syringe and vial can cost around $15. But the FDA has approved two new easier-to-use naloxone devices specifically for people with no medical training: a nasal spray, and an auto-injector, like an Epipen, that talks. Problem is they're way more expensive. The spray is $125. The injector? Over $4,000.\n\nMore about that, in part two of our report.\n\nLearn more about Patrick Rezac's Salt Lake City-based nonprofit One Voice Recovery\n\nProduced by Shachar Bar-On and Natalie Jimenez Peel."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "One of the first Native American women elected to Congress heads to Washington", "description": "Democrat Deb Haaland of New Mexico is one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.

I am Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nPresident Trump pays a visit to the sights of California's deadliest and most destructive fires in history.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To see what's happened here, nobody would have ever thought this could have happened.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll get an update from California Governor Jerry Brown, who was at the President's side during Saturday's visit.\n\nMAN: Does seeing this devastation, though, change your opinion at all on climate change, Mister President?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. We're going to have that, and we're going to have forests that are very safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Then the President disputes reports that the CIA concluded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't assessed anything yet. It's too early. That was a very premature report. But that's possible. We're going to see. But we're going to have a report on Tuesday and it will be very complete. In the meantime, we're doing things to some people that we know for a fact were involved and we're being very tough on a lot of people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, who says the administration is not being tough enough. He's urging more action against the country the President calls a truly spectacular ally when it comes to jobs. Plus, the one hundred and sixteenth Congress, what's ahead for the administration with Democrats controlling investigations in the House. The likely chairman of a key committee, Maryland's Elijah Cummings, will tell us. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst will also be here. She's now part of the Republican leadership team. And as incoming freshman visit Washington in advance of the new Congress we'll hear what unites them and how their diversity could impact future legislation.\n\nIt's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION.\n\nThere's a lot of news in Washington, but we begin with an update on the California fires, where there's been some containment, but the number of dead and missing continues to rise. Officials placed the death toll in the Camp Fire in Northern California at seventy-six and say that at this point there are over twelve hundred missing. President Trump toured both regions hit by devastating fires with California Governor Jerry Brown and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom just yesterday. We spoke with Governor Brown after that visit, where for the most part politics was put aside. We asked why the fires had gotten so out of control.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN (D-California/@JerryBrownGov): Well, how they started is now a subject of investigation. The conflagration occurs because the brush, the vegetation is so dry and the humidity is so low. And when you have that-- that-- and then the heat and the years of drought that gets it going. And in Paradise, there were a lot of buildings that also caught fire and then it just went from one to the other. So it's a mixture of many things. And the President's talked about how our forests are managed, that's an element but there's also the way the houses are built, the materials, what kind of vegetation is around. And then there's also the changing climate and the increasing drought and the lowered humidity and water vapor. All of that is combining to create the tragic situation that we saw today in both Northern California and here in Southern California.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As you say the President did acknowledge that he said climate change might be a factor, \"a little bit\" but he primarily blamed forest management as the cause here. Is California to blame here for its own problems?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Well, where Paradise is, of course, is surrounded by federally managed land. These are national forests. They're not state parks and they're not private property by Californians so it is the federal government. And the fact is that managing the forest is part of it. They are a lot denser than they were two hundred years ago. But on top of that, we have this five-year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the dryness that turns vegetation and bushes and houses and trees into-- literally, into timber. So it was ready to explode. So there-- there's an atmospheric element which is part of the natural cycle and then there is an increasing effect of climate change. In fact, I have read, specifically, peer-reviewed scientific articles that say that the amount of-- of land burnt in California over the last fifteen years has doubled because of climate change, so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Did you make that case to President Trump?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: I certainly raised it but I didn't feel that that that was where we needed to go. We need the money. We need federal help and we need a collaborative and cooperative spirit and we're getting that. But I did say that we are going to look at all the elements that are causing these fires over time and we're going to work in a way to let science be our guide and the President in no way negated that. So I decided to go for an opening and I think over the next months and years you'll see the science becoming crystal clear and even the folks in Washington that are now more in the denialist camp are going to come around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You did say there the federal funds were coming. Did President Trump assure you that he is not going to cut funding as he had threatened to do?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Yes. So that's a big, big win. The President not only has signed a presidential declaration giving California substantial funding, but he said and pledged very specifically to-- to continue to help us. That he's got our back. And I thought that was a very positive thing. There have been some back and forth between California leaders and the President. But in this-- in the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their-- their lesser propensities. So I think we're on a good path, but it's still going to be difficult because the only way to ensure the long-term forest health is not just, you know, cutting trees it's going to require--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: --reducing carbon emissions and, eventually, sooner rather than later to zero. And if we don't do that, you're going to see these fires not only continuing but getting worse by the year as they are. The last five years--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: --the fires have never been this bad. This fire in Malibu is the worst they have ever seen. This fire in-- in Paradise and Northern California was the worst in the history of California. So, yeah, you can mull the science. But I'll tell you every year it's going to get clearer and clearer so that I think in less than five years even the worst skeptics are going to be believers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the human toll? As we said a thousand unaccounted for. Do you believe that number is going to continue to rise?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: I don't think it's going to be a thousand, I don't know that for sure. But we think, by the way, the numbers are gathered that-- that that's high. But, look, the-- they're narrow streets these fires we're going, and I-- I can't even believe it but I'll repeat what the fire people told me. Fires are moving a football length--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: --a hundred yards a second. And-- and the roads were very narrow. So there is no way for a lot of these people to get out, and some of them were backed up. Cars blocking the road. Three hours to move a few miles. So that's another thing. If you're going to live this close to the forest, if the climate is going to keep changing--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: --you're going to have to build some kind of underground shelters, so that you can go in and protect yourself not by going three or four miles but by going, you know, thirty or forty feet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty stark image. Governor, tell me about what's happening now with the air quality, which we understand is very toxic in some cities like San Francisco. And do you have a sense of the damage being caused by that and the economic hit to your state?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Well, first of all, I like to look at my weather app. I look at it a couple of times a day. I never saw on the weather app until yesterday, \"air hazardous to health.\" And then in another cities I saw \"very unhealthful air\" and then \"unhealthful air\" and then \"air-- air unhealthful to sensitive people.\" Those categories I never saw before. So, yeah, this is bad stuff. It's temporary. So in-- in some ways it's far less than Beijing or Shanghai, and far less than Los Angeles was in the fifties. So it's not good but for a few days we'll get through it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the economic hit?\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Oh, the economic impact is devastating. So, yeah, the-- the-- the devastation is-- is at the human level is horrific and-- and hard to find words to describe. And economically, yes, this is going to cost tens of billions. That's what it's going to cost--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: --before we get finished.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you very much. I know you got a lot of work ahead of you. Appreciate you making time.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Well, thank you. Thank you.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the news that the CIA has determined that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul joins us now from Bowling Green. Senator, the President says a final conclusion will be made this week by the U.S. government, but in a Fox interview he indicated that, essentially, murder can be forgiven if the kingdom provides economic benefit. Listen to this exchange.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE (Fox News): What if the Crown Prince, speaking to you the President of the United States, directly lied to you about--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News): Yeah. Well, that he told me that he had nothing to do with it. He told me that, I would say maybe five times at different points.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: But what if he's lying?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: As recently as a few days ago.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Do you just live with it because you need him?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, will anybody really know, all right? Will anybody really know, but he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved. You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions, on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of the President's remarks?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky/@RandPaul): Well, you know the crown prince, his brother, made a phone call to Khashoggi, the dissident that was killed and dismembered, and that phone call was to tell Khashoggi, hey, it's fine. You can go to the consulate no one will harm you. Well, you know, we have the crown prince's brother making that phone call. I think we have other intelligence that may link brother's phone calls back to the crown prince. I think the evidence is overwhelming that the crown prince was involved and so no I don't think we can sweep this under the rug. The thing about sanctions is that I think sanctions are pretending to do something without really doing anything. Most of these people are in prison other than the crown prince. But the crown prince runs the country and we deal with him. If we put sanctions on people who are in prison, are we really doing anything to punish them they're already in prison. We need to punish who ordered this, who's in charge, and really the only thing they understand over there is strength. I think they will see sanctions as weakness on the part of the President and if the President wants to act strongly he should cut off the arms sale not only because of the killing but until they stop bombing civilian populations.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Secretary Pompeo told Saudi Arabia three weeks ago stop bombing civilian populations. Since then Saudi Arabia has bombed cities two hundred times, they're not listening--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about in Yemen.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --they're indiscriminately bombing civilians. Yes in Yemen.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about in Yemen. I should point out Saudi Arabia disputes the reporting that there is a-- there was a phone call between Prince Khaled and Jamal Khashoggi. They say that's just not true. But given the CIA assessment overall that says there was a role, do you think this needs to trigger some other kind of change in policy? You're on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are you going to try to block--\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --the appointment of the appointed ambassador?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Realize the Saudis have told us a lot of things that were untrue. They told us it was a fistfight that went bad--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --they have told us he was alive, they had a body double there to try to trick people into believing he was still alive. So the Saudis have been duplicitous since the very beginning. Do we need to do more? Yes, but at the very least we need to quit selling arms to people who are lying to us--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President says that that's exactly why though, those arms sales are exactly why the relationship is important and he's not going to hurt the economic benefits.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Here's my point. The arms sales don't make us safer. They make us less safe. When we sell arms to a foreign country, it should not ever be for jobs, it should be for our national security. The Saudis' involving us in their war in Yemen is a disaster. Seventeen million people live on the edge of starvation. If we get involved in another civil war in the Middle East that's not good for our national security. That just drains our natural resources--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do anything to stop it though?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Yeah. Quit arming the Saudis. The Saudis are bombing--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But in Congress--\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --to the tune of tens of thousands of bombs in Yemen.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --is there anything you can do? Because the President says he's going to continue selling.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Right. Yeah, I've introduced resolution after resolution to stop selling arms. We've done it twice and it's a privilege resolution meaning they can't prevent me from getting a vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: First time I got twenty-something votes. The second time with the help of a Democrat Senator Chris Murphy we got forty-seven votes. If we have another vote I think we could almost get to a veto proof majority, but guess what? They are not bringing any arms sales up right now--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --because they know we might beat them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the ambassador who's been nominated here, General John Abizaid? You're going vote to confirm him?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: I-- I want to meet with him and I don't think that that really-- my first impulse is not-- that's not the way to sort of punish Saudi Arabia, by blocking an ambassador. I'm a big believer in dialogue and even with this I wouldn't stop trading oil with Saudi Arabia--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --but I would stop selling them arms. That's the first thing I would do. That doesn't disrupt trade, doesn't disrupt diplomacy. It just sends them a very strong message, we're not going to keep fueling your-- your war in Yemen, which is a total disaster.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: And everybody saying there's no military solution and, yet, nobody's willing to do anything that would actually force Saudi Arabia to stop the war. If we were not refuel-- not refueling, if we were not providing spare parts for their American-made planes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --the war would be over in a matter of months because you have to have a continuous supply of spare parts and people repair your planes and train your pilots. If we quit doing that, Saudi Arabia would quit bombing them within three or four months.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get you on domestic policy. The President has put forward a-- a-- a proposal that has some bipartisan support on criminal justice reform. There's no guarantee it's going to be put to vote in the lame duck session and some of your fellow Republicans like Tom Cotton say this is just about letting felons out of jail. How do you respond?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: You know I've been-- I've been working on criminal justice reform with Republicans and Democrats for six or seven years. I met with President Obama several times on this, bipartisan groups. We have a real chance to pass this now. With President Trump being in favor of-- of this criminal justice reform, he came out publicly for it really it only depends on one Senator now. If Senator Mitch McConnell, from my home state, will allow a vote it gets sixty-five to seventy votes in the Senate. It will be one of the most popular things to ever pass. Is it a jailbreak? No. It's saying people that have you know a nonviolent drug offense that we don't keep them in jail for life. It's saying that ninety-five percent of people that get out of prison--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --when they get out of prison, do we want them to keep committing crimes or we should train them for jobs? Should we use programs to try to test whether or not we can teach people not to recommit crimes? And really do nonviolent people need to be in jail sometimes for life? We should--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So how--\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --reevaluate this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you force a vote? You're running out of time here.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, it-- it's all up to one person. Senator McConnell has the ability to call any vote he wants to anytime. He has promised in the past that he would allow this vote if there was popularity for it. President Trump is behind it. In my state eighty-six percent of the people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're suggesting he's choosing not to?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --are behind this. The Fraternal Order of Police-- Fraternal Order of Police are behind it. Two thousand pastors, and I-- I didn't get your follow up.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I said it-- it-- it seems you're suggesting that he does not want to.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: There have been some articles. I haven't talked to him--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: --directly about it. The last time I talked to him about it he said he was open to allowing a vote after the election.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Now with the President Trump's all-- all in on this I really hope we can get a vote but it's really up to Senator McConnell. But it's very, very popular in Kentucky and very, very popular with people who support President Trump so I hope he allows a vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for that. Thank you very much, Senator Paul.\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We are back with Maryland's Elijah Cummings. He is the top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the chief investigative committee in the House and he is joining us from Baltimore this morning. Congressman, welcome to FACE THE NATION. I want to ask you what the President said this morning on Fox News in an interview with Chris Wallace. He said that the acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has the power to block any subpoena requests from the special counsel to the President. The President suggested that he's done answering questions. And now that the investigation he seems to be suggesting is coming to an end. Does Congress have anything to do to protect the integrity of the-- of the probe itself given some of these past public statements by the acting attorney general that have drawn that into question?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-Maryland 7th/@RepCummings): Well, I am extremely concerned about the acting attorney general. I question whether or not it was actually a legitimate appointment since he's not been confirmed by the Senate. But we-- we're going to look into-- to all of this. I-- again--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you force--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: --with him being in there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --his recusal?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: I don't think so. I don't think-- I don't think that we-- I don't know that we have that power. But we're going to certainly look at every angle. But I'm hoping that-- that-- that-- I would love to see him recuse himself because I think the things that he has said about defunding the special probe and the many things that he has talked about, with regard to his opinion, a negative opinion with regard to special counsel in the process. I don't think that he's the proper person to be in that position and I-- in any-- and-- but, again, I think almost anything he does in that-- in the position of the interim may very well be tainted because we're not clear-- it's not clear that he is a legitimate appointment to that position.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If the Mueller probe continues to its conclusion, which the President has said he-- he at this point won't interfere. Will you-- if you do take the chairmanship of House Oversight and have the subpoena power that goes with it, will you force Mueller's findings to be made public if the Department of Justice decides not to release them?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: I would love to see it be-- become public because, basically, in this last election what the public has said is that they want accountability and they want transparency and they have paid for a-- an investigation by one of our greatest public servants, Mister Mueller, Special Counsel Mueller. And so I would do anything and everything in my power to have that-- the findings presented to not only to the Congress, but to the people of the United States. I think it's very important.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If you take this chairmanship, what's your top priority? Where do you begin?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Well, first of all, we've got to make sure that we do-- do those things that are important to the American people. Things such as voting rights, we just saw what happened down there in Georgia and in Florida. We-- we-- we cannot have a country where people are being blocked from voting. We also want to look at preexisting conditions, things of that nature, to make sure that people are protected in-- in regard to that. We also want to look at the census. Lot of people are surprised about that. But the census is right around the corner.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: And what we do with regard to the census will affect us for the next ten to twelve years and-- and it will affect every single person in this country. Another area is postal. Our postal system has had some economic problems. We have legislation that could actually cure those problems. We want to move that forward. So we're going to be doing that. But at the same time we are going to address the issue that-- that-- that a lot of people are concerned about and making sure that government is doing what government is supposed to do for all of the American people. We may not have been elected by all the people as Democrats but we must govern all the people in a fair way.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As I mentioned you are expected to have that powerful position on House oversight. But overall when it comes to leadership right now, there are some questions about whether there is enough black leadership at the top of the Democratic Party. I mean if Pelo-- Pelosi and Hoyer are-- are successful at remaining speaker and leader, is Jim Clyburn enough? Do you need to see more?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: I think-- first of all, you got to understand we have-- all of us our leaders.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: And so-- but we could only have one speaker at a time. Nancy Pelosi has simply been a phenomenal and she has been one who has been-- she believes in inclusion revolution. She has probably the most diverse leadership team that in his-- in the history of any legislative body as far as the Congress is concerned. And she has-- she has fought hard to make sure that people like Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: --and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus are supported. So-- and as far as Jim Clyburn is concerned, he's a phenomenal leader. And so we-- you know we're going to be fine. I know that there are people who are talking a lot of talk.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: But the fact is is that Nancy Pelosi is a phenomenal woman, a phenomenal speaker and a phenomenal leader. She'll be fine.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Congressman, thank you very much.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment with a lot more--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --FACE THE NATION.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Twelve days after the midterm elections we still don't know the exact makeup of the House and Senate. Votes are still being counted. What we do know is there are a record number of women and veterans. Coming up, we'll talk with four new representatives, plus, a new member of the Senate Republican leadership, Iowa's Senator Joni Ernst.\n\nGood to have you here.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to Iowa Senator Joni Ernst who has joined the Republican leadership team as the Conference Vice Chairwoman in the new Congress. Good to see you in person and for the appreciation.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST (R-Iowa/@SenJoniErnst): Thank you, Margaret. Thank you. It's great to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: President gave an interview this morning to Fox's Chris Wallace and he said that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen needs to be much tougher on the border. What is she doing wrong?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Well, I think that she has done a good job. I think the President is just very frustrated, of course, with what we see at the border. We do have a large number of-- of immigrants that are trying to get over the border illegally and we do need to make sure that we have got plenty of surveillance; that we have plenty of officers ready to respond. I think her response has been well so far. We as Congress need to step forward and do the next steps.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: She should continue in the role?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: I think that she's done a good job, but, of course, any of our secretaries or cabinet members serve at the pleasure of the President. It's entirely up to him who serves in those positions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're a vet. Is deploying six thousand troops to the border a good use of resources?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Well, I-- again, up to the President and, of course, those governors that are involved at their National Guard soldiers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are on Armed Services, you have a voice.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: If-- if they are active duty soldiers it does actually provide them an opportunity for real-life training in their roles. Many of them, if they serve in logistics-type positions they will actually be doing those missions on the border. So it is a very good skill. As someone who has commanded troops both in peacetime and in wartime to make sure that they keep their skills sharp. And so when they do deploy, they are in harm's way overseas. They know exactly how to support the-- the men and women on the frontlines.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's how you see--I know General Mattis said-- Secretary Mattis has said they won't even have any contact with people coming across.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Exactly, but they will be utilized in the roles. Like I said many of them may be logistics professionals serving--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: --in our armed services. And then it gives them greater opportunity to respond quickly in those types of situations, whether they are supporting with food or body armor, whatever it might be for Border Patrol agents.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: It allows those border patrol agents to actually focus on the law enforcement duties.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As we introduce you, you are the first female senator to be in a leadership position of the GOP in a decade.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Decade. Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the number of women-- Republican women in the House is at a twenty-four-year low. We have never seen a Republican woman in the House or Senate in the whip leader or speaker positions. Now from these midterm results we're seeing female voters breaking from the party. Does the Republican Party have a problem with women?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Well, I think we need to encourage more women to run for office. I think we really can do much better in that area and then encourage them to seek responsibilities as leaders. So, I was really, really honored to be elected into our Republican leadership in the Senate. We have to have quality candidate-- candidates out there and again encourage them to run, we need to be--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the problem in the primaries that you saw where some women were running but not winning?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Well, part of that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it the-- is the issue with Republican men not voting for Republican female candidates?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: I would say that part of that really is that we need to connect with our constituencies. We need to make sure that our voices are being heard. So whether it is focusing on health care priorities, whether it is focusing on a national paid family leave opportunity for men and for women. Whatever those messages are, we need to communicate those and make sure that we are being heard when our constituents go to the polls.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will you be doing anything to recruit more women?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Certainly I-- I do visit with a number of women and I talk to Republican women. I see Democratic women when I'm in Iowa, as well. And if they have a passion, if they believe in public service, I always encourage them to run, if that's their desire to serve the people of their-- their potential district. We want them to step up and make their voices heard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think the President's rhetoric or what happened during the 2016 election is turning away women from the party overall--\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: I--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --voters or candidates?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: I think that we could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women and that's something that I try and do. I try and set a very strong example for women that want to run for office, women that wish to serve in the military. Whatever it might be, we need to set a good example. Women primarily, men secondarily, we need to step up and make sure that we are supporting the needs of our constituents.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that really impacts your home state. The vice president said today--and he's in Asia--that the U.S. is not in a rush to end this trade dispute with China, suggesting that things might not get resolved when President Xi and Trump sit down in just a few weeks. There was a twelve-billion-dollar bailout for farmers, to help alleviate some of this pain. Will you need another one?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Mm-Hm. I am hopeful that we will not need another subsidy program for our farmers. Our farmers would much rather grow their goods and make sure that they are getting out to the rest of the world. Absolutely. But I've done a number of farmer roundtables all across the state of Iowa. And at the last one I held, the very last speaker, a-- a middle-aged farmer, he-- he stood up and said, \"I understand why President Trump is doing this. However, what I don't understand is why someone didn't do it sooner.\" So they understand--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The pain is tolerable for now?\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: The pain is tolerable for now. I want to see these trade deals done. I'd rather see them done sooner, rather than later, but we have to get a good deal with China or it's all for naught.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Senator, thank you for joining us.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Thank you. Pleasure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with a panel of some of the new House members.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There will be dozens of new faces on Capitol Hill next year when Congress convenes, including our next four guests--all incoming members of the House of Representatives, who each bring a unique perspective here to Washington. Democrat Joe Neguse is Colorado's first black congressman. His parents came to this country from Eritrea as refugees more than thirty-five years ago. He's also a new father of a baby girl. Congrats on that. Democrat Deb Haaland of New Mexico is one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. She's also a single mother. Republican Dan Crenshaw of Texas is a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan. He may also be the first representative elect to appear on Saturday Night Live--at least that I remember. And Democrat Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania is a former captain in the Air Force, a former chemistry teacher and she is also a mother of two. So you, ladies, know something about multitasking here. A lot of Americans, when you talk to them, seem to have lost faith in Congress. In fact, the approval rating CBS News just took was at nineteen percent. What made you run?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE (D-Colorado 2nd/@JoeNeguse): You know, look, I was very concerned about the direction that our country was taking. As you mentioned, my parents were Eritrean immigrants to this country and we've been able to live the American dream and the freedoms and the opportunities that have enabled us to live the American dream in every sense of that phrase, I felt like we're slipping away for a lot of Americans in our country. And so decided that I would try to do something about it and threw my hat in the ring.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND (D-New Mexico 1st/@Deb4CongresNM): Yes, well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman-elect.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Thank you, thank you. Well, of course, this is an important job. It's an important job for my district in New Mexico. I wanted to feel like I could help more people. The constituent services program that we're all responsible for, I think, is extremely important for our districts. And that's absolutely one of the reasons that I decided to run.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman-elect?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW (R-Texas 2nd/@DanCrenshawTX): Well, you know, I was in the military for ten years. I took an oath to the Constitution twelve years ago.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: And, you know, that oath has not ended. So it's really about service. It's about service and it's about impact. You know, how can I impact the-- the issues that matter to my constituents? You know, we're still reeling from Hurricane Harvey. We want more individual freedom. We want less government in our lives. We want to live that American dream. And those are things we can actually agree on. And that's what I'll be fighting for.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So when you hear that there's an approval rating of just nineteen percent, you think you can do better than that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well, I hope so. Is that an improvement or-- or, it might be an improvement. I thought it was lower at one point.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: I understand that's the case. And-- and, you know, the-- the military has-- has long brought a lot of credibility to American institutions. I hope to bring some of that credibility to Congress. You know the way we do that is we talk to each other like we're actually people. Let's not attack each other's intent, let's not attack-- attack each other as a person, let's attack ideas. All right. We can debate ideas, we can disagree on ideas all day long. Let's find the things that we actually agree upon and work on those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you equally as optimistic, Congresswoman-elect?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D-Pennsylvania 6th/@HoulahanForPa): Well, so I-- I share a lot of commonalities with my fellow colleagues in terms of why I'm running. I am third-generation military. My dad and grandfather served careers and I did as well, served as a captain in the Air Force. And as a third-generation military member, I am deeply concerned about the democracy right now. I am worried about the direction that we're heading as a people. I am similarly interested in making sure that we maintain civility and decency with one another in the way that we treat each other and the way that our government works. And, personally, my motivation for running is-- is one of service. I want to continue the service that I've done, both in the military and also growing good and strong businesses and most recently in education as a-- as a teacher and also as a nonprofit leader in early childhood literacy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The district that you were elected in, you flipped it.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Red to blue.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you've described it as more purple.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It-- it's a mix--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --of people of different convictions here. How do you balance those forces? And does that mean that, as a Democrat, you're willing to work with President Trump?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Absolutely. We are a district that's forty percent Democrat, forty percent Republican, and twenty percent Independent. And I-- I call us-- us purple people because I believe that we are, I believe largely that we sit in the middle and what we're looking for is head and heart issues.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the more divisive issues is immigration. It's also what President Trump says he wants to tackle. Obviously, there are different views on how to do that. But Congresswoman-elect, you're in a very unique position, as one of only two--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Sure. Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Native American women elected to Congress. How do you think that affects your approach on things like immigration?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Sure. Sure. Well, New Mexico is a border state. So we-- we actually feel confident about the security of our borders and New Mexico. We-- New Mexico as a whole was appalled when the policy to separate children from their parents happened on the border. It made me immediately think about governmental policies back when my grandmother was a child and she was separated from her family and taken to Indian boarding school. So it seems like at some point, we need to look at our history and stop doing the things that are harmful to our children and work toward finding solutions that are absolutely humane. Well, I--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You would work with President Trump?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Well, I-- I think we all have to do it together. We are-- the Democrats won back the House. We didn't win back the Senate or the presidency yet. So we do have to work across the aisle to make sure that we can get things passed. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect, you-- you are a vet. You mentioned your service. How do you feel about the deployment of U.S. troops, U.S. personnel to the border? Is that the right way to be using the U.S. military?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well, what they're using them for is-- is logistical support. You know they're not there-- they're not down there as-- as combat troops stopping people from crossing the border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They're not actually at the border, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: That-- that-- that's not-- that's not what's actually happening--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: What's actually happening is they're-- they're-- they're reinforcing the law enforcement that is there to do their job. You know, the reality is-- is I-- what I want to-- well, the-- the question I always have the Democrats is, do we agree that our borders should be secure, yes or no? I understand you don't like the wall. I understand that. But can we agree that the border should be secured? And if you have other ideas to-- to-- to secure that border, and especially in Texas we are willing to listen because, you know, we have a river along the border. We can't always put a wall there. We get that. You know we've got other options, as well. So will you work with us on--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of using the U.S. military--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in that role. Essentially, you know, we have--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Right, well-- well-- well, when you have-- when you have-- sure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --a border patrol that has the job that you just laid out that the military is now there to back them up on.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well, right, but there was also thousands of thousands of people coming up to the border in a caravan. And so you have to take different measures to do that. So--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You do see that as a threat even though they're on foot and not at the border yet?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well-- well, what's the other option? To just let them cross? Because we don't have enough law enforcement officials to deal with that possibly. So, you know, again, we're not putting combat troops on the border. That's not what's happening. We are dealing with this in a very humane way and as I think we should and we can all agree on that for sure. None of us really like seeing families separated. I've said that all along. That's-- it's the last thing we want to see. Republicans tried to put legislation forward that would stop that. Okay. And we would continue to do that. But-- but, yes, if-- if-- if it's between letting people across and not letting people cross, we have to secure our border. And I-- and I hear that we agree on that a lot. I do. And I-- and I understand that Democrats don't like the rhetoric and don't like the wall. I-- I absolutely get that. But I want to see other options on the table then on what we can do to actually secure it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He's comfortable using U.S. troops in that way. Are you?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: No, no. I think it's the wrong approach. I think it's imprudent. I disagree with it and I think the other option is to follow existing law and-- and let folks go through the asylum process and to the extent that they are able to successfully claim asylum. I-- I say this as the son of refugees. I mean I-- I think immigrants to this country have so much to give and it's important we get this right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will the Democrats at the table vote for any kind of immigration reform that includes funding for a border wall?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: I wouldn't.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: No, I don't support a wall.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: I wouldn't as well. And I am also the daughter of a refugee. My dad was a survivor of the Holocaust and came here with his mom as a very small child, as a five-year-old and this is a very personal issue to me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me take a break here and come back. We talked about finding agreement. We've already found a disagreement. Let's see what-- what else we can--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: That was easy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --we can get to. Got there pretty quick. After this short break we will be back in a moment with more from our panel.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our new member panel. And let's pick up the conversation. I know the two of you, both vets, have made a vow to try to find at least one point of agreement that you can legislate around. Do you know what that's going to be?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: There's multiple points--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yep.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: So, I mean, opioids--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yep.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: --infrastructure issues. You know different infrastructure issues around the country. But for us it's flood mitigation, opioid epidemic is-- is terrible. You know, more-- more people died of opioids last year than the entire Vietnam War. That's-- that's just the reality. And--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is there anything that you particularly want to shepherd here?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Well I-- I agree, infrastructure and-- and a big infrastructure bill--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that number one for you?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Absolutely. Opioids is an enormous problem in our community as well. Pharmaceutical prescription prices I think is something that we need to look at, we have to look at.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: And another thing I would bring up is workforce training issues. You know there are seven million job openings, which is a great problem to have. We've got a great economy.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yep.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: But we need middle skill labor to fill those jobs.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask the Democrats at the table about your own leadership, your own party identity. I know you, Congresswoman-elect, have said you will support Nancy Pelosi to be speaker.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you. Did you learn anything this week? Did she earn your votes and your support?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Well, so I'd say, I just want to-- one quick tangent, criminal justice reform is also another--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, you're deflecting. You are a politician.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I know. No, I will answer it. I will answer the question but--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Absolutely.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's a-- it's a yes--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: It's a really important issue where there's some emerging bipartisan consensus for Republicans and Democrats--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: I think that's great.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I'm passionate about that. No. Look, I- it's fascinating to me that it's the question that we got most often, at least the Democrats did--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: --here during orientation, which is particularly interesting since there's no other candidate that I am aware of--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: --that's running against Leader Pelosi. I intend to support her. You know I think that it's important that we have steady leadership right now. And I found it pretty heartening over the course of the last week some of the developments around it becoming clear that this leadership team is going to work to try to make sure that everyone has a seat at the table. You saw a message from Leader Pelosi's office by way of example around making sure that there is progressive representation on key committees in the Congress--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: --and the Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders endorsing her shortly thereafter. So-- so yeah, that's where I am.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what changed your mind? The pledge to diversity council?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: That among many other things. I wanted to have conversations with existing leadership and also with my fellow freshmen, you know, fellow classmates to talk to them about their vision for the caucus, their vision for the future. And-- and, ultimately, that's where I landed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know how you'll vote yet?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Right now she's the only person who's running, so it would appear as though that's where my vote would go. And right now I believe that she's an effective person in that job. And so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're open to being swayed?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: I-- I believe right now it looks as though it's heading in the direction that she will be our speaker.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: And I think she's a pretty powerful person and a capable person.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect, you-- during your run were backed by Bernie Sanders. Do you think he represents the future of your party?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I think we're a big tent party. I mean if-- if-- if there's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he's a more progressive voice within it.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Of course. And, you know, there are also many other voices and many of our freshmen that we've spent this week with come from different areas of the country, different regions of the country. Obviously, I, you know, am a progressive Democrat and-- and believe that we should be bold in pushing for some really comprehensive solutions around some of the pressing public policy challenges that we face: climate change and the planetary crisis being the best example perhaps. But, look, again, we are a big tent party. We are inclusive. We are diverse. I think that's a good thing. So I-- I appreciate his voice just as I do the voice of many, many other leaders in the party who are all stepping up to the plate at a really critical time for our democracy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, but Republicans learned this when they had sort of an insurgent group, the Tea Party, right. That it can, while being part of bigger tent, cause problems for leadership or at least, you know, try to create some issues around finding consensus. Do you see that happening for Democrats? Do-- do progressives now become the problem for Nancy Pelosi rather than part of the caucus really on the same page?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: No, I don't think that's the case. I've only been in Washington for five days. So-- but, you know, my experience thus far and-- and I think Deb can touch on this as well as a member of the Progressive Caucus. But, no, I don't think that's the case. I think we are all working together rowing in the same direction trying to save our democracy, to be frank and so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you say save our democracy?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Well, look, I think that right now it's important for this majority in the House to engage in some really critical oversight of an administration that is undermining a lot of critical freedoms for folks in our country. And so when I say save our democracy, I-- I mean, precisely that. That-- I think some of our democratic freedoms and the principles that we live by have been under attack for the better part of the last two years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect, do you want to respond to that since the President has-- is the leader of your party?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Yeah. Well, I-- I always ask the question like--like what? You know like what is he undermining exactly? You know what-- what democratic freedoms have been undermined? We just has an election where we switched-- switched power in the House. Democracy is at work. People are voting in-- in record numbers. I-- I always ask for examples, and then we can hit those examples one-by-one and if it's-- and if it's worth criticizing, it's worth criticizing, but just kind of this broad brush criticism that the President is somehow undermining our democracy. I always wonder like, what exactly we're talking about--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: I'll be happy to-- I'll be happy to add all of the things that he's--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I'm-- I'm happy to give you the example as well.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Yeah.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: All right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I mean the undermining of the free press--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: The free press, you know, judiciary--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well, how has he done that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: --CIA, FBI, the voting process--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: How-- how has he undermined the free press?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Well, by way of example--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Obama indicted--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Sure.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: --had many press members under investigation. Trump has not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's true.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: So just this last week--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: So what is-- so what is-- so what is the difference here?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: Just this last week, one of the largest media publications in the United States, right, had to go to a federal court in order to, essentially, regain access to the press room--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: No, that was for one reporter. One reporter. Not the whole-- not the whole organization.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Other media organizations, including CBS, did file amicus briefs in support--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: That's right. Yeah. So I-- I mean, again--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to disclose that.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: It was just one reporter.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: I think we, obviously, would be-- it's part of a much larger conversation--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Because he was disruptive.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: But-- well, again--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Highly disruptive.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: A federal judge disagreed.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: I-- I-- I would argue that our President is consistently disruptive in those very same press conferences. And I would argue that he treats them with disrespect--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: But how is that-- and how is that an attack on the press, though?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Be-- because it's, literally, an attack on the press--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Oh, I've literally been attacked. So I-- I don't-- let's choose our words carefully.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: His-- his-- his-- his-- his language is an attack in these spaces.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Okay, so why can't he speak-- why-- why is he not allowed to use his own language and freedom of speech?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Because you-- and you talked about this actually, it's important that we lead from example, that we lead from the top. And the way that our President is currently leading--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: You-- I-- I agree with you there. I agree with you there. Style is one thing, if you want to criticize style, I-- I'm with you. Right? But to say it's an attack on the freedom of the press, that is a very bold statement.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: By calling the press the enemy of the people.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Yeah, I don't like that language.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: That is literally--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Okay, so the style, I-- I-- I agree, I don't like that language.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: And-- and fake news, of course. Yes. And I'll give you another example. His rhetoric about erasing trans people in our country, that to me--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: And he has never said that.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Well, it-- it-- it-- it appears that he is discriminating against the LGBTQ community and I think that's troublesome. I think it's worrisome. We all have communities in-- I mean across this country. And, I mean, and we mentioned it at the beginning ripping children away from their parents' arms. Those are all things that worry me that I absolutely feel that we have to have oversight on.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Or how about just, you know, malign--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: So they're policy differences--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: --the CIA and the FBI and the State Department and all those important institutions that are fundamental to how our democracy works and functions--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: So what-- what I hear a lot is you don't like what he says sometimes. Okay, but-- and you don't like the-- you know we have policy disagreements--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: And I--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: --but you're saying undermining democracy--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: --and I am--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: And I want to-- I want to caution us because those are very bold words. If we have policy disagreements, let's focus on those policy disagreements and I'll be happy to discuss those at any point. But this is what I've been getting at kind of all week which is we tend to-- we tend to go right at the jugular, right. We say you're undermining democracy, you're a bad person fundamentally, that's not always true. We have policy disagreements on a lot of these things.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I think it's interesting that we talked about some of the most divisive issues, including immigration, but the thing that set all of you off was the President. We have to leave the conversation there. Thank you so much. Good luck to you and your new work and your new jobs and we'll be right back.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Good to see you.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Thank you.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Thank you.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today.

Rick Scott appears to have ended the lengthy political career of Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson after final official results posted on Sunday showed Scott ahead of the three-term incumbent by more than 10,000 votes. In\u2026 [+3652 chars]", "fulltext": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson conceded defeat to Republican Gov. Rick Scott in the state's bitterly contested Senate race after final official results posted showed Scott ahead of the three-term incumbent by more than 10,000 votes.\n\n\"Let me say by no measure do I feel defeated and that's because I've had the privilege of serving the people of Florida and the country for most of my life,\" Nelson, 76, said in a video released by his campaign Sunday afternoon. \"I was not victorious but I want to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we fought\" a public office is public trust.\"\n\nIn a statement, Scott said he spoke to Nelson, who \"graciously conceded.\" Scott said he thanked Nelson \"for his years of public service.\"\n\nFlorida counties had until noon to file official results with the state following a weeklong machine and hand recount that had triggered allegations of fraud and several lawsuits. State officials will post the official results on Tuesday.\n\nThe defeat of Nelson brings an end to a now-bygone era in Florida. Nelson had been a Democratic survivor as the GOP ascended into power, hewing to a more moderate tone even as newcomers such as Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum tried to push the party in a more liberal direction.\n\nGillum conceded defeat in the state's race for governor to Ron DeSantis on Saturday. Sunday's official results showed DeSantis leading by about 33,000 votes out of more than 8.2 million cast.\n\nIn the Senate race, Scott charged into the race last April at the urging of President Trump and spent more than $60 million of his own money on a series of ads that hammered Nelson as out-of-touch and ineffective.\n\nThe campaign waged between the two men was more about character, competence and their loyalty to Mr. Trump even though Scott was placed on the defensive about his record on the environment and health care.\n\nThe weeks leading up to the election were bitter, and it remained that way after it became clear that the race between Nelson and Scott would head to a legally required recount. Scott held a press conference at the governor's mansion suggesting that fraud may be going on in several Democratic-controlled counties.\n\nNelson and the Democrats responded by filing several lawsuits that challenged everything from Scott's authority over the state's election division to deadlines for mail-in ballots.\n\nThe Nelson campaign managed to secure only one win in court. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker gave voters until 5 p.m. on Saturday to fix their ballots if they haven't been counted because of mismatched signatures. Nearly 5,700 ballots were rejected because signatures on ballot envelopes did not match signatures kept on file by election officials.\n\nWalker rejected a request by Democrats to automatically count all the ballots with mismatched signatures. He also rejected a request to waive deadlines for domestic mail-in ballots even if they had been mailed prior to Election Day.\n\nScott, a one-time health care executive and multimillionaire, first jumped into politics eight years ago, when he rode a tea party wave into the governor's office. Term limits prevented him from seeking re-election. As the state's chief executive, Scott focused on job creation and turning around Florida's economy after the recession.\n\nNelson and Scott disagreed on issues ranging from gun control to environmental policy to health care. Nelson was a strong supporter of the federal health care overhaul pushed into law by President Barack Obama, while Scott had called for the law to be repealed and replaced.\n\nNelson and his allies ran ads that questioned Scott's ethics, pointing to his ouster as chief executive of health care giant Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Although Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud.\n\nDemocrats also questioned whether Scott had conflicts while governor since both he and his wife invested in companies that do business in Florida, including a subsidiary of the company that owns Florida's largest electric utility. Scott has maintained he does not control his holdings."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/18: Paul, Cummings, Ernst", "description": "This week on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d moderator Margaret Brennan interviews California Governor Jerry Brown, Sen.

That will include \"who did it,\" he said.\n\nIt was not clear if the findings of the report would be made public. Officials familiar with the case cautioned that while it's likely the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played.\n\nMr. Trump told \"Fox News Sunday\" that Crown Prince Mohammed had repeatedly denied being involved in the killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The president declined to say if evidence that the crown prince, with whom the Trump administration developed close ties, was involved with the killing would alter relations with Riyadh.\n\n\"Well, will anybody really know?\" Mr. Trump said. \"At the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\"\n\nPresident Trump answers the question \"Did MBS lie to you?\"\n\nWatch the full interview on Fox News Channel at 2P/7P. #POTUSonFNS pic.twitter.com/nNI0HAhTRa \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) November 18, 2018\n\nFor his part, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said the crown prince has been a \"wrecking ball\" in the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I hate to say that because I had a lot of hope for him being the reformer that Saudi Arabia needs, but that ship has sailed as far as Lindsey Graham's concerned,\" the South Carolina Republican told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of working with him ever again,\" said Graham, who is in line to be the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIntelligence officials have been providing information to Mr. Trump about the death for weeks and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\n\"The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nBefore his call on Air Force One, Mr. Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\" That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nMr. Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Mr. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nBut members of Congress are pushing Mr. Trump for a tougher response to the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nVice President Mike Pence told reporters traveling with him Saturday for a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua, New Guinea, that the \"murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press, and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder.\"\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, often criticized the royal family. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "A toast to Irish coffee", "description": "The Buena Vista Caf\u00e9 is a San Francisco institution, and it's where for more than 40 years bartender Paul Nolan has been making the drink that made the Buena Vista famous: the Irish coffee.

The map below shows the parade route.\n\nOfficial parade route: From West 77th Street & Central Park West, the parade marches south along Central Park West to Columbus Circle. From there, it travels east two blocks along Central Parth South (59th Street) to 6th Avenue where it again heads south toward Herald Square. The parade turns west on 34th Street and finishes in front of Macy's Herald Square.\n\nThanksgiving Day parade bands and performers\n\nThe list of stars performing atop the parade floats this year include: Ally Brooke, Anika Noni Rose and the cast and Muppets of Sesame Street, Ashley Tisdale, Bad Bunny, Barenaked Ladies, Bazzi, Brynn Cartelli, Carly Pearce, Diana Ross and Family, Ella Mai, Jack and Jack, John Legend, Kane Brown, Leona Lewis, Mackenzie Ziegler and Johnny Orlando, Martina McBride, Pentatonix, Rita Ora, Sugarland and Tegan Marie.\n\nTwelve marching bands and several dance groups from across the country will be marching in this year's Thanksgiving Day parade. A mix of six high school bands, three college bands and other troupes will be performing. The NYPD Marching band, made up of active police officers, will also be marching.\n\n2018 Thanksgiving parade floats\n\nThe Fantasy Chocolate Factory float is new to the parade this year. The Kinder-sponsored float features a Ferris wheel-powered chocolate factory that would give Willy Wonka a run for his money. Other new floats include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Santa's Saint Bernards, and a newly designed annual favorite of the longest-running float, Tom Turkey.\n\nSesame Street, Ronald McDonald's red shoe, the Girl Scouts and Build-A-Bear are some of the floats returning to the parade this year.\n\nParade weather in New York City\n\nThis year might be the coldest Thanksgiving on record in New York City. The National Weather Service forecast is calling for temperatures in the 20s with high winds gusting up to 35 mph. If that forecast stays true, it may dampen the celebration, as the parade balloons in are not allowed to fly if the wind gusts are more than 35 mph.

Jerry Brown says President Trump assured him he will not cut federal funding to California to deal with the state's deadly wildfires in what the governor called a \"big, big win.\" On Saturday, Brown and the president toured damage from the Camp Fire that killed dozens of people, with nearly 1,300 more still unaccounted for. The governor also said economic impact of the fires will be \"tens of billions\" of dollars.\n\n\"The president not only has signed a presidential declaration giving California substantial funding, but he said and pledged very specifically to continue to help us, that he's got our back,\" Brown said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"And I thought that was a very positive thing. \"\n\nThe positive assessment of the president's visit to the California wildfires comes after some mixed signals from Mr. Trump about the cause of the fires and who is to blame. Last week, Mr. Trump threatened to cut off federal payments to California. \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" He later approved a federal disaster declaration.\n\n\"There have been some back and forth between California leaders and the president. But in the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities,\" Brown said about Mr. Trump's change of mind.\n\nThe governor also said he did not press the issue of climate change during Mr. Trump's visit. The president on Saturday declined to say whether climate change directly impacted the fires, saying there were \"a lot of factors\" and that seeing the devastation had not changed his opinion on climate change.\n\n\"I certainly raised it,\" Brown said about climate change. \"But I didn't feel that that was where we needed to go. We need the money, we need federal help and we need a collaborative and cooperative spirit and we're getting that. But I did say that we're going to look at all the elements that are causing these fires over time and we're going to work in a way to let science be our guide, and the president in no way negated that.

Democrat Joe Neguse is Colorado's first black congressman. His parents came to this country from Eritrea as refugees more than 35 years ago. He's also a new father of a baby girl. Congrats on that. Democrat Deb Holland of New Mexico is one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. She's also a single mother. Republican Dan Crenshaw of Texas is a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan. He may also be the first representative elect to appear on Saturday Night Live- at least that I remember. And Democrat Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania is a former captain in the Air Force, a former chemistry teacher and she is also a mother of two. So you ladies know something about multitasking here. A lot of Americans, when you talk to them, seem to have lost faith in Congress. In fact, the approval rating CBS News just took was at 19 percent. What made you run?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JOE NEGUSE: You know look, I was very concerned about the direction that our country was taking. As you mentioned my parents were Eritrean immigrants to this country and we've been able to live the American dream and the freedoms and the opportunities that have enabled us to live the American dream in every sense of that phrase, I felt like were slipping away for a lot of Americans in our country. And so I decided that I would try to do something about it and threw my hat in the ring.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DEB HAALAND: Yes well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman-elect.\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Thank you, thank you. Well of course this is an important job, it's an important job for my district in New Mexico. I wanted to feel like I could help more people. The constituent services program that we're all responsible for I think is extremely important for our districts. And that's absolutely one of the reasons that I decided to run.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman-elect.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DAN CRENSHAW: Well you know, I was in the military for 10 years, I took an oath to the Constitution 12 years ago. And you know that oath has not ended. So it's really about service, it's about service and it's about impact. You know, how can I impact the issues that matter to my constituents. You know, we're still reeling from Hurricane Harvey. We want more individual freedom. We want less government in our lives. We want to live that American dream. And those are things we can actually agree on. And that's what I'll be fighting for.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So when you hear that there's an approval rating of just 19 percent, you think you can do better than that?\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well I hope so. Is that an improvement or- or, it might be an improvement, I thought it was lower at one point.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: I understand that's the case, and the military has- has long brought a lot of credibility to American institutions. I hope to bring some of that credibility to Congress. And you know, the way we do that is we talk to each other like we're actually people, let's not attack each other's intent, let's not attack each other as a person, let's attack ideas. All right we can debate ideas we can disagree and ideas all day long. Let's find the things that we actually agree upon and work on those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you equally as optimistic, Congresswoman-elect?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Well so I- I share a lot of commonalities with my fellow colleagues in terms of why I'm running. I am third generation military, my dad and grandfather served careers and I did as well, served as a captain in the air force. And as a third generation military member I am deeply concerned about the democracy right now. I'm worried about the direction that we're heading as a people. I'm similarly interested in making sure that we maintain civility and decency with one another in the way that we treat each other and the way that our government works. And personally my motivation for running is-is one of service. I want to continue the service that I've done, both in the military and also growing good and strong businesses and most recently in education, as a- as a teacher and also as a nonprofit leader in early childhood literacy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The district that you were elected in, you flipped it.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Yes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Red to blue.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you've described it as more purple.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Yes.--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's a mix--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --Yes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --of people of different convictions here. How do you balance those forces. And does that mean that as a Democrat, you're willing to work with President Trump?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Absolutely. We are a district that's 40 percent Democrat, 40 percent Republican and 20 percent Independent. And I call us purple people because I believe that we are, I believe largely that we sit in the middle and what we're looking for is head and heart issues.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the more divisive issues is immigration. It's also what President Trump says he wants to tackle. Obviously there are different views on how to do that. But Congresswoman-elect, you're in a very unique position, as one of only--\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Sure. Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --two Native American women elected to Congress. How do you think that affects your approach on things like immigration?\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Sure-sure. Well, New Mexico is a border state. So we-we actually feel confident about the security of our borders and New Mexico. We- New Mexico as a whole was appalled when the policy to separate children from their parents happened on the border. It made me immediately think about governmental policies. Back when my grandmother was a child and she was separated from her family and taken to Indian boarding school. So it seems like at some point we need to look at our history and stop doing the things that are harmful to our children and work toward finding solutions that are absolutely humane.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You would work with President Trump?\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Well I think we all have to do it together. The Democrats won back the House. We didn't win back the Senate or the presidency yet. So we do have to work across the aisle to make sure that we can get things passed. Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect you-you are a vet. You mentioned your service. How do you feel about the deployment of U.S. troops, U.S. personnel to the border? Is that the right way to be using the U.S. military?\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well what they're using them for is-is logistical support. You know, they're not there-they're not down there as-as combat troops stopping people from crossing the border--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --they're not actually at the border--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: That-that-that's not what's actually happening--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --right--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: What's actually happening is they're-they're-they're reinforcing the law enforcement that is there to do their job. You know the reality is-is I- what I want to- the question I always have the Democrats is, do we agree that our borders should be secure, yes or no. I understand you don't like the wall. I understand that. But can we agree that the border should be secured and if you have other ideas to-to-to secure that border, especially in Texas we're willing to listen because you know we have a river along the border. We can't always put a wall there. We get that. You know we've got other options as well. So will you work with us on--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of using the U.S. military in that role. Essentially you know we have--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Right, well-well-well, when you have-when you have--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --a border patrol that has the job that you just laid out that the military is now there to back them up on.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well yeah, but there was also thousands of thousands of people coming up to the border in a caravan. And so you have to take different measures to do that. So--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -You do see that as a threat even though they're on foot and not at the border yet?\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well-well what's the other option? To just let them cross? Because we don't have enough law enforcement officials to deal with that possibly. So you know again we're not putting combat troops on the border. That's not what's happening. We are dealing with this in a very humane way and as I think we should and we can all agree on that for sure. None of us really like seeing families separated. I've said that all along. That's-that's the last thing we want to see. Republicans tried to put legislation forward that would stop that. Okay. And we will continue to do that. But-but yes, if- if- if it's between letting people across and not letting people cross, we have to secure our border. And I- and I hear that we agree on that a lot. I do. And I-and I understand that Democrats don't like the rhetoric and they don't like the wall. I absolutely get that. But I want to see other options on the table then on what we can do to actually secure it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He's comfortable in using U.S. troops in that way. Are you?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: No-no. I think it's the wrong approach. I think it's imprudent. I disagree with it and I think the other option is to follow existing law and-and let folks go through the asylum process and to the extent that they are able to successfully claim asylum. I-I say this as the son of refugees. I mean I-I think immigrants to this country have so much to give and it's important we get this right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will the Democrats at the table vote for any kind of immigration reform that includes funding for a border wall?\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: I wouldn't.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: No, I don't support a wall.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: I wouldn't as well. And I'm also the daughter of a refugee. My dad was a survivor of the Holocaust and came here with his mom as a very small child, as a 5-year-old and this is a very personal issue to me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let me take a break here and come back. We talked about finding agreement. We've already found a disagreement. Let's see what- what else we--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --that was easy--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- we can get to. Got there pretty quick. After this short break we will be back in a moment with more from our panel.\n\nPart 2\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our new member panel. And let's pick up the conversation. I know the two of you, both vets, have made a vow to try to find at least one point of agreement that you can legislate around. Do you know what that's going to be?\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: There's multiple points--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Yep.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: So I mean opioids--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Yep.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --infrastructure issues. You know, different infrastructure issues around the country. But for us its flood mitigation, opioid epidemic is- is terrible. You know, more-more people died of opioids last year than the entire Vietnam War. That's just the reality. And--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But is there anything that you particularly want to shepherd here?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Well I-I agree, infrastructure --and-and a big infrastructure bill--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that number one for you?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --absolutely. Opioids is an enormous problem in our community as well. Pharmaceutical prescription prices I think is something that we need to look at, we have to look at.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: And another thing I would bring up is workforce training issues. You know there are 7 million job openings, which is a great problem to have. We've got a great economy. But we need middle skill labor to fill those jobs.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask the Democrats at the table about your own leadership, your own party identity. I know you, Congresswoman-elect have said you will support Nancy Pelosi to be speaker.\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The two of you. Did you learn anything this week? Did she earn your votes and your support?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Well so I'd say, I just want to, one quick tangent, criminal justice reform--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, you're deflecting. You are a politician.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: --no, I will answer it. I will answer the question but it's a really important issue where there's some emerging bipartisan consensus for Republicans and Democrats--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: I think that's great.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: --I'm passionate about that. No. Look I- it's fascinating to me that it's the question that we got most often, at least the Democrats did, here during orientation, which is particularly interesting since there's no other candidate that I'm aware of--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: --that's running against Leader Pelosi. I intend to support her. You know I think that it's important that we have steady leadership right now. And I found it pretty heartening over the course of the last week some of the developments around it becoming clear that this leadership team is going to work to try to make sure that everyone has a seat at the table. You saw a message from Leader Pelosi's office by way of example around making sure that there is progressive representation on key committees in the Congress and the Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders endorsing her shortly thereafter. So- so yeah, that's where I am.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what changed your mind? The pledge to diversity council?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: That among many other things. I wanted to have conversations with existing leadership and also with my fellow freshmen, fellow classmates to talk to them about their vision for the caucus their vision for the future. And- and ultimately that's where I landed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know how you'll vote yet?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Right now she's the only person who's running so it would appear as though that's where my vote would go. And right now I believe that she's an effective person in that job. And so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you're open to being swayed?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --I-I believe right now it looks as though it's heading in the direction that she will be our speaker. And I think she's a pretty powerful person and a capable person.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect, you during your run were backed by Bernie Sanders. Do you think he represents the future of your party?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: I think we're a big tent party. I mean if-if--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he is a more progressive voice within it.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: --Of course. And you know there are also many other voices and many of our freshmen that we've spent this week with come from different areas of the country, different regions of the country. Obviously I you know am a progressive Democrat and- and believe that we should be bold in pushing for some really comprehensive solutions around some of the pressing public policy challenges that we face: climate change and the planetary crisis being the best example perhaps. But look again we are a big tent party. We are inclusive. We are diverse. I think that's a good thing. So I- I appreciate his voice just as I do the voice of many many of leaders in the party who are all stepping up to the plate at a really critical time for our democracy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, but Republicans learned this when they had sort of an insurgent group the Tea Party right. That it can, while being part of a bigger tent, cause problems for leadership or at least, you know, try to create some issues around finding consensus. Do you see that happening for Democrats? Do- do progressives now become the problem for Nancy Pelosi rather than part of the caucus really on the same page?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: No, I don't think that's the case. I've only been in Washington for five days. So- but you know my experience thus far and- and I think can touch on this as well as a member of the Progressive Caucus. But no, I don't think that's the case. I think we are all working together rowing in the same direction trying to save our democracy, to be frank and so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you say save our democracy?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Well look, I think that right now it's important for this majority in the House to engage in some really critical oversight of an administration that is undermining a lot of critical freedoms for folks in our country. And so when I say save our democracy, I mean precisely that. That-I think some of our democratic freedoms and the principles that we live by have been under attack for the better part of the last two years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-elect, do you want to respond to that since the president has-is the leader of your party?\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well I-I always ask the question like-like what? You know, like what is he undermining exactly? You know what- what democratic freedoms have been undermined? We just has an election where we switched-switched power in the House. Democracy is at work. People are voting in-in record numbers. I-I always ask for examples, and then we can hit those examples one-by-one and-and if it's- if it's worth criticizing, it's worth criticizing, but just kind of this broad brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining our democracy. I always wonder like, what exactly we're talking about--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: I'll be happy to- I'll be happy to add all of the things that he's--\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: --I'm- I'm happy to give you the example as well. I mean the undermining of the free press--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: The free press. Judiciary--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Well how has he done that?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --CIA. FBI. The voting process--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: How-how has he undermined the free press?--\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Well, by way of example--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Obama indicted--\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Sure.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --had many press members under investigation. Trump has not.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's true.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Just this last week--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: So- so what is-what is-what is the difference here?\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: Just this last week, one of the largest media publications in the United States, right, had to go to a federal court in order to essentially regain access to the press room--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: No that was for one reporter. One reporter. Not the-not the whole organization--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Other media organizations including CBS did file amicus briefs in support--\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: That's right. Yeah. So I-I mean again--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to disclose that.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: It was just one reporter.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: I think we obviously would be- it's part of a much larger conversation--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Because he was disruptive.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: But- well, again--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Highly disruptive.\n\nREP-ELECT NEGUSE: A federal judge disagreed.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: I-I-I would argue that our President is consistently disruptive in those very same press conferences. And I would argue that he treats them with disrespect--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: But-but how is that-how is that an attack on the press?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Be-because it's literally an attack on the press--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Oh, I've literally been attacked. So I-I don't- let's choose our words carefully.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: His- his- his- his- his language is an attack in these spaces.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Okay so why can't he speak- why-why is he not allowed to use his own language and freedom of speech?\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Because you- and you talked about this actually, it's important that we lead from example, that we lead from the top. And the way that our president is currently leading--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --you. I-I agree with you there. I agree with you there. Style is one thing, if you want to criticize style I-I'm with you. Right? But to say it's an attack on the freedom of the press, that is a very bold statement.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: By calling the press the enemy of the people.\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Yeah I don't like that language\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: That is literally--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: Okay so the style, I-I-I agree I don't like that language.\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: And fake news of course. Yes. And I'll give you another example. His rhetoric about erasing trans people in our country, that to me-\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: And he has never said that.\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: Well it-it-it appears that he is discriminating against the LGBTQ community. And I think that's troublesome. I think it's worrisome. We all have communities in- I mean across this country and I mean and we mentioned it at the beginning ripping children away from their parents' arms. Those are all things that worry me that I absolutely feel that we have to have oversight on.\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: Or how about just you know malign--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --so they're policy differences--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --the CIA and the FBI and the State Department and all those important institutions that are fundamental to how our democracy works and functions--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: So what-what I hear a lot is you don't like what he says sometimes. Okay-but-and you don't like the-- you know we have policy disagreements--\n\nREP-ELECT HAALAND: And- and I\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: but you're saying undermining democracy--\n\nREP-ELECT HOULAHAN: --and I am--\n\nREP-ELECT CRENSHAW: --and I-and I want to caution us because those are very bold words. If we have policy disagreements, let's focus on those policy disagreements and I'll be happy to discuss those at any point. But this is what I've been getting at kind of all week which is we tend to-we tend to go right at the jugular, right. We say you're undermining democracy, you're a bad person fundamentally, that's not always true. We have policy disagreements on a lot of these things.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I think it's interesting that we talked about some of the most divisive issues including immigration, but the thing that set all of you off was the president. We have to leave the conversation there. Thank you so much. Good luck to you and your new work and your new jobs and we'll be right back."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Transcript: Sen.

Good to see you in person.\n\nSENATOR JONI ERNST: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you. It's great to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president gave an interview this morning to Fox's Chris Wallace and he said that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen needs to be much tougher on the border. What is she doing wrong?\n\nSEN. ERNST: Well, I think that she has done a good job. I think the president is just very frustrated, of course, with what we see at the border. We do have a large number of- of immigrants that are trying to get over the border illegally and we do need to make sure that we've got plenty of surveillance, that we have plenty of officers ready to respond. I think her response has been well so far, we as Congress need to step forward and do the next steps.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: She should continue in the role?\n\nSEN. ERNST: I think that she's done a good job, but of course, any of our secretaries or cabinet members serve at the pleasure of the president. It's entirely up to him who serves in those positions.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're a vet. Is deploying 6,000 troops to the border a good use of resources?\n\nSEN. ERNST: Well I- again, up to the president and of course those governors that are involved if they're National Guard soldiers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're on Armed Services, you have a voice.\n\nSEN. ERNST: If they are active duty soldiers it does actually provide them an opportunity for real life training in their roles. Many of them, if they serve in logistics type positions they will actually be doing those missions on the border. So it is a very good skill. As someone who has commanded troops both in peacetime and in wartime to make sure that they keep their skills sharp. And so when they do deploy, they are in harm's way overseas. They know exactly how to support the- the men and women on the frontlines.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's how you see- I know General Mattis said- Secretary Mattis has said they won't even have any contact with people coming across.\n\nSEN. ERNST: Exactly, but they will be utilized in the roles. Like I said many of them may be logistics professionals serving in our armed services. And then it gives them greater opportunity to respond quickly in those types of situations, whether they are supporting with food or body armor, whatever it might be for Border Patrol agents. It allows those Border Patrol agents to actually focus on the law enforcement duties.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As we introduce you, you are the first female senator to be in a leadership position of the GOP in a decade. But the number of women- Republican women in the house is at a 24 year low. We have never seen a Republican woman in the House or Senate in the whip leader or speaker positions. Now from these midterm results we're seeing female voters breaking from the party. Does the Republican Party have a problem with women?\n\nSEN. ERNST: Well, I think we need to encourage more women to run for office. I think we really can do much better in that area and then encourage them to seek responsibilities as leaders. So I was really really honored to be elected into our Republican leadership in the Senate. We have to have quality candidate- candidates out there and again encourage them to run, we need to be--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the problem in the primaries that you saw, where some women were running but not winning?\n\nSEN. ERNST: Well, part of that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is it the- is the issue with Republican men not voting for Republican female candidates?\n\nSEN. ERNST: I would say that part of that really is that we need to connect with our constituencies. We need to make sure that our voices are being heard. So whether it is focusing on health care priorities. Whether it is focusing on a national paid family leave opportunity for men and for women. Whatever those messages are, we need to communicate those and make sure that we are being heard when our constituents go to the polls.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will you be doing anything to recruit more women?\n\nSEN. ERNST: Certainly I- I do visit with a number of women and I talk to Republican women. I see Democratic women when I'm in Iowa as well. And if they have a passion, if they believe in public service, I always encourage them to run, if that's their desire to serve the people of their- their potential district. We want them to step up and make their voices heard.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think the president's rhetoric or what happened during the 2016 election is turning away women from the party overall--\n\nSEN. ERNST: I--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --voters or candidates?\n\nSEN. ERNST: I think that we could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women and that's something that I try and do. I try and set a very strong example for women that want to run for office, women that wish to serve in the military. Whatever it might be, we need to set a good example. Women primarily, men secondarily, we need to step up and make sure that we are supporting the needs of our constituents.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that really impacts your home state. The vice president said today- and he's in Asia, that the U.S. is not in a rush to end this trade dispute with China, suggesting that things might not get resolved when President Xi and Trump sit down in just a few weeks. There was a 12 billion dollar bailout for farmers, to help alleviate some of this pain. Will you need another one?\n\nSEN. ERNST: I am hopeful that we will not need another subsidy program for our farmers. Our farmers would much rather grow their goods and make sure that they are getting out to the rest of the world. Absolutely. But I've done a number of farmer roundtables all across the state of Iowa and at the last one I held, the very last speaker, a- a middle aged farmer, he-he stood up and said I understand why President Trump is doing this; however, what I don't understand is why someone didn't do it sooner. So they understand--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The pain is tolerable for now?\n\nSEN. ERNST: The pain is tolerable for now. I want to see these trade deals done. I'd rather see them done sooner, rather than later, but we have to get a good deal with China or it's all for naught.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for joining us.\n\nSEN. ERNST: Thank you. Pleasure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with a panel of some of the new House members."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Transcript: Rep.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland that aired Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Maryland's Elijah Cummings. He is the top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Chief Investigative Committee in the House and he is joining us from Baltimore this morning. Congressman, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" I want to ask you what the president said this morning on Fox News in an interview with Chris Wallace, he said that the acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has the power to block any subpoena requests from the special counsel to the president. The president suggested that he's done answering questions. And now that the investigation- he seems to be suggesting is coming to an end. Does Congress have anything to do to protect the integrity of the- of the probe itself given some of these past public statements by the acting attorney general that have drawn that into question?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Well I am extremely concerned about the acting attorney general. I question whether or not it was actually a legitimate appointment since he's not been confirmed by the Senate. But we- we're going to look into- to all of this. I- again--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you--\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: --with him being in there.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: force his recusal?\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: I don't think so. I don't think- I don't think that we- I don't know that we have that power. But we're going to certainly look at every angle. But I'm hoping that- that- that- I would love to see him recuse himself because I think the things that he has said about defunding the special probe and the many things that he has talked about, with regard to his opinion, a negative opinion with regard to special counsel in the process. I don't think that he's the proper person to be in that position and I- in any- and- but again I think almost anything he does in that- in the position of the interim may very well be tainted because we're not clear- it's not clear that he is a legitimate appointment to that position.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If the Mueller probe continues to its conclusion, which the president has said he-he at this point won't interfere. Will you- If you do take the chairmanship of House Oversight and have the subpoena power that goes with it, will you force Mueller's findings to be made public if the Department of Justice decides not to release them?\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: I would love to see it become public because basically in this last election what the public has said is that they want accountability and they want transparency and they have paid for a- an investigation by one of our greatest public servants, Mr. Mueller- Special Counsel Mueller. And so I would do anything and everything in my power to have that- the findings presented to not only to the Congress, but to the people of the United States. I think it's very important.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If you take this chairmanship, what's your top priority? Where do you began?\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: Well first of all we've got to make sure that we do- do those things that are important to the American people. Things such as voting rights, we just saw what happened down there in Georgia and in Florida. We- we- we cannot have a country where people are being blocked from voting. We also want to look at preexisting conditions, things of that nature, to make sure that people are protected in regard to that. We also want to look at the census. Lot of people are surprised about that. But the census is right around the corner. And what we do with regard to the census will affect us for the next 10 to 12 years and- and it will affect every single person in this country. Another area is postal. Our postal system has had some economic problems. We have legislation that could actually cure those problems. We want to move that forward. So we're going to be doing that. But at the same time we're going to address the issue that- that- that a lot of people are concerned about and making sure that government is doing what government is supposed to do for all of the American people. We may not have been elected by all the people as Democrats but we must govern all the people in a fair way.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As I mentioned you are expected to have that powerful position on House oversight. But overall when it comes to leadership right now, there are some questions about whether there is enough black leadership at the top of the Democratic Party. I mean if Pelo- Pelosi and Hoyer are- are successful at remaining speaker and leader, is Jim Clyburn enough? Do need to see more?\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: I think- First of all you've got to understand we have- all of us our leaders.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: And so- but so we could only have one speaker at a time. Nancy Pelosi has simply been phenomenal and she has been one who has been- she believes in inclusion revolution. She has probably the most diverse leadership team that in his- in the history of any legislative body as far as the Congress is concerned. And she has- she has fought hard to make sure that people like Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus are supported. So- and as far as Jim Clyburn is concerned, he's a phenomenal leader. And so we- you know we're going to be fine. I know that there are people who are talking to a lot of talk--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREP. CUMMINGS: But the fact is is that Nancy Pelosi is a phenomenal woman, a phenomenal speaker, a phenomenal leader. She'll be fine.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK Congressman thank you very much.

Rand Paul of Kentucky that aired Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the news that the CIA has determined that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman personally ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul joins us now from Bowling Green. Senator, the president says a final conclusion will be made this week by the U.S. government, but in a Fox interview he indicated that essentially murder can be forgiven if the kingdom provides economic benefit. Listen to this exchange.\n\n*CLIP*\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: What if the Crown Prince, speaking to you the president of the United States, directly lied to you about--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well that he told me that he had nothing to do with it. He told me that, I would say maybe five times at different points.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: But what if he's lying?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: As recently as a few days ago.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Do you just live with it because you need him?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well will anybody really know, all right? Will anybody really know, but he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved. You saw we put on very heavy sanctions massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\n\n*END CLIP*\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of the president's remarks?\n\nSENATOR RAND PAUL: Well you know the Crown Prince, his brother, made a phone call to Khashoggi, the dissident that was killed and dismembered, and that phone call was to tell Khashoggi, \"Hey it's fine. You can go to the consulate no one will harm you.\" Well, you know, we have the Crown Prince's brother making that phone call. I think we have other intelligence that may link brother's phone calls back to the Crown Prince. I think the evidence is overwhelming that the Crown Prince was involved and so no I don't think we can sweep this under the rug. The thing about sanctions is that I think sanctions are pretending to do something without really doing anything. Most of these people are in prison other than the Crown Prince. But the Crown Prince runs the country and we deal with him. If we put sanctions on people who are in prison. Are we really doing anything to punish them they're already in prison. We need to punish who ordered this. Who's in charge and really the only thing they understand over there is strength. I think they will see sanctions as weakness on the part of the president and if the president wants to act strongly he should cut off the arms sale not only because of the killing but until they stop bombing civilian populations. Secretary Pompeo told Saudi Arabia three weeks ago stop bombing civilian populations. Since then Saudi Arabia has bombed cities 200 times, they're not listening--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --you're talking about in Yemen.\n\nSEN. PAUL: --they're indiscriminately bombing civilians.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Yes in Yemen.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about in Yemen. I should point out Saudi Arabia disputes the reporting that there is a- there was a phone call between Prince Khaled and Jamal Khashoggi. They say that's just not true. But given the CIA assessment overall that says there was a role, do you think this needs to trigger some other kind of change in policy? You're on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are you going to try to block the appointment of the appointed ambassador?\n\nSEN PAUL: Realize the Saudis have told us a lot of things that were untrue. They told us it was a fistfight that went bad, they have told us he was alive, they had a body double there to try to trick people into believing he was still alive. So the Saudis have been duplicitous since the very beginning. Do we need to do more? Yes, but at the very least we need to quit selling arms to people who are lying to us--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --The President says that that's exactly why though, those arms sales are exactly why the relationship is important and he's not going to hurt the economic benefits.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Here's my point. The arms sales don't make us safer. They make us less safe. When we sell arms to a foreign country, it should not ever be for jobs, it should be for our national security. The Saudis' involving us in their war in Yemen is a disaster. 17 million people live on the edge of starvation. If we get involved in another civil war in the Middle East, that's not good for our national security. That just drains our natural resources--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do anything to stop it though?\n\nSEN. PAUL: Yeah. Quit arming the Saudis. The Saudis are bombing to the tune of tens of thousands of bombs in Yemen--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But in Congress, is there anything you can do? Because the president says he's going to continue selling.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Right. Yeah, I've introduced resolution after resolution to stop selling arms. We've done it twice and it's a privilege resolution meaning they can't prevent me from getting a vote. First time I got twenty something votes the second time with the help of a Democrat Senator Chris Murphy we got 47 votes. If we have another vote I think we could almost get to a veto proof majority, but guess what? They're not bringing any arms sales up right now--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSEN. PAUL: --because they know we might beat them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the ambassador who's been nominated here, General John Abizaid? You going vote to confirm him?\n\nSEN. PAUL: I- I want to meet with him and I don't think that that really- my first impulse is not- that's not the way to sort of punish Saudi Arabia, by blocking an ambassador. I'm a big believer in dialogue and even with this I wouldn't stop trading oil with Saudi Arabia, but I would stop selling them arms. That's the first thing I would do. That doesn't disrupt trade, doesn't disrupt diplomacy. It just sends them a very strong message, we're not going to keep fueling your- your war in Yemen, which is a total disaster. And everybody saying there's no military solution and yet nobody's willing to do anything that would actually force Saudi Arabia to stop the war. If we were not refuel- not refueling, if we were not providing spare parts for their American made planes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSEN. PAUL: --the war would be over in a matter of months because you have to have a continuous supply of spare parts and people repair your planes and train your pilots. If we quit doing that, Saudi Arabia would quit bombing them within three or four months.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get you on domestic policy. The president has put forward a- a- a proposal that has some bipartisan support on criminal justice reform. There's no guarantee it's going to be put to vote in the lame duck session and some of your fellow Republicans like Tom Cotton say this is just about letting felons out of jail. How do you respond?\n\nSEN. PAUL: You know I've been- I've been working on criminal justice reform with Republicans and Democrats for six or seven years. I met with President Obama several times on this, bipartisan groups. We have a real chance to pass this now. With President Trump being in favor of- of this criminal justice reform, he came out publicly for it, really it only depends on one senator now. If Senator Mitch McConnell, from my home state, will allow a vote it gets 65 to 70 votes in the Senate. It'll be one of the most popular things to ever pass. Is it a jailbreak? No. It's saying people that have you know a nonviolent drug offense, that we don't keep them in jail for life. It's saying that 95 percent of people that get out of prison, when they get out of prison, do we want them to keep committing crimes or we should train them for jobs? Should we use programs to try to test whether or not we can teach people not to recommit crimes? And really do nonviolent people need to be in jail sometimes for life? We should--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So how--\n\nSEN. PAUL: --reevaluate this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you force a vote? You're running out of time here.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Well it- it's all up to one person. Senator McConnell has the ability to call any vote he wants to anytime. He has promised in the past that he would allow this vote if there was popularity for it. President Trump is behind it. In my state 86 percent of the people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're suggesting he's choosing not to?\n\nSEN PAUL: --are behind this. The Fraternal Order of Police- Fraternal Order of Police are behind it. 2000 pastors, and I- I didn't get your follow up.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I said it-it-it seems like you're suggesting that he does not want to.\n\nSEN. PAUL: There have been some articles, I haven't talked to him directly about it. The last time I talked to him about it, he said he was open to allowing a vote after the election.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Now with the President Trump- a-a-all in on this. I really hope we can get a vote but it's really up to Senator McConnell. But it's very very popular in Kentucky and very very popular with people who support President Trump so I hope he allows a vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for that. Thank you very much, Senator Paul.\n\nSEN. PAUL: Thank you."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Transcript: California Gov.

Jerry Brown airing Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: California Governor Jerry Brown toured the devastation along with President Trump and other officials. Governor, thank you for joining us.\n\nGOVERNOR JERRY BROWN: Thank you. Glad to be here. Glad you're out here, right out where the fires are and we're- we're experiencing some difficulty.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that more than a thousand people are unaccounted for, 74 are dead. How did these fires, the worst in your state's history, get so out of control?\n\nGOV. BROWN: Well you're asking how they got out of control- how they started is now a subject of investigation. But obviously some fire source got it going and then it- the conflagration occurs because the brush, the vegetation is so dry and the humidity is so low. And when you have that- that and then the heat and the use of drought that gets it going. And in Paradise there were a lot of buildings that also caught fire and then it just went from one to the other. So it's a mixture of many things. And the president's talked about how our forests are managed, that's an element but there's also the way the houses are built, the materials, what kind of vegetation is around. And there there's also the changing climate and the increasing drought and the lower humidity and water vapor. All of that is combining to create the tragic situation that we saw today in both Northern California and here in Southern California.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As you- as you, say the president did acknowledge that he said climate change might be a factor, \"a little bit\" but he primarily blamed forest management as the cause here. Is California to blame here for its own problems?\n\nGOV. BROWN: Well where Paradise is, of course, is surrounded by federally managed land. These are national forests. They are not state parks and they're not private property by Californians so it is the federal government. And the fact is that managing the forest is part of it. They are a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. But on top of that, we have this five year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the dryness that turns vegetation and bushes and houses and trees into- literally into timber. So it was ready to explode. So there- there is an atmospheric element which is part of the natural cycle and then there is an increasing effect of climate change. In fact, I have read, specifically peer reviewed scientific articles that say that the amount of- of land burnt in California over the last 15 years has doubled because of climate change, so--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Did you make that case to President Trump?\n\nGOV. BROWN: I certainly raised it but I didn't feel that that was where we needed to go. We need the money. We need federal help and we need a collaborative and cooperative spirit and we're getting that. But I did say that we're going to look at all the elements that are causing these fires over time and we're going to work in a way to let science be our guide and the president in no way negated that. So I decided to go for an opening and I think over the next months and years you'll see the science becoming crystal clear and even the folks in Washington that are now more in the denialist camp are going to come around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see on that one. You did say there the federal funds were coming. Did President Trump assure you that he's not going to cut funding as he had threatened to do?\n\nGOV. BROWN: Yes. So that's a big, big win. The president not only has signed a presidential declaration giving California substantial funding, but he said and pledged very specifically to- to continue to help us. That he's got our back. And I thought that was a very positive thing. There have been some back and forth between California leaders and the president. But in this- in the face of tragedy people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities. So I think we're on a good path, but it's still going to be difficult because the only way to ensure the long term forest health is not just, you know, cutting trees it's going to require reducing carbon emissions and eventually sooner rather than later to zero. And if we don't do that you're going to see these fires not only continuing, but getting worse by the year as they are. The last five years, the fires have never been this bad. This fire in Malibu is the worst they've ever seen. This fire in- in Paradise and Northern California was the worst in the history of California. So yeah, you can mull the science, but I'll tell you every year it's going to get clearer and clearer so that I think in less than five years even the worst skeptics are going to be believers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about the human toll? As we said a thousand unaccounted for do you believe that number is going to continue to rise?\n\nGOV. BROWN: I think it will rise. I don't think it's going to be a thousand, I don't know that for sure, but we think by the way the numbers are gathered that that's high. But look, they're narrow streets these fires we're going, and I-I can't even believe it but I'll repeat what the fire people told me. Fires are moving a football length, a hundred yards a second. And-and the roads were very narrow. So there is no way for a lot of these people to get out, and some of them were backed up. Cars blocking the road. Three hours to move a few miles. So that's another thing. If you're going to live this close to the forest, if the climate is going to keep changing, you're going to have to build some kind of underground shelters, so that you can go in and protect yourself not by going three or four miles or by going you know 30 or 40 feet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty stark image. Governor, tell me about what's happening now with the air quality, which we understand is very toxic in some cities like San Francisco. And do you have a sense of the damage being caused by that and the economic hit to your state?\n\nGOV. BROWN: Well, first of all I like to look at my weather app. I look at it a couple of times a day. I never saw on the weather app until yesterday, \"Air hazardous to health.\" And then in other cities I saw \"very unhealthful air\" and then \"unhealthful air\" and then \"air-air unhealthful to sensitive people.\" Those categories I never saw before. So yeah this is bad stuff. It's temporary. So in- in some ways it's far less than Beijing or Shanghai, and far less than Los Angeles was in the 50s. So it's not good, but for a few days we'll get through it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the economic hit?\n\nGOV. BROWN: Oh the economic impact is devastating to the people who lose their house, their farm, their animals, and not to say their lives, their loved ones, their family, their parents. So yeah, the-the- the devastation is-is at the human level is horrific and- and hard to find words to describe. And economically, yes this is going to cost tens of billions. That's what it's going to cost before we get finished.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you very much. I know you've got a lot of work ahead of you. Appreciate you making time.\n\nGOV.

Comunale ended the night at an after-party that seemed like any other ... but this time, he disappeared.\n\nWithin hours of learning Joey Comunale was missing, his close friends went into overdrive scouring social media to find him. Using information they found on Instagram, Facebook and elsewhere, they traced the final steps their friend took that night \u2013 steps that ultimately led to his death.\n\n\"I called everyone in my phone,\" friend Stephen Naso tells Erin Moriarty, after he got a call from Comunale's father, Pat. \"We go and we just start looking for him.\"\n\n\"48 Hours\" explores the last night of Comunale's life, the race to find him, and the case against two young men -- one of them the surrogate son of a so-called \"Jeweler to the Stars\" for brutally murdering him. A third man was also implicated for hindering prosecution and tampering with physical evidence.\n\nIt is a story of wealth, privilege, and an early morning after-party at an upscale NYC apartment that went terribly wrong.\n\nA NIGHT OUT IN THE CITY\n\nPreetham Dhivakarababu: I met Joey freshman year of college. We've been best friends ever since.\n\nStephen Naso: Joey was one of my best friends.\n\nTodd Greene: My best friend\n\nMax Branchinelli: Best friend.\n\nPat Comunale: Everybody called him their best friend, but I was his best friend.\n\nJoey Comunale's father Pat knew his 26-year-old son well and, at first, he wasn't worried when he couldn't reach him the morning after Joey went out with some friends on Saturday night Nov. 12, 2016.\n\nElisa Libretto\n\nPat Comunale: I know it sounds crazy, but in New York, things don't really start until late. It's not unheard of for kids to come home at 6:00 in the morning and I figured he's sleepin'.\n\nLooking back, Joey's friends, like Stephen Naso, will tell you that Joey never even intended to go out that Saturday night.\n\nStephen Naso: He was sick earlier in the day. \u2026I think he took a nap for, like, three hours.\n\nBut then Joey's college buddy Preetham Dhivakarababu, a part-time promoter, texted and offered Joey VIP treatment at the Gilded Lily, a club then located in the chic Meatpacking District in downtown Manhattan.\n\nPreetham Dhivakarababu: I was working so I'd be able to take care of everyone that came in.\n\nElisa Libretto dated Joey Comunale on and off --but mostly on -- for five years; first at Hofstra University and later, when Joey became a sales associate at his father's security company and Libretto became a teacher.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did you ever worry about him?\n\nElisa Libretto: I worried about Joey because I loved him but I knew that, you know, he always surrounded himself with good people. \u2026he is like the rest of us. He wants to have fun, doesn't want any problems.\n\nBut that particular Saturday, she and Joey, like a lot of longtime couples, were taking a break.\n\nElisa Libretto: We had a little bit of, like, a disagreement \u2026 And I was, like, \"You know what? I just need a little bit of space like I'll talk to him in the morning.\"\n\nSo Joey headed into Manhattan from Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nStephen Naso: We hop on the Merritt Parkway and shoot down to New York City.\n\nJoey was with Stephen Naso and they met up with a group of friends\n\nPreetham Dhivakarababu: It was always a good time to meet people and that's why Joey and them came out to the Gilded that night.\n\nAs the club was closing, Joey and his friends can be seen exiting on surveillance video. It was early Sunday morning and the crowd emptied onto the street. That's when Joey began talking to three women standing outside the club.\n\nStephen Naso: 3:30 or so the night was ending so everyone exits. I remember Joey on my left and these girls were looking at him a certain way and he was looking back at me and just smiling like, you know, that he was interested.\n\nStephen Naso: I get approached on my right side by two guys and they try to start some conversation with me. Joey's on my left \u2026 and they kind of form a group on that side.\n\nThe men did not know the women and they didn't know Joey and his friends, either.\n\nErin Moriarty: He jumped in a cab and went off with these two guys. Why do you think he did, do you know?\n\n\n\nStephen Naso: I just don't know, but I guarantee they're saying that they have a penthouse apartment, there's girls, this guy's dad is a jeweler.\n\nStephen Naso: There's six or seven million people in New York City and they cross paths with us.\n\nAt that point, Naso borrowed Joey's phone and stepped away from the group. When he turned back, Joey and the group were gone.\n\nMurray Weiss | \"48 Hours\": And \u2026 this new group that he had met, somebody said, \"Hey, you want to go to a friend's apartment in Sutton Place and continue having some fun?\"\n\nLongtime New York crime reporter Murray Weiss covered the Joey Comunale story when it first broke and is now working for \"48 Hours.\"\n\nMurray Weiss: So Joey went along, leaving his phone behind with his friend, thinking, \"I'll get it tomorrow. No big deal.\" \u2026They just jumped in a couple of cabs and off they went.\n\nNaso got word that Joey had gone to a party uptown at someone's apartment. So he headed home with Joey's phone. Hours later, on Sunday afternoon, back in Naso's apartment, Joey's phone began ringing.\n\nStephen Naso: And it was his father \u2026 He said, \"Hey, where's Joey?\" I said, \"He stayed in the city.\" And he was, like, \"All right, well somethin' happened. Find him for me.\"\n\nPat Comunale: So then I went to Joey's place \u2026 and he wasn't there.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: Did you talk to him every day?\n\nPat Comunale: Yeah everyday. \u2026We talked about the Yankees and the Rangers and \u2026 [sobs]\n\nErin Moriarty: I'm so sorry Pat.\n\nNaso got in touch with Dhivakarababu, who tracked down the phone number of a guy named Larry who had been at the party.\n\nPreetham Dhivakarababu: Larry told \u2026 us that he doesn't know where Joey went.\n\nThat's when the vast network of Joey's friends got to work, combing through social media, searching for any scrap of information. Friend Mike Mullen says they plugged Larry's phone number into Google and got a last name.\n\nMike Mullen: And actually his Facebook popped up, Lawrence Dilione. \"Is this the kid?\" \"Yeah, that's the kid we were with last night.\"\n\nMike Mullen: Max was the one who really put everything in motion.\n\nMax Branchinelli was perhaps Joey's closest friend. He manages a restaurant, but when he heard Joey was missing, he turned himself into an online detective.\n\nErin Moriarty: Had you ever tried to track down or retrace somebody's steps before using social media?\n\n\n\nMax Branchinelli: No \u2026 you're in a panic and you're tryin' to find your \u2013 your friend.\n\nErin Moriarty: So show me where you started.\n\n\n\nMax Branchinelli: So I went on Instagram.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: And why Instagram? Why would you start there?\n\nMax Branchinelli: Instagram, you can click on the location of a place and it will show people that posted a picture there \u2026 from that place.\n\nHere's what Branchinelli did. He began using Instagram's locator function for the Gilded Lily, looking for users who had posted the previous night and that morning. He kept his eye out for Joey.\n\nMax Branchinelli: As I was scrolling, I landed on -- this picture.\n\nErin Moriarty: And why did this catch your eye?\n\nMax Branchinelli: This caught my eye because I happen to know him, in the middle.\n\nBy total coincidence, Max spotted a friend, Alvin. But that's not the only reason he stopped at the photo.\n\nMax Branchinelli: I know the type of girls Joey chases. They're dark features. And I just had a hunch. \u2026So I screenshot the picture, and I sent it to the group of the guys that were out at the club with him the night before.\n\nErin Moriarty: And what'd they say?\n\nMax Branchinelli: They were like, \"Yeah, it's that girl right there on the right.\" \u2026and I was like, \"Wow.\"\n\nThat woman had also gone to the Sutton Place party that night. Branchinelli called his friend, Alvin, who had her phone number.\n\nMax Branchinelli: So I then hit her up. \u2026\"Do you remember being with Joey last night? Like, we can't find him. He's missing.\" And she told me, like, \"Yeah, we were with him last night.\"\n\nShe told him that when the party ended early that Sunday morning, Larry Dilione and Joey walked her and her friends to an Uber.\n\nProsecution trial evidence\n\nMax Branchinelli: She told me they waved \u2026 He looked like he was going back inside with Larry.\n\nBut when Max called Larry Dilione, he said Joey did not go back inside the building.\n\nMax Branchinelli: He's like, \"he left in an Uber with the girls.\"\n\nThose were two very different stories.\n\nMax Branchinelli: At this point, I'm not sure who's lying to me.\n\nWHERE'S JOEY?\n\nHow does a 26-year-old man simply disappear? Joey Comunale was part of a close-knit, loving family with a younger sister, Alexa, and parents, Pat and Lisa.\n\nLisa Comunale: He loved going to the city \u2026 he did it all the time. He loved it.\n\nPat Comunale: He'd go to Ranger games. He'd go to the Yankee games. He'd go to the Giant games.\n\nPat Comunale lives in a tony part of Connecticut, but he's a Bronx kid at heart. He moved here, met his future wife Lisa, and founded a successful security firm that he later sold for more than $400 million. But that meant nothing now that his only son was missing.\n\nErin Moriarty: How important is family to you, Pat?\n\n\n\nPat Comunale: Hmm [sobs].\n\n\n\nPat Comunale: Yeah, family's important. That's -- that's [sobs] everything.\n\nPat Comunale\n\nErin Moriarty: Tell me about his relationship with his dad.\n\n\n\nElisa Libretto: I have never seen a person admire their father so much. I've never seen a father admire their son so much. They were inseparable.\n\nBy Sunday evening, with Joey now missing about 10 hours, Pat Comunale phoned Larry Dilione -- who had been at the Sutton Place apartment with Joey.\n\nPat Comunale: Larry says \u2026 they walked the girls out to the car and that's the last they saw of him.\n\nBut then Dilione provided one small additional detail about Joey that, to Pat, seemed off.\n\nPat Comunale: He said, \"The last I heard, he said he was goin' to get cigarettes.\"\n\nErin Moriarty: Did that make sense?\n\nPat Comunale: \u2026didn't make any sense 'cause if you talk to his -- his friends, they'll tell you that he never bought a pack of cigarettes in his life.\n\nMax Branchinelli: Joey smoked cigarettes from time to time, but he never bought them [laughs]. That's why it doesn't make any sense.\n\nPat Comunale thought so, too. He decided to file a missing persons report.\n\nPat Comunale: So I said, \"All right, let me go to the Stamford P.D.\"\n\nBy then, Pat Comunale had Larry Dilione's phone number. The on-duty sergeant called Dilione, who denied knowing where Joey was but he did provide the names and numbers of two friends at the party: James Rackover and Max Gemma. Dilione also provided the address: 418 E. 59th Street in Manhattan, a building that calls itself the Grand Sutton.\n\nThe Grand Sutton is a luxury condo in one of the wealthiest sections of New York City. And apartment 4C was home to 25-year-old James Rackover.\n\nPat Comunale: You're not expecting an issue in Sutton Place \u2026 Sutton Place is a beautiful place to live. \u2026what could go wrong \u2026 in the Upper East Side?\n\nNo one would disagree. Over the years, the neighborhood's been home to a parade of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson and rock star Freddie Mercury.\n\nErin Moriarty: And do you know anything about Larry Dilione or James Rackover or Max Gemma at that point.\n\nPat Comunale: Nothin'.\n\nErin Moriarty: You know nothing about them.\n\nPat Comunale: Nothin'\n\nBut, as the days passed, the police would find out a lot more about the three young men -- all in their 20s -- who partied that morning with Joey.\n\nMurray Weiss: The three young men in this story \u2026 are young men of privilege.\n\nCenter photo: Carly Erickson/BFA/Shutterstock\n\nLarry Dilione worked in real estate and came from a well-off New Jersey family that owned thoroughbred horses.\n\nMax Gemma was a computer software salesman whose father was once the mayor of Oceanport, New Jersey, and had been in business with Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law.\n\nBut no one appeared to live a more charmed life than James Rackover, who was living in Sutton Place. His father Jeffrey, who had a much larger apartment in the same building on the 32nd floor, specialized in getting one-of-a-kind pieces of jewelry for the world's rich and beautiful.\n\nMurray Weiss: I grew up in the same town with -- Jeffrey Rackover. We grew up a block apart. And while we weren't close, our families knew each other.\n\nMurray Weiss: \u2026he not only cultivated becoming a jeweler to the stars, he wanted to be among them. \u2026He was friends with Jerry Jones \u2026 the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. He came to know Oprah. His apartment has photographs of himself with all these personalities.\n\nJames Rackover enjoyed the good life. He was an aspiring model working in the insurance business, loved boxing and even had a boxer named \"Gloves.\"\n\nMurray Weiss: I think Joey \u2026 had an opportunity to go to a fancy part of New York City, into a fancy apartment. And he went along.\n\nAnd there were those three young ladies along for the ride: Jenna Stisi, Katie Conroy and Samantha Guardiola.\n\nBut all that mattered to Pat Comunale was finding his son. He had already filed a missing persons report with the Stamford Police, but also wanted to alert the New York City cops. So at 9 a.m. Monday morning -- some 25 hours since anyone reported seeing Joey -- Pat was at the 17th Police Precinct where he told NYPD Detective Yeoman Castro everything he knew.\n\nPat Comunale: Detective Castro -- I still remember sayin', \"Let's go to the building.\" And we jumped in the police car.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Grand Sutton, Detective Castro asked to view the building's surveillance video.\n\nPat Comunale: And then -- he starts reviewing video \u2026 they asked me a couple times to come in and to identify if that was my son. [Sobs] So we did.\n\nErin Moriarty: At some point, you see your son? [Pat sobbing] So sorry, Pat.\n\nPat Comunale was overcome when he spotted son Joey and Larry Dilione walking the three women out to the curb.\n\nErin Moriarty: But then what do you see?\n\n\n\nProsecution trial evidence\n\nPat Comunale: We see him come back into the building.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: So you see Larry Dilione and your son walking back in the building?\n\n\n\nPat Comunale: Right, right.\n\nErin Moriarty: And what did that say to you?\n\nPat Comunale: They're lying. There's a problem here.\n\nRemember, Larry Dilione had said Joey did not go back inside the building. It was all too much for Pat. Detective Castro asked him to wait at the 17th Police Precinct.\n\nPat Comunale: So as I went outside to make phone calls, the porter started to bring garbage out. And I ran back inside and I said to the police, \"Don't let the garbage go. Make sure you search all the bags\" ... I just kinda had that sense that if these guys are lying, there could be something in the garbage.\n\nEvidence photo\n\nSadly, he was right. Inside those bags police discovered Joey's bloody pants, his shirt and his driver's license. Also tossed in the trash, a special chain Joey always wore given to him by his father.\n\nPat Comunale: I said to myself, \"I don't think he walked outta the building alive.\"\n\nA FATAL ARGUMENT\n\nFourteen hours after Joey Comunale and Larry Dilione were seen on video walking those women to their Uber, surveillance cameras caught James Rackover taking his father's Mercedes Benz for a drive. With the help of NYPD's network of cameras, detectives were able to track some of his movements.\n\nMurray Weiss: They quickly put in Rackover's Mercedes Benz license plate\u2026 and, bing, bing, bing, it started showin' up goin' down the FDR Drive \u2026 The car went south around southern Manhattan. It then made a turn into the Holland Tunnel that led out to New Jersey.\n\nBut detectives could not pinpoint precisely where the car eventually stopped. They needed a break and they soon got it from Larry Dilione.\n\nMurray Weiss: He agreed to meet with them \u2026 And they sensed that there was something that he wanted to say. \u2026and so the detectives said to him \u2026\"What do you wanna tell us? We have a missing boy here. His family, you know \u2026 wants to know what happened to him.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Dilione began talking. The party at the apartment in the wee early hours of Sunday morning had been lively, he said. One of the women videotaped some of it on her phone. There was cocaine and plenty of drinking. Dilione and James Rackover even competed to see who could give the best lap dance. But by 6:45 a.m., the women left in that Uber. And that's when cameras captured Dilione and Joey walking back into the building and up to apartment 4C, where, Dilione says, a fatal argument erupted.\n\nMurray Weiss: Larry Dilione tells the police \u2026 he has an exchange of words with Joey Comunale, that Joey Comunale says something like, \"James got the cocaine. You know, I got the cigarettes. What have you brought to the table?\" and kinda pounded his hand on a table. \u2026And Larry Dilione admitted to the police that he just flew into a rage and slammed Joey \u2026 knocked him down, and hit him a few times.\n\nDilione says when he began punching Joey, his friend Max Gemma was asleep on the couch. Then, Dilione said James Rackover, a boxing fan who took pride in his chiseled physique, jumped right in.\n\nBob Abrams: According to Larry, James starts also beatin' the crap out of Joey who's now defenseless and gurgling because he can't hardly breathe.\n\nComunale lawyer Bob Abrams has heard Dilione's confession.\n\nBob Abrams: He claims that after he had beaten a defenseless Joey and almost killed him \u2026 Max woke up -- they got so very nervous because Rackover was now beatin' the crap out of Joey, that they would do anything Rackover said. \u2026and this is really difficult for me to talk about, because what they did and how they did it is just so horrific.\n\nDilione says he told Gemma to leave and that's when Dilione says James Rackover began stabbing Joey.\n\nThe stabbing ended Joey's life. Dilione says Gemma left the apartment and had no involvement in the murder. He says James Rackover then dragged Joey's lifeless body into the bathroom.\n\nMurray Weiss: \u2026he tries to dismember him with a serrated knife \u2026 Dismembering somebody is not an easy thing to do.\n\nAnd James Rackover was not able to do it. While they plotted their next move, they began a frenzied cleanup of the apartment, mopping up Joey's blood with bleach and paper towels -- all the while fielding calls from Joey's friends -- and even his father.\n\nErin Moriarty: You're talking to Larry Dilione \u2026And your son's still in the apartment. And they act like there's nothing wrong.\n\nPat Comunale: Yeah.\n\nCBS News\n\nIncredibly, evidence shows that James Rackover and Dilione took time out to eat -- placing a delivery order. Then, as shown on building surveillance cameras, they explored the basement looking, police say, for a way to get Joey's body out of the Grand Sutton without being seen. Then, they had another idea.\n\nMurray Weiss: What they do next is totally insane.\n\nAs darkness settled on the city, Dilione claimed he moved Joey's body -- now wrapped in a comforter -- to the ledge of James Rackover's fourth floor window while James moved the Mercedes Benz into position on East 59th Street.\n\nBob Abrams: When Rackover gave him the clear sign, Dilione pushed the body-- outta the window four floors.\n\nErin Moriarty: And nobody saw it? We're talking about a upscale apartment, midtown Manhattan and nobody saw it?\n\nBob Abrams: The Grand Sutton faces \u2026 the Queensboro Bridge in Manhattan \u2026 and it was dark. \u2026It fell into an area where there may have been some bushes \u2026 and concrete and then when nobody was looking, after Dilione came back down, they stuffed the body into the trunk of the car and then they drove off.\n\nMurray Weiss: Larry had told them that they had driven the body down to Oceanport, New Jersey, and that they had deposited him in a wooded area behind a florist shop.\n\nIt was an area that Dilione was very familiar with. He grew up in Oceanport, a Jersey shore town some 60 miles from Manhattan.\n\nBob Abrams: \u2026he admits to helping take the body and to participate in \u2026 digging -- I don't wanna call it a grave because it's not a grave -- a hole, and then dumping Joey's body in a hole.\n\nBob Abrams: But right before they were gonna cover up the hole, James Rackover took gasoline and started to pour it over Joey's body and, in fact, did light Joey's body on fire.\n\nAfter Dilione's confession, police raced out to Oceanport and discovered Joey's burned body in a field behind the florist shop, exactly where Dilione had said it would be.\n\nTwo hours later, Sgt. Yeoman Castro arrived at Pat Comunale's home in Stamford.\n\nPat Comunale: You heard a car door close. And I popped up. And I saw Detective -- Castro. [Sobs, then sighs] I already knew. Yeah. That was it.\n\nCBS New York\n\nJames Rackover and Larry Dilione were arrested and charged with second-degree murder.\n\nMax Gemma, who Dilione insists had nothing to do with Joey's death, was arrested later but he was not charged with murder. He was charged with hindering prosecution and tampering with physical evidence. Gemma was granted bail.\n\nCBS New York\n\nAll three men pleaded \"not guilty\" -- even Larry Dilione. He challenged his confession, saying police had ignored him when he informed them he had a lawyer.\n\nBut the biggest shock was yet to come when it was revealed that James Rackover -- who seemed to live a charmed life\u2014was not who he claimed to be.\n\nErin Moriarty: James Rackover isn't really James Rackover, is he?\n\nMurray Weiss: No.\n\nWHO IS JAMES RACKOVER?\n\nElisa Libretto: It just seemed like there was always more to learn about James, more terrible things.\n\nTo the outside world, James Rackover was a wealthy young heir and would-be model living in the lap of luxury on Sutton Place. But the man that Larry Dilione claims is the ringleader in Joseph Comunale's vicious murder is not all what he appears to be.\n\nMurray Weiss: James Rackover was not his real name.\n\nDetectives discovered James Rackover was not the son of celebrity jeweler Jeffrey Rackover. He's an ex-con from Florida -- a world away from the understated wealth of Sutton Place.\n\nAnd James Beaudoin has a rap sheet dating back to his teens.\n\nHe spent nearly a year-and-a-half in prison for second-degree burglary. Three months after his release, in September 2013 after moving to New York, he reportedly met Jeffrey Rackover at a gym.\n\nMurray Weiss: They were working out and they kinda hit it off.\n\nBen Rosser / BFA / Shutterstock\n\nSurprisingly, the multimillionaire bachelor, then in his mid-50s, soon invited the 22-year- old James to live with him in his lavish Grand Sutton apartment on the 32nd floor. And if anyone asked why the two were suddenly living together, Jeffrey Rackover explained it this way.\n\nMurray Weiss: Jeffrey Rackover told his closest friends and \u2026 relatives that one day there was a knock on his door and a young man was standing at the door and said, \"You don't know me, but I'm your son.\"\n\nJeffrey Rackover even took the extraordinary step of allowing James to change his last name to Rackover. James claimed he was Jeffrey's biological son.\n\nErin Moriarty: These are the documents for the name change. \u2026they put this in a legal document \u2026 James Rackover said \u2026 Jeffrey Rackover is his biological father. \u2026He lied in this document, didn't he?\n\nBob Abrams: James lied in that document. And Jeffrey Rackover confirmed the information.\n\nComunale family attorney Bob Abrams says it was all an act.\n\nErin Moriarty: They're not related.\n\n\n\nBob Abrams: They are not related.\n\nAbrams alleges there was a sexual relationship between the two, but Jeffrey Rackover's lawyer categorically denies it. What's more, James Rackover's defense attorneys, Rob Caliendo and Maurice Sercarz, say they've only seen a father-son relationship.\n\nMaurice Sercarz: Jeffrey Rackover, provided structure in the life of this young man.\n\nJeffrey Rackover paid for James' education and helped him find a job. He even paid James' nearly $4,000-a-month rent when, in early 2016, James moved into apartment 4C at the Grand Sutton. After James was arrested for Joey Comunale's murder, Jeffrey Rackover paid, at least initially, for James' defense attorney.\n\nErin Moriarty: What does James Rackover face if he's convicted of all charges?\n\nMaurice Sercarz: He faces spending the rest of his life in jail.\n\nCharged with second-degree murder and other crimes, James Rackover is set to stand trial first, before Larry Dilione and Max Gemma. Sercarz has a unique strategy; he says James is guilty of covering up a murder but not of committing one.\n\nErin Moriarty: You are asking this jury to separate the murder from other pretty terrible acts. \u2026 tryin' to cut up the body. Getting rid of the body. Burying the body. Burning the body.\n\nRob Caliendo: It is tough, but -- but they are separate things.\n\nThey say it was Larry Dilione who killed Joey. Just a few weeks ago, two years after Joey Comunale's murder, James Rackover's trial began.\n\nBut Jeffrey Rackover, James' biggest supporter and surrogate father, did not appear in the courtroom.\n\nIt was a much different scene for Joey, whose family and friends packed the courtroom every day.\n\nErin Moriarty: What's been the worst part?\n\n\n\nPat Comunale: Everyday \u2026 it's everyday. [Emotional]\n\nPat Comunale was the first witness and his emotional testimony quieted the courtroom.\n\n\n\nMaurice Sercarz: I know it affected the jury. It affects the jury in any murder case.\n\nProsecutors painted James Rackover as a \"monstrously callous\" killer, playing this phone call\u2014recorded in jail\u2014where he brags to a friend:\n\nJAMES RACKOVER JAIL PHONE CALL : I don't know if you've been following this sh-t but I start trial September. So I'm looking at being home around October-ish \u2026 my rep's gonna be up there bro, like my \u2026 when I hit the street. They're gonna be like, \"Yo, this kid just f---ing beat this sh-t like Rocky? And he's home, oh my God!\"\n\nProsecutors called to the stand women who attended that party -- Jenna Stisi and Katie Conroy, but parts of their testimoney helped the defense. Conroy, in particular, said Dilione was the one brandishing a knife.\n\nRob Caliendo: \u2026he was using it to do coke off of \u2026 the women-- painted a picture of him being pretty quick to use this knife for any variety of tasks.\n\nJames Rackover's defense lawyers also point out that he had nothing to gain and everything to lose by killing Joey.\n\nMaurice Sercarz: James knew that if Jeffrey ever found out that a dead body had been discovered in his apartment, that was the end of their relationship. And that had to be factored into account as well, when you consider why James felt so compelled to get that body out of the apartment.\n\nAfter more than a week of testimony, prosecutors had a strong case proving the cover-up but there was nothing that directly pointed to James Rackover as Joey's killer. They seemed to need something or someone more.\n\nMurray Weiss: And sure enough, they announced that they had a star witness who was gonna take the stand.\n\nDAMAGING TESTIMONY\n\nProsecutors hoped to seal James Rackover's conviction by unleashing an 11th hour witness: Louis Ruggiero, a close friend of James Rackover.\n\nMurray Weiss: The new witness turned out to be the troubled son of a very, very popular New York television morning anchor woman named Rosanna Scotto.\n\nPopular and well connected, Rosanna Scotto is as hometown as New York gets, and her 24- year-old son told the court that he met James because of his mother's friendship with jeweler Jeffrey Rackover. The day after Joey Comunale's murder, Ruggiero said he was working out at the gym when James called him, desperate to talk.\n\nMurray Weiss: Louis testified that James looked strung out. He had bags under his eyes.\n\nMurray Weiss: And he said that James told him, \"I've done something awful.\" \u2026There was a kid in the apartment. Lawrence Dilione got into a fight with him. Kinda knocked him out. And then James says, \"I got my own licks in there. And I didn't want a dead body in my apartment. So I slit his throat.\"\n\nMurray Weiss: \"We then put him in a comforter, threw him out the window. Drove him 60 miles and buried him in a grave.\" And then he adds, \"Don't worry about it because I bleach cleaned the entire apartment and nobody'll know about it.\"\n\nRuggiero testified he thought James was just making a sick joke. But the reaction in the courtroom was very different.\n\nMurray Weiss: Gasps came out of half of the room that was filled with Joey's family and friends \u2026 you could see the jurors actually recoil when he used the word, \"I slit his throat.\"\n\nIt was a stunning moment because Ruggiero was the first witness who directly implicated James Rackover in Joey Comunale's murder.\n\nMaurice Sercarz: The testimony by Mr. Ruggiero was very damaging.\n\nBut defense attorney Maurice Sercarz maintains that Ruggiero's testimony was riddled with factual errors.\n\nMaurice Sercarz: Ruggiero testified \u2026 that my client slit his throat. Joseph Comunale did not have his throat slit.\n\nSercarz stuck to his defense that Rackover is guilty of the cover-up but not the murder. On cross examination, the defense attacked Ruggiero.\n\nRobert Caliendo: He had a lot of issues \u2026 in the fall of 2016 \u2026 He was in the throes of as bad a drug problem as you could have.\n\nRuggiero admitted on the stand that he had been spending $1,200 a day on marijuana, OxyContin, Xanax and cocaine. He never called police to tell them about James' confession.\n\nRobert Caliendo: \u2026there were a number of reasons to think that Mr. Ruggiero might not be the person you wanna hang the hat of a murder conviction on.\n\nThe prosecution rested soon after Ruggiero's damaging testimony. The defense then presented only one piece of evidence: the ring reportedly worn by Larry Dilione when the fight broke out.\n\nDefense court evidence\n\nErin Moriarty: And why is that ring so important?\n\nRob Caliendo: The ring had a sizeable dent in it \u2026 And if you conclude that he hit Joseph so hard that he dented it \u2026 that's certainly -- is a fact that we would want the jury to consider \u2026 it certainly speaks to who -- might have committed murder and who might not have.\n\nIn his closing argument, Sercarz had one last surprise. He showed jurors 4 minutes of video where James could be seen in a building elevator and then in Jeffrey Rackover's bedroom where Jeffrey is sleeping. Sercarz argued that in those are 4 minutes when James was not in apartment 4C, Dilione alone killed Joey.\n\nMaurice Sercarz: Four minutes is plenty of time.\n\nBut prosecutors have a different theory that James was looking for cocaine in Jeffrey Rackover's bedroom, didn't find any, and the fight broke out when he returned to apartment 4C empty-handed.\n\nAfter 10 days of witness testimony and evidence, the jury got the case.\n\nPat Comunale: Just gotta get justice\u2026that's really it. Now it's a waiting game.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 2, after nearly 5 hours of deliberations, the jury announced it had reached a verdict.\n\nThe former James Beaudoin of Florida, now James Rackover from New York, was convicted on all counts for the murder of Joey Comunale. The verdict was greeted with relief and tears.\n\nWCBS\n\nPat Comunale [to reporters]: I want to thank the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. I couldn't be more proud of the NYPD \u2026 And all Joey's friends and everybody else who supported us over the last two years \u2026I can't wait to get these other two sons of bitches to go down, just like this a--hole. Pardon my language.\n\nLarry Dilione's trial is set for January and Max Gemma will be tried later. Joey's dad is still upset that Gemma has not been charged with Joey's murder.\n\nPat Comunale: \u2026he was there. \u2026And then ran home like a coward and didn't do anything.\n\nThose who knew Joey best, like girlfriend Elisa Libretto, are left with their memories.\n\nElisa Libretto: I definitely thought I was gonna marry him one day. \u2026He was just a beautiful person inside and out. My life without him has been crazy.\n\nJoey's mother Lisa can barely speak about her only son.\n\nErin Moriarty: What do you think when you take a look at Joey?\n\nLisa Comunale: I just miss him every day [cries].\n\nAs a way of remembering Joey, some of his friends got tattoos with the number 9, which is the number Joey always wore when he played sports.\n\nBut, of course, Pat Comunale just had to get the most elaborate tattoo.\n\nPat Comunale\n\nPat Comunale [rolls up his sleeve]: I do have one. \u2026It's pretty big.\n\nErin Moriarty: So your son's always gonna be with you.\n\nPat Comunale: Yeah (teary)\u2026I said, \"You better make sure it looks just like him\" and it does.\n\nPat Comunale: Honestly, I never saw the kid cry (sobs). Never one time. Ironic. I'm makin' up for it. \u2026 He was a special kid. He really was.\n\nJames Rackover will be sentenced on December 5.\n\nJeffrey Rackover has cut ties to James Rackover and he has moved out of the Grand Sutton."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "What Happened in Apartment 4C?", "description": "When a man goes missing, his friends turn to social media to track his final hours.

Brent Taylor, 39, was killed Nov. 3 in an attack by one of the Afghan commandos he was training, military officials said.\n\nTaylor was a deeply patriotic man who was committed to training commandos as part of an effort to build the capacity of the Afghan national army, Utah Army National Guard Maj. Gen. Jefferson Burton said at the service inside an events center in the northern Utah city of Ogden.\n\n\"He was completely committed to going and doing this job,\" Burton said. \"He truly loved the Afghan people and wanted to help them so they could build capacity in themselves and as a nation to be able to stand on their own.\"\n\nTaylor's casket was draped in an American flag and sat in front of a stage where his father, a local leader with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, led the services.\n\nThe choir sang \"America the Beautiful\" as the opening hymn and \"Born to be a Soldier\" to close in a nod to the service's focus on Taylor's love of country and commitment to sacrifice.\n\nHis wife, Jennie, didn't speak but has previously said the family felt \"heartache but no regret\" because Taylor was trying to bring freedom to others.\n\nJennie Taylor told CBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV her late-husband's sacrifice represents more than their family, it's a moment for Americans to reflect.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for Americans to pause and reflect on how blessed we are, how fortunate we are and the little things we take for granted and remember what matters most,\" Jennie Taylor said.\n\nJennie Taylor said the popular saying \"freedom isn't free\" might be cliche, but for her, it rings true.\n\n\"Freedom isn't free but it's worth it and i hope that everyone who hears of this story, or has a fallen soldier, that all of us can feel we are part of something so much more,\" Jennie Taylor told KUTV. \"My biggest message, I think Brent's biggest message, is we all try and do our part. Some gave all but all could give some.\"\n\nBesides his wife, Taylor leaves behind their seven children, ranging from 11 months to 13 years old.\n\nThe memorial service capped off several days of events to honor Taylor.\n\nHundreds of soldiers saluted Taylor's flag-covered casket Wednesday as his remains returned to a National Guard base in Salt Lake City. A couple hundred motorcycle riders carrying American flags followed the hearse north to Taylor's hometown of North Ogden in a procession.\n\nOn Friday, a National Guard member stood guard over his casket during an all-night vigil at a mortuary.\n\nMatt Herp/Standard-Examiner, via, Pool)\n\nTaylor had taken yearlong leave of absence as the mayor of North Ogden to go on his second tour to Afghanistan. Taylor, a military intelligence officer with Joint Force Headquarters, also had served two tours in Iraq.\n\nYounger brother Derek Taylor said Brent had a knack for bridging gaps and finding resolutions among people with different views - a talent he developed at the family home where fights and disagreements were frequent. He said his brother always ended their phone conversations with \"Love ya, Derek.\"\n\nHe said his brother was blessed with \"three Cs,\" - commitment, confidence and compassion - and those were the driving force behind everything he accomplished.\n\n\"As a brother, Brent was as good as they come,\" Derek Taylor said. \"He was the best of all of us.\"\n\nToby Mileski, a friend and former mayor of Pleasant View, a town neighboring North Ogden, remembered Taylor for his love of eating, his penchant for always running late and his good sense of humor.\n\n\"We were always laughing - always - and that's one thing I'm really going to miss,\" Mileski said, later adding, \"Jennie, kids, your dad was a warrior, a patriot and a super person.

Tear gas and explosives went off as the crowd marched through the streets chanting \"Nazis, go home!\" Police in riot gear arrived in various locations to keep the demonstrators on the sidewalks, KOIN reports.\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America on Portland held the first rally, which started around 11:30 a.m. Portland DSA tweeted they stand \"with survivors and against oppressors. Fascists out of our city!\"\n\nThey marched to Chapman Square, where they met up with the group Popular Mobilizations for a rally called #SupportersAreEverywhere, according to the Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\nThese rallies ended around 1:30 p.m., while antifa supporters in their hoodies and black masks plus hundreds of others lingered along the sidewalks as the police repeatedly made loudspeaker announcements, KOIN reports.\n\nThese protests were meant to counter the rally scheduled for 2 p.m. across the street at Terry Schrunk Plaza called #HimToo, led by activists from the far-right group Patriot Prayer.\n\nAt the #HimToo gathering, Joey Gibson and his Patriot Prayer acolyte Tusitala \"Tiny\" Toese spoke and danced.

Speaker Christopher Foster urged people to \"join us in the fight for rights for men and accountability for women.\"\n\nAnother speaker with a Southern accent told KOIN he drove all the way from Arkansas to speak at the #HimToo rally. While he said he did not prepare a speech, he railed against the \"Democratic women cabal\" and defended Roy Moore.\n\nSaturday's protests were just three days after an ordinance aimed at regulating protests was shot down by the Portland City Council.
