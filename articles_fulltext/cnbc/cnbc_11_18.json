Now 16 universities host arts-business incubators, the oldest of which include Arizona State University and the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Another 16 schools have competitions where students compete for start-up funding, and a dozen more have artist-in-residence or business coaching programs, according to a December 2016 study Essig led.\n\n\"After the recession a lot of arts programs said we have to make sure students can navigate the economy as well as the studio,\" said Essig, who claims a higher percentage of arts grads work in their field than do accounting majors. \"Students today will have on average 11 careers.

In his new book \"WTF?!\" (which stands for Willing to Fail) he outlines some of his biggest failures, and his biggest lessons along the way.

The win by Cisneros, a Navy veteran and philanthropist who is taking over the seat vacated by retiring Republican Rep. Ed Royce, flips the district from red to blue, and means that Congressional Republicans will be shut out of Orange County for the first time since the Great Depression.\n\nCisneros won a $266 million lottery jackpot in 2010, and used some of that bounty to vastly outspend his Republican challenger, essentially financing his own campaign. The race for the 39th was one of the most expensive House races in the country, with Cisneros spending about $9.7 million \u2014 including $8 million of his own money \u2014 and Kim spending nearly $1.9 million.\n\nKim conceded the race Saturday, tweeting that she called Cisneros to congratulate him and offering him best wishes in Congress.\n\nBesides Orange County, the district includes eastern Los Angeles County and southwestern San Bernardino County.

In a debate in October, Kim expressed support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects people brought illegally to the U.S. as children from deportation and also provides them work authorization.

The perpetrator was sentenced to two years for the attack.\n\nIn 2007, the country of Estonia was subject to widespread outages in its entire telecommunications network, following a cyberattack stemming from a dispute with Russia over a military statue. The incident was so damaging, it led to a decision to place the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Cyber Security organization in Tallinn, the country's capital.\n\nIn 2015, Ukraine's power grid had massive outages after a cyberattack \u2014 which some officials have attributed to Russia \u2014 two days before Christmas, during a cold snap. Around a quarter-million residents were left without power, but the outages only lasted a few hours before government agencies were able to restore service.\n\nMajor cyberattacks aimed at taking down official services don't need to be strictly nation-state sponsored or terrorist-backed. They can be strictly criminal in nature, or come from a malevolent backer under the guise of a criminal attack.\n\nThe NotPetya cyberattacks of June 2017, known by the name of the criminal ransomware-inspired computer virus behind it, were notorious for the real-world harm they caused to companies. In Germany, consumer goods-maker Reckitt Benckiser halted shipments of numerous products. Ships belonging to logistics giant Maersk were at a standstill, and the company later said it took a $300 million hit from the attack. In the U.S., a facility owned by Merck that makes the HPV vaccine Gardasil was shut down to such a big extent, the company had to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars worth of back-up vaccines stockpiled by the Center for Disease Control.\n\nPower outages or water supply corruption are the most worrisome to Peter Beshar, general counsel for risk management firm Marsh & McLennan. Loss of electricity, he said, is just one piece of the greater risk for physical security stemming from a cyberattack.\n\n\"Utilities are one vital resource. But it's not just power, water is another type of utility.

The Trump administration should make a credible determination of responsibility before MbS executes the men who apparently carried out his orders,\" tweeted Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Saturday.\n\nTrump and top administration officials have said Saudi Arabia should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their role in the killing.\n\nBut they have also stressed the importance of Washington's ties with Riyadh, one of the biggest clients of the U.S. defense industry. Trump wants to preserve the Saudi arms deals, despite growing opposition in Congress.\n\n\"They have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,\" Trump said. \"As president, I have to take a lot of things into consideration.\"\n\nMarine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted on Saturday that the kingdom plays a key military role for the United States in the Middle East.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia has been an important partner to regional security in the past. I expect they will be in the future,\" he said at a security forum in Halifax, adding Middle Eastern allies including Saudi Arabia are \"a stabilizing force in the region.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said he was seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nThe prosecutor, Shaalan al-Shaalan, told reporters the crown prince knew nothing of the operation, in which Khashoggi's body was dismembered and removed from the consulate. Saudi officials have said a team of 15 Saudi nationals were sent to confront Khashoggi and he was accidentally killed in a chokehold by men who were trying to force him to return to the kingdom. Lawmakers critical of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's killing and its role in Yemen's civil war are ramping up their efforts to clamp down on the country.\n\n\"Trump must accept (for once) his intelligence experts' incontrovertible conclusion: Crown Prince MBS is culpable for Khashoggi's monstrous murder. This brazen killing must have consequences - sanctions, prosecution, removal of MBS & others, not continued cover-up, enabled by Trump,\" tweeted Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal on Saturday."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Spriha Srivastava", "title": "British PM May says changing leadership will delay Brexit", "description": "British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that the number of letters required to trigger a no-confidence vote in the Parliament had not been met.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/18/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-on-brexit.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/15/105575963-1542269439054gettyimages-1061486868.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T10:40:00Z", "content": "If 48 Conservative MPs (Members of Parliament) back a no-confidence vote, there will be a leadership contest and the prime minister would need more than 50 percent of the vote to stay in office.
