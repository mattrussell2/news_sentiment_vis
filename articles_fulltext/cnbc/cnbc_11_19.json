The same point was made Friday by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who told CNBC that the global economy deserves attention, and it looks like it's slowing.\n\n\"There's a bit of a walk back in progress,\" said Don Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas Research. \"I'm sure they're looking at financial conditions.\"\n\nThe market's interpretation of the recent comments is in sharp contract to the response to Powell's Oct. 3 commentthat the Fed is still a long way from neutral. That comment was interpreted to mean the Fed was confidently moving forward with the rate hikes it has already forecast for 2019, and possibly adding more.\n\nNow, the markets still expect the Fed to go through with a rate hike at its December meeting, but the three more hikes anticipated for next year are in doubt.\n\nJon Hill, U.S. rate strategist at BMO, said since Nov. 9, the fed funds futures market has reduced its expectations for rate hikes next year to just 1.4 hikes from 2.2.\n\n\"\"Clarida sounds a bit more dovish, but he didn't say anything remarkable,\" said Hill. \"To price out almost an entire hike in a week just because [they] acknowledge overseas matters seems a bit too aggressive.\"\n\nHill said New York Fed President John Williams comments Monday that the Fed was raising rates \"somewhat\" also sounded a bit more dovish. Williams added that it's \"really in the context of a very strong economy and obviously we're not on a preset course,\" according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nFinancial conditions are clearly worsening, with the S&P 500 down 9.5 percent since the end of September, and the spreads on corporate credit widening, meaning the market is pricing it at increasingly lower prices [and higher yields], relative to Treasurys. Prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nAt the same time, investors are jumping into the safety of Treasurys, driving interest rates lower. The 10-year is now yielding 3.03 percent, the lowest since Oct. 3, the day Powell made his hawkish comments.\n\nRissmiller has been forecasting the Fed will only be able to raise interest rates twice next year, as some others also expect. He said the neutral rate, or the interest rate level where the Fed is no longer stimulating the economy or trying to slow it down, is probably closer to 2.5 percent. The Fed funds target range is currently at 2 percent to 2.25 percent.\n\n\"I just don't see the rush. Why snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. They are succeeding here. They can remain in a rate hike cycle,\" said Rissmiller.\n\nBut on the other extreme, Goldman Sachs economists expect the Fed to raise interest rates four times next year, and they note that inflation could jump more than expected."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Lauren Hirsch", "title": "This holiday season, there's no room for error for these five retailers", "description": "Holiday sales will be crucial for these five retailers.

It raises the question of whether popular culture is overly romanticizing the stark realities of outer space \u2014 and all that's involved in living off Earth.\n\nEnter \"MARS,\" an ambitious National Geographic series that explores the idea of terraforming the red planet. Now in its second season, the show underscores the often grim challenges faced by a fictional team of astronauts charged with the responsibility of developing a functioning colony on Mars. By all indications, it's hardly a vacation in Las Vegas or the Caribbean.\n\nNatGeo's project utilizes a hybrid storytelling format that fuses fiction and documentary-style segments, with the fictional narrative interspersed with interviews from real-life scientists, astronauts and sci-fi enthusiasts. In some ways, \"MARS\" can be seen as a version of MTV's \"The Real World\" \u2014 inviting the audience to imagine what happens when astronauts stop being polite, and start getting real.\n\nAt least for the moment, the show lacks the cultural import of something like \"Star Trek,\" with its popular if not debatable trope involving the low-level crew member \u2014 usually clad in a red uniform \u2014 who dies before the opening credits even begin rolling.\n\nHowever, \"MARS\" successfully drives home a bleak concept that arguably gets lost in the excitement over the next phase of space exploration: It won't be easy, and space isn't filled with glittering metropolises, massive spaceships and friendly aliens. In fact, the hazards that await are likely to kill at least some of outer space's first pioneers.\n\n\"The mission to terraform a virgin planet comes with heavy adjustments, including how humans [will] cope with contamination, illness, death, natural disasters and even the first Martian baby,\" a synopsis of the second season of \"MARS\" reads.\n\nTo be certain, modern-day science fiction is suffused with lots of cautionary tales of what can go wrong with space exploration, and what occurs when technology and human nature take a darker turn. For example, Netflix's \"Lost in Space\" reboot features a host of unknown dangers astronauts face on other planets (including toxic ecosystems and killer robots).\n\nThe negative implications of technology and space travel is enough to make Andy Weir \u2014 a sci-fi author who serves as a consultant for NatGeo's \"MARS\" and who wrote the best-selling \"The Martian\" \u2014 think society is bordering on \"technophobia.\"\n\nMuch of science fiction \"has been taken over by miserable, dystopian stuff,\" Weir told CNBC recently. \"There's very little science fiction going on nowadays that has a positive message or a happy world that you'd actually like to live in.\"\n\nWhile not outright apocalyptic, \"MARS\" shows the underbelly of colonizing another planet, and all that can go awry when humanity is faced with the unknown, and high tech is thrown in the mix. For his part, Weir acknowledged the downsides of technology, but insisted that \"I don't think that's how technology ends up working.\"\n\nHe cited instances in the development of medicine, energy and other areas where \"the positive applications, in practice, dramatically outweigh the negative applications.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Kate Rooney", "title": "Payments company Square drops 10 percent amid a broader sell-off in once-loved technology stocks", "description": "Shares of payments company Square dropped\u00a0 as much as 10 percent Monday as the rest of tech stocks struggled to find footing.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/payments-company-square-drops-10-percent-amidst-a-broader-tech-sell-off.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/05/103610573-GettyImages-520557810.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:00:00Z", "content": "Shares of payments company Square dropped 10 percent Monday as major tech stocks struggled to find footing. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; Square 's stock fell 10 percent to roughly $63 after, bringing its one-month losses to 14 percent.

She was living with her mom, and at one point in time she remembers looking in her bank account and seeing just $12. That, she says, \"was a good day. A positive bank account was rare.\"\n\nTo cover the cost of taking the course at Stanford, Hamilton spoke out on social media and was nominated for scholarship. Her vocal presence on Twitter caught the attention of people like Twitter, Uber and Instagram investor Chris Sacca, who helped her raise the rest of the funds she needed to get to California.\n\nAt Stanford she'd meet classmates and mentors who were millionaires and return each night to an Airbnb, unable to afford dinner. But the connections she made through the course would prove to be invaluable.\n\nFor months following the Stanford course, Hamilton stayed in San Francisco. Her savings dried up quickly, and when they did, she slept at the airport. \"My mom actually would send me money like $10 at a time when she could put it together,\" Hamilton says of the days she spent sleeping at the airport. \"She didn't have anything for me. And you know that probably the worst part was having her, you know, see me like that.\"\n\nHamilton would travel across Silicon Valley each day to meet with investors, founders and experts to talk about her vision, learn about the industry and build relationships with entrepreneurs she hoped to one day invest in. \"I'd wake up every day and take a train either to Silicon Valley for meetings or up to San Francisco for meetings, and people were none the wiser.\"\n\nOccasionally, Hamilton would borrow money from a family member in order to get a hotel room to \"pull myself together for a night and feel human.\" One Silicon Valley connection she made was with Sam Altman, president of seed accelerator Y Combinator. Hamilton used LinkedIn to connect with his brother, Jack Altman, who forwarded her pitch along. Sam Altman didn't invest in Backstage, but he did give Hamilton a loan.

He was provocative, outspoken.\"\n\nGhosn's arrest by Japanese police in Tokyo on Monday shocked the auto world. He's been accused of underreporting his income to Japanese regulators and misusing company funds, Nissan and Mitsubishi both said.\n\nNissan executives said Monday that they will seek Ghosn's removal from his roles as chairman of Nissan and as chairman and CEO of the alliance. Mitsubishi said it plans to also remove him from its board.\n\nThe allegations of misconduct could bring Ghosn's career to an abrupt end, closing a chapter in an industry he played such a significant role in reshaping.\n\n\"He was an asset in navigating globalized markets and that has been so hard for the industry to adapt to,\" said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of data strategy for Edmunds, which provides information on cars and the auto industry. \"Then you factor in Nissan's woes here in the U.S., they can definitely use a dose of his bold decision-making and nose for the future. So really this is coming at a terrible time.\"\n\nGhosn was known for his larger-than-life personality and for his tireless work schedule shuttling across the world to manage several automotive businesses across different continents. He was also credited with having a global vision and the ability to see possibilities other executives missed.\n\nMany people thought the 1999 strategic alliance between French automaker Renault and Japanese company Nissan, a deal he engineered, was preposterous and doomed to fail.\n\n\"I said it would never work\" former General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Monday \"and to my amazement it has worked fabulously well for both companies.\"\n\nTurning around Nissan made Ghosn something of a hero in Japan: there have been dishes at restaurants named after him and a Japanese comic book about his life.\n\n\"If you have not been a villain at a certain point in time, you will never be a hero,\" he said when asked about the book. \"And the day you are a hero, you may become a villain the next day.\"\n\nHe was also known for his bold bet on electric vehicles, exemplified by Nissan's low-cost and well-known electric Leaf sedan. In 2017, he said he thought Nissan was probably the only automaker that was making money off the fledgling powertrain technology.\n\nGhosn's personality, work ethic and preference for swift-direct action has earned him comparisons to the late Fiat-Chrysler CEO Marchionne. The chain-smoking, espresso swilling and blunt-tongued executive unexpectedly died earlier this year, sending shockwaves through the industry.\n\nWhile there are some differences between the two executives, they both shared a few common traits.\n\n\"You have these firebrands that are at the helm, and their tenures have been marked by really bold decision-making, and it has come bundled with really big personalities,\" Acevedo said.\n\nLike Ghosn, Marchionne was known for being a tirelessly hard worker who slept on flights from one office to another. He also had to intregrate auto brands that spanned continents and entirely different cultures. As Ghosn is credited with breathing new life into Renault and Nissan, Marchionne was credited with saving Chrysler after the company declared bankruptcy during the financial crisis in 2009.\n\n\"There are shades of Marchionne here,\" Krebs said.\n\n\"We have lost the two most provocative, vocal, big personality individuals in the auto industry, apart from Elon Musk, who still has to prove himself,\" she said. \"They don't make them like that anymore.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Carmin Chappell", "title": "Michelle Obama's memoir is Barnes & Noble's fastest-selling book of 2018, beating Woodward's 'Fear'", "description": "In addition to being this year's fastest seller, Barnes & Noble also announced that \"Becoming\" had the best first-week sales of any adult book since 2015's \"Go Set a Watchman,\" the highly anticipated second novel from \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" author Harper Lee.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/michelle-obamas-becoming-is-barnes--nobles-fastest-selling-book-of-2018.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/19/105582863-1542652343505rts25uhm.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:02:00Z", "content": "Former first lady Michelle Obama's memoir \"Becoming\" has become the fastest-selling book of 2018 at Barnes &amp; Noble, surpassing the Trump administration tell-all \"Fear: Trump in the White House\" by veteran journalist Bob Woodward. div &gt; div.group &gt; p\u2026 [+2050 chars]", "fulltext": "Former first lady Michelle Obama's memoir \"Becoming\" has become the fastest-selling book of 2018 at Barnes & Noble, surpassing the Trump administration tell-all \"Fear: Trump in the White House\" by veteran journalist Bob Woodward.\n\nIn addition to being this year's fastest seller, Barnes & Noble also announced that \"Becoming\" had the best first-week sales of any adult book since 2015's \"Go Set a Watchman,\" the highly anticipated second novel from \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" author Harper Lee.\n\nPublisher Penguin Random House announced that \"Becoming\" sold more than 725,000 copies on its first day of release last week, the highest single-day sales of any book by the publisher this year.\n\n\"Becoming\" chronicles Obama's path from a child growing up in the South Side of Chicago to her time as first lady of the United States.

That makes it a slanted process,\" says Szalai. \"I've seen cases in the past where companies with forced arbitration clauses have required employees [meet] harsh conditions, such as attending arbitration hearings held on the opposite end of the country, allowing only 30 days to bring a claim, charging expensive fees and capping damages at $5,000.\"\n\nIn arbitration, employers typically set the parameters, which means they can add such criteria and, also, limit the timeline of the case. For instance, in court, an employee's legal team could set up multiple depositions and make broad discovery requests, which can be crucial for supporting sexual harassment claims, says attorney Zachary Liszka, who specializes in sexual harassment and discrimination cases. In arbitration, employers can mandate no discovery and a single deposition.\n\nThey can also select the arbitrator deciding the dispute. Researchers who reviewed cases settled by the American Arbitration Association over an 11-year period found that employers who rely on the same arbitrator win more often and have lower damages awarded against them, likely because companies stick with arbitrators who've ruled in their favor in the past.\n\nDamage amounts determined by a federal or state court are also typically much larger than those awarded by an arbitrator, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\"One of the downfalls of arbitration is that you have the one experienced arbitrator deciding.

The order lasts for 14 days, multiple outlets reported.\n\nHours after that ruling, Sanders and communications chief Bill Shine sent Acosta a letter saying the Trump administration had come to a \"preliminary decision\" to once again revoke his press pass once the temporary court order expires. They gave Acosta the option to \"contest\" that initial decision, however, before they came to a \"final determination.\"\n\nIn a response Sunday, a lawyer for CNN rejected what it called the White House's \"attempt to provide retroactive due process,\" and warned that it will seek to depose the defendants, who include Trump, \"on their intentions and their conduct\" unless the administration halts its action against Acosta.\n\nShine and Sanders had cited Acosta's \"conduct\" at a presidential news conference a week earlier on Nov. 7. \"The President is aware of this preliminary decision and concurs,\" Shine and Sanders wrote.\n\nAt that presser, where Trump declared victory after the midterm elections, Acosta had disputed the president's use of the word \"invasion\" to describe a caravan of Central American migrants traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border. The exchange grew more heated as Acosta continued to ask follow-up questions, prompting a White House intern to try and grab the microphone from the reporter, who initially refused to let go of it.\n\nLater that day, Acosta announced that he had been barred from the White House grounds by the Secret Service.\n\nIn the lawsuit, CNN had argued that Acosta's rights under the First and Fifth amendments to the Constitution had been violated. The White House countered that it had \"broad discretion\" to remove Acosta's pass, and highlighted his \"decision to engage in conduct that disrupts press events and impedes other reporters from asking questions\" in its argument.\n\nAt the Friday hearing, Kelly granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order, ruling that the White House had indeed violated Acosta's due process rights.\n\nThe new rules press conference rules are as follows:\n\n1. A journalist called upon to ask a question will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists; 2. At the discretion of the President or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted; and where a follow up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor; 3. \"Yielding the floor\" includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to White House staff for use by the next questioner; 4. Failure to abide by any of rules 1-3 may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist's hard pass.\n\nSanders had teased the new requirements after Judge Kelly's ruling Friday. \"There must be decorum at the White House,\" she said at the time.\n\nIn their letter to Acosta sent Friday evening, Sanders and Shine said, \"We had not previously thought that a set of formal rules for journalists' behavior at press conferences was necessary.\" They listed \"basic, commonsense practices\" for journalists to follow, such as asking a single question and then yielding the floor unless a follow-up is permitted by the president or other White House staff.\n\nThey wrote that their preliminary decision would become \"final\" unless Acosta responded by 5 p.m. Sunday to contest the action, in which case they would issue a \"final determination\" by Monday at 3 p.m.\n\nA lawyer for CNN responded in an email to Justice Department lawyers Sunday, \"To say the least, the letter is a disappointing response to the court's decision and our attempts to resolve the matter amicably.\" CNN's response added that \"unless you can confirm to our satisfaction that no action will be taken against Mr. Acosta, we will seek expedited discovery, including depositions, from all defendants on their intentions and their conduct.\"\n\nIn an attached letter, CNN's lawyer rejected that there are tacit rules of conduct for White House reporters, and noted that other journalists at the Nov. 7 event had asked follow-up questions to Trump \"without consequence.\"\n\nTrump, in an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace that aired in part on Friday, said of the ruling that \"It's not a big deal and if he misbehaves, we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference.\"\n\nWATCH: Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "David Faber", "title": "Arconic buyout deal could be announced by mid-December, sources say", "description": "The aluminum products maker has been mulling offers and sources tell CNBC a deal is likely", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/arconic-buyout-deal-could-be-announced-by-mid-december-sources-say.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/01/31/104252834-GettyImages-632859564.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:44:00Z", "content": "Arconic could announce a deal on a leveraged buyout by mid-December, sources tell CNBC. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The aluminum products maker has been mulling offers, and the sources tell CNBC a deal is likely in a few weeks.

Failing to plan. Lacking a financial plan means you have no focus and you can easily be swayed. A recent study by the University of Scranton revealed that 92 percent of people who do not achieve their goal fail as a result of lack of planning. People who do not plan for how to manage their money and who lack a budget are vulnerable to impulse buying, overspending and making other unwise decisions. You may be earning a lot of money, but failure to plan will derail you from your set objectives.\n\nPrepare a budget that outlines every financial expense you have. Having a list will guide your actions and restrict those that are unfavorable. In case you make an inevitable decision that was not part of the budget, you will know about it and evaluate how to address it. The plan will also teach you accountability and point out areas where you are deviating. It will also indicate your progress or performance.\n\n2. Setting unrealistic goals. Most people have unsuitable goals for their financial journey to success. Their goals are either vague, too broad or exaggerated with no timeline. Setting unrealistic goals will demoralize you, especially in this era, where young people prefer duplicating celebrity lifestyles and lavish spending.\n\nToday young people below the age of 35 are living on a tight budget. They are called \"Generation Squeeze.\" They have low income and are under a prolonged economic crisis. They are in debt and struggling with school loans and family difficulties. Another aspect of unrealistic goals is setting standards that are too high, with inadequate time to achieve them.\n\nMore from FA Playbook:\n\nHow to control your reaction to market volatility\n\nUse an advisor? Here's how to save on taxes\n\n'Mini retirements' take some serious planning\n\nEvaluate where you are and your intended position financially. Set short-term goals to achieve a long-term objective. Small steps are more practical to achieve, and they motivate you to continue pursuing the ultimate target. Realistic goals entail specificity, a particular timeline and accuracy. Ensure that setting goals is a personal initiative; do not allow anyone to dictate or create the goals for you.\n\n3. Lacking financial literacy. Ignorance is a significant enemy of progress and, in this case, financial success. A large number of people lack financial literacy. They believe financial success is doing things that they have always planned to do; for example, living in the moment. Success has no specific approach; it is a combination of proven methods that you apply according to your personal situation.\n\nOpenness to experience is a personality characteristic associated with people who are interested in learning new things and engaging in creativity. Nevertheless, it does not mean people with other personality traits should not seek further information. Knowledge has never been irrelevant, and that applies to financial knowledge. Read books, watch the news and follow closely emerging and trending issues and practices in finances. Also, work with a financial advisor.\n\n4. Impatience. Pursuing success one day does not lead to success the next. Most people begin pursuing their financial goals with high confidence and motivation and are hell-bent on achieving them. But after a while, they may encounter unforeseen challenges and other difficulties that lead to impatience.\n\nThose who become impatient change their goals, which hinders their financial success. Behavioral economist Shlomo Benartzi discourages people from having financial market phone apps, because people who do often make quick and bad decisions when they receive continuous stock updates.\n\nFinancial success is a process that takes time. Make sure you make the journey with a financial planner. Create small milestones that you will achieve at a quicker pace. Every time you do so, it will encourage you to further pursue your ultimate goals. Cultivate a culture of patience."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Lauren Feiner", "title": "Tech won't redeem itself in 2019, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says", "description": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said his Silicon Valley peers are responsible for the problems their companies create during an MSNBC special called \"Revolution.\" In an interview with journalist Kara Swisher, Benioff said he thinks tech's problems will persist in\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/tech-wont-redeem-itself-in-2019-salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-says.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/11/18/104117450-20161117-4727-2300.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:55:00Z", "content": "The new year won't wipe the slate clean for tech companies, according to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; Benioff addressed issues facing Silicon Valley in a wide-ranging interview with journalist Kara Swisher that aired\u2026 [+1254 chars]", "fulltext": "\"I think that these problems are big,\" Benioff said on the \"Revolution\" special. \"I think that they are multistakeholder.
