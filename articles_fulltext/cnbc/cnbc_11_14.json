The Camp Fire was 35 percent contained early Wednesday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nDanko also represents a group of plaintiffs suing PG&E over the 2017 wine country fires, a group of Northern California blazes. Cal Fire has pinned the blame on PG&E in at least 16 wildfires in last year's fire siege, including some blazes with fatalities.\n\nAccording to Danko, other California utilities do a better job of \"mitigating the risk. For example, in Southern California when there are windy conditions, the utilities as a matter of routine for some time have shut off the power so that if the lines come down it won't spark a fire. That's something that PG&E never did until after the wine country fires.\"\n\nThe attorney claims PG&E sent out emails indicating it would shut off power before the Camp Fire but didn't do it. \"Their meteorologists were watching the conditions, and then they decided not to,\" he said. \"They decided to leave the power on.\"\n\nPG&E's Tostado said, \"The safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our highest priority. Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers.\"\n\nThe electrical outage that PG&E experienced in Butte County was to a 115kV transmission line and the damage observed near the fire was to a 115kV transmission line. The utility spokesperson said \"115kV transmission lines are not currently part of the Public Safety Power Shutoff program due to a variety of safety and regulatory factors.\"\n\nStill, Danko alleges that PG&E has \"nefarious\" reasons for keeping the power on.\n\n\"PG&E does not want to shut off power for the reason that management bonuses are tied not to safety, but rather the lack of customer complaints,\" Danko said. He said when the power is shut off to customers they complain so management is therefore hesitant to flip the power off.\n\nDanko said he plans to subpoena PG&E's witnesses and their documents to get even more information on the incident.\n\nEarlier this year, PG&E and its parent renewed liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for approximately $1.4 billion, covering the period from Aug. 1, 2018, through July 31, 2019.\n\nThe state legislature already has given PG&E some relief that allows them in the event of a wildfire to sell bonds to essentially pay for damages. That relief, known as state Senate Bill 901, was approved by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sept. 21 and followed the catastrophic wine country fires last year.\n\n\"If they file bankruptcy, so be it,\" said Danko. \"That means that ultimately their equipment is essentially auctioned off. Perhaps someone more responsible will end up operating the electric and gas facilities.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Tyler Clifford", "title": "'Crypto civil war' slams bitcoin, but it won't last, says BKCM's Brian Kelly", "description": "Bitcoin had been coasting in recent months on fairly low volatility until \"things exploded,\" says the cryptocurrency fund manager.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/bkcm-brian-kelly-crypto-civil-war-slams-bitcoin-but-not-for-long.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/10/09/105496652-1539107947284gettyimages-917296340.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:56:00Z", "content": "Bitcoin had been coasting in recent months on fairly low volatility until \"things exploded\" Wednesday and prices tanked more than 10 percent, BKCM founder and CEO Brian Kelly told CNBC. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; Kelly, a cryptocurrency fund m\u2026 [+2071 chars]", "fulltext": "A crypto financial crisis is happening, says Coinshare's Demirors 7:49 PM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018 | 07:47\n\nBitcoin had been coasting in recent months on fairly low volatility until \"things exploded\" Wednesday and prices tanked more than 10 percent, BKCM founder and CEO Brian Kelly told CNBC.\n\nKelly, a cryptocurrency fund manager, said the sharp downturn had to do with bitcoin cash, which splintered off in August 2017 from regular bitcoin with the goal of being able to process more transactions.\n\nBitcoin cash is doing a \"hard fork\" or \"effectively a software upgrade,\" Kelly said on \"Fast Money.\" \"When you do a software upgrade, everybody usually agrees.

Even then, it would be competing with other legislation and would not necessarily come to the floor.\n\nTrump did not respond to shouted questions after his announcement about whether he had sufficient votes for the legislation to pass.\n\nThe bipartisan compromise on criminal justice reform has attracted support from a broad range of groups including law enforcement associations, the libertarian-leaning network operated by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"These members have reached a bipartisan agreement,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"Did I hear the word bipartisan? Did I hear that word? That's a nice word.\"\n\nThe president touted the overhaul's support among law enforcement and faith groups and vowed that his administration would continue to be \"tough on crime.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has emerged as the most vocal opposition in the Senate and has pushed the Trump administration to take a tougher stance on crime.

Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., was also in attendance.\n\nThe new legislation is expected to give judges more leeway to bypass mandatory minimum sentences in certain types of offenses and to reduce penalties for drug-related offenses. One key provision would lower the minimum sentence for those convicted under the \"three strikes\" policy from life to 25 years.\n\nThe compromise bill would also retroactively apply a 2010 law reducing the disparity in sentencing between different forms of cocaine. Critics say that sentencing disparity has contributed to disproportionate penalties against African-Americans.\n\nThe legislation would radically overhaul the nation's sentencing policies. More than 2 million Americans are incarcerated. The U.S. has the world's highest incarceration rate.\n\nOne of the measure's chief backers in the White House is Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior advisor. Kushner, whose wide-ranging portfolio also includes Middle Eastern diplomacy, has made sentencing reform one of his chief priorities. His father, Charles Kushner, served time in prison.\n\nKushner reportedly briefed the president on the legislation on Tuesday.\n\nWATCH: This midterm ballot initiative could swing Florida in 2020"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Thomas Franck", "title": "Here are Warren Buffett's 10 biggest holdings now, half of which are banks", "description": "Here are Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings by market value.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/here-are-warren-buffetts-10-biggest-holdings-now-half-are-banks.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/30/104681315-_Y2A7721.1910x1000.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:29:00Z", "content": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported its third-quarter holdings on Wednesday, revealing a new $4 billion stake in J.

The following is a link to video of the full interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/14/watch-cnbcs-full-exclusive-interview-with-liberty-media-chairman-john-malone.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nMalone: Disney in middle of unique content 'food fight'\n\nJOHN MALONE: They're throwing Hail Mary passes in content. They're disrupting the traditional studio architecture\u2014 going directly to talent, bidding against each other for anything that looks unique. I mean, this is going to be a food fight for a while. And you know if Disney gets in the middle of the food fight, they're just going to have to live up to their brand in terms of what they deliver. And they're got to figure out how to make it somewhat unique because you know their contents been out there forever, so people are used to getting it and not paying for it. Right? Or not understanding that they're paying for it, right?\n\nFABER: Right. Right.\n\nMALONE: So to make that transition \u2013 and the question is how much pain are they willing to suffer pulling back rights from existing distribution, so that they create this appetite or starvation even for their brand and their content. So that when they then offer it as a premium direct consumer service people are willing to say \u2013\n\nFABER: There's real value.\n\nMALONE: -- I should pay for it now.\n\nFABER: And guys, and Jim, that goes back to this question we've been asking when it comes to Disney certainly is: what's it all going to cost? What's the incremental cost going to be to the company as it of course tries to compete robustly with Netflix and Amazon? And John was sort of pining a bit on -- on that and on the evolving world, in terms of that food fight he was talking about where so much money is being spent for those who create the content.\n\nMalone: Disney lacks massive direct consumer relationships\n\nMALONE: They have great brand, there's no question. And they really know the entertainment of business. What -- what they don't have is a massive number of global credit cards. They don't have massive direct consumer relationships at this point and those are not easy to come by. You know, if you look at the other people in the space: Amazon, because of their retailing businesses and the creation of Prime has been able to tie into consumer interest pretty globally, and -- and so it's very easy for Amazon to sell an incremental service. You have Apple wanting to be in this space. Apple is the big gorilla.\n\nFABER: When you say wanting to be in this space what do you mean?\n\nMALONE: Wanting to develop a direct consumer entertainment relationship beyond music, let's call it into video. And I -- I -- we're estimating that Apple has probably 650 to 700 million direct consumer relationships, in which Apple has a credit card, a lot of information about the consumer. They've started to put money into original content and they're certainly having lots of discussions in and around the content industry to figure this out. And you know they want to drive their consumer interface technology, their ecosystem into the video space in the living room, more heavily than Apple TV has so far. And Jeff is on a roll with his fire stick and his prime and his content and so he's in the living room. And Alexa is a \u2013 is a voice-activated interface that that works well as well, thought-through well, well-engineered, interfaces with Netflix. I mean well engineered, okay. So the technology side, if Disney has a problem, okay, I believe it's going to be those two things: it's going to be the technology platform and it's going to be establishing those one-to-one consumer relationships.\n\nFABER: All that said, when I did put the direct question to him he does say he believes Disney will be the third significant entrant and successful entrant overtime in direct consumer after Netflix and Amazon. Guys.\n\nLiberty Media' John Malone on Comcast, Verizon and Charter\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Let's get over to David Faber as we said earlier at Liberty Media's Investor Day once again. David?\n\nFABER: Thanks, Carl. Yeah, earlier today I had a chance to sit down with John Malone, of course the man who helped create the overall company and as its Chairman also still sits on nine boards of directors. Always like to talk to John about, well, a variety of things in the larger media business and about deals themselves, something he's no stranger to. We talked about globalization. It's been a key theme of his through the years. In particular we talked as well about our parent company, Comcast's, decision to buy Sky. And we went on as well to talk about a deal that didn't happen last year, namely the sale of Charter Communications, of which Malone and Liberty own more than a 20% stake. The first question that I asked was did Comcast get a good deal in purchasing Sky?\n\nMALONE: Brian will shoot me if I say no. He paid a lot of money for Sky. I think the proof is going to be how he goes -- the bulk of the Sky business is UK and the bulk of the UK business is a satellite-to-consumer business. He has to make the transition from satellite distribution to internet transmission over time.\n\nFABER: It seems to have passed. Do you --\n\nMALONE: For now.\n\nFABER: For now?\n\nMALONE: For now.\n\nFABER: Do you regret it passed? Do you regret there was an opportunity there that wasn't seized given the stock is 328 right now?\n\nMALONE: Look, you're always worth more dead than alive in the business world. Right? And on any given day you can usually sell a company for more than its market trading value. So in the short run, would that have been something to pursue and if you know, we owned -- instead of a 328 stock and you know, we had $350 worth of Verizon stock, would we be better off? Would the future be brighter? You know, I don't know. I mean, I think clearly some of us on the board and in the company thought we should have more aggressively pursued some of those interests. I can tell you that the deals that were on the table would not have gotten anybody's support. Okay? So Verizon would have had to get more aggressive for that deal to have had any chance. The problem with Masa's overture was it wasn't deemed to be equal for all shareholders. And as a result, some of us felt a) that it would be awkward to propose it.\n\nFABER: At the same time \u2013\n\nMALONE: Do you think a T-Mobile/Sprint wanting to go into -- just look forward a few years. If it turns out that 5g is an attractive -- involves to be, demonstrated to be an attractive fixed solution, Charter will have a maturing high speed powered network in the part of the world it serves. Very incrementally positive to add a 5g on that-to-that platform.\n\nFABER: Right now, Hans Vestberg, who is running Verizon --\n\nMALONE: He's focused \u2013\n\nFABER: He's very focused on 5g,\n\nMALONE: -- he's focused on 5g --\n\nFABER: -- and they've been rewarded in the marketplace for doing so overtime. Last time when they went to 4g.\n\nMALONE: Well, let me point out, Charter is trading at, what, 9.1 times. Comcast attributed to that business maybe seven. Tom is being rewarded for a clear pure play leveraged cash flow growth buyback story. Not experimenting over here, not trying to buy a content company or a \u2013 right? So Charter is currently, and the Charter shareholders are currently being rewarded the same way -- with premium valuation and a big buyback program that gives liquidity to its shareholders. Okay? Now that is not my traditional way of building a business but it's Tom's, and it's working.\n\nFABER: And you clearly believe there may be another opportunity to revisit, if it makes sense, a sale of Charter at some point?\n\nMALONE: Correct.\n\nFABER: And perhaps Tom will be in a different place in terms of his view of value as well?\n\nMALONE: Yes. And, you know, Tom is a terrific operator, right? And so he's got a very clear vision. This is a stage, right, where Tom is basically saying \"Don't bother me with all this other stuff. I've got this focus and this vision and this challenge and I've got to get this done and once I've got that done then you guys, you naysayers, right, can say 'Now what should we do?' But if I don't get this done everybody will be disappointed.\" So I think for that board, in a year, two years this there will be a big question. Okay. \"Now what?\" \"Now we're generating this big free cash flow. Are we going to have an opportunity to steal an NBC Universal from somebody like Brian did?\"\n\nFABER: Really?\n\nMALONE: Yes, really. I mean, you don't know. Timing, timing, if you have dry powder \u2013\n\nFABER: Are you trying to get Brian to split the company? Is that sort of what I'm hearing here too, John? Are you --\n\nMALONE: No I'm talking about him being Brian.\n\nFABER: I see. Okay.\n\nMALONE: I think he made a fabulous transaction.\n\nFABER: Always a good place to stop, saying that our boss made a fabulous transaction. Carl, back to you.\n\nLiberty Media' John Malone on Netflix's 'massive lead' in streaming landscape\n\nFABER: Thanks, Carl. Yeah, it's a yearly investment meeting and a chance every year to sit down with John Malone. Typically we do talk about, of course, the changing media landscape, something you and I talk about every morning at 9:00 with Jim as well. And certainly we tend to focus on Netflix. As has Mr. Malone for years now, by the way, in terms of originally his belief that the cable companies should have gotten together to try to combat it and his admission that, well, its place is fairly cemented when it comes to being the number one player. I did ask him: does he believe that that will continue?\n\nMALONE: They've got a massive lead in that space. It's difficult to imagine that anybody can displace them.\n\nFABER: Is there any chance that Netflix hits a wall at some point?\n\nMALONE: So far it's an equity play that is based upon growth, valuation of growth, and the general belief that there will be a point at which they can take their foot a little bit off the throttle, right? They demonstrated -- their stock really took off, David, when they could demonstrate pricing power. So when they raised their prices and didn't lose any material subscribers, I think the financial markets said \"Aha, glue,\" right? So if you have glue and you have growth and pricing power, right, now the question is how to manage that. So unless Reed, you know, which he won't, does something really nuts, I think it's a question of modulating their spend and coasting in to maturity, at which point they should be enormously cash generative. Okay? And the only thing that I can see that interrupts that is number two comes in and starts a price war. But I don't see why number two would start a price war, right? I think Netflix right now provides a pricing umbrella, and as long as the competitors come at it either under that price umbrella or, like Amazon is doing where it's a whole different bundle, right, I think there's clearly room for two or three global providers in this space coming at it from slightly different perspectives. So, you know, I think Netflix, will be very successful in my opinion. And I think Amazon obviously is going to be very successful. And the question is who's going to be number three.\n\nFABER: I think you've answered it to a certain extent. You expect it to be Disney.\n\nMALONE: I expect it to be Disney.\n\nFABER: One question that I also put to Malone is his future. In the last year he stepped down from the boards of Charter and Lionsgate, raising at least some questions as to whether he was pulling back to a certain extent. Here is what he had to say:\n\nMALONE: First of all, my wife has a health condition that makes it much more difficult for me to travel for business. So the travel obligations of being on boards that aren't where I am, you know, is a challenge for us. You know, we're coming up on 60 years of marriage, so you know, she's very, very important to me and that's number one. And then I have ISS and those types of people saying I'm on way too many boards to begin with and they're recommending, \"Don't vote for John, he's on 13 boards,\" or something. And so I'm still on nine boards.\n\nFABER: That's plenty.\n\nMALONE: And the guys who are on the boards representing our collective interests are terrific people. So I don't think we lose a beat. On Charter, for instance, they've invited me to be an emeritus. So I call in, I listen to the board meeting. I do it. I read the board material. I call in. I'm an insider anyway, because of my ownership, so I get lots of connectivity there.\n\nFABER: For those who view it in a larger context, \"Well, John Malone is pulling back,\" or \"He's starting to think about what he wants to do with his empire.\"\n\nMALONE: No. But I would say, David, as you get older you have other interests, right? And so you want to spread your time \u2013 I have a lot of philanthropy interests. I have a forestry business. I have a hotel business in Ireland, I have a big thoroughbred racehorse business. These all -- these all are personal interest things.\n\nFABER: \"As you get older, you have other interests.\" I'm trying to figure that one out myself, Carl.

A spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also did not immediately respond.\n\nFlake's vote is crucial for the nominees currently moving through the Judiciary Committee, which comprises 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. Republicans cannot lose Flake's vote if they want to advance those judges.\n\nBut if Flake is the only senator voting across party lines in the full Senate body, Vice President Mike Pence will be able to cast the tie-breaker vote and push those nominees through."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Amanda Macias", "title": "America has spent $5.9 trillion on wars in the Middle East and Asia since 2001, a new study says", "description": "The report, from Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs at Brown University, also finds that more than 480,000 people have died from the wars and more than 244,000 civilians have been killed as a result of fighting.

She would learn to use that attention to her advantage.\n\nObama was sometimes taken aback by the special scrutiny her clothes received. \"My pearls, my belts, my cardigans \u2026 all seemed to trigger a slew of opinions and instant feedback,\" Obama wrote in an excerpt published on Elle.com.\n\nAt one event, she was moved to tears by girls speaking at a school in London. A reporter didn't ask what had prompted the first lady to become so emotional but instead asked who designed her dress. \"It seemed that my clothes mattered more to people than anything I had to say,\" wrote Obama.\n\nObama wrote that the focus on women's wardrobes can amount to a sort of double standard and even unfair expenses for women in visible positions. Still, she used this obsession over her wardrobe to divert attention to social issues and people she thought were important.\n\nLike other first ladies before her, she used her spotlight to give attention to American designers, especially ones that weren't yet established. But she also used her fashion choices to give added visibility to the people she was photographed with or the platform she was trying to promote.\n\n\"If people flipped through a magazine primarily to see the clothes I was wearing, I hoped they'd also see the military spouse standing next to me or read what I had to say about children's health.\"\n\nOther women in high profile positions have faced this same scrutiny. In 2015, a reporter asked Amal Clooney what she was wearing while the human rights attorney walked into court to represent Armenia in a genocide denial case. Clooney laughed and responded, \"I'm wearing Ede & Ravenscroft,\" a reference to a maker of legal robes, one of the oldest established tailors in England.\n\nFellow politico Hillary Clinton also faced intense scrutiny over her appearance and has said she wore her signature pantsuits in an attempt to control the conversation about her. \"Since there wasn't much to say or report on what I wore, maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead,\" the Democratic presidential nominee wrote in her memoir \"What Happened.\"\n\nTo be sure, Obama served as first lady, where optics are paramount.

Both Willis and Brochstein think the long-term opportunity is huge, with Grand View Research saying the global pot market will be worth $146 billion by 2025.\n\nFor things to really take off, though, other countries need to legalize weed. Canada, with 35 million people, is a decent size, but it's small compared to everyone else. If the U.K. legalizes marijuana \u2014 and the country did just start allowing doctors to prescribe it \u2014 and Germany comes around, and if the United States legalizes it on a federal level, then it becomes an industry on par with tobacco or booze.\n\nIt will still be years before this happens, but Canada's foray into legal weed should push other countries to get there faster, Willis said. \"The U.K. did an about-face; it flipped in three months from not allowing medical prescriptions to allowing them,\" he said. \"That shows the power of what Canada has done.\"\n\nEven if you believe in the long-term opportunity, Willis suggests waiting until the second half of 2019 to buy in. Valuations are still too high, with some of the big companies trading between 20 to 55 times earnings, but they will come down over the next few months. Eventually, they should be more in line with tobacco and alcohol businesses, which trade at around 10 to 14 times earnings.\n\nAny investor feeling the cannabis itch should consider some opportunities in the United States, which is less regulated than Canada. American companies have fewer restrictions on how they can market their wares, and they have more strains to sell. They're much smaller, so they carry even more risk, but companies like MedMen or iAnthus, which have operations in multiple states, trade at lower valuations than their Canadian counterparts. Both are down 7 percent on Wednesday, but still up on the year.\n\n\"They're expensive, but it's not as crazy,\" Willis said. \"It's kind of like Canada in 2013.\"\n\nWillis said the best advice is to look for the lowest-cost producers \u2014 it is currently Aphria in Canada \u2013 and for businesses that seem to be closer to generating a profit. Tilray had the smallest net loss among the big three reports this week, though its loss did widen from the year-ago quarter. Willis said none of them are close to making a real profit. Aphria is the closest to breaking even and should be generating net income by the second quarter of 2019 (June-ending quarter).

He maintained his buy rating on shares following the earnings release.\n\nThe weaker revenue is \"a hiccup in getting products to Germany, along with minimal initial shipments into provincial recreational channels,\" he wrote to clients. \"We believe we will see higher recreational sales impacting the company's top line next quarter. Given the company's leading position with 70,000 kilograms in supply agreements (excl. Ontario), we believe this could amount to more than $300 million in revenues and can support the company's leading position in the recreational market.\"\n\nCanopy has been seen as a better bet in the cannabis space thanks to a $5 billion strategic partnership from international brewer Constellation Brands. Access to capital is seen by some analysts as key to the future success of marijuana companies, which are struggling to build up enough production to meet swelling demand.\n\n\"We think Constellation Brand's recent investment provides significant additional financial capacity and operational capabilities to become a leading CPG company, longer-term,\" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Monday, before the earnings results. \"We think that demand for Canopy's products remains strong. As we have highlighted in our e-commerce platform checks, Canopy has steadily grown its product listings amongst our five province sample, covering 65 percent of Canada's population.\"\n\nAzer had forecast Canopy posting revenue of CA$60 million.\n\nNeither Canopy nor Tilray reported a significant bump in sales thanks to recreational cannabis.

CEO Jeff Gennette said Wednesday during a call with analysts that Macy's will look in 2019 to see what format works best before deciding what it will roll out to other stores across the U.S.\n\n\"We want to create a vibrant destination,\" Gennette told CNBC Wednesday after Macy's reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. \"When you look at what the customer needs, it's more about fulfillment and convenience. You need less space in order to do that.\"\n\nDespite the earnings beat and an increased forecast, Macy's shares fell nearly 6 percent Wednesday. The stock is up about 35 percent so far this year.\n\nIn rethinking its real estate, there are three ways Macy's could fill the leftover space in its \"neighborhood\" stores, Gennette explained.\n\nOne way is by partnering with other retailers. Macy's already has brought Starbucks and Sunglass Hut into its stores, for example. Gennette said it will continue to look at food-and-beverage concepts and other retailers that don't cannibalize what Macy's is currently selling. This mimics a similar initiative taken by Kohl's, which is dividing some of its bigger stores to make space for retailers such as Aldi.\n\nThe CEO added that other retailers could include those currently trying out Macy's recently launched pop-up marketplaces, which are in a handful of cities today. \"You could turn that [excess space] over to a suite of retailers,\" he said.\n\nThen, Macy's will consider bringing its off-price concept, known as Macy's Backstage \u2014 a competitor with the likes of TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack \u2014 to move into the space, Gennette said. The company has said its full-price locations with Backstage shops inside them are helping lift sales. Macy's currently has 166 Backstage locations open across the U.S., and continues to add more.\n\nLast, Macy's could use the extra space to fill online orders, like a mini-fulfillment center, according to Gennette. He said one location in a market could be used to reach surrounding homes, and even other Macy's stores. Nordstrom, similarly, is trying a small-shop concept known as Nordstrom Local in Los Angeles, where it can pull inventory from other surrounding shops and serve as a hub for online orders.\n\n\"We will test and iterate until we land on the right formula to scale,\" Gennette told analysts Wednesday."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Amanda Macias", "title": "At least 13 countries are interested in buying Russian missile system despite threat of US sanctions", "description": "Several of the countries want to avoid regulatory hurdles that come with dealing with the U.S., according to a person with knowledge of the matter.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/countries-interested-in-buying-russian-missile-system-despite-us-sanction-threats.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/07/105559612-1541620392409gettyimages-955532060.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:50:00Z", "content": "WASHINGTON At least 13 countries have expressed interest in buying a Russian missile system instead of platforms made by American companies, despite the potential for triggering U.S. sanctions, according to people with first-hand knowledge of a U.S. intellige\u2026 [+2152 chars]", "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 13 countries have expressed interest in buying a Russian missile system instead of platforms made by American companies, despite the potential for triggering U.S. sanctions, according to people with first-hand knowledge of a U.S. intelligence assessment.\n\nOne of the people, who declined to be named, said that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Vietnam, and Iraq have all discussed buying the S-400 missile system from Russia. However, the U.S. expects that a handful of countries will fold to diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe S-400, a mobile long-range surface-to-air missile system, is the Kremlin's answer to America's Patriot and THAAD platforms. Lockheed Martin makes the THAAD, or terminal high altitude area defense, system, while Raytheon makes the Patriot.\n\nThe Pentagon deferred questions about this story to the White House, which did not comment.\n\nAny potential economic or political penalties would come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which President Donald Trump signed in August 2017. In September, the U.S. slapped sanctions on China for buying fighter jets and missiles from Russia. However, the U.S. could grant waivers.\n\nChina, India and Turkey have already signed purchase agreements with the Kremlin. China, which is embroiled in a trade battle with the U.S., is in the middle of receiving its final shipment of the S-400 system.

That momentum selling largely accounts for U.S. crude prices falling below $60 a barrel and toward $55, according to Currie.\n\nAt that point, another quirk of the market kicked in. When oil fell to about $55, it triggered selling by swap dealers, who had sold options to oil producers giving them the right to sell the commodity at that price level.\n\nHistorically, this environment can last for three to four weeks, Currie says.

The first two revolutions were about mass production. The third turned us into knowledge workers bound in offices. This revolution is about breaking free of geography. It is being driven by the technology to help us do that.\n\nFourth industrial revolution change is coming from both sides: People want better lifestyles, and businesses are in hiring pain.\n\nPeople know that place-bound work no longer makes sense. Collaboration technologies, like Microsoft's Office 365, Slack, Google Hangouts and Atlassian, along with the ability to find work online via sites like ours, make it possible to work anywhere. The number of U.S. freelancers who found projects online increased 22 points in the past five years \u2014 from 42 percent in 2014 to 64 percent in 2018.\n\nWhile technology is the main enabler, another major force is hiring pain and huge talent shortages. The most talented professionals are increasingly used to being able to call the shots and shape their lives as they want to live them rather than as traditional 9-to-5 work requires. This means companies who want access to them need to allow remote work.\n\nWhat is your view on Yahoo, Bank of America, Aetna and IBM eliminating their work-from-home policy?\n\nThese remote-work policy reversals are extremely shortsighted. Forcing workers back into offices is archaic and a great way to lower the quality of your team. Top professionals will not trade the way they want to live to fit a company's policy. They will find new work with companies more open to remote work. The team members who are less motivated, lower performers are more likely to stay.\n\nCompanies that revoke remote work privileges not only risk talent loss, they signal that they are not a fit for future top talent, especially among younger generations coming of age at a time when flexible work is an option they're well aware of.\n\nReversing remote work policies is also the wrong thing for America. Big companies have social responsibilities. With so many areas of our country struggling, it's backward-looking for companies to make decisions that take away jobs from regions that need them most. That is exactly what these remote-work reversals do.\n\n\n\nYou had mentioned that the concept of the workplace is \"dead,\" yet organizations in this country haven't changed how they operate inside their four walls since Henry Ford created the 9-to-5 workday. Why are they so slow to change?\n\nThis brings to my mind the fable of the boiling frog. If a frog is suddenly put into boiling water, it will jump out. It senses danger immediately and takes action to save itself. But if a frog is put into water that is slowly brought up to a boil, it will perish because the change is so gradual, the frog doesn't perceive danger until it's too late.\n\nThis is the situation we are in with organizational change. Without having reached a boiling point, it's easier for companies to do more of the same than to revisit their assumptions. So they keep conducting painful searches to find people who can drive into their offices and sit, unnecessarily, bound by four walls. Meanwhile, local costs of living are going up. Commutes are increasingly painful. And every year, things keep getting a little bit worse. But because there hasn't been a major crisis, organizations having trouble finding the people complain but don't jump into action. Just because something is gradual does not mean it's okay not to rethink it. People need to wake up.\n\nWhen do you think companies across America will finally embrace this change?\n\nWithin the next 10 to 15 years, because of generational shift. Millennials will be the next CEOs and CXOs. Gen Z is going to take all of this as a natural way of working. They are flexible work natives. Many baby boomers will be out of the workforce, and Gen X will be starting to move out as well. Younger generations will see the trade-offs in quality of life and think traditional models are ridiculous. This is similar to how digital natives changed the way we use technology. As younger generations take management reins, remote-work and flexible-work models will just be the norm to them. They'll hire more remote people and empower their teams to work that way. Research points in this direction, too. Five times more hiring managers expect more of their team to work remotely in the next 10 years than expect less.\n\n\n\nWhat type of companies do you see getting disrupted if they don't soon embrace remote work?\n\nFortune 500s are seen as somewhat invincible \u2014 they're far from it. When the F500 list first came out in 1955, they had an average lifespan of 75 years. The average lifespan of an F500 company today is less than one third that \u2014 15 years. Only 12 percent of the original F500s remain on today's list. It's easier for smaller, younger companies to evolve so it's even more critical for F500s to embrace remote work if they want to prolong their lifespan.\n\nAgencies and traditional staffing firms are also ripe for disruption. Companies that hire via online marketplaces or build flexible remote teams can access the same quality talent at much faster speeds and usually with lower overall costs than they'd get via these traditional sources since they're going direct to the talent. The majority (90%) of hiring managers are open to working with freelancers rather than through a staffing firm, according to Future Workforce Report. Staffing firms that evolve will do better than the ones avoiding change and agencies themselves can move online to create a more distributed model."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "George Manessis", "title": "Alibaba's Singles Day may not boost its stock", "description": "Despite being one of the biggest online shopping events in the world, shares of Alibaba tend to sell off after the event.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/alibabas-singles-day-may-not-boost-its-stock.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/05/105552563-1541425371210gettyimages-1057636520.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:53:00Z", "content": "China's largest online shopping event, Singles day, was Sunday and from a sales-perspective, it didn't disappoint. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The shopping event, started by Alibaba 10 years ago, racked up over $30b in gross merchandise value n\u2026 [+707 chars]", "fulltext": "Alibaba Singles Day may not boost stock 10:49 AM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018 | 01:21\n\nChina's largest online shopping event, Singles day, was Sunday \u2013 and from a sales-perspective, it didn't disappoint.\n\nThe shopping event, started by Alibaba 10 years ago, racked up over $30b in gross merchandise value \u2013 nearly a 27% gain from last year - setting a record for the company.\n\nTo put that in perspective, total online sales in the U.S. for Black Friday totaled just $5b in 2017.\n\nThe growth was driven by Alibaba's \"New Retail\" strategy, which brought together 180,000 brands and 2000,000 smart stores from the company's ecosystem.\n\nBut shares of Alibaba tend to sell off after the event.\n\nIn keeping with history, shares of Alibaba sold off November 12th, something the stock has done in the four previous Singles Days that it's been a public company.\n\nAnd a month later, the negative sentiment tends to continue.\n\nThe stock loses another 4 percent, a negative trade 75 percent of the time - underperforming the S&P."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Jeff Cox", "title": "Maxine Waters says easing banking regulations 'will come to an end' when she takes committee chair", "description": "Rep.

Mills said a stronger \"internal thrust\" is seen when that ratio reaches at least more than 5 to 1.\n\nHistorical data also suggest markets have to return to October lows before they reach a bottom, said Mills.\n\n\"Go back to 1981, we've seen 21 declines of 10 percent or more and typically over 70 percent of the time you see a retest of that initial low so I think that's what we're living through right now but fundamentals still support us moving higher through 2019,\" he explained.\n\nThe S&P 500 has moved more than 4 percent higher since it bottomed out at 2,603 on Oct. 29. At those lows, it had fallen more than 11 percent from its record high of Sept. 21.\n\nEven after the S&P 500 bottoms out, Mills expects elevated volatility for markets that could spook investors. Typically, the late stage of a cycle is characterized by tightening monetary policy and flattening yield curves, two factors that tend to roil markets.\n\n\"I think there's a road higher, but \u2026 I think it could be bumpy,\" Mills said. \"We're moving into this market phase where higher volatility is probably here to stay to some degree.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 remains nearly 2 percent higher for the year, while the Dow has added almost 3 percent."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Nia Warfield", "title": "Your first trade for Wednesday, November 14", "description": "The \"Fast Money\" traders share their first moves for the market open.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/14/your-first-trade-for-wednesday-november-14.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/01/27/104245575-final-trade-logo.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:19:00Z", "content": "div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The \" Fast Money \" traders shared their first moves for the market open.

For Perlstein, that means incorporating patients in the company in a more direct way, and taking a different approach to pricing potential medicines.\n\n\"We staked our whole brand on wanting to make a downward dent on drug pricing,\" he explained.\n\nPerlara's still a way's away from pricing a drug: it plans to start human testing of its first two projects next year, for NGLY1 Deficiency and PMM2-CDG, both extremely rare genetic diseases. Only about 800 people have been identified worldwide with the latter.\n\nIt's aiming to tackle both of those through \"PerlQuests\" as well, a system Perlara established to work with families or patient groups that want to invest in research.\n\n\"Right now we're living in a world where those families are told if you just raise a few million dollars for gene therapy, that's your panacea,\" Perlstein said, referring to technology that delivers a health copy of a gene to make up for one that causes disease.\n\nPerlara aims to find more near-term solutions at a lower cost by creating disease models in worms, flies, yeast or fish, for example, and then screening existing compounds to see if there may be therapeutic activity.\n\n\"For a tenth of the cost, we're building animal models and finding repurposing opportunities,\" Perlstein explained.\n\nThe goal, then, isn't necessarily a cure, but a therapy that can help treat the disease for the years it may take to develop one.\n\nThat's the focus of Cuban's investment to develop treatments for Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that can be caused by mutations in one of more than 75 different genes.\n\n\"Families affected by rare disease are ready to move mountains, but they lack the financial resources to do so,\" Cuban said in a statement from Perlara. He said by e-mail he does expect a return on his investment, \"but we aren't looking to maximize ROI. We are looking to maximize health and wellness.\"\n\nHe noted a successful treatment for the disease could also hold implications for \"aging, sports medicine, traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other indications.\"\n\nAs for drug pricing? Cuban's still interested in in it, pledging to \"significantly reduce the pricing of all orphan drugs we invest in.\"\n\nSo far, Perlara is his only investment in drug discovery or development, he said.\n\nHis take on the industry's pricing practices more broadly is blunt: the \"price of drugs,\" he said, \"is too damn high.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Kerri Anne Renzulli", "title": "People who make time to learn at work are 21% happier than those who don't", "description": "New research by LinkedIn shows that professionals who spend five or more hours a week learning are less stressed, more confident and feel more successful and happy at work than peers who spend less than a hour learning each week.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/13/people-who-learn-at-work-are-21percent-happier-than-those-who-dont.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/09/20/103954863-GettyImages-498573133.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:00:00Z", "content": "Taking time at work to focus on mastering a new skill, learning a new software program or tool, or even just reading widely about your industry can do wonders for you mentally as well as professionally. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; New research \u2026 [+3413 chars]", "fulltext": "Taking time at work to focus on mastering a new skill, learning a new software program or tool, or even just reading widely about your industry can do wonders for you mentally \u2014 as well as professionally.\n\nNew research conducted by LinkedIn found that the best way to ensure that you're happy at your job is to spend more time learning.\n\nAmong the professionals surveyed, those who were \"heavy\" learners \u2014 devoting more than five hours a week to things like reading, taking classes and watching online courses \u2014 reported being happier, less stressed, more productive and more confident than those who spent less time learning.\n\nFor instance, when compared to \"light\" learners, those who commit an hour or less each week, heavy learners were:\n\n74 percent more likely to know where they want to go in their career\n\n48 percent more likely to have found purpose in their work\n\n47 percent less likely to be stressed at work\n\n39 percent more likely to feel productive and successful\n\n21 percent more likely to feel confident in their work\n\nAnd finally, 21 percent more likely to be happy at work\n\nHeavy learners see almost three times as many positive results as light learners says Josh Bersin, an HR industry analyst who developed the survey with LinkedIn.\n\nThose who said they spent between one and five hours a week on education also had much happier work lives than the light learners (though not as happy as those of heavy learners.) They reported being 14 percent happier than light learners did, 13 percent less stressed, 16 percent more productive and 32 percent more likely to know where they want to go in their career.\n\n\"There is a clear relationship between time spent learning and a person's career satisfaction, career prospects and general happiness,\" says Bersin. \"People who either have the time or make the time to educate themselves are performing at higher levels.\"\n\nThe bad news? Few of us are actually heavy learners.\n\nOf the 2,049 workers surveyed, including freelancers and entrepreneurs, in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Australia, India, Singapore, and Hong Kong, only 7 percent said they spent five hours or more a week learning. That number may even skew a little high, admits Bersin, as LinkedIn only queried people who had recently paid for some form of online learning with the company.\n\nMost of people fall into one of the two other learning groups: 47 percent are \"medium\" learners, spending 1-5 hours a week educating themselves, and 46 percent are \"light\" learners, spending less than an hour a week.\n\nIt's an understandable reality, when you consider that two-thirds of workers already spend more than 40 hours a week at work performing necessary tasks. Bersin says that one key way to free up time in your week for more learning activities is simply to cut back on communications.\n\n\"One of the big messages I took out of this research is that people are so distracted at work that they need to force themselves to limit interacting,\" says Bersin.\n\nThings like email, social media and meetings eat up so much of a person's day that it leaves little extra time for this kind of learning, he adds. More than a quarter of people admit they waste a day a week on emails and messages that don't contribute to their jobs, the survey found.\n\n\"This is also a call on leaders and management to recognize that they need to give employees time to improve their core skills,\" says Bersin. \"It will pay off.\"\n\nLike this story?

And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market.\n\nThe Russell 2000, comprised of small-cap stocks, has taken it on the chin in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the index's 50-day moving average crossed beneath its 200-day moving average \u2014 what would be the \"death cross\" formation.\n\nThe index has also plunged 13 percent from its high at the end of August and sliced through its 200-day moving average amid widespread selling in October.\n\nThe last time the Russell 2000 saw a death cross, in 2015, the index plummeted another 17 percent to the so-called Dimon bottom in early 2016.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm quite skeptical on death crosses. Not only do you need the 50-day and 200-day moving averages to cross, but they both have to be declining. That's not always the case. Another thing is that it works really well with some assets, and not so well with others. For instance, it doesn't work well with gold, sending mixed signals all the time.

That doesn't even include the 42 percent decline we saw in 2008,\" Maley said, adding that he'd never advise forming an opinion about the market solely on a single technical indicator.\n\nOthers are more optimistic on the group's next move.

The stock has rallied more than 80 percent from a year ago. And some analysts say they're still waiting to see if Macy's can pull off a strong fourth quarter, where it faces tougher comparisons.\n\n\"This is only the start of Macy's journey,\" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said. \"A lot more work is still needed to make Macy's a unique and compelling retail destination.\"\n\nHere's what Macy's reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\n* Earnings per share: 27 cents, adjusted, vs. 14 cents expected\n\n* Revenue: $5.40 billion vs. $5.41 billion expected\n\n* Same-store sales: up 3.3 percent, on an owned plus licensed basis, vs. growth of 2.8 percent expected\n\n\"We are ready for the fourth quarter,\" CEO Jeff Gennette told CNBC. \"I think the backdrop for consumer spending is good, their confidence is strong, the dotcom business is really humming. \u2026 For stores, we are going into the fourth quarter in a healthy place with momentum.\"\n\nMacy's reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $62 million, or 20 cents per share, up from $30 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Macy's earned 27 cents, ahead of the 14 cents expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nNet sales climbed to $5.40 billion from $5.28 billion one year ago, falling roughly in line with analysts' expectations for $5.41 billion. The company said digital sales were up a double-digit percentage, fueled by growth of sales made via mobile devices. Macy's is on track to reach $1 billion in mobile sales by the end of the year.\n\nSales at stores open for at least 12 months were up 3.3 percent, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth for Macy's, and surpassing Wall Street expectations for growth of 2.8 percent.\n\nLooking to the full year, Macy's is now calling for earnings per share to fall within a range of $4.10 to $4.30, up from $3.95 to $4.15. It also narrowed its forecast for same-stores sales to climb between 2.3 percent and 2.5 percent, compared with a prior range of 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent. Estimates for net sales narrowed to an expected increase of between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent, compared with flat to up 0.7 percent, previously.\n\nHoping to avoid the same fate as now-bankrupt Sears, Macy's has been testing new technology and other concepts in stores to lure shoppers and grow sales.\n\nThe department store chain is adding mini marketplaces to some locations to sell goods from lesser-known and local brands. It's adding augmented reality devices to stores to let shoppers try on make-up virtually, along with virtual reality headsets to let shoppers see furniture in real life. All of Macy's stores are also expected to be equipped with mobile checkout by the end of the year.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, has been adding its off-price brand, Macy's Backstage, to existing full-line shops to compete with the likes of TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack and Ross Stores. Macy's has said stores with Backstage see two times more shopping trips, with basket sizes up an average of 30 percent.\n\nMacy's is also starting to experiment with smaller stores, hoping to trim staffing and inventory costs. Retailers including Kohl's, Nordstrom and Target have either opened smaller locations or trimmed larger ones in recent months, as more people shop online.\n\nAccording to Gennette, the company is making progress with its turnaround plans, and it's showing up in results. He said October was the strongest month for Macy's during the third quarter, particularly in the last three weeks. He added the company is \"ahead of schedule\" for hiring 80,000 workers this holiday season, despite many retailers facing headwinds amid a tight labor market in the U.S.\n\n\"While Macy's has been working to make improvements in its own business, we believe this performance sets an optimistic tone for the sector,\" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey said in a research note.\n\nOther retailers including Kohl's, Nordstrom and J.C.

It already offers a variety of other cookware, like KitchenAid mixers, coffee machines and toaster ovens.\n\nThe move comes as Sears, once a dominant appliance retailer, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and is shutting stores. Other competitors in the space looking to capitalize on that opportunity include Home Depot, Best Buy, J.C. Penney and Lowe's.\n\nBloomingdale's twist is focusing on the higher-end appliances, where sales are doing particularly well in the past few years, according to data compiled by Euromonitor. On Nov. 19, it will open a shop selling high-end LG Electronics appliances within its flagship department store in New York on 59th Street. It will also start selling those items on its website, the company announced Wednesday. This marks the first time the chain has ventured into selling larger home appliances like refrigerators.\n\nThe plan is for the space to stay open into 2019, and depending on how well it performs, the company will consider adding it to other locations, and adding more brands to the mix, Dan Leppo, executive vice president of the men's and home departments at Bloomingdale's, told CNBC.\n\nIn the New York store, Bloomingdale's will take the floor where it houses home goods to turn it into an \"LG Signature\" experience. There, shoppers will find items like LG Signature TVs, counter-depth refrigerators, washer/dryer combos, air purifiers and dishwashers.\n\nSpending on major consumer appliances in the U.S. rose 46 percent between 2012 and 2017, Euromonitor said. Sears, with its Kenmore brand, used to be the No. 1 appliance retailer with a 40 percent share of the market, but that title was taken by Lowe's in 2013, according to a list compiled by TWICE, a consumer electronics industry trade publication that tracks sales of appliances.\n\nDepartment store operator Penney in 2016 started selling larger home appliances after a hiatus in the business for more than three decades, as it started to see Sears stumble. But even Penney now is trying to regain its footing, having recently named former Joann CEO Jill Soltau to replace the chief it lost to Lowe's.\n\nEuromonitor has said the home appliance industry could reach as much as $38 billion in sales by 2020.
