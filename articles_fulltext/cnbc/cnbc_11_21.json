But by late in the day, Apple reversed gains and the Dow lost 200 points, closing down by just under 1 point, though the S&P was up 8 at 2,649.\n\n\"I think everyone was hoping for some kind of positive bias into Thanksgiving, which is what we historically have,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \"If we couldn't hold up today, the market's kind of showing its hand. It tried to muster up a feel good Thanksgiving rally but wasn't even strong enough to do that.\"\n\nThe Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all had their worst week to date leading up to a Thanksgiving holiday since 2011. All of them are down more than 3 percent for the week so far.\n\n\"The real tell will be next week,\" Redler said.\n\nNext week could be pivotal for markets, which are awaiting comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday but also the outcome of a meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit on Thursday.\n\nTraders are hoping to hear more dovish commentary from Powell, after he softened his stance last week, and traders are now betting on fewer rate hikes for next year.\n\nBut it's the G-20 meeting could set the tone for markets and the economy for months to come, since it is expected Trump could decide whether to continue to ramp up his tariffs on Chinese goods; hold off on further tariffs and initiate discussions, or in the best case, drop the existing tariffs and move toward a deal.\n\nRedler said the market would surge if the best case is the outcome, and stocks could get back to highs. But if Trump is just negative and there are no signs of future negotiations, stocks could quickly test the lows and break lower.\n\nIt was encouraging that some of the momentum stocks gained Wednesday before Apple dampened the rally. \"A lot of names are battered and bruised,\" said Redler, but it was positive that when the Dow was down 400 points Tuesday, and buyers came into names like Facebook.\n\nPerhaps no stock has guided market sentiment more than Apple, which fell below its 200-day moving average Nov. 13.\n\n\"The behavior of Apple raises doubts that the Thanksgiving bounce attempt has any validity,\" said Redler. He said traders on Friday will be watching Tuesday's low of $175.50. \"If that doesn't hold, it could be a headwind for the market and tech with potential downside for Apple in the $160s.\"\n\nApple finished the day at $176.78, down 20 cents.\n\nStrategists say the market could still retest the October lows \u2014 2,603 on the S&P 500 \u2014 before it turns higher, but that retest could come soon depending on the outcome of G-20, or even after a seasonal, year-end rally.\n\nTodd Sohn, technical analyst at Strategas Research, said he would not confuse Tuesday's weakness with a low. \"A lot of the things we follow came up short\u2026volumes were higher but they were not extreme,\" he said. \"I don't know how much weight to put on today's rally given the holiday.\"\n\nThe market still needs to show signs of capitulating in more than just tech names, he said.\n\n\"The next five weeks are a really strong seasonal period and that is the one thing we're very reluctant to fight\u2026you could still get a seasonal rally,\" said Sohn.\n\nStovall said the market needs a positive catalyst in order to really move higher.\n\n\"I think that we've got to hear something from the Fed, from Trump or from corporations regarding forward guidance. That would in a sense, undo some of the worries that had been built into equity prices before this could become a more meaningful and lasting rally,\" he said.\n\nStovall said in the other years where the performance was poor from the start of the fourth quarter through Nov. 20, stocks were positive 80 percent into the end of the year, and in those 20 occasions, stocks were on average up 4.1 percent in the same period.\n\nStovall said stocks would respond positively if Powell were to moderate his rate hiking tone and sound more dovish."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "LA prosecutor declines to charge Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti with felony abuse", "description": "Avenatti was arrested on a felony domestic violence charge last week after his girlfriend told police he roughed her up at his apartment.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/la-prosecutor-declines-to-charge-michael-avenatti-with-felony-abuse.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/30/105240220-GettyImages-963720204.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:16:00Z", "content": "Los Angeles prosecutors have declined to charge attorney Michael Avenatti with a felony after his girlfriend alleged abuse.

Hours later, he flew to China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.\n\nLocal prosecutors are weighing evidence that would move the case beyond a \"he said, she said\" stalemate. Among the issues being considered by the Hennepin County Attorney's office: the divergent accounts of what happened that night, the initial determination by police that there was no crime, and the woman's early hesitance to press charges against Liu, Reuters has learned.\n\nAn attorney for Liu, Jill Brisbois, said in an emailed response that Liu's innocence would become apparent once more evidence is disclosed. \"We are very disappointed that Reuters would choose to run a story with unsubstantiated information, from anonymous sources who clearly have an agenda, while Richard cannot defend himself out of respect for the judicial process,\" she wrote.\n\nWil Florin, an attorney for the now 22-year-old woman hired four days after the alleged rape, would not make her available for comment.\n\nFlorin said in response to questions that the case was \"simple\" - Liu used force to have non-consensual sex - and the initial hesitance to press charges was understandable. \"No one can fully appreciate the hurricane of initial emotions that a rape victim suffers,\" Florin said. \"Reluctance, fear and confusion are commonplace.\"\n\nAsked if his client planned any civil suits, Florin said, \"Our legal intentions with regard to Mr. Liu and others will be revealed at the appropriate time.\"\n\nSome legal experts say victims' initial reluctance to speak out plainly can deter prosecutors from charging due to concerns about how it would be seen by a jury.\n\n\"The decision to prosecute has a lot to do with the initial reaction of the victim, which is unfortunate,\" said Roger Canaff, a former sex crimes prosecutor in New York.\n\nOthers said prosecutors should still be able to make a case, for example, with the help of expert witnesses.\n\n\"Prosecutors can still educate jurors on issues like fear of retaliation, avoidance and shame,\" said Benjamin Andreozzi, a Pennsylvania-based attorney who frequently represents victims of sexual abuse.\n\nThe decision by prosecutors will likely affect JD.com, whose shares have already tumbled by more than a third since Liu's arrest.

According to an SEC press release unrelated to Riot Blockchain, this type of examination could have led to an order blocking share sales, but it did not in this case.

Henning was a senior attorney in the division of enforcement at the SEC.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment.\n\nRiot released its third-quarter earnings on Monday, after filing on Nov. 14 that they would be delayed.\n\nThe company had approximately $2.3 million in cryptocurrency mining revenue in the quarter and a net loss of approximately $6.2 million, according to a press release. In the previous quarter, Riot had approximately $2.8 million in revenue and a net loss of approximately $24.4 million. Year-over-year comparisons are unhelpful since the company only entered the cryptocurrency business in October 2017.\n\nIn the third quarter, Riot had a positive growth margin even with the decline in the price of bitcoin, according to Ensey.\n\nThe company produced 319 bitcoins and 1,182 litecoins in the latest quarter, according to its press release. In the previous quarter, the first time all of the company's cryptocurrency mining machines were set up, Riot produced 348 bitcoins and 318 litecoins.\n\n\"We are pleased with the results of the [mining] team,\" Ensey said in the phone interview.\n\nAccording to Monday's press release, part of the loss was from legal fees. In addition to the SEC matters, the company is also facing various lawsuits. On Nov. 6, U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, ordered a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for a class action against Riot.\n\nThe company had $1.6 million cash on hand, down from $1.7 million as of the end of the second quarter of 2018, $5.3 million in cash at the end of the first quarter of 2018, and $41.7 million in December 2017, according to recent quarterly filings.\n\nRiot currently has $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency on hand, down from $4.9 million last quarter. The company sold nearly $7.4 million worth of cryptocurrency in the last nine months, according to recent filings.\n\n\"We look at it as we're always looking at efforts to improve our operations and overhead cost,\" Ensey said in the interview. \"We continue to receive and evaluate various opportunities including those related to additional capital.\"\n\nOver the past nine months, Riot spent $20.3 million on purchasing property and equipment and used nearly $16 million for operating activities, according to its latest quarterly filing.\n\nRiot is trying to start its own cryptocurrency exchange, RiotX. The company announced Wednesday that it had entered an agreement with Shift Markets to provide RiotX with its crypto exchange platform. Shift Markets provides cryptocurrency exchange services for clients.\n\n\"The Company expects to continue to incur losses from operations for the near-term and these losses could be significant,\" the latest filing said. \"The Company believes that in order for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations for the next twelve months, the Company requires additional capital either in the form of equity or debt. Without additional capital, the Company's ability to continue to operate will be limited.\"\n\nThis was the first quarterly filing since CEO John O'Rourke resigned in the wake of unrelated allegation by the SEC against him for what an SEC press release called \"lucrative market manipulation schemes.\" He was succeeded by Ensey as interim CEO.

Confused, he went to a nearby Apple store and later contacted his service provider, AT&T. But he wasn't quick enough to stop a hacker from draining $500,000 from two separate accounts he had at Coinbase and Gemini, according to Santa Clara officials.\n\nNicholas Truglia, 21, lifted the $1 million from Ross' two cryptocurrency accounts, according to a felony complaint filed this month in California state court. Prosecutors say Truglia also hacked the phones of multiple Silicon Valley executives but was not able to rob their accounts.\n\n\"It's a whole new wave of crime,\" said Erin West, the deputy district attorney of Santa Clara County. \"It's a new way of stealing of money: They target people that they believe to have cryptocurrency,\" she told CNBC.\n\nTruglia has been charged with 21 counts, which include identity theft, fraud, embezzlement, crimes that \"involve a pattern of related felony conduct,\" and attempted grand theft in Ross' case, according to court documents.\n\nWest said Ross had been saving that money for his daughters' college funds, and stored it in U.S. dollars on the crypto exchanges. Truglia later converted that money to cryptocurrency and moved it to his own accounts before Ross was able to regain control of his phone number.\n\nOfficials obtained a warrant and searched Truglia's 42nd Street high-rise in Manhattan last week, they told CNBC. They were able to recover $300,000 from a computer hard drive. But the rest of the missing money may be tough to track down.\n\nCryptocurrency fans have said it is more trustworthy because transactions are recorded on a public ledger, known as blockchain. Transactions can be seen by anyone, but the identity of the sender and receiver are anonymous.\n\n\"In some ways, it's helpful because we can see where the money is going \u2014 that's the beauty of the blockchain,\" West told CNBC. \"It's public, but what we still can't see is who holds those accounts.\"\n\nCryptocurrency trading became especially popular last year, attracting floods of retail investors as bitcoin rose to nearly $20,000. But with that popularity came hacks. The total in cryptocurrency lost by individuals hit $1.6 billion at the end of June, according to CoinDesk's 2018 State of Blockchain Report. Bitcoin itself is now down more than 75percent since those December highs, and was trading near $4,400 Wednesday.\n\nOther victims that were hacked and named in the court papers include Saswata Basu, the CEO of blockchain storage service 0Chain; Myles Danielson, a hedge-fund executive, and Gabrielle Katsnelson, co-founder of start-up SMBX.\n\nTruglia has agreed to extradition, and Santa Clara officials expect to pick him up in December.

Airlines for America, an industry trade group, estimates 30.6 million people will take a flight during the 12-day stretch that wraps around Thanksgiving. The busiest day is expected to be Sunday when just more than 3 million people are scheduled to board flights.\n\nDemand is strong thanks to the robust economy, low unemployment and high consumer confidence.\n\n\"The consumer has continued to show up to travel and we are looking at very healthy revenue trends going forward,\" said Donofrio.\n\nIt also helps that airfares remain relatively low. The website Hopper.com, which tracks airfares, says the average domestic round-trip ticket is currently $222.\n\nPerhaps the only glitch to the start of Thanksgiving weekend for travelers came Wednesday morning when the American Airlines mobile app went down for about 15 minutes.

Though steep sales can lure shoppers into stores, selling too much at low prices won't help companies' earnings but instead can hurt them.\n\nRetailers such as Walmart and Target are already heading into this holiday season facing margin pressure due to heightened investments in their supply chains to keep pace with Amazon in getting online orders to customers. Their stocks recently took a hit because of this.\n\nThe discount sector that includes Walmart and Target, however, will have fewer promotions in stores this year, implying these companies are working toward improving margins, according to the Refinitiv study. It's the department stores that are expected to have more deals. And it's the department stores like J.C. Penney that also rely the most on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to match or beat quarterly earnings estimates, Refinitiv found.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Macy's, Nordstrom and Kohl's are expected to report same-store sales growth, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv. Dillard's and Penney, meanwhile, are predicted to have negative same-store sales for the holiday period.\n\nSome of the Black Friday doorbusters shoppers can look out for this year: Penney is handing out envelopes starting as early as 2 p.m. Thanksgiving Day with coupons inside for at least $10 off a purchase worth $10 or more. Some lucky shoppers could snag deals for $100 off a $100 purchase or $500 off a $500 purchase. In stores, Macy's will be offering a dozen different mail-in rebates to get items like glassware sets and Ralph Lauren-embellished pillows for free. Sears, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, is giving shoppers back $50 in loyalty points for purchases over $50.\n\nHoliday sales are expected to top $717 billion this year, climbing as much as 4.8 percent from a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation. That would be better than a five-year average of growth of 3.9 percent."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Christina Farr", "title": "Amazon's PillPack may be gearing up to serve the e-retailer's employees before broader rollout", "description": "Amazon's PillPack has filed for a few new licenses, including to ship from Phoenix to Washington, which may point to a plan to serve the company's employees first.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/pillpack-is-applying-for-licenses-as-amazon-expands-pharmacy-business.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/06/28/105300960-1530210494331pillpackfounders-gettyimages-476367148.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:38:00Z", "content": "Amazon bought PillPack, an internet pharmacy start-up, earlier this year, leading to speculation that the e-retailer will soon start selling prescription drugs on its marketplace. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; Before that happens, Amazon may be p\u2026 [+1778 chars]", "fulltext": "Amazon bought PillPack, an internet pharmacy start-up, earlier this year, leading to speculation that the e-retailer will soon start selling prescription drugs on its marketplace.\n\nBefore that happens, Amazon may be preparing to provide the service to its own employees.\n\nPillPack recently applied for a string of new pharmacy licenses, primarily to ship drugs to customers from its Phoenix facility. The licenses in Washington, New Mexico and Indiana were spotted this week by analysts at financial services firm Jefferies.\n\nIn a report to clients on Monday, the analysts said it appears that the licenses would allow PillPack to ship to those states from Phoenix. Previously, Jefferies noted that PillPack's facility in Phoenix was only licensed to ship to Arizona and New Hampshire, where it's headquartered. The company has been applying for more licenses in the past few months.\n\nCustomers in every U.S. state except Hawaii can already receive PillPack shipments, but they only get delivered from a handful of facilities. With more licenses in Phoenix, the company potentially gets faster access to people in Western states.\n\nIt's particularly notable that PillPack is targeting Washington, because that would mean gaining access to employees at Amazon's Seattle headquarters.

It is a notable one-month movement into gold by investors, especially in light of the near-$3 billion move out of GLD year-to-date made by investors. So far in the fourth quarter, gold ETFs, including GLD, are up roughly 2.5 percent through Nov. 20.\n\n\"A lot of the factors that led to gold seeing little interest from investors are going to be reversing,\" said Bart Melek, director and head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.\n\nHe expects a steady upward trend for the spot price of gold as central banks pump the break on quantitative easing and tighten monetary policy. He pointed to several other factors: Equities are not necessarily going to be the one-way bet (up) they have been for most of the decade-long bull market run, as volatility is back in a major way and many investors expect it to continue, or even increase. Another factor working against gold, the strong dollar, should start to reverse, Melek said. \"We think gold will be over $1,300 an ounce by the final months of 2019,\" he said.\n\nGold was trading above $1,220 per ounce on Wednesday. It began 2018 at a level above $1,300 per ounce. Gold prices have fallen roughly 10 percent since peaking in April as issues including the trade war with China, Fed interest-rate policy and a slowdown in overseas markets sent the U.S. dollar higher. The dollar hit a 17-month high versus other currencies last week.\n\nGeorge Milling-Stanley, vice president and head of gold strategy at State Street Global Advisors, said his firm's SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) exchange-traded fund saw increasing interest from investors in October due to rising market volatility, with $472.3 million in inflows for the calendar month. The weakness in gold prices came after a summer of \"exceptional strength in the equity markets,\" he said. (The third quarter was a period of record-low volatility in stocks, with no trading session where the U.S. market moved by 1 percent up or down.)\n\nGold opened at $1,303.45 on Jan. 2., but a perfect storm of signals from the Federal Reserve and currency moves came together to drive gold down to a yearly low of $1,160.39 on Aug. 18. \"After Powell came in, [the Fed] started to talk about a persistent cycle of tightening in the U.S.,\" Melek said. \"With employment and inflation at multidecade lows, the Fed began to raise interest rates, with two-year Treasury yields moving from 1.89 percent on Jan. 2 to 2.97 percent by Nov. 8.\"\n\nThe Fed is approaching the end of its tightening cycle, and with stocks plunging, expectations for further rate increases from the market have come down. Other central banks, including in the EU, are starting to remove monetary accommodation and tightening their policies, Melek said, and these decisions could result in a weakening dollar.\n\n\"You had interest rates move higher, which worked against gold, and at the same time, that drove the dollar higher,\" Melek said. As the U.S. dollar strengthened, highly indebted emerging markets countries had to repay loans in U.S. dollars. Instead of using resources to purchase gold, these emerging market countries, which are usually big buyers of gold, were forced to use those resources to repay loans, Melek said.\n\nMilling-Stanley also sees the dollar headwind easing. \"The dollar is looking a bit wobbly and so are equities, so the things that have been against gold for the past few months are turning,\" he said. \"I think the broad trend in equities will be flat to downward with occasional rallies, and I think gold will benefit from that as it has so often in the past,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Adam Reed", "title": "English soccer teams express anger and 'grave concern' despite $761 million TV deal", "description": "Soccer clubs from England's Championship have expressed \"grave concerns\" about how the English Football League (EFL) renegotiated a new multi-million pound TV deal with British broadcast partner Sky.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/english-soccer-teams-express-anger-and-grave-concern-despite-761-million-tv-deal.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/25/105158191-GettyImages-945899376.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T16:43:00Z", "content": "\"Concluding these negotiations has indeed been challenging, as is the case when managing a diverse group of stakeholders, and the Board took on board the comments and frustrations voiced by a number of Clubs,\" EFL Interim Chair Debbie Jevans commented on Mond\u2026 [+1779 chars]", "fulltext": "Sky pays $761 million for broadcast rights to English Football League \u2014 but clubs want more 3:45 AM ET Wed, 21 Nov 2018 | 02:27\n\nSoccer clubs from England's Championship, the league immediately below the Premier League, have expressed \"grave concerns\" about how the English Football League (EFL) renegotiated a new multi-million pound TV deal with British broadcast partner Sky.\n\nDespite a 35 percent increase on the previous deal, the \u00a3595 million ($761 million) agreement which is due to kick in from the start of next season and run until 2024 has not been well received by the majority of clubs.\n\nIn contrast, the Premier League domestic rights due to begin next season between Sky and BT Sport is worth \u00a34.55 billion over three years, with a further package sold to Amazon for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe terms of the new EFL deal were announced on Monday, leading to a meeting being between club officials the following day.

He has said publicly that he is thinking about running for president.\n\nThe Iowa Caucuses represent an early test for candidates on the road to their party's nomination for president. Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, edged out Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., by less than a percentage point in the 2016 caucuses. Eventual GOP nominee and President Donald Trump, on the other hand, lost the Republican Iowa Caucus to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nIt appears that Booker is looking to get a head start on the rest of the potential Democratic 2020 field in the crucial state. He has held discussions with Matt Paul, who led Clinton's Iowa Caucus operation in 2016, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter. Paul currently works as senior vice president for consulting firm Cornerstone Government Affairs.\n\nPaul and Booker held one of their earliest discussions in October, during the Iowa Democratic Party's annual fall gala in Des Moines in October. At the party, Paul, who is known as a \"state ambassador\" for Democrats considering a run for president, acted as an intermediary for Booker as he introduced him to dozens of political operatives and party activists, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe two have stayed in touch since the party, discussing a variety of topics, including how Democrats win during the Iowa Caucuses as well as the potentially expansive field of potential Democratic presidential candidates in 2020, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\nA person close to Booker emphasized that these conversations have been general in nature and that it is too early to say whether the New Jersey lawmaker will try to hire Paul as a consultant. Booker is also up for re-election to the Senate in 2020.\n\nA spokesman for Booker declined to comment. Paul did not return repeated requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Link, Obama's deputy director for paid media and research during his 2008 run for the White House, said he has also been in touch with Booker. According to Link's website, he coordinated all paid media and polling in 25 states, including seven battleground states, for Obama's campaign that year. Obama turned heads early on in the 2008 campaign, defeating Clinton in the Iowa Caucuses.\n\nBooker and Link also privately spoke at the gala, Link told CNBC in an interview. He said he has not heard from either Booker or his team since then. He noted, however, that his first meeting with the Democratic lawmaker at the party was an introduction. They also talked about the candidates Booker was backing at the time \u2013 and the rousing speech he gave that night.\n\n\"I thought he gave a great speech. He got the crowd really engaged and he did an excellent job there,\" Link said. \"He would be a real factor if he has a go here in Iowa.\"\n\nBooker's speech focused, in part, on a call to support women who run for office and those come forward with sexual assault allegations. The address came just hours after Democrats failed to block the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, a former federal appeals judge in D.C., was accused of sexual assaulting a girl when they were both in high school more than three decades ago. He vehemently denied this allegation and others that surfaced. The Senate confirmed him to the top court along mostly partisan lines, 50 to 48.\n\n\"We're not defined by a president who does not believe women,\" Booker said in his speech. \"We're gonna be defined when this state not only says that we believe women, but that we elect women!\"\n\nAt least 100 women went on to win their individual House races during the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nBooker has made other moves that indicate he is seriously preparing to run for president.\n\nNext month, he is reportedly set to a second trip to New Hampshire, which traditionally holds the first primary election of the campaign season. Politico recently reported that Booker has been reaching out to other potential consultants in that state as well as in South Carolina, another early primary state.\n\nRecently polling puts Booker in the top 10 of preferred presidential candidates for Democratic voters. According to a Morning Consult/ Politico poll, Booker is ranked sixth among Democrats' preferences for their 2020 candidate, scoring 3 percent of the vote. California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Texas Rep.

In September 2001, Amazon traded for under $6 per share.\n\nFast forward, Amazon in September 2018 became the second U.S. company to eclipse a stock market value of more than $1 trillion. (Apple was the first, a month before.) But since its all-time high of $2,050 per share on Sept. 4, Amazon lost 27 percent in the October and November rout as of Tuesday's close.\n\nHowever, Kerner said that kind of volatility, while troubling, is nothing compared to what longtime bitcoin investors must endure. \"There was a day in 2013 when we were down 70 percent overnight. Nobody likes being down like this. But this is what investing in crypto is all about.\"\n\nBitcoin became a phenomenon in 2017, skyrocketing from about $3,600 per coin to more than $19,000 in December of that year. But by February 2018, it fell under $7,000. After bouncing around for most of this year, bitcoin plunged about 30 percent over seven sessions to about $4,100 as of Tuesday. Other cryptocurrencies fared much worse. But bitcoin was actually up nearly 3 percent in early Wednesday trading.\n\n\"Crypto has been so weak because most of it there's no underlying value outside of confidence,\" Kerner said. \"[But] bitcoin, itself, we think is going to replace gold eventually. Gold is an $8 trillion thing.\"\n\n\"I think it's a store of value. I think it's the greatest store of value ever created,\" he added. \"It should surpass gold over time. It won't happen overnight.\"\n\nKerner isn't the only crypto investor who believes bitcoin will become the new gold. But there's plenty of skepticism among many Wall Street veterans, including J.P. Morgan chief Jamie Dimon who in September 2017 called bitcoin a fraud only to walk back those comments a bit about three months later.\n\nIn putting his faith in bitcoin, Kerner said he subscribes to Amara's law, which was coined by Stanford professor Roy Amara in the 1970s. It holds that the impact of all great technological change is overestimated in the short run, and subsequently underestimated in the long run. But in the meantime, he said he's \"holding on for dear life.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Sam Meredith", "title": "'Outrageous' and 'unacceptable': Saudi foreign minister rejects reports of a potential regime change", "description": "Saudi Arabia's foreign minister rejects reports suggesting a change in the kingdom's line of succession could be required following the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/khashoggi-case-saudi-foreign-minister-rejects-reports-of-a-potential-regime-change.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/21/105586527-1542798571211saudiarabiaaljubeir.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:25:00Z", "content": "\"The country is totally supportive of them.

Earnings, adjusted for pretax gains, came to $2.30 per share, 14 cents short of industry analyst projections, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue jumped 17 percent to $9.42 billion, driven by gains from the purchase of The Wirtgen Group, a construction company, late last year. Adjusted revenue of $8.34 billion fell short of Street forecasts for $8.59 billion.\n\nAgricultural equipment, the biggest division for Deere, reported a 3 percent boost in sales to $5.6 billion. Construction and forestry equipment sales surged 65 percent to $2.7 billion. Financial services and other revenue also rose.\n\nThere are concerns that the strong dollar and a slowdown in global growth could hurt future export sales for a wide swath of U.S. manufacturers, like Deere. The company said Wednesday that the strong dollar is could shave about 2 percent off of equipment sales for the year.\n\nThen there is the impact of President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies, which include higher tariffs on aluminum and steel along with penalty tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. China and other countries have already retaliated with penalty tariffs on American products.\n\nFor the year, Deere reported profit of $2.37 billion, or $7.24 per share. Revenue was reported as $33.35 billion.\n\nThe company expects a 7 percent boost in revenue in 2019, and profit of about $3.6 billion. It also expects continued growth in the U.S. housing market, along with economic growth worldwide, which would help to drive revenue at its construction unit.\n\nThere have been tremors in the home construction sector, which may also be driving some investors away.\n\nThe Commerce Department reported this week that while home construction improved a slight 1.5 percent in October, but in a troubling sign, ground breakings for single-family houses fell. That can serve as an indicator of things to come.\n\nHousing has stumbled in recent months as mortgage rates have climbed, putting the ability to buy a home or move up to a nicer property out of reach for more Americans. A sharp increase in mortgage rates has led to a marked decline in home construction since May, such that ground breakings have fallen 2.6 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nDeere shares have fallen 11 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has decreased 1 percent.

The assumption that the United States economy can absorb higher rates with slower money supply growth represents a massive change in Fed thinking.\n\nFor decades, the economy has functioned with the belief that the Greenspan \"put\" or the Bernanke \"ease\" will always be there. The belief was that economy need never worry about fund availability. Now one must question these beliefs.

Silly concepts like \"neutral interest rates\" will be thrown back into the dustbin of PR hype where they belong. The average Fed Funds rate from July 1954, when it was initiated, to the present has been 4.80 percent. The average Fed Funds rate in this century has been 1.71 percent. There is no \"neutral rate\" in these numbers.\n\nIt is time for straight thinking and realistic policy. The United States cannot shift from a financial system characterized by \"free\" amounts of unlimited money supply to one driven by costly funds that are not easily acquired.

The huge profit margins in the online advertising business made it hard to justify loading up on expensive salespeople and marketing campaigns.\n\nSo while Google was dithering alongside a large group of also-rans, Amazon Web Services was running away with cloud computing. Microsoft deftly moved into second place by pivoting its traditional software licensing business to a subscription-based cloud-first model.\n\nGreene was meant to change all that. She brought with her serious enterprise credentials as the co-founder and first CEO of VMware. In some sense, VMware helped kick off the cloud revolution by pioneering a technology called \"virtualization,\" which allowed the operators of data centers to squeeze more functionality out of the server hardware they bought and maintained. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has said \"there's no more successful female executive in Silicon Valley\" than Greene.\n\nPichai wrote in his introductory blog post in November 2015 that \"Diane needs no introduction.\" She would get her own dedicated sales team, pulling cloud software sales out from under the control of the core advertising business.\n\nOn Friday, that plan came to an abrupt halt when Greene announced that she will leave her post in January. Greene will be replaced by Thomas Kurian, who recently left a top executive role at Oracle, where he spent 22 years.\n\nDuring Greene's tenure, Google increased its annual capital expenditures from $10 billion to over $13 billion, and went on a hiring spree \u2014 the cloud group has added more people than any other at Alphabet over the last two years. It got some key customer wins and built out several important functions for selling to enterprises, including professional services, training and marketing.\n\nDespite all that, Google continues to struggle. People who follow the industry say it's a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft, with Google failing to keep pace in a cloud infrastructure market that Gartner expects to grow to $39.5 billion next year from $31 billion in 2018. In terms of market share, Google has yet to crack double digits.\n\n\"They figured out and monetized search like nobody probably ever will, but I don't think they care about the enterprise,\" said Tom Siebel, the co-founder of software company Siebel Systems, which Oracle acquired for almost $6 billion in 2006. Siebel, who has known Greene for about 15 years and is now CEO of cloud software company C3, said that when it comes to helping big businesses solve their infrastructure problems, \"Google is just not a factor.\"\n\nGreene put a positive spin on last week's announcement, saying that she was among the Google employees to interview Kurian for the job, along with Pichai and Urs Hoelzle, Google's eighth employee, who serves as senior vice president of technical infrastructure.\n\nGreene also said that when she took the position in 2015, she told family and friends that it would be for only two years."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Lauren Thomas", "title": "Gap looking to close hundreds of stores at malls 'quickly and aggressively'", "description": "Gap CEO Art Peck said that should the company \"address\" the bottom half of its fleet of Gap stores, it could contribute more than $100 million to earnings.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/gap-to-close-hundreds-of-stores-at-malls-quickly-and-aggressively.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/09/103620042-GettyImages-509572458.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:03:00Z", "content": "Gap Inc. is considering shutting hundreds of its namesake stores at shopping malls as sales at the Gap brand continue to slide. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The retailer said Tuesday evening that it still has 775 Gap-branded stores globally, in \u2026 [+2004 chars]", "fulltext": "Gap looking to close hundreds of stores at malls 'quickly and aggressively' 11:41 AM ET Wed, 21 Nov 2018 | 01:01\n\nGap Inc. is considering shutting hundreds of its namesake stores at shopping malls as sales at the Gap brand continue to slide.\n\nThe retailer said Tuesday evening that it still has 775 Gap-branded stores globally, in addition to those under the Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta banners.

Activist firm Third Point has been waging a proxy battle against Campbell, demanding that it put five of its nominees on its board.\n\nIn this contest for Campbell, it is seemingly no longer a question of whether it will add Third Point nominees but how many.\n\nThe number is significant. According to the bylaws, Campbell has 12 board members, with the ability to go to 14, with board approval. (Its bylaws could be amended to boost the board even more.) But the more Third Point nominees it adds, the more control of the boardroom Campbell cedes. That would mark a huge shift for a soup company steeply tied to its tradition of largely being run as a family company. Three of Campbell's heirs sit on its board. The descendant family owns at least 41 percent of the company.\n\nThird Point and its founder, Dan Loeb, which have a roughly 7 percent stake in Campbell, originally wanted to replace the soup company's entire board. Third Point is now aiming to add only five directors, it has said.\n\nIf Third Point gains board seats, it doesn't necessarily mean the entire company will get sold. While Third Point originally called for a sale of Campbell, it is unclear there is a buyer at a good price for the entire company.\n\nBut Third Point has been urging Campbell to consider a split, a move Campbell said it previously weighed along with a number of other strategic options. Having more influence on the board could make such a move more likely. It may also put pressure on Campbell's owners to act quickly.\n\nCampbell has already offered concessions, publicly stating its offer to add two of Third Point's nominees, as pressure from the investor community has mounted. That's even as Campbell Soup heirs, who hold roughly 41 percent of Campbell, have already pledged their support to the company.\n\nIts recent financial performance is not in its favor. The soup company has delivered 19 percent total shareholder return over the last 20 years, while the S&P 500 has nearly tripled in the same period. Its stock is down 16 percent since January, according to Factset, despite topping analysts' expectations for its quarterly earnings on Tuesday.\n\nNor is an opinion written by influential shareholder advisory firm ISS. Last week ISS came out in support of all five of Third Point's nominees.\n\n\"Given the board's subpar oversight of critical issues such as M&A and succession planning, shareholders may wonder whether the incumbent board is capable of steering Campbell back on track in a timely manner,\" ISS said.\n\nThe advisory firm also raised questions about Campbell's dedication to its dividend despite its poor financial performance.\n\n\"Maintaining the dividend may prove to be the right decision, though it raises the question of whether the board, which currently includes three members of the founding family, is truly considering all options,\" the opinion said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Michelle Fox", "title": "Wells Fargo's Scott Wren dismisses risks: 'You need to be stepping in here and buying some stocks'", "description": "Investors are concerned about three key risks but they may be worrying for nothing, says strategist Scott Wren.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/wells-fargo-you-need-to-be-stepping-in-here-and-buying-some-stocks.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/07/102318338-RTR4KF2L.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:21:00Z", "content": "Investors are concerned about three key risks but they may be worrying for nothing, strategist Scott Wren told CNBC on Tuesday. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The questions of whether there will be a policy mistake by the Federal Reserve, whether \u2026 [+1538 chars]", "fulltext": "Investors are concerned about three key risks but they may be worrying for nothing, strategist Scott Wren told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nThe questions of whether there will be a policy mistake by the Federal Reserve, whether global growth is going to slow and whether there will be a margin squeeze have been weighing on investors, causing stocks to sell off, he said.\n\n\"If your answer is 'no' to all of those, which that is our answer, you need to be stepping in here and buying some stocks,\" said Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\n\"Not that they are zero probabilities, but we believe they are low probabilities.
