It originally appeared on scmp.com on Nov. 17, 2018.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Vice President Mike Pence traded barbs at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea on Saturday, with each laying the blame for the trade war and growing geopolitical rivalry at the other\u2019s doorstep, while also seeking to sell their vision of a regional development strategy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn a speech lasting almost 40 minutes, Xi urged the business and political leaders gathered in Port Moresby to uphold free trade and promote a multilateral system.\n\n\u201cUnilateralism and protectionism will not solve problems but add uncertainty to the world economy,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, produces no winners.\u201d\n\nWhen it was his turn to take to the podium, Pence was equally fervent but far more direct in his criticism.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for President Xi and China, but as we all know, China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years and those days are over,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHe then leveled a number of accusations at Beijing, including its insistence on forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Pence said, adding that there was still room for the White House to introduce new tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nSince July, Washington has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, while Beijing has slapped similar duties on $110 billion worth of goods it imports from the US. In September, President Donald Trump threatened to extend the tariffs to all of the products it imports from China.\n\nNeither Xi nor Pence listened to the other\u2019s speech, both of which were delivered from a conference room on a cruise ship moored in Port Moresby harbour.\n\nDespite his hard line, Pence said Washington \u201cbelieved progress could be made\u201d when Trump and Xi meet in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires at the end of the month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit. The talks will be the first between the two leaders since the trade war began.\n\nAside from airing their grievances on trade, Xi and Pence were equally keen to promote their nations\u2019 respective plans for regional cooperation, respectively the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d and Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\n\u201cThe belt and road [plan] is an open platform for cooperation. [It is] neither designed to serve any hidden political agendas nor to target anyone,\u201d Xi said.\n\n\u201cIt does not cause debt traps, as some want to label it, [but] is a transparent project that brings common development to the world.\u201d\n\nXi launched the trillion-dollar program in 2013 as a way to boost connectivity between China and the Eurasian land mass.\n\nPence, however, made a thinly veiled attack of China\u2019s controversial overseas infrastructure building spree.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, some are offering infrastructure loans to governments across the Indo-Pacific and around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cYet the terms of those loans are often vague at best, projects they support are often unsustainable \u2026 too often they come with strings attached.\u201d\n\nWhile he made no specific references to China, Pence urged governments in Asia to consider Washington\u2019s Indo-Pacific Strategy, which is backed by Australia and Japan, as a preferable alternative to the belt and road plan.\n\n\u201cKnow that the U.S. offers a better option,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt, we don\u2019t coerce, or compromise your independence \u2026 We don\u2019t offer a constricting belt or a one way road.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of China\u2019s growing militarization of the disputed South China Sea, Pence said the U.S. would partner Australia on the upgrading of the Lombrum naval base on the Pacific nation\u2019s Manus island.\n\nInfrastructure development, including roads, railways, ports, pipelines and airports, would be the priority of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, Pence said, adding that the U.S. would adopt a \u201cprincipled approach that will stand in contrast to some other nations\u201d.\n\nThe tension between the two nations was also evident at a photo call for the leaders of the 21 Apec member nations on Saturday afternoon. While Xi stood beside Papua New Guinean President Peter O\u2019Neill, Pence was noticeably absent from the shot.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry reported that the vice president met the self-ruled island\u2019s envoy to Apec, Morris Chang, and discussed ways to \u201cboost inclusive growth and shape the digital future\u201d.\n\nPence described his meeting with Chang as being \u201cabout economics\u201d. \u201cThey were strong supporters of TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] and made a case for being considered for a free-trade agreement. And I assured them we would carry back that ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn contrast, there were no reports of meetings between Chinese and American officials at the event.\n\nXi is currently on a seven-day tour of the Asia-Pacific region. After leaving Papua New Guinea he will travel to Brunei and the Philippines for state visits, and attend the G20 summit from November 30 to December 1 in Buenos Aires.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "qforgey@politico.com (Quint Forgey)", "title": "Trump schedules Mississippi rallies to boost Hyde-Smith", "description": "The Republican senator's campaign has become the subject of national scrutiny over the past week.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/17/trump-hyde-smith-mississippi-senate-1000496", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/94/b7/ceb5e0fe4bad91b1fdc1f769e5da/181117-trump-hyde-smith-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T19:46:07Z", "content": "President Donald Trump's upcoming rallies for Sen.

He did not travel here after last year's massive wildfire in Santa Rosa, the January mudslide in Montecito or the fatal Carr Fire in Redding this summer.\n\nTrump and Newsom at times paused to speak to each other in front of the charred wreckage. Trump appeared to assent as Newsom spoke to him and gesticulated, and Trump repeatedly called Newsom by his first name during subsequent remarks to the media.\n\n\u201cJerry and I have been speaking, and Gavin and I have gotten to know each other, and we\u2019re all going to work together,\" Trump said, flanked by Newsom and Brown. He offered Newsom a chance to speak, which the governor-elect declined.\n\nTrump said they were \u201call on the same path\u201d regarding the need to work on \"the forest floor.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll be working also with environmental groups,\" he added. \"I think everybody has seen the light.\u201d\n\nJoining Trump on Air Force One were two of his top allies from California\u2019s diminishing Republican congressional delegation: newly elected Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents the area ravaged by flames.\n\nAfter arriving at Beale Air Force Base, they left with Brown and Newsom by helicopter for the Paradise fire zone about 60 miles north.\n\nAs he sought to consolidate support for his leadership bid, McCarthy aligned himself closely with the president. In Paradise, Trump heralded their relationship, thanking McCarthy for \u201cthe support you\u2019ve given in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cKevin, anything we can do, you know we\u2019re here. Just bring it over to the office,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNewsom and Trump have long been locked in a dance of mutual enmity, each regularly invoking the other to galvanize their respective bases: Newsom positions himself as the champion of California's alternative to Trumpism, while the president caricatures Newsom on the campaign trail as an extreme liberal who wants to open borders and distribute free health care.\n\nStill, the social media reaction underscored the political peril, with detractors questioning Newsom's decision and equating it to an act of betrayal.\n\nNumerous users said Newsom and Brown should use the opportunity to demand that Trump apologize for his tweets faulting California for the severity of the fires or to challenge the accuracy of his claims. While some praised the show of unity, others said Newsom should have skipped the appearance to send a statement. More than a few mentioned that Newsom\u2019s ex-wife Kimberly Guilfoyle is now dating Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. and wondered whether the relationship would come up.\n\nWhen Trump a week ago responded to the natural disaster ravaging California by deriding the state's management and threatening to halt federal help, Newsom joined Democrats heaping on criticism. \"Lives have been lost. Entire towns have been burned to the ground. Cars abandoned on the side of the road. People are being forced to flee their homes. This is not a time for partisanship,\" he said.\n\nThe sight of Brown alongside Trump was also jarring, given how the current governor has sparred with Trump \u2014 particularly over the White House's unraveling of policies intended to blunt the effects of climate change, a signature issue for Brown. Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace in an interview set to air Sunday that while an altered climate contributed \"a little bit\" to voracious wildfires, forest management was the larger culprit, and he reiterated on Saturday that he believes better management of forests is the paramount issue.\n\nWhile Trump is reviled by much of the California electorate, the area at the heart of the fire's devastation supported the president in 2016. In the town of Paradise, almost completely destroyed by the Camp Fire, Trump won 53 percent of the votes in 2016, compared with 37 percent for Hillary Clinton.\n\nLaMalfa, the Republican who represents the area, told McClatchy that he had invited Trump and echoed the president's calls to better manage the trees on which fires feed."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "qforgey@politico.com (Quint Forgey)", "title": "Trump disputes NYT report that he asked aides about Pence's loyalty", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t question his loyalty at all,\u201d the president said.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/17/trump-pence-loyal-new-york-times-1000493", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/fa/c2/36fc38db463080f99e75f423b78c/181117-trump-pence-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T18:26:36Z", "content": "President Donald Trump referred to Vice President Mike Pence as a trooper who has already been tested, in many ways. | Al Drago - Pool/Getty Images President Donald Trump on Saturday reaffirmed his confidence in Mike Pence, repeatedly slamming a report in the\u2026 [+3187 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump referred to Vice President Mike Pence as \u201ca trooper\u201d who has \u201calready been tested, in many ways.\u201d | Al Drago - Pool/Getty Images White House Trump disputes NYT report that he asked aides about Pence's loyalty\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reaffirmed his confidence in Mike Pence, repeatedly slamming a report in the New York Times that asserted Trump has questioned the loyalty of his vice president, while claiming against available evidence that the newspaper had not sought comment before publication.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times did a phony story, as usual, about my relationship with @VP Mike Pence,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey made up sources and refused to ask me, the only one that would know, for a quote....\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump added: \u201c....I can\u2019t imagine any President having a better or closer relationship with their Vice President then the two of us.

Lawmakers from both parties have been working furiously to build support for the compromise legislation that would begin to reverse some of the tough-on-crime federal policies of the 1980s and 1990s that incarcerated African-American offenders at much higher rates than white offenders.\u201d NYT\n\nELIANA JOHNSON: \u201cJohn Kelly makes final bid to save Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s job\u201d: \u201cWhite House chief of staff John Kelly is fighting to save Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security chief at whom President Donald Trump has lashed out for the rise in border apprehensions over the past several months. Kelly, whose fate in the administration is also unclear, is working to convince the president that Nielsen is not to blame for a recent surge in arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border that has enraged him, according to two sources familiar with the conversations.\n\n\u201cNielsen also has other supporters, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have told Trump that Nielsen cannot control the border crossing rate. ... Kelly\u2019s bid to save Nielsen may be motivated in part by an understanding that, with Nielsen gone, he would be almost completely isolated in an administration that several of his onetime allies have departed.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS \u2026\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S SPENCER HSU: \u201cMaria Butina, alleged Russian agent who met with NRA and other groups, is in plea talks\u201d: \u201cAttorneys for a Russian woman jailed on charges of seeking to infiltrate the National Rifle Association and other American conservative groups for the Russian government are in negotiations with federal prosecutors, both sides said in a court filing Friday.

Mueller III had Washington reporters fidgeting all week long in the expectation that Roger Stone or Jerome Corsi or someone else connected to the scandal would get slapped in the kisser with criminal charges. Late on Thursday, news of a criminal indictment did bring joy to the press, but it wasn't what they expected at all. News dribbled out that\u2014thanks to a clip-and-paste flub into a court filing by federal prosecutors\u2014international man of mystery and WikiLeaks chief Julian Assange stands secretly charged with something or other.\n\nThat something or other could be, take your pick, his role in 2010 in disseminating via WikiLeaks the diplomatic cables and other materials stolen by Chelsea Manning or for posting to his site the purloined Democratic Party emails in 2016. Or maybe both. Or who knows? The indictment was sealed in deference to the \u201cneeds of law enforcement,\u201d the passage states, and \u201cdue to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity of the case.\u201d The news galvanized First Amendment Twitter. Flush with its temporary restraining order victory in the Jim Acosta affair, it rose to defend Assange even before anybody\u2014outside the Department of Justice, that is\u2014knew what crimes he\u2019d been charged with.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDuring his decade in the spotlight, Assange has hit the cardinal as well as the ordinal points on the public\u2019s compass. He\u2019s been lionized by the left as a truth-teller and savaged by the right as a traitor to the West. He\u2019s cozied up to the Russians (his deputy helped ensconce whistleblower Edward Snowden safely in Moscow) but become a TV buddy of Fox News Channel talker Sean Hannity. Depending on his most recent performance, he\u2019s denounced as a sociopath or celebrated as a savior. Who in the 21st century has forced so much sputtering indignation and flip-flopping? The prospect that he might soon appear in a U.S. courtroom and defend his deed is both chilling and thrilling to the journalists who have covered and sometimes abetted him.\n\nThe Assange indictment doesn\u2019t appear to be the product of Mueller\u2019s investigation, but interest in Assange occupies a place of primacy in the Mueller investigation timeline. WikiLeaks posted the trove of emails allegedly stolen from Democrats during the campaign by previously indicted Russian intelligence officers, although Assange has consistently\u2014and not very convincingly\u2014denied that the Russians were the source of the emails. The nature of the connections among the Trump campaign team, WikiLeaks, and the Russian officers has been one of the mainstays of the Mueller probe. Stone, an unreliable witness if ever there was one, was an early Trump supporter who has both bragged about his intimate relationship with WikiLeaks and Assange and denied having an intimate relationship with the operation. He's also claimed intimate foreknowledge of the WikiLeaks dump of the emails and denied that he knew anything that wasn't public domain. Donald Trump Jr., the easy mark of the Trump campaign, has also dallied with WikiLeaks. President Donald Trump, of course, has been effusive in his praise for WikiLeaks, speaking of his \u201clove\u201d for the organization and its email dumps repeatedly during the presidential campaign.\n\nUsing a criminal indictment to muscle Assange into telling all he knows about the provenance of the stolen emails and what part\u2014if any\u2014Trump and his campaign played in spreading them would track with standard federal prosecutor conduct. Assange, who appears to be on the verge of eviction (with his cat) from his safe space in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, has long feared extradition to the United States on Espionage Act charges. Although the feds don't appear to have an open-and-shut case against him in the Manning or email affairs\u2014he can cite legitimate First Amendment protections for much of his work\u2014prosecutors might have secret dirt on him that would stick in court. Perhaps the indictment is part of a plea-deal scheme to extract from Assange everything he knows about the Russians in return for a light sentence for his \u201ccrimes.\u201d Or maybe I\u2019m wrong and this theory is just more Washington columnist fidgeting.\n\nThe press corps wasn\u2019t alone in its high anxiety this week. The president, who has reportedly spent the week completing the homework questions Mueller sent over to the White House, reached new heights of ferocity in his Twitter account, calling the \u201cinner workings of the Mueller probe\u201d a \u201ctotal mess\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Who might have told him about the inner workings? Could it be our faux attorney general, Matthew Whitaker? If true, CNN reported, \u201cthat would raise concerns that Trump was possibly trying to interfere with the probe.\u201d He wouldn't do that, would he?\n\nHe would if he could. Meanwhile, former Roger Stone aide Andrew Miller is attempting to do what Trump dreams about. Miller is challenging a grand jury subpoena to testify by invoking the legal theory that Mueller's appointment to the position of special prosecutor was unconstitutional to begin with. (His argument boils down to this: Mueller has too much unaccountable power.) This dispute could stretch for months, further elongating the Mueller investigation until it's resolved. And my Politico colleagues reported this week that Mueller and Paul Manafort had pushed back to Nov. 26 the filing of a status report that precedes Manafort's sentencing. It\u2019s safe to speculate that Manafort is still sharing information with Mueller. Rick Gates, who also plead guilty to Mueller charges, is likewise in sentencing limbo as he continues to talk.\n\nEverybody seems to be talking, even Trump himself, who said he has answered the special counsel\u2019s questions but hasn\u2019t turned them in yet. The latest cooperator is accused and jailed Russian agent Mariia Butina, who although not a target of the Mueller probe, appears to have roamed similar turf. In July, she was charged with having conspired against the United States as an agent directed by a high-level member of the Russian government. Now, Butina is working on a plea agreement with prosecutors according to court filings (previously she asked the court to dismiss the charges as \u201cunconstitutional\u201d). According to the Washington Post, Butina tried to cultivate \u201cback-channel\u201d relationships with the Republican Party\u2019s 2016 presidential candidates and bridge build with the National Rifle Association in a way that would give Russians official access and influence over the party.\n\n\u201cSilence is a weapon,\u201d former FBI agent Ali Soufan told GQ, referencing the stealthy, no-nonsense tactics of his onetime boss, Mueller. Mueller\u2019s disciplined silence has made intuiting his intentions impossible, so it doesn\u2019t pay to speculate too long on whether he\u2019s got Assange in his sights. But let\u2019s say he did. Isn\u2019t this the way he\u2019d land the big fish that nobody else has been able to hook?\n\n******\n\nHow best to condition the press? Wind sprints or beatings?

There is no messenger. There is no money. And there is no infrastructure.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like Madrid also mourned another low point this week: the defeat of Southern California Assemblyman Dante Acosta, marking the demise of the last GOP Latino legislator \u2014 in a state where Latinos comprise the fastest-growing electorate.\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

The Grand Old Party is dead,\u201d wrote former state GOP Assembly leader Kristin Olsen, who startled fellow Republicans with a brutally frank op-ed this week saying Republicans must acknowledge their \u201cserious problem\u201d in California, particularly the effects of toxicity of President Trump.\n\nGOP strategist John Weaver, who has worked California races and also has represented the presidential campaign of Ohio governor John Kasich, seconded Olsen\u2019s view, tweeting that the effects of the Trump presidency have doomed any chance of resurrection. \u201cIn one fell swoop Trump & Republicans who willingly handcuffed themselves to him have turned Orange County into a GOP wasteland,\u2019\u2019 he tweeted this week. \u201cYou want to see the future? Look no further than the demographic death spiral in the place once considered a cornerstone of the party.\u201d\n\nMadrid argues that many California Republican leaders remain in complete denial of the fact that their continued support of Trump presidency has sealed the fate of the GOP \u2014 and last week\u2019s midterm elections revealed the true extent of the GOP\u2019s rot in California, where the state party has now shrunken to third party status.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s just open warfare. The barbarians have broken through the gates. The army is in full retreat,\u2019\u2019 said Madrid, who adds there\u2019s no hope left for a party that for years has been on a path toward destruction. \u201cBurn it to the ground. I want to reconstitute.\u2019\u2019\n\nRepublicans looking at the ashes of the midterm results say they must envision what a new party will look like \u2014 after the current structure and its leadership has been entirely disassembled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the question: how do you start over?,\u2019\u2019 said Joel Fox, a longtime GOP strategist who publishes the \u201cFox & Hounds Daily\u201d commentary site. He says the answer will be more wide-ranging than finding \u201cone dynamic leader\u201d \u2014 celebrity or billionaire \u2014 to rescue their cause.\n\n\u201cThe rise of the Republican Party may really depend on the Democratic Party,\u2019\u2019 Fox said, and how it handles the heady times of having a $14 billion surplus and a supermajority under the leadership of the incoming Governor-elect Gavin Newsom. If progressives try to push their agenda too far, and land too many pro-tax ballot measures in front of the voters in future ballots \u2014 including revisions of the landmark property tax measure Prop. 13, soda taxes and oil taxes \u2014 it\u2019s possible they will create an opening for the GOP to return to viability.\n\nNot everyone agrees that Trump is the cause for the party\u2019s bottoming out. This week, former state GOP chair Shawn Steel, a member of the Republican National Committee, argued in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner that \u201cit\u2019s not Trump\u201d who lost Orange County dominance for the party. He laid the blame on millions of dollars in \u201cdark money\u201d raised by Democrats, who he said were aided by better organization and help from the tech industry in Silicon Valley. And \u2014 without any substantiation \u2014 Steel also claimed Democratic voter registration drives produced \u201cborderline fraudulent turnout rates\u201d in some key districts.\n\nAlready, a leading pro-Trump Republican voice \u2014 former gubernatorial candidate Assemblyman Travis Allen, a far-right conservative who fully supports the president\u2019s wall and immigration policies \u2014 has kicked off his campaign to head the state GOP, announcing that it\u2019s time to \u201ctake back California.\u201d\n\nBut a growing number of Republicans in the party\u2019s #NeverTrump wing \u2014 which includes prominent strategists like Rob Stutzman and Luis Alvarado \u2014 insist that a new beginning will rely heavily on a full-throated repudiation of Trump\u2019s caustic divisiveness. They believe the rebuilding process could require years, if not generations, to rid the state GOP of the taint of a president who is blamed for ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment in a state that is home to more immigrants than any other in the country.\n\nGil Cisneros was elected to a U.S. House seat in California\u2019s 39th District, one of six seats Democrats picked up in the state. | Chris Carlson/AP Photo\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the dilapidated Republican Party in California has faced a dire outlook \u2014 or debated the notion that it must be completely overhauled. In 2007, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was lambasted by Republicans when he delivered an address to their state convention warning that the GOP was \u201cdying at the box office\u2019\u2019 because they lacked inclusive messaging and policies, particularly to minorities who now dominate the state\u2019s demographics.\n\nAnd in assuming the leadership of the party in 2013, former state Sen. Jim Brulte predicted it would take at least six years to rebuild the structure and fundraising strength of Republican in California. He warned then that Republicans would need to \u201ceither stop the bleeding and/or start turning it around\u201d in 2014 --- or the party will be in the pits \u201cfor the rest of the decade.\u201d\n\nNone of that altered the party\u2019s downward trajectory, however, or caused a wholesale rethinking among some leading candidates and party leaders. Madrid cites the recent gubernatorial contest in which Republican nominee John Cox, who described himself repeatedly as a \u201cJack Kemp\u201d Republican, pushed for Trump policies that are abhorrent to many Californians.\n\n\u201cIt is completely unfathomable ... for a Republican nominee to run on building a wall,\u2019\u2019 said Madrid, a nationally recognized expert on Latino voting trends who noted that the party has spent 20 years trying to extricate itself from the damage done by Prop. 187, the anti-illegal immigration ballot measure that eviscerated Latino support in the state. \u201cAnd everyone acts like it\u2019s normal ... Cox was running on that, in California. Are you out of your mind?\u201d\n\nMadrid, who most recently advised the gubernatorial campaign of former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, said the party needs to stop looking for silver bullets \u2014 like a gas tax repeal \u2014 and confront the disintegration of some of the state GOP\u2019s once most reliable electorates, especially college-educated voters and women.\n\n\u201cWe hemorrhaged college-educated Republican voters on Tuesday night. The \u2018diploma divide\u2019 is a very real thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller it gets, the more monolithic is gets. The whiter it gets. The more populist-nationalist it gets. What you\u2019re seeing in the Republican Party is that it\u2019s the party of white identity politics.\u201d\n\nDemocratic political strategist Darry Sragow says if the party continues on its current path, its complete disintegration is entirely predictable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re down to 24 percent registration. And the reason is that they have a huge deficit with Latinos, with African Americans...and with Asian Americans. And they now have a deficit with whites,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a party where 77 percent of Republican likely voters in California are white. And the population that\u2019s white here is 39 percent.\u201d\n\nHis advice: \u201cThey have to take down the \u2018whites only\u2019 sign from the clubhouse door,\u2019\u2019 Sragow says. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re willing to allow people who aren\u2019t white into the club, they may be able to recover.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI think that the GOP is capable of turning itself around, because it\u2019s a well-established brand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe problem is, the people who manage the party are going to have to be willing to do that. And by definition, they are the opposite of that. They have no interest in that.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "(Associated Press)", "title": "Fire death toll rises to 71 ahead of Trump\u2019s California visit", "description": "The president on Saturday is expected to get a look at the grief and damage caused by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/california-fires-trump-visit-death-toll-1000486", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/cb/b6/896e974b4c15b6ef75143305e044/181116-californiafires-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T03:09:26Z", "content": "A firefighter searches for human remains in a trailer park destroyed in the Camp Fire on Nov. 16 in Paradise, Calif. | John Locher/AP Photo CHICO, Calif.

Bill Nelson has no way to make up his 12,603-vote deficit with Gov. Rick Scott. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo 'Nelson has no path': Democrats admit Scott beats Florida icon\n\nSen. Bill Nelson has run out of time, run out of favorable court rulings and is about to officially run out of votes.\n\nAfter losing to Gov. Rick Scott on Election Day, losing after an automatic recount and appearing to not make up the gap following a manual recount Friday, Nelson\u2019s campaign was dealt a mortal blow later that evening by U.S. District Judge Mark E. Walker, who crushed the Democrat\u2019s last major hope by upholding a Florida law that forbids county election offices from counting vote-by-mail ballots received after 7 p.m. Election Day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s done. But it was done before today. This was a total Hail Mary,\u201d said a top Democrat involved in Nelson\u2019s campaign who didn\u2019t want to speak publicly before the Democratic Party icon conceded defeat to one of the party's most-hated rivals.\n\nThe night before, Walker had rejected yet another Nelson lawsuit concerning standards for divining voter intent in manual recounts, and he refused to extend the deadlines of the recount.\n\nWithout favorable court rulings to expand the available ballot pool, Nelson has no way to make up his 12,603-vote deficit with Scott. Nelson can still appeal, but Democrats said that\u2019s highly unlikely, considering Walker has historically appeared more sympathetic to their arguments compared to appeals courts.\n\nThe counties officially have to submit their manual recount totals to the state Sunday. The election is supposed to be certified Tuesday.\n\nOn Friday, Nelson gave an emotional \u201cthank you\u201d speech to staff earlier in the day \u201cbut it was more of a goodbye,\u201d said yet another top Florida Democrat connected to Nelson\u2019s re-election. A third source added that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and its mammoth recount ground force is starting to leave Florida: \u201cDSCC is packing up and headed north\u201d \u2014 an assertion disputed by a DSCC official who said \u201cno one\u2019s leaving.\u201d\n\nWhile party officials refused to discuss the hopelessness of the situation on the record, the Florida Democratic Party on Friday continued to fundraise off the recount, suggesting to donors that Nelson had a shot when his own top backers knew he didn\u2019t.\n\nNelson, a three-term U.S. Senator, was the last Democratic statewide elected official in Florida for years. First elected to the Florida House in 1972, he served as a member of the U.S. House and as insurance commissioner before being elected to the Senate in 2000. He only lost one race: a Democratic primary for governor against party legend \u201cWalkin\u2019\u201d Lawton Chiles in 1990.\n\nScott's defeat of Nelson certifies him as a Democratic giant-killer who continues to prove party elites wrong. In three straight elections, Democratic insiders have predicted his defeat. Scott first beat Alex Sink, the woman once thought to be the future of the party, in his first gubernatorial race. Then he defeated former Gov. Charlie Crist, a once-highly popular governor. And now he has bested the one politician Democrats thought was unbeatable in a Florida general election, Nelson.\n\nScott called on Nelson to withdraw.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the courts have denied Bill Nelson\u2019s desperate attempt to change Florida law after the election. It\u2019s long past time for Bill Nelson to face the facts: this charade is over, Floridians' votes have been counted multiple times, and Rick Scott is the next Senator from Florida,\" said Chris Hartline, Scott's campaign spokesperson.\n\nLike Nelson's official campaign spokespeople, the Democrat\u2019s usually voluble recount attorney, Marc Elias, fell uncharacteristically quiet Friday after the recounts and before Walker\u2019s ruling.\n\nElias this week has held daily conference calls with reporters and \u2014 contrary to the assertions of experts who spoke to POLITICO \u2014 had insisted throughout that Nelson had a shot. But Elias acknowledged Thursday evening it would take more than \u201cone silver bullet ...[to] ... change the margin in this race.\u201d\n\nDuring that call, Elias said Nelson was relying on a court ruling to potentially count absentee and provisional ballots that had been rejected because the voter\u2019s signature did not match the signature on file. The state estimated Friday that 5,686 such ballots existed. But even if all somehow voted for Nelson, he still would come up short against Scott.\n\nElias also hoped that the manual recounts, which wrapped up Friday, would produce new loads of votes for Nelson \u2014 especially in Broward County, where he estimated 23,000 votes in the Democratic-rich area might not have been properly read by machines in the precincts on Election Day. In pushing this narrative, Elias specifically tried to bat down experts who said that the county\u2019s bad ballot design \u2014 the Senate race was tucked in the lower left-hand corner beneath the instructions \u2014 caused many voters to not see the race and therefore not vote in it.\n\nBut after the recount Friday in Broward, observers in the room said there was no batch of hidden votes. People just undervoted the race by disproportionate margins compared to the 66 other counties.\n\n\u201cThe votes weren\u2019t there. It was bad ballot design,\u201d said Democratic data analyst Matt Isbell, who first raised the issue of the undervotes after Election Night. \u201cNelson has no path.\u201d\n\nLate Friday, the Scott campaign reported that Nelson netted fewer than 300 votes in Broward County after the recount. The campaign obtained the numbers through a public records request.\n\nThe third \u201csilver bullet\u201d Elias was hoping for concerned the mail-in ballots that were not received at county offices before 7 p.m. Election Day. The estimated number of these ballots is unclear, but likely totaled in the thousands.\n\nElias had said the ballot-receipt rule was unfair because overseas absentee ballots that were postmarked before Election Day could continue to be counted through Friday, Nov. 16.\n\nBut Judge Walker said the rule just helps soldiers and other U.S. citizens who are disadvantaged by the mail system since they\u2019re overseas, and that this effort to give them a little help does not disadvantage domestic absentee-ballot voters.\n\nWalker also noted that the challenge of a longstanding law by Nelson came too late in the process, and that the state at a certain point has the right to fix the deadlines it wants to make sure elections are orderly.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there might be problems with the mail does not outweigh the state\u2019s important interest in delineating finality in elections. To hold otherwise could call into question the entirety of the vote-by-mail system itself,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe restriction is reasonable, and the state\u2019s regulatory interest is sufficient to justify the deadline.\u201d\n\nAnd though other states allow absentee ballots to be received after Election Day as long as they\u2019re postmarked by Election Day, the judge said that has no bearing on Florida.\n\n\u201cA later or more lenient deadline in other states may not a constitutional violation make,\u201d he ruled."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bgriffiths@politico.com (Brent D.

He was killed Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThis week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.\n\nAmong those targeted for sanctions were Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate, and Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince\u2019s entourage on trips abroad.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.\n\nAlso this week, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing. The prosecutor\u2019s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom\u2019s leadership, primarily the crown prince.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \u201cthe cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\u201d\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nThe Post, citing unnamed sources, also reported that U.S. intelligence agencies reviewed a phone call that the prince\u2019s brother, Khalid bin Salman, had with Khashoggi. The newspaper said the prince\u2019s brother, who is the current Saudi ambassador to the United States, told Khashoggi he would be safe in going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents he needed to get married.\n\nThe newspaper said it was not known whether the ambassador knew Khashoggi would be killed. But it said he made the call at the direction the crown prince, and the call was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington, said that claim was false.\n\nShe said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that the ambassador met Khashoggi in person once in late September 2017. After that, they communicated via text messages, she said. The last text message the ambassador sent to Khashoggi was on Oct. 26, 2017, she said.\n\nBaeshen said the ambassador did not discuss with Khashoggi \u201canything related to going to Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbassador Prince Khalid bin Salman has never had any phone conversations with him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are welcome to check the phone records and cell phone content to corroborate this \u2014 in which case, you would have to request it from Turkish authorities,\u201d Baeshen said, adding that Saudi prosecutors have checked the phone records numerous times to no avail.\n\nThe ambassador himself tweeted: \u201cThe last contact I had with Mr. Khashoggi was via text on Oct. 26, 2017.

He has for months been lobbying for a \u201cbig job\u201d in the administration, according to a former White House official, who said Canterbury\u2019s name was bandied about for several roles.\n\nCanterbury has a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Trump, according to a close friend, and has been a regular presence at White House listening sessions on immigration and issues affecting law enforcement. At a late October board meeting, he told colleagues he was flattered to have had his name floated for ATF chief, but had not formally been offered the job, according to a person in the room. This person said Canterbury is currently running for an eighth term as head of the FOP, describing the competitive re-election process as \u201clike running for Congress nationwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cChuck is one of the most honorable people I\u2019ve ever worked with and if he is selected, I can\u2019t think of a finer person to take the position,\u201d Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, told POLITICO.\n\nBut Thompson\u2019s group, which represents over 3,000 elected sheriffs in the U.S., was among several to forcefully push back on the legislation, claiming in a statement this week that the bill would \u201crelease dangerous criminals back into our communities\u2026 [and] falls far short in the funding, personnel and social services needed to protect our communities.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators who have withheld support for the measure, which would require 60 \u201cyes\u201d votes to pass the upper chamber, cited the opposition by Thompson\u2019s organization in defending their own position.\n\n\u201cI put great weight on the views of those sheriffs,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). \u201cThey have grave concerns about a \u2018social experiment\u2019 of this kind.\u201d\n\nLike other opponents, Cotton said he would prefer that the legislation \u201cfocus on prison reform and give prisoners who are on their way out of prison a chance to land on their feet,\u201d instead of introducing greater leniency in mandatory minimum sentencing for serious offenders.\n\nThe Fraternal Order\u2019s endorsement puzzled its law enforcement community allies in part because it was a reversal of its earlier position.\n\nCanterbury and his team had several meetings and phone calls with White House officials, including the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, between August, when the group reportedly described the proposal as \u201cunworkable,\u201d and Trump\u2019s declaration of support this week. \u201cThere were regular phone conversations with staff and we sent a letter to the president articulating our concerns,\u201d said FOP executive director Jim Pasco.\n\n\u201cPasco said the group struck \u201ccommon ground\u201d after changes were made to the bill, including the removal of conditions that would have eased existing limitations on early release for persons who used firearms in the commission of their crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be well-defined that violent felons wouldn\u2019t get reduced sentences,\u201d Canterbury told the Washington Post.\n\nOthers suggested the FOP was never truly against the legislation and made it easy for the administration to secure their support. \u201cThey were ready to fold pretty quickly,\u201d said the law enforcement official, who claimed the group at one point simply requested a \u201cstudy on the effects\u201d of the legislation in order to throw their weight behind it.\n\nThose claiming the group\u2019s endorsement was linked in some fashion to Canterbury angling for a Trump administration post are playing \u201cpart of the game in Washington,\u201d Pasco said.\n\n\u201cIt was a confluence of timing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious or untoward,\u201d added the person close to Canterbury.\n\nShould the bill pass the Senate, it would return to the House where proponents of the legislation have already begun whipping support in its favor. One potential problem as the plan moves forward is acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has privately warned Trump about aspects of the bill related to illicit drugs. However, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Post that Whitaker \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to kill it\u201d following a meeting with the interim attorney general."}]
