Cory Booker is signing on as an original backer of the criminal justice package backed by President Donald Trump, giving the deal valuable momentum with Democrats even as it splits the Senate GOP.\n\nBooker's support for the carefully-crafted agreement to overhaul prison and sentencing laws also puts him in rare alignment with a president whom he's openly considering challenging in 2020. But the New Jersey Democrat said his decision to endorse the deal \u2014 which backers are pushing to vote on during this year's lame-duck session \u2014 has nothing to do with those considerations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I don\u2019t give a damn about politics when thousands of people are incarcerated unjustly,\" Booker told POLITICO on Thursday. \"This is about people, this is about justice, this is about righting wrongs. And this bill does a lot in that.\"\n\nThe final agreement, released by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) late Thursday, also includes a key priority of Booker's: bipartisan legislation he's spearheaded that would largely end the practice of juvenile solitary confinement on the federal level. While the criminal justice legislation faces major obstacles in the divided Senate Republican conference, where Arkansas' Tom Cotton is opposed to its easing of some mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, Booker's early thumbs-up is poised to help solidify Democratic votes.\n\nBooker said he would \"start reaching out to our caucus\" to corral support for the final agreement, and \"I imagine we\u2019re going to have a lot of success in getting people on board.\"\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), whom Booker credited as their party's lead negotiator, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) also endorsed the criminal justice agreement as original Democratic cosponsors. Other prominent liberal senators weighing a 2020 presidential run, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have yet to formally endorse it.\n\nWarren has said that she's still looking at the details of the final agreement, which took shape on Thursday as most senators left Washington to travel home for the Thanksgiving recess. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of comprehensive criminal justice reform. My only question is, is this big enough?\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said on Wednesday.\n\nThe legislation includes only a handful of sentencing provisions from a broader criminal justice reform package negotiated on a bipartisan basis during the Obama administration.\n\nBut the House passed a narrower bill earlier this year that only tackled prisons, not sentencing, despite criticism from multiple progressive and civil rights groups that pushed for the inclusion of sentencing changes. Booker, Harris and Durbin joined Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and other progressive lawmakers in opposing the prisons-only legislation, slamming it as \"a step backwards.\"\n\nBooker and Durbin later joined efforts to begin \"negotiating back in the sentencing components,\" as Booker put it. And the leader of one prominent civil rights group, speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of a formal statement on the criminal justice deal, hailed both Democratic senators' work as vital to restarting momentum for what became Thursday's announced agreement.\n\nIndeed, Trump's endorsement of a compromise with sentencing changes marked a key victory for advocacy groups that had pushed for progress to no avail earlier in his administration. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has remained skeptical about whether the chamber has time to take up the legislation before year's end, leaving its passage very much in doubt.\n\n\"This is not a perfect bill,\" Booker acknowledged. \"But I\u2019m not going to let perfect be the enemy of the good when the lives of thousands of people hang in the balance.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Congress"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Alena Sadiq", "title": "Sen.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMueller obsessives, political junkies and Washington insiders have been scrutinizing the president\u2019s every mannerism, such as snapping at a CNN reporter for posing a \u201cstupid question\u201d about whether he wanted the new acting attorney general to stymie the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in Trump\u2019s body language all week long. There\u2019s something troubling him. It\u2019s not just a couple staff screw-ups with Melania,\u201d said a senior Republican official in touch with the White House. \u201cIt led me to believe the walls are closing in and they\u2019ve been notified by counsel of some actions about to happen. Folks are preparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nAdding to the unease is a spate of anonymously sourced media reports suggesting Mueller\u2019s self-imposed quiet period that started about two months before 2018 Election Day is about to transition into a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nMueller, as has been his custom throughout the investigation, hasn\u2019t said a word about what\u2019s next for his probe into the Trump 2016 campaign and whether it conspired with Russian hackers to win the White House. Instead, the special counsel has let his legal filings do the talking. On Wednesday, Mueller stirred the speculation pot yet again, delivering a one-page motion to a federal judge in Washington, D.C., confirming that former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates \u201ccontinues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations\u201d and still isn\u2019t ready to be sentenced. Gates pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy against the U.S. and making a false statement in a federal investigation.\n\nLate Thursday, Mueller and attorneys for Paul Manafort confirmed in a joint motion that they\u2019ve been meeting since the former Trump campaign chairman\u2019s mid-September guilty plea and requested a 10-day extension until Nov. 26 to file a status report that will help set the stage for the longtime GOP operative\u2019s sentencing.\n\nIn and around Trump world, the pressure is tangible.\n\nJerome Corsi, a conspiracy theorist and ally of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone said during a live-streamed video broadcast on Monday that he expects to be indicted by Mueller for perjury.\n\nFor his part, Stone told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in May that he was \u201cprepared\u201d for the possibility of an indictment. In the months since, the self-proclaimed dirty trickster has beefed up his legal team and even designated friends to be his spokesmen just in case a judge slaps a gag order on him.\n\nAlso on indictment watch: Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son, who has told his friends in recent weeks that he believes he could be facing charges from Mueller, according to one of those people.\n\nLawyers for the president and Trump Jr. insist they aren\u2019t worried about Mueller.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to be concerned about that. I can't imagine what they'd indict him for,\u201d Rudy Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s personal attorneys, said in a recent interview when asked about Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAlan Futerfas, who represents Trump Jr., referred POLITICO to a statement he gave earlier this month to Vanity Fair , denying his client had been expressing any concerns about Mueller.\n\n\u201cDon never said any such thing, and there is absolutely no truth to these rumors,\u201d Futerfas said.\n\nBut others in contact with the White House say they are picking up a very different sentiment \u2014 paranoia that Mueller is far from finished and that there may indeed be more indictments either about to be filed or that have already been entered in federal court under seal.\n\nAt 18 months and counting, the special counsel has already netted guilty pleas from the president\u2019s former national security adviser, 2016 campaign chairman and the Trump campaign deputy. The special counsel, whose original mandate charges with him investigating both Trump-Russia connections and \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,\u201d also has no deadline to finish his work.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies and former aides interviewed since the midterms said they aren\u2019t sure what to think about the current state of the probe. Several sources sought to put some distance between the president and Stone even though the two share a deep connection going back more than three decades. They also downplayed the seriousness of the crimes at the center of any potential indictments.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all going to be for the same reason \u2014 they lied,\u201d said former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett. \u201cI don\u2019t think perjury charges are necessarily earth-shattering. Those are just personal errors.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that while Stone, Corsi and Trump Jr. speaking up about potential indictments may represent their own legitimate concerns, he nonetheless dismissed the suggestion that the anxiety is any more widespread.\n\n\u201cI actually think that it\u2019s a big media creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only people who ever ask me about this are other reporters.\u201d\n\nBut Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and National Review columnist whom the president has cited on Twitter with respect to the Mueller probe, said Trump and his allies shouldn\u2019t feel they are free from legal jeopardy just yet.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s asked to testify or provide information to a prosecutor who\u2019s not told he\u2019s in the clear has stuff to worry about,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso fanning the flames of apprehension is the intense media attention that\u2019s returned to the Mueller probe after it took a brief backseat behind the 2018 midterm campaign, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation fight and a series of pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets.\n\nTelevision journalists on Monday morning captured footage of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen and his criminal defense attorney as they arrived at Union Station in Washington, fueling speculation he was in town for a meeting with the Mueller prosecutors.\n\nAnd every day, CNN has a rotating cast of reporters camped outside Mueller\u2019s office, where they\u2019ve been chronicling the special counsel\u2019s early morning arrival and keeping count of at least nine visits over four weeks from Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman whose cooperation with Mueller was part of his guilty plea.\n\nAt the D.C. federal courthouse where Mueller\u2019s grand jury meets, journalists routinely prowl the hallways and the building\u2019s perimeter on the lookout for the special counsel\u2019s prosecutors or witnesses who aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of secret escorts through a secure backdoor entrance. A reporter from one of the major television networks said last week he was on stakeout patrol because he heard a competitor was already there.\n\nThe feeding frenzy is everywhere. John R. Schindler, a columnist for the Observer and former National Security Agency analyst, wrote last week that Mueller was holding \u201cdozens of sealed indictments\u201d involving people associated with Trump, his campaign and the administration. He cited an unnamed intelligence community official who has worked with Mueller as his source.\n\nWhile Schindler buried that detail in the final paragraph of his op-ed, it nonetheless got noticed. The Daily Mail published a story the next day that led with the column\u2019s most jarring detail. In Washington, Brett Kappel, a Democratic campaign finance lawyer, used the Observer column as inspiration to spend the weekend sorting through the federal court\u2019s online criminal docket to make a list of all the sealed cases in the District of Columbia circuit that could be Mueller related.\n\nHe counted 336 criminal cases filed since the start of this year \u2014 53 of them are still sealed.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no guarantee that any of the mystery cases are Mueller-related, several are chronologically listed right around some of Mueller\u2019s earliest moves in 2018, including charges filed against a California man who later pleaded guilty to unwittingly helping the Russians interfere with the presidential election, a Dutch attorney who has since gone to prison for lying to Mueller\u2019s investigators and the case against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities accused of sabotaging the 2016 campaign on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nKappel also found 11 cases sealed during just the first two weeks of May and another dozen that were lodged between Labor Day and Election Day when Mueller was staying under the radar.\n\nIn an interview, Kappel acknowledged that many of the cases he found could have nothing to do with Mueller. But he added that the D.C. docket has what \u201cseems like a disproportionately high number\u201d of criminal indictments that could be kept under wraps because Mueller doesn\u2019t want to tip off potential targets or disrupt the rest of his investigation.\n\nIndictment watch seems to kick into high gear every few days now. On Tuesday, CBS\u2019 \u201cThis Morning\u201d cited \u201csources with knowledge\u201d of the Mueller probe to report new charges could be coming \u201cas soon as today.\u201d Multiple media reports followed that story with their own articles that repeated what CBS said. On Twitter, #indictmentpalooza has become a thing.\n\nOthers on the outside, meantime, are left just trying to read the tea leaves.\n\n\u201cWe think it's about to be indictment-thirty up in here,\u201d Evan Hurst of Wonkette wrote on Tuesday. \u201cWe'd put bets on it but it's entirely possible we're wrong. But if we're right, then the rest of this week is going to be NUTFUCKINGCRAZY.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Jesus Rodriguez", "title": "Trump to visit California on Saturday amid deadly blaze", "description": "The president previously tried to put blame on state authorities for not being efficient in their response to the Woolsey and Camp fires.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/trump-california-fires-woolsey-camp-visit-994381", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/88/27/54783e8c41c09dbdfa1bd6c8b86b/181115-californiafires-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:24:28Z", "content": "Residences were leveled by the wildfire in Paradise, Calif., on Nov 14.

However, Haning\u2019s move may have added traction because of the unusual role the former attorney general has played in his case. Because of a recusal by the local federal prosecutor in the case \u2014 St. Louis-based U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Jensen \u2014 the government\u2019s filings in Haning\u2019s case bear Sessions\u2019 name as ultimately responsible for the prosecution.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker now appears to have assumed that role \u2014 squarely teeing up the legitimacy of his appointment as an issue open to litigation in the criminal case.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cFor a federal criminal prosecution, the rule of law is profoundly important and the Department of Justice in this case is not upholding the rule of law,\u201d Justin Gelfand, one of Haning\u2019s current lawyers, told POLITICO. \u201cAs a matter of federal law, the attorney general is in charge of this prosecution, but the office of attorney general is currently staffed by someone appointed in violation of Article II of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Justice Department vehemently dispute that assertion and argue that Trump\u2019s decision to tap Whitaker was both constitutional and clearly authorized by a 1998 law, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nIndeed, on Wednesday, Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel released a formal, 20-page legal opinion dismissing contentions by some prominent lawyers on the left and the right that the move unconstitutionally usurps the Senate\u2019s authority to pass judgment on presidential appointees to the Cabinet and other senior posts.\n\nHowever, the key question at the moment may not be who is ultimately right on that legal issue, but which efforts to raise it can gain traction and how quickly.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh fired what appears to be the first shot in that battle by seeking to have a judge declare that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and not Whitaker, is in fact the acting attorney general. Frosh brought the motion as part of a lawsuit the state filed in September, accusing Sessions of dereliction of duty for failing to defend parts of the Obamacare law.\n\nA judge has set a Dec. 19 hearing on the Maryland challenge. No hearing has yet been set on Haning\u2019s motion, but some lawyers believe the enhanced role the attorney general plays or is supposed to play in cases involving recusals could make them fertile ground for challenges to Whitaker's authority.\n\n\"This certainly appears to be a uniquely promising context within which to challenge the validity of Whitaker\u2019s appointment,\" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck.\n\nOne twist in Haning\u2019s case is that the prosecution is at least nominally being overseen by one senior official other than Sessions (and now, presumably, Whitaker): Timothy Garrison, the U.S. Attorney in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nGarrison was confirmed by the Senate in April, so he might have authority to initiate and pursue criminal cases even if the courts conclude that Whitaker does not. However, it seems unlikely that Garrison would have authority on his own to bring, maintain or shut down a prosecution outside his district. Federal law appears to place that power squarely in the hands of the attorney general.\n\nHaning\u2019s motion says the recusal in his case has been a kind of a fig leaf, purporting to shift the case out of Jensen\u2019s office even while it continues to be prosecuted by three attorneys who are members of his staff. Jensen recused himself because he used to be Haning\u2019s defense attorney.\n\n\u201cInstead of actually recusing the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in its entirety, the Government assigned this case to three [assistant U.S. attorneys] in this district, gave them a different title solely for purposes of this case, and somehow concluded that the conflict of interest requiring recusal has therefore suddenly\u2014and magically\u2014disappeared,\u201d Haning\u2019s defense team wrote. \u201cThe reality is it has not. No defendant should be prosecuted by his prior defense attorney or by those who serve directly under him.\u201d\n\nThe indictment filed against Haning in February accuses him of directing a long-standing conspiracy to secretly blend chicken feathers and bones into what pet food companies were told was higher-grade chicken or turkey meal products. The government contends the practice violated federal laws against sale of adulterated ingredients, although officials say the substitutions posed no health danger to pets.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment on the motion by Haning\u2019s lawyers or to a request to detail the nature of the recusal in the case.\n\nHowever, a court filing earlier this year in another case involving a recusal of local federal prosecutors provides some insight into the process.\n\nAfter former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship filed a motion accusing prosecutors of withholding evidence during the 2015 trial in which he was convicted of covering up safety violations at a mine where 29 miners were killed, prosecutors advised the court that Justice Department officials had ordered that responses to the issue be transferred from the Southern District of West Virginia to the Eastern District of Kentucky.\n\nProsecutors filed the Justice Department order publicly in the case in May. It shows that the recusal issue was fielded by the general counsel\u2019s office at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys and then directed to Justice\u2019s top career official at the time, Associate Deputy Attorney General Scott Schools.\n\nThe memo specifically says that all future court pleadings in the case should include the name of the attorney general. It also says if the Kentucky team wants to use prosecutors from the West Virginia office previously handling the matter, such an arrangement would require \u201ca detailed justification of the need\u201d as well as approval from DOJ headquarters.\n\nDefendants in other cases where local U.S. attorneys are recused could lodge similar objections to Whitaker's role overseeing their cases, if they believe such a challenge could yield some tangible benefit.\n\nOne high-profile defendant being prosecuted by out-of-district attorneys is former Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), who was indicted on corruption charges brought by a federal prosecutor in Springfield, Ill. That prosecutor was later ousted from the case by Justice Department officials, who reassigned the matter to prosecutors in Chicago. Schock seems unlikely to fight the arrangement since his lawyers pushed for the original prosecutor to be removed.\n\nAnother figure being prosecuted in a case in which the local U.S. attorney is recused: the president's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. The Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, is recused from handling the case, which is being directed by the office's No. 2 official, Robert Khuzami.\n\nThe wording of pleadings in Cohen's case is cagey about who, if anyone, is supervising Khuzami. The usual printed line for the attorney general's name in recused cases is missing from those filings. Khuzami is also not described as acting as a special assistant to the attorney general but \"under authority conferred\" by the same statute that allows the attorney general to assign government prosecutors to conduct prosecutions in districts where they are do not normally practice.\n\nNothing has been publicly filed by prosecutors in Cohen's case since Whitaker assumed control of the Justice Department last week. However, since Cohen has negotiated a plea deal with Khuzami's team, the former Trump lawyer also appears unlikely to mount a battle to disqualify them.\n\nStill, some lawyers are predicting a flood of motions like Haning's in every kind of case the Justice Department is involved in \u2014 virtually guaranteeing that the Supreme Court will have to step in and resolve the issue.\n\n\"There will be thousands of identical motions filed throughout the country,\" said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law. \"Eventually, one judge will declare Whitaker not the acting AG. That decision will throw the entire executive branch into disarray. [The Supreme Court] will have to resolve [that] ASAP.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mseverns@politico.com (Maggie Severns)", "title": "Pro-Trump group raised $22 million from anonymous donors", "description": "An affiliated super PAC also raised $4 million in 2017.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/trump-america-first-policies-fundraising-donors-994292", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/4a/64/806fede941cbaa588638e2aa74c9/181115-trump-gettyimages-1057413564.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:20:24Z", "content": "Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images A political group aiming to be a megaphone for President Donald Trumps policies raised $26 million in its first year in operation, new disclosures show, the vast majority of which came in through a political nonprofit that does \u2026 [+3325 chars]", "fulltext": "America First's nonprofit and super pac exist to promote Trump\u2019s agenda from outside the White House. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Elections Pro-Trump group raised $22 million from anonymous donors\n\nA political group aiming to be a megaphone for President Donald Trump\u2019s policies raised $26 million in its first year in operation, new disclosures show, the vast majority of which came in through a political nonprofit that does not have to reveal its donors.\n\nThe group, America First, consists of two parts that face different federal disclosure requirements.

Two anonymous donors who gave contributions of $4.5 million and $5 million each gave close to half of America First Policies\u2019 funding. The group does not have to disclose the names of its contributors, who could be individuals, corporations or unions.\n\nThe groups exist to promote Trump\u2019s agenda from outside the White House. America First Policies aired ads urging lawmakers to support the tax bill in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court this year, while the super PAC, America First Action, aired ads in House and Senate races during the midterm elections. The groups\u2019 donors dined with Trump on multiple occasions and attended a summer fete at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n\nThe America First organization struggled to get off the ground during Trump\u2019s early months amid competition from competing pro-Trump political groups, staff turnover and criticism about high payouts for its consultants. One White House official even called the group \u201can embarrassment\u201d in the spring of 2017.\n\nBecause America First Policies is organized as a political nonprofit, it does not face the same FEC disclosure requirements that campaigns and super PACs do. But it must disclose some information in annual tax filings. America First Policies received an extension until Thursday for its 2017 filing, which covers the period from when it was formed in late January through the end of that year. It does not show the group\u2019s fundraising in 2018.\n\nAmerica First Policies also does not have to reveal details of most of its spending. But it said in the filing Thursday that its biggest expenditures to outside contractors were for \u201cmedia services,\u201d which could include ad production and placement. It paid $4.9 million to NMRPP LLC, $2.7 million to Parscale Strategy LLC and $1.2 million to Smart Media Group LLC, according to the disclosure.\n\nAmerica First Action, the corresponding super PAC, brought in $4 million in 2017, but its fundraising picked up this year. The group had raised $30 million in 2018 as of mid-October, when it filed its most recent disclosure with the FEC. That uptick was thanks in no small part to Republican megadonors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, who gave $10 million.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dsamuelsohn@politico.com (Darren Samuelsohn)", "title": "Avenatti blames pro-Trump conspiracy theorist for arrest", "description": "\u201cFirst Mueller and now me.

But the ultimate problems \u2014 out-of-date machines and tabulation equipment \u2014 were purchased by her predecessors.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to drive a \u201965 Mustang to L.A. and back with a bad fan belt, and we were hoping we wouldn\u2019t break down,\u201d Bucher told POLITICO in a phone interview. \u201cBut we broke down.\u201d\n\nPalm Beach County is the only Florida county to use Sequoia Voting Systems, which Bucher said were purchased at the direction of her predecessor, Arthur Anderson, over her objection as a state House member in 2007. The original system was purchased in 2002 by former Supervisor of Elections Theresa LePore, who designed the infamous butterfly ballot that likely cost Democrat Al Gore the presidency in 2000. The touchscreen system from Sequoia that she bought was banned by the Florida legislature after a series of controversies over alleged missing votes in Palm Beach and other counties.\n\nBucher said the machines was so unable to handle the strain of machine recounts right after Election Day in races for the U.S. Senate, governor, agriculture commissioner and a local state House race that they \u201cmelted down\u201d Tuesday, forcing the recount of about 175,000 ballots that had already been recounted.\n\nBucher said she discovered yet another problem: the recounted vote tallies in 30 precincts were off when compared to the original vote tallies from Election Day.\n\n\u201cWhen the machines died, it dropped part of our tally,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t added the ballots up, but it\u2019s about 30 precincts. I don\u2019t care how many it is. We\u2019re just trying to get them.\u201d\n\nAs for making the 3 p.m. recount deadline, Bucher said at about 2 p.m., \u201cthere\u2019s no way we can make it unless 3 p.m. is in five hours.\u201d\n\nHours before the deadline, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker rejected a lawsuit from the Nelson campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to extend that deadline. The Nelson campaign, though, plans to file a lawsuit in state court now asking for an extension just in Palm Beach County. The Senate race is likely to be close enough to head into a manual recount. In that race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott leads Nelson by 12,562 votes.\n\nWalker openly expressed his annoyance with the process so far.\n\n\u201cWe have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\u201d Walker, who is overseeing several recount-related lawsuits, most filed by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), said during a Thursday hearing.\n\nWalker also speculated that Palm Beach County could continue counting voters through Sunday, which is the day official results are due to the state. He admitted, however, he feels like he is \u201cblind-folded\u201d because of the uncertainty out of Palm Beach County.\n\nPalm Beach County had been in the spotlight since Election Day Nov. 6 because along with Broward County, it was slow to finalize its vote count. Since that time, Palm Beach County has started to capture much of the negative attention on its own.\n\nEarlier this week, Bucher said her top priority was the Senate race and announced she couldn\u2019t finish the other contests on time.\n\nUnder state law, if the deadline is not met, the vote count reverts back to the first unofficial results, which were due last Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe law also states that even if they don\u2019t make the deadline, counties should continue with the recount, along with any prescribed manual recount, and certify the election returns,\" said Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State.\n\nOnce Palm Beach County was hopelessly behind and her staff had been worked past the point of exhaustion, Bucher said all she could do was go to \u201cprayer mode\u201d and send her workers home.\n\n\u201cThey hadn\u2019t slept. They were exhausted. The machines weren\u2019t working,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, we would have had a bigger problem if we had exhausted technicians working on machines that were breaking down.

A number of likely Democratic presidential contenders \u2014 Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 have signed on to Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All legislation.\n\nNobody expects Newsom to enact single payer in the first two years of his term. He\u2019s tempered expectations but says he remains committed to expanding coverage while finding a pathway to a government-run system that could serve as a blueprint. Part of his early policy agenda is expected to include making California the first state to expand Medicaid to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"Since he has promised so much, and since he has talked about California as national model and since he\u2019s going to be the principal architect against President Trump from 'Left Coast,' anything he does on health care \u2014 managed care, Medicare for All or something in between \u2014 will serve as a model to catapult him into the national conversation,\" said David McCuan, a strategist who teaches political science at Sonoma State University.\n\nThe question is whether an incremental, go-slow approach will gradually rile progressives eager for big change. On the other hand, a bolder effort will force sticky policy questions. Single-payer legislation failed to move in the state Assembly in 2017 and died this year; a state analysis found it would cost $400 billion, half of which would come from new taxes.\n\n\u201cIf he can show progress on keeping his campaign promises, I think people understand changing and improving the health system takes time,\" said Ian Russell, a political strategist and former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official. \"I would assume he'd want to keep California at the forefront of showing a different way of governing than the [Trump] administration, by bringing down the costs of health care and increasing access to it, but it's more important he take the time to get it right.\"\n\nExtending health coverage regardless of immigration status would in itself be reminiscent of the precedent-shattering move Newsom made after being elected San Francisco mayor in 2004, when he started issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Covering undocumented immigrants would put California in the direct line of fire of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIn a time when you have an administration that\u2019s incredibly negative toward the undocumented community, it will seem incredibly courageous,\u201d said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cAnd it will probably get [Newsom] into a suit with the government, which he will love.\u201d\n\nNewsom's power to endorse candidates who support single payer shouldn't be underestimated, Blendon added. \u201cWhen people say they\u2019re too extreme, too liberal, too socialized, you\u2019ll have the governor in the largest state who agrees with them,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, anything short of single-payer health care will put Newsom at odds with true supporters of a government-run health care \u2014 namely the politically powerful California Nurses Association.\n\nThe registered nurses union, the primary backers of California\u2019s failed single-payer initiative, endorsed Newsom and say they\u2019ll hold him to his words.\n\nStephanie Roberson, director of government relations for the union, said Newsom \u201cdidn\u2019t wait for the whole marriage equality piece\u201d before issuing marriage licenses, and called the universal health access program enacted in San Francisco under his watch \u201ca microcosm of what we\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has the courageousness and know-how to be set up to get this done,\u201d Roberson said.\n\nMost observers still expect Newsom to initially take a piecemeal approach and devote more state money to making coverage more affordable while also addressing prescription drug prices and strengthening California\u2019s health care marketplaces.\n\n\u201cThe job for the Newsom administration is to build on what\u2019s working,\u201d said Peter Lee, executive director of the state exchange, Covered California. \u201cHe understands health care is a complex issue and \u2026 he\u2019s going to make progress on what\u2019s already working in California.\u201d\n\nNewsom is seen as far more interested in health care than his predecessor, Democrat Jerry Brown, and health care groups are jockeying to influence his new administration.\n\nMore than 50 consumer and labor groups gathered a few days after the midterms to map out next year's state legislative agenda. Most participated in the Care4All California coalition, formed in March to push for legislation to expand and improve health care in the state without the need for federal approvals.\n\nMaking plans so soon after votes were cast \u201cspeaks to the seriousness and interest in moving this agenda early in the new year with a new governor,\u201d said Anthony Wright, head of Health Access California and a leader of the coalition.\n\nThe nurses union did not participate in the coalition but has already announced it will be backing a new single-payer bill in the upcoming session.\n\nThe union\u2019s Roberson said the nurses also support such moves as extending coverage to the undocumented. \u201cWe would be upset if that\u2019s the end of the road for him,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the ultimate solution? It is single payer.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Health Care"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mlevine@politico.com (Marianne LeVine)", "title": "Family Research Council tour includes Trump hotel stay", "description": "How to survive a congressional investigation \u2014 Facebook fires Definers", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2018/11/15/family-research-council-tour-includes-trump-hotel-stay-414669", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:15:50Z", "content": "With Daniel Lippman, David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL TOUR INCLUDES TRUMP HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: The Family Research Council s Washington D.C.

But beyond Cotton's resistance, on Thursday the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association joined two other law enforcement groups in slamming the current version of the measure as \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s on top of repeated skepticism from McConnell, who had vowed to call up the criminal justice package if it\u2019s shown to have 60 \u201cyes\u201c votes, and Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), the lead sponsor of the narrower, prisons-only proposal. Trump said Wednesday that he\u2019ll be \u201cwaiting with a pen\u201d for a final deal, but without Senate GOP leaders\u2019 buy-in he could be waiting well into 2019.\n\nOne Republican senator supportive of the criminal justice plan, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity, said that \"I don\u2019t know of any valid basis for [McConnell] to go back on\" his agreement to call a vote on the measure: \"It would be one thing if something unforeseen and unforeseeable had occurred between the time he gave us that assurance and now. But nothing has.\"\n\n\"The word that was used was that McConnell had deputized Cotton to go out and whip against it,\" the GOP senator added. \"Perhaps understanding that he wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat it but to keep the score from getting run up too high.\"\n\nCornyn said Thursday that while talks are \"making progress,\" the bill\u2019s backers may need to abandon their strategy and pursue a new bipartisan accord next year, after Democrats take power in the House. McConnell and several other GOP sources have warned that there is likely to be little time to take up a divisive debate unless all 100 senators support it, a long shot given the heated opinions about the bill.\n\n\u201cI think we can take it up next year. I don't know what Ms. [Nancy] Pelosi's thought would be about changing what the House has done already,\u201d Cornyn said in an interview. \u201cBut to me, this whole subject is one where there is bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nGrassley fired back at Cotton when presented with his colleague's push to slow down the Trump-backed criminal justice proposal \u2014 set for formal legislative release later Thursday \u2014 with a new hearing.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like our bill, and so, anything he can do to stall it, he wants to stall it,\u201d Grassley responded. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need a hearing on a bill that\u2019s been around for five years.\u201d\n\nAdvocacy groups lobbying for the prison-and-sentencing agreement, led in the White House by Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, cheered a recent statement of support from the Fraternal Order of Police. But they suffered a setback Thursday when the National Sheriffs' Association, alongside the Major Cities Chiefs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America, warned Senate leaders that they couldn't support the current version without five changes, as a starting point.\n\nWithout those changes at a minimum, the groups wrote in a Thursday letter, \"this legislation creates a high-risk path for dangerous criminals with gun crime histories to early release from prison.\"\n\nKushner has spent much of his time in Washington shuttling between the White House and Capitol Hill trying to hammer out a bipartisan compromise. McConnell, with whom Kushner met several times to discuss the legislation, asked him to table the bill until after the midterm elections, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe timing worked in Kushner\u2019s favor: The president, reeling from defeats in the midterm elections and fuming about bad headlines generated by his decision to cancel a visit to a World War I cemetery outside of Paris last weekend, is eager to tout a legislative victory. Kushner presented the legislation to Trump on Tuesday, a day filled with more misery-making headlines for the White House, including the first lady\u2019s public call for the dismissal of the deputy national security adviser, whom the White House said Wednesday would be reassigned to another job in the administration.\n\nTrump touted the bill as a bipartisan solution to a long-simmering problem. \u201cDid I heard the word \u2018bipartisan\u2019? Did I hear \u2014 did I hear that word? That\u2019s a nice word,\u201d the president told the crowd assembled in the Roosevelt Room, which included Grassley, as well as Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.).\n\nIn addition to provisions lowering mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug-related felonies, the compromise proposal would require inmates to be incarcerated closer to their homes, expand a program for early release and promote training programs in prisons. The backing of a president who has cast himself as tough on crime was critical to an effort that has stalled multiple times on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd Thursday wasn't without its victories for the long-shot criminal justice push. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a close Trump ally seen as undecided by advocacy groups backing the bill, said he's \"in general support of\" the text he's seen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to see the final text,\" Perdue cautioned, \"but I\u2019m supportive of what I\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\n\nScott pointed to the House's \"convincing, overwhelming\" bipartisan vote earlier this year for a version that didn't include the negotiated changes to sentencing rules.\n\n\"Anyone who [has] not fully understood the legislation, it's not because it's not available. It's out there,\" the South Carolinian said in an interview. \"I think we could take it to the floor and vote for it, vote it up or down.\" And the bill would \"without question\" get to the needed 60 supporters if it received that vote, Scott added.\n\nPaul, however, said it's still up to the majority leader.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be done. It depends on one person: Sen. McConnell. If he allows a vote it passes with 65 to 70 votes.

Bill Nelson, who has filed a host of lawsuits to broaden the pool of countable ballots by overturning or changing Florida election laws and rules. It\u2019s an unlikely path to victory even for Nelson, who has a smaller deficit in his race compared to Gillum\u2018s.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a path. And if enough votes surface, Gillum could still contest the election by filing a lawsuit within 10 days of the election being officially certified, which is supposed to happen Nov. 30. So Gillum has two weeks to make a decision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s struggling with the fact that obviously he would like to be governor. But he\u2019s got other things on his mind,\u201d said Gillum\u2019s attorney, Barry Richard, a veteran election law lawyer central to George W. Bush\u2019s recount fight in the 2000 disputed presidential election in Florida.\n\n\u201cWould he have a stronger voice or lesser voice if he filed a lawsuit? If he files a lawsuit, would it diminish his ability to change things?\u201d Richard asked.\n\nThough he's Gillum's legal adviser, Richard's question reveals the broader political concerns Gillum is weighing. The race for governor catapulted the Tallahassee mayor to national stardom and made him a progressive heartthrob. Gillum now has a new fan base \u2014 and an expanded donor network \u2014 outside of Florida. Some of his backers are privately urging him to consider challenging President Donald Trump.\n\nSome Democrats who backed Gillum privately expressed concern that the candidate would be damaging his brand by drawing out the process of an election contest when he clearly lost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s train wreck,\u201d said one top backer, who did not want to be quoted for fear of being ostracized by Florida Democrats. \u201cThe only people who benefit from this are people who want power, money and the adoration of elements in our party who want to push this because they\u2019re looking at the 2020 elections instead of the good of our state.\u201d\n\nSo far, Gillum has refrained from caustic remarks or appearing like a sore loser and hasn\u2019t been litigious. Instead, he has taken the safe position of merely calling for all the votes to be counted, which he\u2019s expected to do again Thursday.\n\nGillum adviser, Kevin Cate, said his team isn\u2019t concerned about the criticism.\n\n\u201cAndrew\u2019s brand is strong and growing stronger,\u201d Cate said. \u201cThis election is not about a moment. It\u2019s a movement.\u201d\n\nCate said no decision on an election challenge has been made yet, a sentiment echoed by Richard.\n\nRichard acknowledges that an election contest lawsuit isn\u2019t easy. Citing Florida statute, Richard said the likeliest grounds for such a contest, as of now, would be to challenge the results based on the \u201crejection of a number of legal votes sufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election.\u201d\n\nBut, he said without elaborating, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of different theories, but which ones we would advance in the lawsuit depends on what the evidence is. And you have to have enough votes left over to win the election.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean? \u201cWe don\u2019t know at this point. We don\u2019t have all the data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Gillum campaign got a small dose of hope Thursday morning when a federal judge ruled that absentee and provisional ballots that were thrown out because of mismatched signatures could be counted if each voter in question cures his or her ballot by 5 p.m. Thursday.\n\nStill, the pool of votes \u2014 which could range from 4,000 to 7,800 \u2014 is relatively small compared to Gillum\u2019s deficit of 33,684 heading into the manual recount, which Florida law mandates if election results are within .25 percent after a machine recount. Judging by the current election results, those votes would split about equally between Gillum and DeSantis.\n\nNelson has a smaller deficit in his race against Gov. Rick Scott \u2014 12,562 votes \u2014 heading into the likely manual recount to be called today when the machine recount of all the ballots is done. The margin in the Senate race is so small that a manual recount in is scheduled to begin to today.\n\nRichard said Gillum didn\u2019t intervene in Nelson\u2019s lawsuits because \u201che doesn\u2019t want to litigate for the sake of litigating. There\u2019s nothing to be gained from litigating just to litigate if there\u2019s no reasonable chance that it\u2019s going to make a difference. And there\u2019s nothing to be gained from intervening. It wouldn\u2019t have gotten us anywhere.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Jesus Rodriguez", "title": "Trump administration slaps sanctions on Saudis over Khashoggi's death", "description": "The Treasury Department designated the officials for sanctions over what it called &quot;serious human rights abuse.&quot;", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/trump-administration-sanctions-saudi-khashoggi-992296", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/58/6c/9e61c02b4a36a3b27450ad65a744/181115-jamal-khashoggi-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:50:43Z", "content": "Karen Attiah, Jamal Khashoggi's editor at the Washington Post, tweeted Thursday that \"sanctions will not fix this.

The announcement named royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani and said he led the team that flew into Istanbul just hours before Khashoggi entered the consulate there for paperwork relating to his planned marriage. Al-Qahtani was fired from his post in late October.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who decided not to attend the glitzy \"Davos in the Desert\" business and investment conference in Riyadh amid outrage over Khashoggi's death, said al-Qahtani and the other 16 officials were directly involved in the \"abhorrent killing\" and must face consequences for it. He also called on the Saudi government to \"end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists.\"\n\n\"The United States continues to diligently work to ascertain all of the facts and will hold accountable each of those we find responsible in order to achieve justice for Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, children, and the family he leaves behind,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nHuman rights groups, however, expressed outrage that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is close to presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, was left out of the sanctions.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

President Donald Trump also worried human rights activists when he expressed a hesitation to jeopardize weapons sales with the Saudis over the Khashoggi incident.\n\nWhile the sanctions ameliorated some of this criticism, lawmakers across the aisle said they should be just a first step in punishing Saudi Arabia and reassessing the U.S. relationship with the country.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has cast doubt on the notion that the crown prince's hands are clean, said he requested a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Gina Haspel to discuss the U.S. response.\n\n\"I have a lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid,\" Corker said in a statement.\n\n\"The administration appears to be following the Saudi playbook of blaming mid-level officials and exonerating its leadership,\" said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents Virginia, where Khashoggi lived. \"I will continue to push for further action in Congress to hold Saudi Arabia accountable.\"\n\nMaryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he remained concerned that Trump was \"enabling the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\" in shielding the crown prince from punishment.\n\nHuman rights activists also decried the limited actions.\n\n\"The Trump administration deserves some limited credit,\" said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy at the Human Rights First advocacy group. But: \"There should be no doubt that there are sighs of relief in Riyadh at the moment.\"\n\nKhashoggi's former employer has also long demanded an independent investigation into the situation.\n\n\"It is impossible to have confidence that we have gotten to the truth when the purported investigations were neither transparent nor independent and when evidence continues to be withheld,\" said Fred Ryan, Washington Post publisher and CEO in a statement. \"Many important questions about Jamal\u2019s tragic murder have gone unanswered.\"\n\nAnd Karen Attiah, Khashoggi's editor at the Washington Post, tweeted Thursday that \"sanctions will not fix this. It\u2019s not enough.\"\n\nIn their own efforts to punish people over Khashoggi's death, the Saudis announced Thursday that they were seeking the death penalty for five individuals suspected to have ordered and carried out Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe Trump administration had been previously quick to slap sanctions on international actors, including in Nicaragua, Myanmar and the Gambia, using the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which gives the president broad sanction powers to punish human rights violators. In a statement Thursday, Pompeo signaled the administration might not be done responding to the death of Khashoggi, who was living in Virginia at the time of his death.\n\n\"Our action today is an important step in responding to Khashoggi\u2019s killing,\" Pompeo said. \"The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Sarah Zimmerman", "title": "Report points to 'difficult and worrying' 2019 for U.S. agriculture", "description": "Rabobank predicts trade woes and extreme weather could destabilize global food commodity prices next year.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/report-points-to-difficult-and-worrying-2019-for-us-agriculture-966944", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/27/c7/456b9f0d447c8a2f29543225f760/hurricane-florence-ap-900.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:34:48Z", "content": "The report noted that climate experts are forecasting an 80 percent chance of El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions being formally declared \"by the end of the northern winter.\" | AP Photo Market volatility caused by President Donald Trump's trade disputes, extreme weath\u2026 [+4218 chars]", "fulltext": "The downward trend of U.S. farmers' profitability will only get worse if China continues to ignore American agricultural imports, the report said. | Steve Helber/AP Photo Report points to 'difficult and worrying' 2019 for U.S. agriculture\n\nMarket volatility caused by President Donald Trump's trade disputes, extreme weather and the potential spread of African Swine Fever could threaten the stability of global food commodity prices next year, the agricultural banking company Rabobank warned Thursday in a new report.\n\n\u201cThe agri-commodity price environment may be relatively stable currently, but it\u2019s difficult to remember a time [when] there were so many threats to food commodity prices on so many fronts,\u201d Stefan Vogel, Rabobank's head of agricultural commodity markets and a co-author of the report, said in a statement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn Rabobank's annual Outlook report, the Holland-based company predicted that trade uncertainty remains the largest threat facing U.S. farmers next year. The downward trend of U.S. farmers' profitability will only get worse if China continues to ignore American agricultural imports, the report said. Fiscal 2018 marked the second-worst profitability year for American farmers in nearly the last decade, the report said, despite record-smashing corn and soybean yields and the fact that Chinese retaliatory tariffs only directly affected one-quarter of the 12-month period.\n\nRabobank anticipates that American soybean farmers will continue to take the biggest hit if Beijing keeps its tariffs in place \u2014 and that U.S. soybean stocks \"will easily double\" under that scenario. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has said that farmers will not receive additional trade aid for 2019 production, reasoning that Trump's tariff policies have already altered markets and that farmers must now react accordingly.\n\nIn many cases, that may be easier said than done. \"These measures,\" the report said, referring to tit-for-tat tariffs, \"change the structure of global trade and increase U.S. inventories to new all-time highs, while hurting U.S. farmer margins, and resulting in great uncertainty when it comes to prices and the upcoming 2019 planting season.\"\n\nAgricultural producers should prepare for other factors beyond trade, according to the report. If African Swine Fever, which has cropped up in places in China's massive pork industry, spreads to become a full-on outbreak, consumer concern could lead to shifts in preferences, in turn affecting global trade flows.\n\nIn addition, the report noted that climate experts are forecasting an 80 percent chance of El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions being formally declared \"by the end of the northern winter.\" El Ni\u00f1o-related weather patterns tend to make the U.S. Southern Plains wetter and can also lead to drier conditions in the northern part of the U.S. Midwest.\n\nWith El Ni\u00f1o-like effects already being experienced in parts of Australia, Brazil and India, the report said, further weather change holds the potential to hurt crop yields and production, and influence global trade in agricultural commodities.\n\n\u201cFood producers face a melting pot of risks,\u201d Justin Sherrard, a global strategist for animal protein at Rabobank, said in a statement. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s possible that not all of them will come to pass, they need to be prepared for a difficult and worrying year in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe report predicted a hefty surplus in U.S. soybeans next year and a global glut in coffee and, less significantly, in palm oil and sugar. It forecast global deficits in corn, wheat, cocoa and cotton, noting that hurricane-related damage affected the U.S. cotton crop this year.\n\nWith Trump expected to talk trade with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month, the report was not overly pessimistic about the possibility that the two economic superpowers could strike a deal to ease trade tension.\n\nThe report said it \"may take very long negotiations\" to address America's trade deficit with China \"by any significant amount.\" However, Rabobank said it was \"surprising\" how quickly the new North American trade agreement came together and that \"we can\u2019t rule out a speedy resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.\"\n\n\"Once achieved,\" the report said of a U.S.-China trade deal, \"it will likely result in China buying increasing quantities of American goods. Under a Chinese tariff regime, however, the U.S. will easily double its soybean stocks.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Agriculture"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "britchie@politico.com (Bruce Ritchie)", "title": "Nelson intervenes in GOP ag commissioner candidate challenge to block Scott", "description": "Nelson's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have intervened and presented a witness list for the hearing.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2018/11/15/nelson-intervenes-in-gop-ag-commissioner-candidate-challenge-to-block-scott-698504", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/83/b3/1ddedbcf4fe9bd5030d8314a33c3/180104-bill-nelson-ap.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:22:38Z", "content": "Nelson's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee have intervened and presented a witness list for the hearing. | AP Photo TALLAHASSEE The campaign of Sen.

He added that neither he nor Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a central figure in the Times story, knew about the firm\u2019s work for Facebook until reading the newspaper\u2019s report.\n\nThe Times said Facebook also recruited support from powerful friends in Washington, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), to tamp down talk of regulation that could hamper its business. And it went to pains to seek favor with conservatives \u2014 for example by declining to penalize then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims in late 2015. The company said Trump's comments got a pass for newsworthiness, the same explanation Twitter has offered for allowing posts from the president that appear to violate platform rules.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But the revelations strike another blow to an already embattled Facebook, which has scrambled to fend off criticism that it failed to address its role as a potential vector for social ills like misinformation, foreign election interference, terrorism and human rights abuses.\n\nZuckerberg said Thursday that the company will review it ties to outside consultants. Earlier the same day, the company announced it was terminating its contract with political communications firm Definers Public Affairs, which the Times identified as one of the key consultants that spread negative stories about rivals like Google and Apple and questioned critics' funding sources.\n\nZuckerberg pledged an internal review of all outside firms Facebook works with, to be led by Nick Clegg, the former UK deputy prime minister Facebook recently tapped to lead its policy and communications teams.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that the company will review it ties to outside consultants after criticism over tactics revealed in the Times' story. | John Shinkle/POLITICO\n\nThe press call, ostensibly held as a briefing on Facebook's efforts to improve its content moderation practices, became a bid for damage control after the report drew attention to the roles of Zuckerberg and, more critically, Sandberg \u2014 a bestselling author who was once seen as a potential Cabinet member for Hillary Clinton.\n\nPatrick Gaspard, president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations, said in a letter to Sandberg late Wednesday that he was \"astonished\" by the Times report.\n\n\"It's been disappointing to see how you have failed to monitor hate and misinformation on Facebook's platform,\" wrote Gaspard, whose group is the principal vehicle for Soros' donations. \"To now learn that you are active in promoting these distortions is beyond the pale.\"\n\nAccording to the Times\u2019 report, the product of a six-month investigation, Sandberg and other Facebook executives deliberately slow-walked the company's response to Russian manipulation and other politically fraught abuses of the platform to avoid seeming to favor Democrats. Zuckerberg said on the call that Facebook was \"too slow to spot Russian interference\" but that it was \"simply untrue\" that delay was intentional. He did not deny that, as the world learned of those interference campaigns, Facebook under Sandberg's leadership turned to third-party firms to do battle with the company's detractors.\n\nAs illustrated in documents obtained by POLITICO, consultants and company allies depicted critics of Facebook and its leadership as anti-Semitic (Sandberg and Zuckerberg are both Jewish). And they tried to get media outlets to report on financial ties between Facebook foes and Soros, itself a tactic echoing longstanding anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish financiers shaping world events.\n\nFacebook on Thursday denied that Definers was asked to produce articles on its behalf. Instead, Facebook said Definers was used to contact journalists about \"important press calls\" and to investigate funding behind its critics at the organization \"Freedom from Facebook.\"\n\n\"The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company,\" the Facebook statement said. \"To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and untrue.\"\n\nA Definers spokesperson said the research it conducted for Facebook \"was entirely factual and based on public records, including public statements by one of its organizers about receiving funding from Mr. Soros' foundation.\"\n\nThe Times report comes as Facebook is already looking to blunt the prospects of a regulatory crackdown, tough new legislation targeting Silicon Valley business practices around issues like privacy \u2014 or both.\n\nLawmakers told POLITICO Thursday they were troubled by the Times story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alarming. It\u2019s appalling. They just have to be held to account\u201d said Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a high-ranking and influential Democrat on the Commerce Committee. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a neutral platform to me. That sounds like a major corporation using its financial weight and its political clout to advance its own interests.\u201d\n\nSchatz said he plans in the wake of the report to meet with Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) to continue discussions on crafting privacy legislation that could add substantial federal oversight to Facebook's handling of user data.\n\nThe report also caught the attention of Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a leading critic of Facebook and other internet companies from his perch as top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. According to the Times report, Schumer, whose daughter works at Facebook, told Warner to ensure his actions don't hurt the company.\n\nWarner declined to comment on any talks with Schumer. He did, however, pledge to \"continue to pursue this,\" telling POLITICO, \"The fact that it literally took months and months of relentless activity to take this issue seriously ... is a problem.\"\n\nSchumer spokesman Justin Goodman would not confirm or deny his intervention on Facebook's behalf, but defended the senator as trying to \"push Facebook to do more to purge fake accounts and bots used by the right wing and Russians to perpetuate a disinformation campaign and interfere with our elections.\"\n\nSchumer has \"urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company,\" Goodman said.\n\nIn concert with the congressional scrutiny, federal investigators are probing Facebook over some of the issues that sparked the damage-control efforts in the first place. The Federal Trade Commission announced in March it would investigate the social media giant's failure to secure the data of millions of users against improper access by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nMatt Stoller, policy director at Open Markets Institute, one of the groups Definers targeted, told POLITICO that the FTC needs to punish Facebook and set rules to rein in the company's behavior.\n\n\"If they don\u2019t do anything meaningful, then Congress needs to step in and do something,\" he added. \"Facebook is perfectly willing to engage in tactics that reflect a total disrespect for any ethical grounding whatsoever.\n\n\"If the legal context were different, they would have to act differently,\" Stoller said.\n\nNancy Scola contributed to this report.\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bfaler@politico.com (Brian Faler)", "title": "Downhill from here?", "description": "About those Amazon subsidies ... \u2014 Opportunity Zone connection", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2018/11/15/downhill-from-here-413779", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:02:58Z", "content": "Editors Note: This edition of Morning Tax is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Tax subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pros comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy t\u2026 [+7790 chars]", "fulltext": "Downhill from here?\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Tax is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Tax subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Tax will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23.

Our Ben White looks at why the economy right now may be as good as it\u2019s going to get, and what that means for Republicans. \u201cFiscal stimulus from the GOP tax cuts is likely to start running out. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep bumping up interest rates. And few analysts expect a divided Congress \u2014 facing soaring deficits and with its eyes on 2020 \u2014 to join hands and pass a big infrastructure package or sweeping middle-class tax cuts to keep the fiscal juice going.\u201d That, along with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars, he says, \u201ccould deny Trump the kind of big economic growth numbers he loves to celebrate. And they could undercut one of the GOP\u2019s biggest current arguments: You may not love what Trump says or does, but the Trump economy is awesome.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY. Tell us what we should be writing about. We\u2019re at bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com teckert@politico.com and bbecker@politico.com. You can also find us Twittering at @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo, and, of course, at @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nABOUT THOSE AMAZON SUBSIDIES\u2026 Our Steven Overly looks at how big incentive packages politicians put together to lure companies can go wrong, focusing on Wisconsin\u2019s deal to bring Foxconn to the Badger State. Once touted as a triumph for Gov. Scott Walker, opinion shifted amid \u201ctax breaks, regulatory rollbacks and other favors that Wisconsin was handing Foxconn. The cost of the state incentives continued to climb while the size of the factory and number of new jobs appeared to be shrinking \u2014 a reality that may have contributed to Walker\u2019s ouster at the polls last week,\u201d he says.\n\nThe New York Times, meanwhile, wonders how much those incentives even matter. \u201cIn selecting New York and Virginia for its new locations, Amazon turned down seemingly richer offers just next door. Maryland and New Jersey each offered multi-billion dollar incentive packages that dwarfed the ones Amazon accepted,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cGov. Andrew Cuomo defended the deal, arguing New York has to offer incentives because of its comparatively high taxes,\u201c the paper said. \u201cIf we do nothing, they\u2019re going to Texas,\u201d said Cuomo.\n\nTHE OPPORTUNITY ZONE CONNECTION: Much of the New York site Amazon selected for a new headquarters is eligible for the new \u201cOpportunity Zone\u201d program offering tax breaks for investing in underdeveloped areas, the Associated Press reports. \u201cCritics question whether Long Island City, the fast-gentrifying Queens neighborhood across the East River from the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan, needs such breaks. Median household income around Amazon\u2019s planned campus is $130,000, poverty is half the city average and new buildings were going up long before the overhaul.\u201d\n\nPolitics\n\nMACARTHUR LOSES: Rep. Tom MacArthur, the only New Jersey lawmaker to back the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lost his reelection bid thanks in part to the law\u2019s cap on state and local tax deductions. The loss \u201ccaps a devastating midterm election for Republicans in New Jersey,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cWith 11 Democrats now holding House seats, Representative Chris Smith is the lone Republican in Washington from New Jersey; the last time Democrats had such a large advantage Theodore Roosevelt was in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nHARRIS\u2019 TAX CUT IS EVEN BIGGER THAN TRUMP\u2019S: Potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris\u2019 tax cut plan weighs in at $2.8 trillion, the Tax Policy Center says, or almost twice what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act costs. All that debt is a big reason why TPC says the plan would actually hurt the economy in the long run. But it would provide a big benefit to average Americans \u2014 those in the bottom quintile of incomes would see their after-tax earnings climb 12.6 percent.\n\nIRS\n\nTHE IRS NEEDS HELP WITH WEED MONEY: The agency is paying $1.7 million to an outside firm to help it process tax payments in cash from marijuana producers, Quartz reports. Many weed sellers are unbanked because financial institutions don\u2019t want to deal with them, so they pay their taxes in cash.\n\nSays Quartz: \u201cWhen a cannabis business pays federal taxes, someone has to schedule an appointment with the IRS to go to its local offices and make a cash deposit. A secure space is set aside to count it all, and there are two IRS employees inside the room at all times, explained Oakland cannabis accountant Luigi Zamarra.\u201d Quartz dug up data showing the IRS paying Virginia-based Mitre Corporation for \u201clarge cash payments for processing cannabis federal taxes.\u201d Both declined comment.\n\nAMID LEAN BUDGETS, IRS TURNS TO DATA ANALYTICS: \u201cIRS criminal investigations increasingly rely on data analytics as the number of agents has waned at that division of the agency,\u201d our Aaron Lorenzo reports. The number of special agents has fallen to a 40-year low \u201cdue to retirements and a lack of hiring over the past five years due to lean IRS budgets.\u201d The agency is \u201cincreasingly making use of data-based models, algorithms and existing records and evidence,\u201d Lorenzo reports.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nCHICAGO IS TAXING YOUR PLAYSTATION: \u201cPlaystation users in Chicago on Wednesday began paying a 9 percent tax on streaming content as the gaming company starts complying with a city levy,\u201d the Chicago Tribune reports. \u201cThe city\u2019s amusement tax, which used to apply mostly to concert and sporting event tickets, was extended to include streaming services in 2015. That includes charges paid for playing games, according to Chicago\u2019s Finance Department. Some tech companies have fought the additional 9 percent charge. Apple filed a lawsuit against the city in August alleging the tax on its music streaming services was illegal and discriminatory.\u201d\n\nSYRACUSE TRIES IT THE EASY WAY: \u201cA city in New York state has found a novel way of motivating residents to pay their back taxes: personal notes handwritten by city officials,\u201d the Associated Press says. \u201cCity officials wrote and signed thousands of notes by hand, rather than sending standard legal letters demanding payment. The result was the city collecting nearly $1.5 million more than it predicted.\u201d\n\nANCHORAGE CONSIDERS ALCOHOL TAX HIKE: The city\u2019s mayor wants to raise taxes to help fund substance abuse and anti-homelessness programs. \u201cAlcohol is an incredibly profitable business in this town,\u201d said Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The tax would add 40 cents to the cost of a six-pack of beer, the paper says. Congress slashed taxes on alcohol makers as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the consternation of public-health advocates.\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nJAPAN & THE ART OF RAISING TAXES: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to raise the country\u2019s sale tax, \u201cwhich the government has done twice since It was introduced in 1989\u201d and \u201chas sent the economy into reverse and incited political revolts,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek reports. \u201cBut with the ruling party recently reaffirming its support for his leadership, he\u2019s seized on next year as the best time to bolster the government\u2019s revenue base without tipping the economy into recession. The construction boom for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo is set to roll on, exports look likely to hold up, and the gross domestic product is forecast to expand by just more than one percent \u2013 a healthy number by Japanese standards.\u201d\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nThe Tax Policy Center\u2019s Renu Zaretsky on why tax-free tampons are a bad idea\n\nITEP on repealing the SALT cap\n\nHow many income tax brackets does your state have?\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe person who donated the Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian send it to the museum through the mail."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mcassella@politico.com (Megan Cassella)", "title": "USMCA on the docket", "description": "Malmstr&ouml;m vows retaliation against auto tariffs \u2014 Trump looms large over APEC", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2018/11/15/usmca-on-the-docket-413964", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:02:55Z", "content": "With help from Sabrina Rodriguez Editors Note: This edition of Morning Trade is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pros comprehensive p\u2026 [+10871 chars]", "fulltext": "USMCA on the docket\n\nWith help from Sabrina Rodriguez\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Trade is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Morning Trade will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23. Our next newsletter will publish on Monday, Nov. 26. Please continue to follow Pro Trade issues here.\n\nON TAP TODAY: It\u2019s a big day for NAFTA 2.0 today as dozens of industry officials and others gather at the U.S. International Trade Commission to share their thoughts on the new agreement. European trade czar Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s visit to Washington is wrapping up with little clarity on the future of U.S.-EU trade talks \u2014 but plenty of warnings from Brussels about retaliation against car tariffs and how it doesn\u2019t want to touch agriculture. Plus, the most influential figure at this week\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperationleaders summit might be the one who\u2019s not there: Donald Trump. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nSOUNDING OFF ON USMCA: Dozens of industry representatives, labor groups and lawmakers are headed to the U.S. International Trade Commission today and Friday to make their case either for or against NAFTA\u2019s new replacement.\n\nThe hearing is part of an ITC probe examining the effect of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the broader U.S. economy as well as individual sectors. That investigation, which is required under Trade Promotion Authority, will wrap up with a report due by mid-March, though it could potentially conclude sooner. Congress is expected to wait until the ITC report is complete to vote on the USMCA, though it is not legally required to do so.\n\nVoicing their views: The hearing will start off with testimony from Democratic Reps. Sander Levin, who is retiring at the end of the year, and Bill Pascrell, whose potential role as the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee means that his support for the deal could be crucial to its passage in the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nAuto group representatives are then scheduled to kick off the first of what will be six panels over two days, which are more or less divided by industry. Agriculture groups will also testify Thursday. They will be followed by labor and environmental groups whose stance on the deal could prove influential among newly powerful House Democrats.\n\nThe steel elephant in the room: Throughout six panels worth of testimonies that will run through Friday, expect substantial commentary on the need for the Trump administration to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in order for the new deal to prove effective.\n\n\u201cThe new USMCA simply cannot work as intended for the aluminum industry and our customers with those tariffs \u2014 or quotas to limit access to supply \u2014 in place,\u201d Heidi Brock of the Aluminum Association wrote.\n\nOr, as the Beer Institute, put it: \u201cWe do not believe the agreement is complete, however, unless steel and aluminum tariffs are completely eliminated. And for the record \u2014 we don\u2019t support quotas in lieu of tariffs.\u201d\n\nIT'S THURSDAY, NOV. 15! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host decided last night to try the popular internet prank where millennials text their parents asking how long they should microwave a 25 pound turkey for and is still laughing at the results. Any suggestions out there for what crazy thing I should text my mom today? Let me know: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella.\n\nMALMSTR\u04e6M PLEDGES TIT FOR TAT: The European Union will waste no time in retaliating against the U.S. if the Trump administration moves forward with import duties on European cars. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said Wednesday in Washington that she has a \u201cdraft list\u201d of products \u201ccovering lots of different sectors\u201d that would face penalties if Trump hits the EU auto industry first. But she also said she did not discuss the issue during her meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Doug has more.\n\nAll-important agriculture: Malmstr\u00f6m warned that any prospective trade talks would likely come to a standstill if the Trump administration continues to push for agriculture to be included as part of any deal \u2014 including if it even lists ag among its negotiating objectives it is expected to send to Congress before talks begin.\n\n\"I understand that it is still important from the U.S. side, but we have been very clear that it is not going to be in a trade agreement from our side,\" Malmstr\u00f6m told reporters. \"Things haven\u2019t changed.\" More on that here.\n\nU.K. CABINET BACKS DRAFT BREXIT DEAL: British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday won the support of her Cabinet on the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement after a \u201clong, detailed and impassioned debate.\u201d\n\nUnder the draft agreement, the U.K. and EU will aim to have a trade deal wrapped up before the end of the transition period in December 2020, but that could be extended if there\u2019s no deal by then.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Securing the \u201ccollective decision\u201d of her Cabinet without any immediate resignations makes room for a summit with European Union leaders in Brussels that has been penciled in for Nov. 25.\n\nTougher parts to come: The prime minister for now dodges a damaging no-deal Brexit, but the stage is still set for a much larger battle to get her deal through parliament. May acknowledged there would be \u201cdifficult\u201d days ahead and \u201cintense scrutiny\u201d of her draft deal.\n\nU.S. connection: Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) on Wednesday raised concern about the \u201ccatastrophic consequences that can flow from a bad Brexit.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor many, many years, we\u2019ve relied on Great Britain, especially, to carry our water in EU negotiations. We\u2019re not going to have that when it comes to their exit from the EU, so we\u2019re going to have to find new avenues of relevancy within the EU,\u201d Kind, a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Morning Trade. More on the deal here.\n\nWARNINGS REACTIVATED OVER AUTO TARIFFS: Reports this week that a draft of the administration\u2019s Section 232 report on auto imports is undergoing the interagency review process have led to a fresh wave of criticism over the threat to impose new tariffs on cars.\n\nWhere it would hurt: The Tax Foundation put out a new analysis Wednesday estimating that blanket 25 percent tariffs on all imports could cause a $53.1 billion economic hit and lead to the loss of more than 164,000 jobs.\n\nThey also mapped out what the impact would be divvied up by individual trading partner. If Canada and Mexico are excluded, for example, those numbers drop to nearly $28 billion and 86,000 jobs. More here.\n\nThe Organization for International Investment also added its voice, noting that the effects of imposing \u201cbygone industrial policy in the automotive sector under the pretext of national security\u201d would likely \u201ccreep into every corner of our economy.\u201d The statement came out alongside a new OFII survey showing that chief financial officers list potential auto tariffs as the largest threat to U.S. competitiveness.\n\nTRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER PENCE\u2019S ASIA TRIP: Trump may have chosen to skip this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in Papua New Guinea this weekend, but that doesn\u2019t mean his presence won\u2019t be felt.\n\n\u201cIn the background, we\u2019ve got big trade frictions going on and that\u2019s definitely hung over the agenda,\u201d Alan Bollard, executive director of the APEC secretariat, told Morning Trade. \u201cThere are some differences in terms of the terms of trade.\u201d\n\nIn his place: Vice President Mike Pence will attend APEC and meet with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this week in Trump\u2019s stead. Lighthizer is expected to attend, Bollard said, though USTR has yet to make any formal announcement.\n\nSTEELWORKERS GET A POST-TARIFF RAISE: The United Steelworkers signed a new contract this week that secures a 14 percent increase in wages over the next four years and strengthens retirement benefits, changes the union and Trump administration officials both said were a result of profits the industry has begun to see since steel import tariffs took effect earlier this year.\n\nTrump takes credit: \u201cNot seen in many years, America\u2019s steelworkers get a hard-earned raise because of my Administration\u2019s policies to help bring back the U.S. steel industry, which is critical to our National Security,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI will always protect America and its workers!\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross chimed in with his own statement saying that the new contract illustrates the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the president\u2019s trade policies.\n\nNEW SANCTIONS ON CUBA GO INTO EFFECT TODAY: The State Department released on Wednesday a list of more than two dozen Cuban companies that will begin to face sanctions today. Americans are barred from any financial dealings with the companies, which have ties to the Communist-run island\u2019s military and intelligence services.\n\nThe Trump administration first placed sanctions on almost 200 Cuban entities in November, as part of an effort to walk back on some of former President Barack Obama\u2019s pro-engagement policies. White House National Security Adviser John Bolton first announced that there would be more sanctions on Cuba earlier this month.\n\nPushback: James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a coalition that supports normalized relations, said the new sanctions are part of an \u201cattempt to choke commercial ties with Cuba\u201d and \u201cplay into the hands of adversaries like the Chinese government and Vladimir Putin, both of which are actively trying to undermine U.S. interests in Latin America.\u201d\n\nTRADE REMEDY CORNER\n\nCHINESE RUBBER BANDS EDITION: The Commerce Department found evidence that rubber bands from China are being unfairly subsidized and dumped in the United States. In its final ruling, the agency moved to impose anti-dumping duties of 27.3 percent and anti-subsidy duties of 125.8 percent on imports of the product from China, which were valued at an estimated $4.9 million last year. The case now moves to the ITC, which is scheduled to make its final determinations on or around Dec. 28.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, China has provided a written response to the Trump administration\u2019s trade demands, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 As fiscal stimulus from this year\u2019s tax cuts wear off and a divided Congress takes control of Washington next year, the economy\u2019s recent sugar high is likely to wear off, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n\u2014 The difference between U.S. export prices for soybeans and Brazilian exports is narrowing, indicating the industry could be seeing signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations, CNBC reports.\n\n\u2014 Rep.

Our next Morning Transportation newsletter will publish on Monday, Nov. 26. Please continue to follow Transportation issues here.\n\nNTSB DIGS INTO SOUTHWEST 1380: The agency held a hearing Wednesday about the failure of an engine on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this year, with representatives from Boeing, FAA, the airline and engine manufacturer CFM International testifying. During the April incident, a fan blade detached and debris crashed into the fuselage. The plane lost one window and a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, was partly sucked out. A medical examiner later found that Riordan died from \u201cblunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nPiece by piece: Participants in the daylong hearing spoke about the fan blades as well as other parts of CFM56-7 engines. NTSB member T. Bella Dinh-Zarr noted at the end of the hearing that it\u2019ll be months before a final report about the accident is ready.\n\nScary, to say the least: NTSB on Wednesday also made available the docket for its investigation. According to an interview summary, a flight attendant said she saw Riordan in her seat with her upper torso, head and arms outside the plane. The attendant took hold of Riordan\u2019s leg and another held her lower body. A pair of male passengers came to help pull her inside. The flight attendant also noted that during the flight, \u201cmany oxygen masks were broken and pulled down to the point the air hose was not attached,\u201d and many passengers \u201chad it on over their mouth and not their nose.\u201d\n\nCommunication difficulties: Meanwhile, in the cockpit, first officer Darren Ellisor said it was so noisy that it was difficult at first to communicate with air traffic control and Capt. Tammie Jo Shults, who eventually landed the plane at Philadelphia International Airport. Ellisor said that their oxygen masks, the so-called startle factor and the \u201ctemporary loss of situational awareness\u201d also played a role in the communication problems. As the plane was descending, he tried to call the flight attendants. Eventually, he got in touch with one, who told him \u201cthere was someone outside the aircraft,\u201d according to an interview summary. After the plane was on the ground, the pilots had trouble communicating with fire trucks via radio.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

Visit PlanetM.com **\n\nFULL SPEED AHEAD: A Coast Guard reauthorization (S. 140 (115)) passed the Senate with fairly broad support Wednesday. The handful of dissenters included Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). The bill will now move to the House, which passed similar reauthorization language in a defense bill earlier (H.R. 5515 (115)) this year.\n\nFIRST IN MT: BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD REFORM TIFIA LOANS: Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) plan to introduce a bill today aimed at reforming DOT's TIFIA loans. The legislation would expedite projects that meet certain specifications and require DOT to publish status reports online. And it would raise the threshold for projects that need to secure two opinions from credit rating agencies from $75 million to $150 million. \"These carefully targeted changes will make it easier, faster, and more cost effective for communities to finance key transportation projects with TIFIA loans, while also maintaining rigorous loan standards,\" Kaine said in a statement.\n\nCOMMITTEE LEADERSHIP CHANGES: Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) was officially elected to the position of majority whip on Wednesday, cementing a long-expected promotion. He will have to abandon his gavel, meaning the top spot on Commerce is set to go to Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who is next in line in seniority.\n\nOnly one remains: On the House side, Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) is in line to be ranking member of the Transportation Committee, after Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) officially lost his reelection bid earlier this week. In an October interview, Graves told MT that his experience serving in the minority would be helpful as ranking member \u2014 he\u2019s one of only two Republican members on the committee who have done so (the other is Alaska\u2019s Don Young). Graves has also been a ranking member before, on the Small Business Committee. \u201cI know how to work with members on both sides of the aisle. That\u2019s how you get things done. [Incoming Chairman Peter DeFazio] and I have a great relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I did with Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez on Small Business, we couldn\u2019t be further apart, two different polar opposites when it comes to politics, but we were able to get a lot of stuff done. And it would be the same way with Peter.\u201d\n\nSubcommittee shuffle: We\u2019re still polling members to see who\u2019s interested in what subcommittee, and here\u2019s the latest: Neither Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson (D-Ind.) nor Rep. Albio Sires (D-N.J.) were interested in heading up the railroads subpanel. Sires said he\u2019d defer to Donald Milford Payne, who is interested. Rep. Brian J. Mast (R-Fla.) wants to stay on as ranking member on the Coast Guard Subcommittee \u2014 \"if they'll have me\" \u2014 and expected Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) would be chairman. Mast said they\u2019d continue working on getting more icebreakers.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nIT\u2019S NOT EASY FINDING GREEN: Senate leaders presented at-odds visions for Congress\u2019 work on an infrastructure package Wednesday, your host reports. Schumer reiterated that Democrats will push for a \u201creal\u201d bill with \u201cdirect and robust federal investments.\u201d But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned \u201cthere\u2019s no easy way to pay for infrastructure without impacting an awful lot of Americans,\u201d despite saying that he hoped the two parties could work together on infrastructure. He said Republicans are not interested in a $900 billion stimulus package \u201cwhich we did at the beginning of the Obama era.\u201d\n\nAirlines fear second attempt at tax increase: Meanwhile, airlines are bracing for the possibility that lawmakers, most likely in the House, could try to include ticket fee and tax increases in an infrastructure bill, after failing to attach such provisions to the FAA reauthorization. \"Constitutionally, tax increases have to originate in the House and my suspicion is that an infrastructure package, which is a place where we might see that, is something that will also begin in the House,\u201d said Sharon Pinkerton of Airlines for America. Stephanie Beasley has more details for Pros.\n\nRail\n\nPTC GUT CHECK: Commuter railroads made progress on implementing positive train control in the third quarter of this year, and the American Public Transportation Association said it has \u201cevery expectation\u201d that all 28 around the country will meet a Dec. 31 deadline. \u201cSixty-eight percent of the 28 commuter railroads are either in PTC operation, testing the technology on trains that operate regular passenger service, or awaiting FRA approval to begin such testing, the group told reporters,\u201d Tanya reported for Pros.\n\nTightening their belts: Jim Derwinski, CEO and executive director of Chicago\u2019s Metra, said his agency has had to forgo purchases of new locomotives and coach cars as well as other enhancements to pay for PTC. APTA President and CEO Paul Skoutelas said that as far as he knows, no railroads have raised fares explicitly to pay for PTC improvements.\n\nOn the Hill: Lawmakers are preparing to continue their oversight of PTC implementation. \u201cI've been getting briefed and we\u2019ll be addressing that with the administration probably in early December when we come back. Deadlines are deadlines,\" DeFazio told MT.\n\nAUTOMOBILES\n\nEPA EXEMPTS AUTO DEALERS FROM TAKATA RCRA REQUIREMENTS: EPA on Wednesday said it will exempt auto dealerships, collision shops and salvage yards that are pulling defective Takata airbags out of vehicles from hazardous waste management rules under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Until earlier this year, the defective inflators were all sent to Takata warehouses under a DOT order and were not subject to RCRA waste handling requirements. But Takata's bankruptcy and a change in DOT's order means the recalled inflators, which are subject to RCRA because of their propellant, can now be sent directly to special disposal facilities.\n\nStreamlining the process: Many of the dealers and salvage yards pulling the airbags may not have the expertise or experience to meet more rigorous RCRA requirements, and that could lead to a slowdown in removing the dangerous airbags from cars still on the road, EPA said. The exemption will apply to all airbag waste, not just Takata, to \"avoid confusion, increase efficiency and will help prevent non-Takata airbag waste from being diverted into the municipal waste stream,\" EPA said. The parts still must be sent to a RCRA-certified facility for ultimate disposal. The exemption will take effect as soon as the interim final rule is published in the Federal Register. EPA will also take public comment for 60 days with plans to formally finalize the rule next year.\n\nNOMINATIONS\n\nTWO TAPPED FOR MARITIME BOARD: Trump nominated Daniel Maffei and L.E. Sola to be members of the Federal Maritime Commission. Maffei, a former Congressman from New York, previously served a two-year term on the commission under President Barack Obama, but was not initially reappointed to the board by Trump when his term expired earlier this year.

The newsletter will resume publishing on Nov. 26.\n\nNEW NAME, SAME GREAT TASTE \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s expected signature on a bill (H.R. 3359) renaming and reorganizing the DHS cyber wing will give that part of the department a much-needed boost in stature and begin a process of streamlining its operations, according to its leader. \u201cIt puts us on the level of other operational agencies within the federal government, including within the department,\u201d Chris Krebs, the undersecretary in charge of the cyber wing, said at a National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee meeting on Wednesday. He told reporters after the meeting that the bill \u201cputs us into position to be the lead federal civilian cybersecurity agency,\u201d where \u201cright now, it\u2019s not imminently clear\u201d who has that role.\n\nOnce Trump signs the bill into law, it will rename the National Protection and Programs Directorate to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. But that is only the beginning, said Krebs, who described the change as \u201ca groundbreaking, not a ribbon-cutting.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d he said. \u201cOrganizationally, I kind of equate us to a 14-year-old startup. We don\u2019t have mature processes in place. We\u2019ve got a lot of internal work to do. But we have a very clear sense of purpose.\u201d\n\nKrebs\u2019 agency will follow the mantra of \u201cdefend today and secure tomorrow,\u201d he told the NSTAC. In addition to its existing work protecting federal networks, DHS will \u201cexpand into the industrial control system area,\u201d he said. It has already launched pilot programs in areas like pipeline cybersecurity. Industry help will be crucial in building a \u201ccollective defense model,\u201d he said, because the federal government won\u2019t be able to fill all of its cyber job openings. And DHS will lean heavily on guidance from the private sector rather than charging out with ideas developed entirely in-house. \u201cI need my stakeholders to tell us what they need us to do,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to industry collaboration, DHS will also place more emphasis on promoting public awareness of cyber issues. \u201cWhat can we do to better educate the American public on cybersecurity risks and what they can do to protect themselves?\u201d Krebs said, before praising the U.K. for its approach to the challenge.\n\nFRABJOUS DAY, CALLOOH, CALLAY \u2014 Everybody\u2019s pretty thrilled to see the CISA legislation finally get to the finish line. House Speaker Paul Ryan and sponsor Mike McCaul held a signing ceremony in honor of the occasion Wednesday. \u201cThe creation of CISA within the department is a long overdue step that will strengthen DHS\u2019s ability to execute its cyber mission and enhance coordination among our government\u2019s cybersecurity efforts,\u201d said Jordan Wong, a spokesperson for Sen. Claire McCaskill, who was a sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. Offered Ryan Gillis, vice president of cybersecurity strategy and policy at Palo Alto Networks: \u201cThe bill rightly gives the Department of Homeland Security the flexibility to organize its cybersecurity and critical infrastructure office to meet today\u2019s threats and challenges, and grants the agency a name that truly matches its mission.\u201d\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Full team info below.\n\nTODAY: TALKING ICT \u2014 The Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force holds its very first meeting today. Announced last month, the task force is a joint government-industry group devoted to identifying and managing supply chain risks in those industries. According to a draft DHS announcement obtained by MC, its government executive committee members include DHS, DoD, DOJ, Commerce, General Services Administration, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Social Security Administration and Treasury.\n\nIts industry executive committee members include Accenture, AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, Cisco, Comcast, CTIA \u2014 the Wireless Association, CyberRx, Cybersecurity Coalition, Cyxtera, FireEye, Intel, The Information Technology Industry Council, the IT Information Sharing and Analysis Center, Microsoft, National Association of Broadcasters, NCTA - the Internet and Television Association, Palo Alto Networks, Samsung, Sprint, Threat Sketch, the Telecommunications Industry Association, T-Mobile, USTelecom and Verizon.\n\nTOMORROW: TALKING DIPLOMACY AND CYBERSPACE \u2014 Your MC host heads to Brussels for a conference Friday hosted by our POLITICO EU colleagues asking the question, \u201cIs Europe cyber-ready?\u201d I\u2019ll be moderating a chat on the diplomacy piece. Panelists include Antonio Missiroli, NATO\u2019s Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges; Carmen Gonsalves, the head of international cyber policy in the Netherlands\u2019 Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chris Painter, a commissioner on the Global Commission on Stability of Cyberspace and former State Department cyber coordinator; and Patryk Pawlak, Brussels Executive Officer for the EU Institute for Security Studies.\n\nALL WAIT AND NO PLAY MAKES DoD A DULL BOY \u2014 The Pentagon takes too long to acquire new tech, causing DoD to reinvent what\u2019s already commercially available and fall behind on innovation, cybersecurity executives told lawmakers at a Senate Armed Services cyber subcommittee hearing Wednesday. Executives from CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Core Consulting and Parsons Corporation told lawmakers the private sector faces the same risks as the DoD, but the Pentagon doesn\u2019t take advantage of the threat intelligence already developed by some commercial coalitions like the Cyber Threat Alliance. What\u2019s more, contracts can take years to implement. \u201cIf it takes you three years to figure out if the technology is good enough, it\u2019s probably already obsolete by the time you deploy it,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike chief technology officer.\n\nThe DoD also focuses too much on cyber hygiene and passively securing infrastructure and not enough on actively searching for threats, some said. Clearance also poses a significant problem, they said, and potential employees are turning to the private industry simply because it\u2019s faster and easier to get hired.\n\nHEAR YE, HEAR YE \u2014 The Defense Intelligence Agency has issued a call to industry outlining potential requirements for its new database. The \u201cbroad agency announcement\u201d from the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence armed details four \u201ctechnical capability\u201d areas that could contribute to the envisioned Machine-Assisted Analytic Rapid-Repository System (MARS), including demonstrating a \u201cflexible, scalable and adaptable data centric environment able to manage and support, at a massive level, a variety of diverse and dynamic data\u201d for multiple kinds of users.\n\nMAGIC 8 BALL SAYS: OUTLOOK NOT SO GOOD \u2014 Expect cyberattacks to ramp up at nearly every avenue, FireEye said in a report looking at cybersecurity in 2019 out today. The cybersecurity firm expects nations to take more offensive attacks that deteriorate the traditional rules of engagement. Attacks on cloud infrastructures, mobile devices, e-commerce sites and online banking portals are also expected to increase as tools and attack vectors both grow wider and more easily available.\n\nRussia\u2019s successful disinformation campaign in 2016 has inspired and taught other threat actors, so expect more social media influence operations, FireEye said. Iran and China are expected to ramp up their attacks, as well. One way to slow down the number of attacks is by ensuring hacks carry \u201crisk and repercussions\u201d in the coming year, FireEye said.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 The State Department says it\u2019s \u201cnot in a position to endorse\u201d a Paris-led accord on cybersecurity. \u2026 IRS criminal investigations are increasingly relying on data analytics, according to a report from the agency. \u2026 DoD and DHS signed a pact on cybersecurity cooperation.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 This is a good conversation regardless of your position on it.\n\nREPORT WATCH\n\n\u2014 At least one in three companies experienced a cryptocurrency mining attack in 2017, according to SecureWorks\u2019 latest cybercrime report, released Wednesday. \u201cThese infections represent unauthorized access to the network and can affect critical business functions,\u201d the company said. It also found that hackers created more than 257 ransomware variants between July 2017 and June 2018. One of them, GandCrab, spread with remarkable speed and became \u201cthe most prevalent ransomware threat in the first half of 2018,\u201d according to the company.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 A New York Times investigation into Facebook sheds light on Russian hacking attempts on the platform and how the social media giant handled disinformation campaigns early on.\n\n\u2014 An former U.N. diplomat accused of hacking GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy has diplomatic immunity, the U.S. says.

Our next Morning Ag installment will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nIN THE HOPPER: In some of the sharpest intra-party sniping yet in farm bill talks, Senate Ag Chairman Pat Roberts on Wednesday blamed his House counterpart Mike Conaway for holding up a potential agreement over concerns spanning at least six titles. Roberts is shooting for a deal as soon as today. Conaway said \u201cwe\u2019re going to get a deal done,\u201d but wished talks could remain behind closed doors.\n\n\u2014 \u201cNeither one of us is gaining anything by whacking on each other in front of the press,\u201d Conaway said.\n\n\u2014 California wine groups and farm bureaus are getting involved in the year-end congressional spending battle, seeking new funds and policy changes to help the state\u2019s wine grape growers deal with damage from catastrophic wildfires. Their sights are set on an emergency funding package in the works for ag producers dealing with this year\u2019s natural disasters.\n\nCONAWAY DEFIANT AS ROBERTS SEEKS DEAL TODAY: House and Senate Agriculture Committee leaders are within striking distance of reaching agreement on a farm bill conference report, as the Senate panel\u2019s top Republican and Democrat see things.\n\nRoberts\u2019 ambitious outlook of a deal being possible today, if realized, would put Congress in good position to pass final legislation before the year ends. But sources tell MA that lawmakers have a ways to go before a deal can be reached.\n\nThe loneliest number: As one would expect, the six titles that Roberts says Conaway is dug in on include the commodity, conservation and nutrition sections. But Roberts also said Wednesday that he, Senate Agriculture ranking member Debbie Stabenow and House Ag ranking member Collin Peterson were all on the same page.\n\n\u201cI am very troubled by the fact that we have agreement among three but we can\u2019t get the fourth one,\u201d Roberts said of the Big Four, our Liz Crampton reports. Conaway has been slow to respond to compromise offers, Roberts said, and at one point took 12 days to make a counter-proposal.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re close if the House wants to get a farm bill,\u201d Stabenow said, per another dispatch Liz filed from the Hill.\n\nConaway\u2019s response: The Texas Republican disagreed with the notion that Roberts, Stabenow and Peterson were in accord. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some things I haven\u2019t agreed to, they\u2019ve got some things they haven\u2019t agreed to, so you pick your poison as to who you think is standing in the way,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nThe House Ag chairman accused Roberts of also not being quick to respond to proposals. Conaway said it took Roberts\u2019 staff eight days to respond to one of Conaway\u2019s offers.\n\n\u2014 Bottom line: It\u2019s become increasingly clear that the Big Four are not on the same page about where talks stand, raising more questions about how quickly lawmakers can get a bill done in the lame-duck session.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY, NOV. 15! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host could always use a two-hour delay. Have any news or tips?

A new report out today from Rabobank, a Holland-based banking company focused on agricultural financing, is the latest warning for U.S. agricultural producers to brace for continued trade tension and other threats to commodity prices.\n\nTrade: President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China remains the biggest threat, especially for soybean growers. If Beijing\u2019s 25 percent retaliatory tariffs remain in place, the report said U.S. soybean stocks \u201cwill easily double.\u201d The bank predicts that Washington\u2019s steep trade deficit with China will make it difficult for the two countries to quickly reach a major deal. But Rabobank saw it as promising that trade negotiators were able to finalize a new North American trade pact in a short span of time.\n\nPork problems: Rabobank also warns that pork markets could take a hit if the spread of African Swine Fever currently making its way through Chinese livestock herds worsens. Markets would likely shift as they did in response to outbreaks of bird flu, with consumers shifting preferences in consumption.\n\nMore bad news: There\u2019s also an 80 percent chance that an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern could be declared by the end of the winter, which could spell wetter conditions on the Southwestern Plains and the opposite in parts of the Midwest.\n\n\u201cFood producers face a melting pot of risks,\u201d said Justin Sherrard, global strategist for animal protein at Rabobank. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s possible that not all of them will come to pass, they need to be prepared for a difficult and worrying year in 2019.\u201d\n\nPros, POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman has more on the report here.\n\nCALIFORNIA WINE PRODUCERS SEEK WILDFIRE AID: The state\u2019s wine grape growers want a piece of a potential disaster-assistance package for agricultural producers that Congress might take up in coming weeks or months. Heavy smoke from the deadly blazes has tainted crops, forcing growers to leave grapes withering on the vine or to sell them at a steep discount. Producers also worry that consumer fears of smoke exposure could drive down demand.\n\nStatewide and county winegrower groups and farm bureaus this week wrote to federal lawmakers to make specific policy requests, like extending a federal wildfire indemnity program and promoting access to crop insurance for wine grape growers with smoke exposure claims.\n\n\u201cWe urge the inclusion of California winegrape growers in any disaster assistance bill that may move forward,\u201d the groups wrote, citing \u201csubstantial economic losses\u201d from the fires, especially in Lake and Mendocino counties.\n\n\u2014 Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson, whose district includes Napa Valley and much of Sonoma County, said he\u2019s pushing House appropriators to extend the wildfire indemnity program to include wine grape growers who suffered recent damage.\n\nTallying up the damage: The wine grape crop in Lake County typically produces $75 million in revenue, the groups said, but now producers there are facing losses of at least $37 million, or roughly 50 percent. (The damage to Malibu vineyards has been extensive as well, The Hollywood Reporter writes.)\n\n\u2014 Reps. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) and Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) are working on a spending package to help farmers, ranchers and rural communities recover from natural disasters including Western wildfires and major hurricanes that struck the Southeast. Vineyards appeared to be on the list of potential recipients of the ag aid.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Few changes in leadership ranks: Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst is the new Senate Republican Conference vice chair, following leadership elections Wednesday, POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett reports. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was reelected as majority leader and Chuck Schumer will remain the Senate Democratic leader. In the House, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was chosen to lead the GOP conference as minority leader next year.\n\n\u2014 EU vows swift retaliation if Trump imposes auto tariffs: EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said Wednesday she has a \u201cdraft list\u201d of products \u201ccovering lots of different sectors\u201d that would face penalties if Trump slaps duties on the EU auto industry. Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer has more.\n\n\u2014 More Malmstr\u00f6m: The EU trade chief, who met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington, also warned that prospective U.S.-EU trade talks would likely freeze if the Trump administration keeps pushing for agriculture to be included in a deal \u2014 or even if ag is listed as a negotiating objective when the administration sends Congress its trade goals before the talks begin. Doug has that story, too.\n\n\u2014 USDA sued over certain labeling procedures: The Animal Welfare Institute sued the Agriculture Department on Wednesday, claiming it failed to mandate third-party audits of food label claims like \u201chumane\u201d and \u201csustainable.\u201d AWI said USDA hasn\u2019t responded quickly enough to a 2014 petition from the group seeking independent certification of such label claims.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, who\u2019s facing former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy in a runoff on Nov. 27.

Herszenhorn has the details of the Brexit plans.\n\n\u2014 Consumer Reports wants to know salmonella-linked turkey brands: A week before Thanksgiving, USDA is facing pressure from consumer advocates to name the brands linked to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 160 people in 35 states, including one person who died.

Please continue to follow eHealth issues here.\n\nMANY QUESTIONS FOR VA, DoD AT HEARING: Pressure is building on the government\u2019s big EHR project as the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense plan to reveal a joint command structure for the software enterprise\u2019s implementation, VA program director John Windom said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the House Veterans' Affairs EHR subcommittee quizzed Windom on the lack of clarity about the structure, and some of the allegations in recent media investigations \u2014 such as a ProPublica report that the DoD had considered trying to take over the entire EHR project. (Windom denied that one.)\n\nThe final versions of the DoD and VA\u2019s EHRs will overlap; matters such as cybersecurity, data hosting structure and patient identity management can be done jointly, Travis Dalton, Cerner's government business lead, testified. Specific differences remain to be ironed out, he said:\n\n\"We learned some hard lessons with the DoD implementation, and we're doing a lot of things differently.\"\n\n\u2014 Some Epic questions too: The VA also will brief Congress in December on whether it plans to scrap an Epic scheduling pilot or use both Epic and Cerner systems.\n\nCommittee members asked why VA had spent more than $200 million less than budgeted in 2018 as its 10-year estimate for the project jumped from $15.8 billion to $16.1 billion. Windom said the added cost reflected salaries of VA employees that weren\u2019t included in a hurried first estimate.\n\nVA scrubbed an initial plan to staff the EHR modernization office with 700 people, mostly contractors. The plan now is to have to 269 government employees and to draw more heavily on VHA and Office of Information and Technology expertise, Windom said.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: Thomas Goetz @tgoetz \u201cJust saw a guy take off a smoke mask to have a cigarette.\u201d\n\nTHURSDAY: If you had to bet, what present-day phenomenon are you most sure is a fad? (Your correspondent\u2019s answer: most things matcha.) Submit answers at dtahir@politico.com, or socially at @arthurallen202, @dariustahir, @ravindranize, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_eHealth.\n\nTOO MANY MEASURES?: At the Digital Quality Summit, co-held by the National Committee for Quality Assurance and HL7, attendees were forced to grapple with a potentially unwelcome notion: There are too many measures, and paring back means saying \u201cno\u201d to politically powerful entities.\n\nThe bearer of the message, David Blumenthal \u2014 a former ONC director \u2014 said, \u201cWe need to decide what not to measure.\u201d Blumenthal based his argument not merely on documentation burden, but also the cognitive demands of responding to measurements. Therefore, he said, the health care system would do better to measure fewer things and more carefully, too. The challenge is compounded by the decentralization of the system; reducing measurement requires getting not merely government but private-sector payors on the same page.\n\n\u201cThat is a political challenge \u2014 with a small p. Anyone who\u2019s worked in the political system knows patients with problems, and the clinicians who help them do not like to be shunted aside,\u201d he said. But since \u201cno other country is equipping its physicians with scribes,\u201d he added, it\u2019s a challenge worth solving.\n\nBlumenthal also had bullish arguments about Apple and the other tech companies creating tools for consumers to control their health data. \u201cThe question that all these tech behemoths are going to be asking themselves is: What will people buy? How can we make this data a consumer item? What will they want to know? What will they open their wallets to get?\u201d he asked. It would mean sidestepping traditional medical power centers \u2014 or, as Blumenthal put it, \u201cconsumerization of health data \u2026 through the backdoor.\u201d\n\nCYBER REPORT: A new report today from medical device manufacturers Abbott and security management advisory firm The Chertoff Group finds that physicians and administrators alike feel underprepared on cybersecurity. According to a survey, about 75 percent of physicians and 62 percent of administrators feel underprepared on their security roles \u2014 which include staffing, training and awareness.\n\nThe cybersecurity risks are increasing, due not merely to the rise of digital records but also the digital medical devices sprouting everywhere. That means a need for increased standards, particularly in areas around software updates to medical devices (which last a long time). The report will be a subject of discussion during a panel today at US News\u2019s Healthcare of Tomorrow conference \u2014 which your correspondent will be moderating, if you needed additional incentive to come.\n\nINSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING\n\nHHS LOOKS AT FUNDING \u2018SOCIAL DETERMINANTS\u2019: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is looking into a new care model that could let organizations pay for patients\u2019 social needs, like housing and nutrition, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday.\n\n\u201c[W]hat if we went beyond connections and referrals \u2014 what if we provided solutions for the whole person, including addressing housing, nutrition and other social needs?\u201d Azar said.\n\nCMMI has an early-stage model, named \u201cModel One,\u201d that could allow for a single payment that an accountable care entity can use to invest in a beneficiary\u2019s broad needs such as transportation, CMMI director Adam Boehler said earlier during the event at the Hatch Center for Civility and Solutions.\n\nThe efforts build on the \u201cAccountable Health Communities\u201d model CMMI built last year allowing providers to screen high-needs patients for socioeconomic risks like food insecurity, domestic violence, transportation, housing and utility needs. Those providers then connect beneficiaries with navigators to find relevant social services.\n\n\u2014 First in Morning eHealth \u2014 Verma to talk telehealth at conference: This morning the CMS administrator is scheduled to address a conference hosted by the Alliance for Connected Care, a telemedicine focused lobbying group. Seema Verma plans to mention CMS\u2019s past and future efforts to cover telehealth under Medicare and the role of technology in value-based care, the agency tells us.\n\nFCC\u2019S PAI TO MEET WITH DAN SULLIVAN: Federal Communications Commission leader Ajit Pai is due to have a meeting with Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan today over a dispute regarding subsidies from the agency\u2019s rural health care program fund.

With members of Congress set to go home Dec. 14 (barring unforeseen developments), unconfirmed nominees risk having to start the nomination process all over again. Here\u2019s a rundown of those who are in confirmation limbo (with help from the non-profit Partnership for Public Service):\n\nAssistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (a.k.a. ICE director). The nominee, Ronald Vitiello, goes before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee today at 10 a.m. in Dirksen 342. Vitiello, currently deputy director, has been ICE\u2019s acting director since June. Read prepared remarks by Senate HSGAC Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) here and watch the hearing here.\n\nICE inspector general. Joseph Cuffari was nominated Nov 1, and his nomination was reported to the Senate Wednesday. The post is currently filled by Deputy IG John V. Kelly (not to be confused with the White House chief of staff, whose middle initial is F).\n\nDOL assistant secretary for employment and training. John Pallasch was nominated in April; no confirmation hearing has been set. Molly Conway has been serving as acting assistant secretary for employment and training.\n\nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (a.k.a. OSHA chief). Scott Mugno, a former vice president for safety, sustainability & vehicle maintenance at FedEx Ground, was nominated in Oct. 2017, which was thirteen months ago. He was reported favorably out of committee in January, but not yet voted on by the full Senate. Loren Sweatt, deputy assistant secretary for occupational safety and health, has been acting OSHA chief.\n\nDOL assistant secretary for policy. Bryan Jarrett was nominated in July. His nomination was referred to the Senate HELP committee, but no hearings have been held. Jonathan Berry, principal deputy assistant secretary, has been serving as acting assistant secretary for policy.\n\nDOL wage and hour administrator. Cheryl Marie Stanton was nominated in September 2017, which was fourteen months ago. She was reported favorably out of committee in January, but still awaits a floor vote. Bryan Jarrett has been serving as acting administrator.\n\nAccording to the database tracked by the Partnership for Public Service and The Washington Post, only 50 percent of key DOL positions have been filled so far; at DHS the number is slightly higher, at 65 percent. Take a look at the Post database here.\n\nGOOD MORNING! It\u2019s Nov. 15, and this is Morning Shift, POLITICO's daily tipsheet on employment and immigration policy.

Follow us on Twitter at @RebeccaARainey, @tedhesson, @IanKullgren and @TimothyNoah1.\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE\u2019S MORE: Some key positions in agencies that make employment and immigration policy have occasioned no nomination at all. Here\u2019s a rundown of those (with help, again, from the non-profit Partnership for Public Service):\n\nDHS deputy secretary. When Elaine Duke vacated this position in April, she was not replaced. The undersecretary for management, Claire Grady, has been acting deputy secretary--and may soon be acting secretary if news reports are correct that President Donald Trump is preparing to fire DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nDHS\u2019 chief financial officer. Stacy Marcott, appointed deputy chief financial officer in 2012, has been acting chief financial officer.\n\nAssistant Secretary in the Office of Disability Employment Policy.\n\nDHS undersecretary of the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. This is the person responsible for developing agency policy. The deputy undersecretary, James McCament, has been performing the duties of DHS undersecretary for the office.\n\nUNIONS SUE VA: The National Federation of Federal Employees, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the National Association of Government Employees filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s move to \u201crepudiate\u201c parts of its collective bargaining agreements with employees and reassign more than 400 physicians who work for government unions. (More on that here.) The lawsuit argues that the VA is illegally barring employees from utilizing \u201cofficial\u201d work time where they can weigh grievances. The VA notice was slated to go into effect today and will impact more than 100,000 employees. Read a press release here and the complaint here.\n\nLAWSUIT CLAIMS ICE TARGETED ACTIVISTS: A federal lawsuit filed Wednesday argues that ICE retaliated against Vermont immigration activists who criticized the agency. The lawsuit, brought by the non-profit Migrant Justice, contends the group\u2019s members were subject to \u201csurveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention.\u201d The complaint cites encounters with ICE dating back to the Obama administration. An ICE spokeswoman said last year that it \u201cdoes not target individuals based on political beliefs or activism.\u201d\n\nWages\n\nBERNIE GOES AFTER WALMART: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today will introduce legislation to pressure Walmart to pay employees $15 an hour, the Washington Post\u2019s Jeff Stein reports. The bluntly named Stop Walmart Act \u201cwould bar big corporations from buying their own stock \u2014 a move that rewards shareholders \u2014 unless they pay all employees $15 an hour, provide them seven days of sick leave, and prevent CEO compensation from rising more than 150 times above median employee pay,\u201d Stein writes.\n\n\u201cCritics say Sanders\u2019s bill would constrict the flow of capital by preventing firms from buying back shares from their investors \u2014 money those investors then plow back into to the broader economy. Supporters say the plan would benefit a huge number of underpaid workers as the company\u2019s founders, the Walton family, have seen their wealth balloon dramatically amid a broader increase of wealth inequality in the United States.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 bill is DOA in the Senate, though an identical version by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) may get traction in the Democratic-controlled House. More from the Post here. Tune into a conference call briefing on the legislation at 11 a.m. here.\n\n@realDonaldTrump: \u201cNot seen in many years, America\u2019s steelworkers get a hard-earned raise because of my Administration\u2019s policies to help bring back the U.S. steel industry, which is critical to our National Security.

Our next newsletter will publish on Monday, Nov. 26. Please continue to follow Pro Education issues here.\n\nDEVOS\u2019 TITLE IX RULES IMMINENT: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is set to unveil as soon as this week her proposed rules for schools handling allegations of sexual harassment and assault. DeVos has said her controversial rewrite of the rules \u2014 which she announced after scrapping Obama-era guidance last year \u2014 is aimed at bolstering the rights of accused students.\n\n\u2014 The department is planning to unveil the proposal on Friday, multiple sources told Morning Education \u2014 though the exact timing could change. The proposal was still being reviewed by OMB late Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Democrats are ready to pounce. The rewrite is among the most controversial moves she\u2019s made since taking office and Democrats are sure to target it as they wield their newfound control of the House to call DeVos and her aides to testify on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u2014 A preview of what\u2019s to come: The Title IX rules will be a main topic of discussion in a roundtable that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) is hosting this afternoon with members of Congress, civil rights advocates and student leaders. It\u2019s at 3:30 p.m. in Cannon House Office Building Room 421.\n\n\u2014 DeVos\u2019 proposal is expected to mostly stick with changes included in leaked drafts, which sparked intense pushback from women\u2019s advocacy groups earlier this summer. Those groups argue the new rules will put up roadblocks for victims seeking justice. The leaked draft drew praise from civil liberties and men\u2019s rights groups who say Obama-era rules pushed schools to trample due process.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe are very committed to a rule that will respect all parties,\u201d DeVos told National Review this month. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that institutions have a framework they can rely on, and that all parties can rely on.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The rules are expected to: More narrowly define sexual harassment, let schools use a higher standard of evidence for discipline decisions and allow them to offer mediation to resolve cases. They are also expected to hold schools responsible only for allegations involving misconduct that occurred on campus, among other changes.\n\n\u2014 One major change: The rules are expected to guarantee students have a chance to cross-examine their accusers. The students could be in separate rooms and the questions could be delivered by third parties. It\u2019s a major departure from Obama-era guidelines that discouraged the practice, which survivors\u2019 advocates say is traumatizing.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis rule will return schools back to a time where rape, assault and harassment were swept under the rug,\u201d said Jess Davidson, executive director of End Rape on Campus. \u201cThis rule enables schools to be a safe place to get away with committing sexual violence, rather than a safer place to learn free from violence.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Civil liberties groups have praised DeVos\u2019 efforts. Based on the leaked draft, at least, the new rules \u201care a dramatic improvement over the previous guidance,\u201d said Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. She praised the department for launching a formal rulemaking process and said she believes the rules balance the rights of both victims and accused: \u201cIt\u2019s important that allegations aren\u2019t ignored and aren\u2019t prejudged.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY.

The nonprofit Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence devoted the most energy to unseating the \u201cNotorious Nine\u201d \u2014 incumbent Republican House members who\u2019ve received A or A-plus ratings from the National Rifle Association. Of those nine, seven lost their races, only one came out victorious and another race still hasn\u2019t been called.\n\n\u2014 The gun control movement of 2018 ignited by the Parkland school shooting is taking credit for helping secure these new House seats for Democrats. And with the lower chamber flipping blue, advocates are bullish about passage of a background checks bill, even if it likely will fail in the Senate. While guns weren\u2019t a top issue for most voters, according to exit polls, advocates and experts say they believe the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people led to more gun control supporters in Congress and helped drive more young people to the polls.\n\n\u2014 All eyes on Florida: Advocates and some Parkland survivors and parents who were initially disappointed by Florida on Election Day also have new hope. The governor\u2019s race and the Senate race are embroiled in a recount, leaving open the possibility that Florida might still elect a progressive governor and senator who embrace gun control in a state where the NRA has historically had a strong hold. Caitlin Emma has the story.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION\n\nA LITTLE LAME-DUCK ACTION: The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee are pushing a bipartisan bill to allow the IRS and Education Department to share more student data. It\u2019s a step toward simplifying the application for federal student aid that has long been a goal of Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) \u2014 and one that he and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) hope to get through Congress in the coming weeks, a difficult feat in a lame-duck session.\n\n\u2014 The \u201cco-sponsors hope to pass this legislation before the new Congress,\u201d a HELP committee spokesman told Morning Education. The FAFSA Act, S. 3611 (115), is also co-sponsored by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.).\n\n\u2014 The bill would amend the the Internal Revenue Code, which currently prohibits the IRS from sharing taxpayer data with the Education Department. It would allow the IRS to disclose tax return information to department officials \u201cdetermining eligibility for, and amount of, Federal student financial aid.\" More on that here.\n\nANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CANDIDATES STRUGGLE IN MIDTERMS: Rep. Mimi Walters (R-Calif.) has slowly lost the lead this week in her reelection bid in which she vowed to push for the House to investigate \u201cdiscrimination against Asian-American students at Ivy League and other top universities.\u201d The pitch was on a mailer praising a Justice Department investigation into such allegations at Yale.\n\n\u2014 Walters was one of at least two candidates that attacked affirmative action in a bid to win over Asian-American voters. The other was Corey Stewart, who lost a bid to unseat Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) by 16 points. In California, Walters is still engaged in a tight race that she led by more than 6,000 votes on election night. Walters now trails her Democratic challenger, Katie Porter, by just a couple hundred votes.\n\nSPEAKING OF: The federal judge weighing allegations that Harvard is discriminating against Asian-American applicants approved a schedule for how the arguments will play out going forward. Both Harvard and the group suing it, Students for Fair Admissions, will each submit 75 pages or less making their final arguments in December and they\u2019ll each get a chance to submit written responses in January. Another round of oral arguments are expected in Boston in February.\n\nHBCUS WARM TO DEVOS: Presidents of historically black colleges and universities presented DeVos with a plaque Wednesday, thanking her for her work on a capital financing program that's helped their financially struggling schools \u2014 a shift from the cold shoulder DeVos received at one HBCU in 2017.\n\n\u2014 \"We thanked her and gave her a plaque which we hope she will place prominently in her office, which is an expression of our appreciation,\" said Michael Lomax, the president of the United Negro College Fund \u2014 commonly known as UNCF. UNCF works on behalf of 36 private HBCUs. The meeting in DeVos' office lasted about an hour. It included several presidents whose schools have benefited from the Education Department's work with the HBCU Capital Financing Program.\n\n\u2014 Several of the presidents extended an invitation to DeVos to visit if she's in their communities, Lomax said, adding: \"Those were heartfelt, I think, invitations.\" Kimberly Hefling has the full story.\n\nANALYSIS: SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PLANS NEED IMPROVEMENT: Just 17 states have made enough information publicly available to detail their plans for improving low-performing schools under the Every Student Succeeds Act, a new analysis concludes. The nonprofit Collaborative for Student Success teamed up with HCM Strategists, a public policy and consulting firm, to review how states are approaching school improvement under the law.\n\n\u2014 Less than half of the 17 states reviewed require districts to demonstrate how their proposed strategies for improving low-performing schools \u201cwill address historic inequities \u2014 such as access to high quality teachers, a rigorous curriculum, enrichment opportunities and closing the achievement gap,\u201d the review says.

The new climate plan goes well beyond the Obama-era cap-and-trade climate policy that House Democrats embraced before losing their previous majority in 2010 \u2014 but since then, renewable energy's costs have plummeted while its popularity has risen in key electoral states like Colorado.\n\nWhile she is confident she will prevail, Pelosi faces a thin margin for error and has launched an intense campaign to round up the support she will need, and Democrats are using that vulnerability to attempt to secure concessions on a host of issues.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nClimate activists are urging Ocasio-Cortez and other liberals to consider withholding their support for Pelosi's bid to be speaker without additional concessions.\n\nPelosi's record \"doesn't give us confidence that she is ready to do what it takes in the next two years. ... She wants to reintroduce this select committee on climate change, but basically all she wants it to do, from what we can tell, is convene people to talk about the science,\" said Evan Weber, national political director with the Sunrise Movement, an organizer of protests outside Pelosi's office on Tuesday. \"We\u2019ve been talking about the science for the past few decades.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez is gathering support for a resolution that would establish a select House committee to develop legislation on the Green New Deal, a set of ambitious principles that progressives envision as a work-in-progress Democratic Party platform on climate change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Miami underwater, I don\u2019t want to see my own district underwater, and I know that Leader Pelosi doesn\u2019t, either,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters Tuesday as she joined protesters at the leader's office. \u201cWhat we need to show her is that we\u2019re here to back her up in pushing for 100 percent renewable energy and we\u2019re here to support that kind of bold, progressive leadership.\u201d\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and incoming members Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) have all endorsed the Green New Deal resolution. Other liberals, like Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), have not endorsed the Ocasio-Cortez resolution but backed similarly ambitious legislation like transitioning the U.S. to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. Most have remained coy on whether they'll support Pelosi on the floor.\n\nThe Green New Deal resolution calls for a bevy of far-reaching liberal goals to decarbonize the economy within a decade by reshaping the electric power, agriculture and transportation sector, but it includes few details outlining how to get there. That is likely too ambitious even for many Democrats \u2014 and would stand zero chance of getting past Senate Republicans or President Donald Trump \u2014 but the concept has become an important rallying cry for the need to address climate change.\n\n\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s called the Green New Deal, I think there will be significant pieces of [an infrastructure package] that will touch on climate,\u201d Jayapal told POLITICO. \u201cThere are lots of ideas out there that aren\u2019t called Green New Deal but are addressing similar kinds of issues.\u201d\n\nPelosi created the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming when she was first elected speaker in 2007, but Republicans eliminated the committee when they took the majority in 2011. Now, a growing number of senior Democrats say they don't know whether the panel needs to come back.\n\n\"As co-chairs of the Safe Climate Caucus, we believe that the committees of jurisdiction and future Chairs are ready and able to tackle this challenge,\" Reps. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.) wrote in a letter to Pelosi on Wednesday. \"However, should you decide to create a select committee on climate change in the 116th Congress, we stand ready to work with you.\"\n\nThe letter from Beyer and Lowenthal came a few hours after three Democratic chairmen-in-waiting \u2014 Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), Science ranking member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and Natural Resources ranking member Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) \u2014 announced they would be holding climate change hearings early next year, in an apparent attempt to protect their turf. \"Our committees plan to work closely together to aggressively assess the public health, economic and environmental impacts of climate change and to explore the best solutions to combat this challenge,\" they said in a statement.\n\nGrijalva, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who has said he plans to back Pelosi, said he understood why Ocasio-Cortez and others are pushing leadership to be more aggressive in attacking climate change. \u201cI would agree with some of their criticism. We\u2019re baby-stepping it,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nBut climate change wasn\u2019t a top issue most Democrats campaigned on in a wave election, and the incoming majority is expected instead to focus on health care, infrastructure and conducting oversight on the Trump administration.\n\nRepublicans will likely paint any Democratic plan to address climate change as too expensive, but activists say Democrats should not fear such attacks from a party that has overseen growing deficits and did not pay for its massive tax cut last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in entertaining that question given the full board of what Republicans have funded most recently with the tax cut,\u201d said Vijay Das, a senior campaign strategist with the public policy organization Demos who has been working on the Green New Deal concept. \u201cTo be perfectly blunt, fiscal conservatives don\u2019t have to answer this question when they\u2019re making decisions to embolden the 1 percent.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Republicans won\u2019t make the argument anyway.\n\n\u201cGreen New Deal? Sounds like a lot of red ink,\u201d Sen.

Bill Nelson\u2019s reelection campaign against GOP Gov. Rick Scott. | Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo Florida judge extends deadline for fixing ballots with mismatched signatures\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 A Tallahassee federal court judge has given voters until Saturday to fix ballots that were tossed due to conflicting signatures, extending the deadline for counties to turn in final election results, including machine recounts.\n\nJudge Mark Walker determined Thursday that state law lacks a concrete process for voters to challenge county canvassing boards that decided to reject provisional or vote-by-mail ballots due to signature mismatches.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe ruling is likely to extend the machine recount portion of one of two U.S. Senate contests that remain to be called. The margin in the Florida race is so slim that it is almost certain to proceed to a manual recount after the machine recount concludes.\n\nBut though it could affect thousands of ballots, the ruling would likely not be enough on its own to reverse the 12,562 vote deficit Sen. Bill Nelson faces in his reelection against Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nWalker noted in the ruling he handed down Thursday morning that the law also \u201cinterestingly\u201d allows voters to challenge an acceptable signature match, but not defend one that was rejected.\n\n\u201cThe precise issue in this case is whether Florida\u2019s law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures \u2014 with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection \u2014 passes constitutional muster,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe answer is simple. It does not.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s ruling is the result of a challenge filed last week by Nelson\u2019s reelection campaign against Scott. Nelson\u2019s lawyer asked during a Wednesday hearing for at least a month to alert at least 3,700 voters whose ballots had been rejected. Walker, instead, hinted at a Sunday deadline. Voters now have until Saturday at 5 p.m.\n\nHowever, the ruling might not apply to all of those ballots. Walker narrowly tailored the decision to those \u201cvoters who have been belatedly notified [by election supervisors that] they have submitted a mismatched-signature ballot.\u201d That number is unclear.\n\nWalker stresses in the ruling county elections supervisors should not just count the rejected ballots. The extended deadline is merely an opportunity for voters to come forward with information that would confirm their signature.\n\n\"Let this Court be clear: it is NOT ordering county canvassing boards to count every mismatched vote, sight unseen,\u201d Walker wrote. \"Rather, the county supervisors of elections are directed to allow those voters who should have had an opportunity to cure their ballots in the first place to cure their vote-by-mail and provisional ballots now, before the second official results are fully counted.\u201d\n\nWalker also rejected a motion Scott\u2019s lawyers made to delay the impact of his decision pending the result of the appellate review. Scott\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal this morning shortly after Walker published his decision. Scott has consistently led as the votes have been tallied.\n\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "coprysko@politico.com (Caitlin Oprysko)", "title": "Despite staffing turmoil, Trump promises White House 'running very smoothly'", "description": "The media, Trump said, had overhyped personnel moves.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/staffing-turmoil-trump-white-house-991283", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/ae/a8/2c7b29a54444be9886a25fba60bd/181114-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:28:36Z", "content": "More changes could still be coming for the Trump administration, with President Donald Trump himself hinting for weeks that he would make personnel moves following the midterms. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik President Donald Trump insisted Thursday that despite a \u2026 [+2180 chars]", "fulltext": "More changes could still be coming for the Trump administration, with President Donald Trump himself hinting for weeks that he would make personnel moves following the midterms. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik White House Despite staffing turmoil, Trump promises White House 'running very smoothly'\n\nPresident Donald Trump insisted Thursday that despite a recent flurry of high-level reshuffling inside his administration, with more reportedly on the way, his White House \"is running very smoothly.\"\n\nThe media, Trump said, had overhyped personnel moves, which have included the removal of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and the reassignment of deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good.

His concession came hours after the AP called the race for Kim.\n\n\"Tonight, I called Congressman-Elect Andy Kim to congratulate him on his victory,\u201d MacArthur said in a statement. \u201cEnough provisional ballots have been counted to make the outcome clear.

But he sought to be close to Trump while appearing as a moderate to constituents who perhaps weren\u2019t weren\u2019t following the ins and outs of politics.\n\nTo his constituents, MacArthur portrayed himself as someone able to stand up to the president and work with him as well. But he also fundraised with Trump and had a closed-door event with the with one of the president\u2019s most controversial allies, Rep. Devin Nunez . When he did criticize Trump, even on the most outrageous statements, he broadened out the criticism to include just about everyone else (see Charlottesville ). And, of course, he revived the doomed Obamacare repeal effort and was the only member of the New Jersey House delegation to vote for the new tax law.\n\nBut ultimately, voters\u2019 anti-Trump sentiment swept away both New Jersey Republicans who embraced the president and those who conspicuously sought distance, like Leonard Lance. MacArthur performed far better than Kim in the debates I watched. But it didn\u2019t matter. Because of Trump.\n\nBut this district could easily go back to Republicans. Kim, no doubt, is aware that the last Democrat to hold it \u2013 John Adler \u2014 was defeated after just one term. But as long as Trump is driving Democrats to the polls, Kim has an advantage.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY?

Chris Christie, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, said Wednesday he has not been contacted by the White House about the possibility of being nominated for attorney general. The Republican, who left office in January after hitting a two-term limit, is now an attorney in private practice and a political analyst for ABC News. He has moved toward the front of the line for the attorney general job since Jeff Sessions was pushed out after it became clear several other potential nominees were not interested in the position. POLITICO reported last week that Trump has said privately he believes Christie, the first prominent Republican to back his presidential bid, has patiently waited his turn after being passed over for the job during the post-2016 election transition. Christie played coy when asked if he would accept the nomination if asked. \u201cListen, the only person I owe that answer to is the president of the United States if the question is asked and, if he asks, I\u2019ll answer like I always do,\u201d Christie said.

A private, for-profit business is paid millions each year in taxpayer funds to shoulder a sacred public trust \u2014 the care of children so medically fragile that most can\u2019t even speak up when something goes wrong. Ten of those children have died and 23 others have been sickened at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation since Sept. 26 in one of the nation\u2019s worst-ever outbreaks of adenovirus. The institution at the center of this storm is part of a small chain of nursing homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

In this recent study, the National Reentry Resource Center and the Council of State Governments Justice Center study looked at New Jersey and 10 other states with significant declines in their three-year return-to-prison rates. New Jersey\u2019s rate dropped from a high of 37 percent in 2007 to 29.8 percent in 2013, according to the most current data available. \u2018It\u2019s exciting to see,\u2019 said Roseanne Scotti, state director of the New Jersey Drug Policy Alliance. She cited changes in the state parole system as one reason for the drop in recidivism. The state has increased its offerings of residential and community-based programs for parolees to help them stay on track and make the transition back to life outside prison. There are also programs to help those suffering with substance abuse and mental illness, as well as general rehabilitation.\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201cState awards $6.8M in emergency aid to 13 districts hurt by school funding changes\u201d Read more here\n\n\u2014\u201c2018 New Jersey Globe Power List\u201d Look for your name on the list\n\nTRUMP ERA\n\nTHAT FEALTY TO CHRISTIE REALLY PAID OFF \u2014 \u201cNew Jersey GOP endures worst cycle in US House races in party history,\u201d by SmartPolitics\u2019 Dr. Eric Osterrmeier: \u201cAs discussed in a Smart Politics report two months ago, New Jersey Republicans bottomed out with a century-low election night by recording only a single victory in elections to the U.S. House of Representatives \u2026 If Rep. MacArthur\u2019s loss stands, Republicans will have won only 8.3 percent of house seats on the ballot (1 of 12). Only the 1912 cycle (also 8.3 percent) saw Republicans do as poorly at the ballot box since the party organized in New Jersey over 160 years ago in the mid-1850s. All things considered, however, the 2018 cycle was more devastating for the GOP, which lost only two seats in 1912 and shed four this cycle.

The 6th District lawmaker jumped on the anti-Nancy Pelosi offensive a couple of years ago, and yesterday Pelosi called him out by name.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what Seth Moulton says,\" Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"I\u2019m not the only one saying it,\" Moulton responded on Twitter.\n\nBut he is among the loudest. Ousting members of the party's old guard is part of Moulton's brand. He's an early example of the wave of ambitious politicians who burst onto the scene by challenging incumbents rather than wait their turn to run for office in Massachusetts. He took on nine-term Rep. John Tierney in 2014 and won in a Democratic primary upset, and he's been publicly opposed to Pelosi since the 2016 election. It wasn't always that way , but in November 2016, Moulton signed onto a 63-member letter against Pelosi's leadership. Now he's leading the charge against her.\n\nMoulton floated Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge for the speakership during a CNN appearance on Wednesday night. \"She's a woman of color from the Midwest, she's someone who understands the economic challenges that so many Americans face today,\" Moulton said. \"The American people sent a very clear message a week ago with the election that it's time for a new approach to politics and new leaders, and it's our job in Washington to answer that call.\"\n\nBut some are questioning whether Democrats should just rely on Pelosi's experience at the party's helm when the stakes are so high in Washington under the Trump administration.\n\n\"The more that Republicans see their president getting put to the spurs by the Democrats, the less likely they will be to make a deal. How do you balance the two?\" CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Moulton on Wednesday night.\n\n\"You sound like an RNC chairman, Chris. We're not just gonna take this Republican talking point. We're gonna do both,\" Moulton said.\n\nMuch of the Massachusetts delegation supports Pelosi for Speaker, including rising star Rep. Joe Kennedy III. With 49 days until House Democrats vote for Speaker on Jan. 3, the two questions marks in the Massachusetts delegation are Congresswoman-elect Ayanna Pressley and Congresswoman-elect Lori Trahan. Neither Democrat would say whether they would support Pelosi on the campaign trail, but it's likely they are experiencing Pelosi's wooing efforts during freshman orientation this week.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

The requests for high-dollar contributions come with promises of a \u2018candlelight\u2019 dinner, \u2018VIP access\u2019 to the governor\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019 inaugural celebration, and recognition on \u2018all printed materials\u2019 for the planned events, according to documents obtained by the Globe .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cHealey Mum On Laity Call For Renewed Church Investigation,\u201d by Mike Deehan, WGBH News: \u201cAttorney General Maura Healey has failed to respond \u2014 at least to date \u2014 to a call from Catholic advocacy groups that her office investigate the personnel records of all Massachusetts archdioceses in order to ensure that there is no evidence of accused abusive priests being shuttled between or among parishes.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio held earlier this week to announce/celebrate their deal with Amazon for a new headquarters in Long Island City might have been premature \u2014 it can\u2019t go forward without the approval of an obscure, three-person board with a history of scuttling major development projects.\n\nAs Dana Rubinstein reports , the plan \u201cis not a done deal \u2014 not yet, anyway.\u201d\n\nDana writes: \"Key elements of the Amazon plan require the approval of state legislative leaders via an obscure entity called the Public Authorities Control Board, the state's economic development arm confirmed Wednesday morning. The state Senate and Assembly majorities each have a vote on the board, and so does the governor. Unanimity is required. It's not clear when the board might vote on the two elements that the state\u2019s economic development arm \u2014 Empire State Development \u2014 says need the board\u2019s approval: the state's offer of up to $505 million in grants to Amazon, as well as the 'general project plan' that will result from the state\u2019s land use review process. If the vote happens after Democrats assume control of the Senate majority in January, the process will be 'fascinating,' said Reinvent Albany Executive Director John Kaehny.\n\nThat\u2019s because one of the most powerful Democrats poised to join the majority is state Sen. Michael Gianaris, who represents Long Island City and has emerged as one of the deal\u2019s staunchest critics. Gianaris did not respond to a request for comment. But at a rally against the plan on Wednesday, he said, 'We will go to court if we have to, we will take legislative action if we have to.'\n\nWhether Gianaris actually wants to kill the deal or merely exact more concessions from Amazon remains to be seen. Where the larger Democratic conference stands is also an open question. Should the Public Authorities Control Board in some way stymie the project, it would not be the first time. In 2005, the board killed then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg's bid for a $2 billion stadium on Manhattan's West Side, a key part of his effort to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York City.\"\n\nOh and that\u2019s not all: Our Rosa Goldensohn reports that City Council speaker Corey Johnson is reviewing what, if any, legal recourse the City Council might have to delay or stop Amazon\u2019s plan.\n\nCuomo\u2019s end run around the Council makes sense in a certain light \u2014 he doesn\u2019t need the legislative body for anything, and it\u2019s more convenient to avoid the cumbersome city planning process. But this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen de Blasio roll out a big plan without bringing in major players with a stake in the outcome \u2014 incurring resentment from the allies whose support he\u2019s taken for granted. There\u2019s a chance the secretive tack both leaders took in brokering this deal could backfire in a major way.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY. It might snow in the city today, and we are ready for it.

The case involved Susai Francis, an Indian national living on Long Island who overstayed a visa in the 1990s. After an arrest in Nassau County in June, 2017, for driving under the influence, he was transferred to Suffolk County to complete a different proceeding there involving a criminal charge. In December, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentence to time served. But instead of letting him leave court, Suffolk police rearrested him at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was taken to a jail cell in Riverhead rented by ICE. On Wednesday, a three-judge appellate court panel found this violated state law because the Suffolk police went beyond their authority. ICE detainers ask police to hold someone already in custody for 48 hours, to facilitate a transfer. By putting Francis back in jail, the court found Suffolk went too far. The ruling said, \u201clocal law enforcement officers are not authorized to effectuate arrests for civil law immigration violations.\u201d The court found they could, however, if ICE showed them a warrant signed by a judge.\u201d WNYC\u2019s Beth Fertig\n\nPOINT: \u201cSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office is exploring whether longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone tried to intimidate and discredit a witness who is contradicting Mr. Stone\u2019s version of events about his contacts with WikiLeaks, according to people who have spoken to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators.

Judge William Pauley refused to approve an agreement Mayor Bill de Blasio signed more than five months ago with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan that would have committed the city to spend at least $1.2 billion more on the housing authority under the auspices of an outside monitor. In ordering the parties to come up with a new plan by Dec. 14, Pauley unleashed a deeply unflattering critique of NYCHA, following a federal complaint in June that concluded residents were repeatedly put in dangerous and unhealthy living conditions. (Pauley said the complaint was \"understated.\")\"Somewhat reminiscent of the biblical plagues of Egypt, these conditions include toxic lead paint, asthma-inducing mold, lack of heat, frequent elevator outages, and vermin infestations,\" Pauley wrote in his 52-page ruling . Pauley said the agreement \u2014 which allowed de Blasio to avoid a trial for the housing authority \u2014 lacked clear lines of enforcement and predicted it would create more confusion between the parties.

For more than ten months, she sought to be transferred to another building without success. In a personal note postmarked October 22, 2018, the tenant informed this Court that NYCHA moved her to a new apartment. While this Court commends NYCHA for acting expediently after the hearing, it should not take a public admonishment from a federal judge to spur NYCHA to perform an act of basic human decency.\u201d\n\nAN EIGHTH TAXI DRIVER COMMITS SUICIDE: On Wednesday, the New York City Council passed a raft of legislation designed to help struggling taxi drivers in the age of Uber, even as news emerged that another taxi driver had ended his own life. \u201cWe have suffered yet another devastating loss with the suicide of taxi owner/driver Roy Kim ,\u201d Taxi and Limousine Commission Chair Meera Joshi said in a statement. \"This tragedy underscores the importance of finding new ways for government, the industry and lenders to work in unity to address the financial challenges that are weighing so heavily on our licensees.\" Kim appears to be the eighth taxi or livery driver to take his own life since the arrival of companies like Uber have depressed taxi medallion values. The City Council and the de Blasio administration have been forced into a reactive role. Together, they imposed a year-long pause on new for-hire vehicle licenses likes those deployed by Uber drivers and on Wednesday, the Council passed several bills designed to improve the lives of drivers. The de Blasio administration supports them all. One bill would establish a task force to study taxicab medallion values and recommend ways to bolster them.

On paper, a new Democratic majority in the state Senate should be a relief for de Blasio, whom Senate Republicans and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have forced to return to Albany year after year to hold onto control of the country\u2019s largest school system. \u201cSenate Republicans have made a sport out of torturing the mayor for their own amusement and political ends; we are obviously not looking to do that,\u201d said Queens Sen. Michael Gianaris, now the number two Democrat in the state Senate. \u201cI expect a robust discussion about mayoral control issues.\u201d But some of the mayor\u2019s more controversial positions \u2014 specifically, admissions reform at the city\u2019s specialized high schools \u2014 may give fellow Democrats pause in supporting a loosening of de Blasio's leash. [POLITICO\u2019s Anna Gronewold and Madina Toure]\n\nSENATE HEALTH SET FOR MAJOR SHAKEUP \u2014 The Democratic takeover of the state Senate next year will bring profound change to the state Capitol, but perhaps the most dramatic transformation will take place in the makeup of the Senate's health committee.Not only will Democrats lead the Senate for the first time in a decade and just the second in more than half a century, but new faces will replace at least five of the committee's 17 members. [POLITICO\u2019s Nick Niedzwiadek]\n\nGOP LEADERSHIP SQUABBLES \u2014 \u201cFor the second time in three and half years Republican Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan finds himself in a leadership fight. The first in 2015 between him and John DeFrancisco ended with a Flanagan victory to lead what was then the majority chamber. He did so partially on a promise to unite upstate and downstate Republicans, but he also got a boost from Governor Cuomo. 2015 was the peak of the good years between the Democratic Governor and the Republican controlled upper house. My, how times have changed. Today Flanagan is facing a new challenge, this time from Senator Cathy Young of Olean, who also has the backing of some strong Republican donors including the Real Estate Board, or REBNY. The environment is very different for this fight, of course, with Republicans heading into the January legislative session with devastating losses, particularly on Flanagan\u2019s home turf of Long island. As one Republican put it recently, \u201cThe Long Island 3 doesn\u2019t quite have the same ring to it as The Long island 9\u201d ( Republicans once controlled as many as 9 seats on the island, now it\u2019s down to 3 ).\u201d [NY1\u2019s Zack Fink]\n\n\u2014 Sen. Fred Akshar, who many in the party see as a rising star, is explicitly backing Flanagan. Other upstate members have pushed for his ouster and thrown support to Young.

But a Collins spokesman said McMurray \u2018struggles with basic math\u2019 and predicted the congressman\u2019s 1 percentage point lead will hold once results from Erie County are tabulated next week. Both campaigns now continue the back and forth jabs that marked their bitter contest, which was thought to have ended late on election night when McMurray appeared to concede defeat. But later that night he said he would continue his candidacy until all absentee and other outstanding ballots are officially counted. That process is expected to end on Nov. 20 when results from Erie County are finalized.\u201d [Buffalo News\u2019 Bob McCarthy and Jerry Zremski]\n\n\u2014 McMurray is complaining that he was blocked from attending freshman Congressional events by GOP officials.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile the race between incumbent Rep.

The nominee is decided behind closed doors in a secret ballot vote, and requires only a simple majority of members to clinch.

Pulling out a copy of the Constitution, Perlmutter argued that such rules go against founding principles of the nation.\n\n\u201cBut Rep.-elect Katie Hill of California challenged Perlmutter on why the rule needs to be changed, since it's not enforced anyway.

The two are instead being accused of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s forced return in an operation the Saudis allege went awry.\n\nIn a press conference later Thursday, Sheikh Shalan al-Shalan, spokesman and deputy attorney-general, said the Oct. 2 killing was ordered by one man: the individual responsible for the negotiating team sent to forcibly bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe did not disclose that individual\u2019s name, but said he was part of a 15-man team sent to Turkey comprised of three groups: negotiators, intelligence and logistics.\n\nHe said that on the morning of the killing, the leader of the negotiating team saw that he would not be able to force Khashoggi to return \u201cso he decided to kill him in the moment.\u201d\n\nThis appears to contradict a previous Saudi statement quoting Turkish intelligence saying the killing had been premeditated.\n\nAl-Shalan said that Khashoggi\u2019s killers had set in motion plans for the operation on Sept. 29 -- three days before his slaying in Istanbul. He says the killers drugged and killed the writer inside the consulate, before dismembering the body and handing it over for disposal by an unidentified local collaborator. The body has never been found.\n\nThe brutal death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who had been critical of the crown prince, has sent shock waves around the world and led analysts and officials to believe a sensitive operation of this magnitude could not have been carried out without the prince\u2019s knowledge.\n\nThe latest Saudi account of what took place failed to appease officials in Turkey, who insist the killing and its cover-up were carried out by the highest levels of government.\n\n\u201cWe did not find some of his explanations to be satisfactory,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said after the Saudi announcement.\n\n\u201cThose who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way,\u201d he added.\n\nThrough a series of orchestrated leaks, including audio of the killing shared with Western intelligence, Turkey has attempted to keep pressure on the crown prince, who sees Turkey as a regional rival.\n\nTurkey alleges that among those sent to Istanbul was a forensics expert.\n\nIn an apparent reference this specialist, al-Shalan said the organizer of the operation -- who was not named -- called on a specialist to be part of the team to erase evidence if Khashoggi needed to be forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia. Prosecutors said this specialist was working without the direct knowledge of his boss.\n\nSaudi Arabia said 21 people are now in custody, with 11 indicted and referred to trial. The Turkish government is demanding the suspects be investigated and put on trial in Turkey.\n\nAmong the high-level officials incriminated in connection with the killing is former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, who was fired in the immediate aftermath of the killing.\n\nAl-Assiri, believed to have been a close confidant of Prince Mohammed, and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani are accused of planning and ordering Khashoggi\u2019s forced return to Saudi Arabia. Prosecutors say the men formed a 15-man Saudi team to carry out the operation.\n\nSaudi prosecutors said the men deemed Khashoggi a threat because of his work as a writer and because he was allegedly backed by groups and countries that are hostile to Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, Saudi prosecutors stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering the killing itself -- further distancing the killers from the crown prince\u2019s inner circle and bolstering Saudi assertions that the killing was carried out by rogue agents who exceeded their authority. Both men were fired from their posts last month amid fallout from the killing.\n\nKhashoggi had been living in self-imposed exile abroad for nearly a year before he was killed by Saudi agents at the consulate on Oct. 2. In his writing, he was especially critical of the crown prince, who\u2019d been leading a wide-reaching crackdown on activists and critics inside the kingdom since last year.\n\nKhashoggi had gone to the consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. His Turkish fiancee waited outside and first raised the alarm about his disappearance.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Saudi Arabia\n\nJamal Khashoggi"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "webin@politico.com (POLITICO Staff)", "title": "\u2018We\u2019re Here and We Want to Contribute\u2019", "description": "It\u2019s a tough time to be a new arrival in the U.S. But in Texas, a group of millennials is trying to change that.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/15/what-works-next-austin-texas-apple-news-222545", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/eb/8d/832433a442bbbda3dc9e9c57c16e/mag-wwn-swipe-629.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:23:30Z", "content": "POLITICO Magazines What Works Next series explores the ways millennials, Americas largest generation, are transforming the cities where they live.

The nonprofit, originally founded in Chicago in 2011, is run exclusively by millennial women for high school girls, a vulnerable and overlooked segment of the United States\u2019 nearly 2 million-strong refugee population.\n\nRefugees have been getting a lot of attention from the current administration, most of it negative. But in Texas, which has the highest number of refugees in the country next to California (more than 20,000 have settled here since 2015 alone) helping resettled families is a priority. Nonprofits like GirlForward fill a critical role in helping mainstream the families and ensuring they become integrated quickly into the economic and social fabric of their new communities. GirlForward, in that sense, satisfies both liberal and conservative instincts: It\u2019s welcoming to newcomers, yet also insists that they become self-sufficient. And it doesn\u2019t take a dime of government funding. According to a study by Stockton University economics professor Ramya M. Vijaya, it takes the average American refugee seven years to become self-supporting. If GirlForward can expedite that process, that\u2019s an outcome that would please Americans on all sides of the political debate.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/1508/1155968404_5967047923001_5967039738001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true How GirlForward is providing a support community for refugee youth.\n\nGirlForward is predicated on the notion that refugee girls face particular hardships due not only to the tumultuous circumstances of their upbringing and relocation but also their gender. \u201cOftentimes, our girls haven\u2019t been able to pursue education in the same way their brothers have,\u201d Shannon Elder, 24, GirlForward\u2019s Austin development manager, observes. \u201cIn countries of conflict, girls\u2019 access to education can be much more limited than it is for boys,\u201d said Arielle Levin, who runs the mentorship program. GirlForward recruits refugees through Austin nonprofits, schools, and word of mouth. It tries specifically to recruit the oldest daughter in a family, reasoning that they are usually shouldered with the heaviest burdens. \u201cA lot of my family don\u2019t speak English,\u201d said Storai Rana, an 18-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, \u201cso there was so many responsibilities of things I had to do. Like I had go to the bank, to the market,\u201d she said.\n\nGirlForward defines its mission as more than imparting tangible skills\u2014such as speaking English, opening a checking account, or taking out a library book. The program wants to help the girls live full and rich lives as well. On that score, GirlForward appears to be working: \u201cIn Afghanistan I felt like I was in a box, and I couldn\u2019t fly anywhere.\u201d Fatima Mirzakhail, an 18-year-old refugee, told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three women who run the Austin branch of GirlForward: Shannon Elder, Arielle Levin and Elie Wu. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nFatima says that when she first came to the United States three years ago she was initially optimistic\u2014happy to get out of a country that has been a war-zone her entire life. But that hopefulness quickly turned to despondency, as she realized she couldn\u2019t understand what was happening around her. \u201cI was crying all the time, hating myself,\u201d she said. GirlForward and its focus on English education helped change that\u2014and now she\u2019s blossoming, planning on attending a local community college next year before transferring to UT.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve helped me to find real ways to open closed doors for me.

Brettschneider, a native of the Detroit suburbs, attended the University of Miami, where she studied journalism. She graduated in December 2009 just as the economy was collapsing. With the possible exception of home construction few industries were shedding jobs faster than journalism.\n\nSo instead of pursuing her long-held dream of a career as a reporter\u2014\u201cI always wanted to be a journalist,\u201d she says\u2014Brettschneider, now 29, took a job with AmericaCorps VISTA, the Great Society-era national service program that funds jobs that fight poverty. Her new gig took her to Chicago, where she landed a job as an office gofer at a refugee resettlement agency.\n\nIn between making photocopies and running for coffee, Brettschneider decided she \u201cwanted to learn more about the families\u201d the agency served, she recalls. She struck up a relationship with Domi, a teenage refugee from Burundi, and began tutoring her. She even started visiting her home and quickly realized how overwhelmed Domi was. \u201cI was trying to help her with her math homework while she also cooked dinner and took care of her siblings,\u201d Brettschneider says. \u201cThere was no support for her.\u201d\n\nTop: Fatima and her mentor, Wajiha, meet up weekly to catch up. Bottom: In the middle photo, Blair Brettschneider, the founder of GirlForward is flanked by her Austin staff. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nBrettschneider had no doubt Domi\u2019s gender made life especially tough for her. At the same time, she noticed the refugee resettlement agency\u2019s after-school program only seemed to draw boys. This suggested that girls\u2014often tasked with not only making it at school but making things work at home\u2014needed their own network of support. So, in the spring of 2011, she decided to found GirlForward.\n\nThe \u201cinitial seed funding came from my grandparents. It was a $2,000 check that I deposited into a new bank account for GirlForward,\u201d she said. She spent much of the rest of that spring and summer setting up online crowd-funding campaigns and writing grant proposals. Because at first GirlForward didn\u2019t require physical space, it was fairly cheap to launch: The group mostly needed things like office supplies.\n\nGirlForward grew rapidly from 2012, especially as the Syrian civil war raged and produced a refugee exodus. Some 15,000 refugees have been settled in Illinois since 2012, the lion\u2019s share in Chicagoland. The Syrian conflict and attendant political debate kept refugee issues at the top of the news, and foundation dollars flowed. Today, GirlForward gets about half of its funding from foundations such as the Chicago-based Springboard Foundation. The balance comes from individual donors.\n\nChicago, of course, wasn\u2019t the only city seeing an influx in refugees during that period. Around 2015, Brettschneider started \u201cthinking about where we should go next.\u201d Texas seemed like a good possibility, despite having a governor, Greg Abbott, who had opposed their resettlement in his state.\n\nThe North Austin Muslim Community Center sometimes serves as a community space for Afghan refugees. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nAustin was particularly attractive to Brettschneider. Not only did it have a liberal political culture and large student population\u2014useful for recruiting tutors\u2014but it also \u201chad similar refugee numbers as Chicago,\u201d Brettschneider says. Given that Chicago\u2019s population is three times that of Austin, that means that the per capita number of refugees in Texas\u2019s capital is very large indeed.\n\nGirlForward launched an Austin pilot program in 2015 and the results were stellar. Interest from local refugee communities was intense, and in many ways, it was actually easier to operate in Austin than Chicago, Brettschneider found. For one, the school system was \u201cactually functioning,\u201d she notes, which made it easy to use school facilities to host events. Other local nonprofits were also extremely welcoming, she says. Today, Brettschneider goes to Austin a couple of times a year, but the operation, run by three staffers, is now largely self-sustaining, at least operationally, if not financially. GirlForward had annual expenses of about $300,000 in 2016, and only about 250 of the group\u2019s donors are in Austin, versus 600 in Chicago. The staff is uniformly young: Only one woman on GirlForward\u2019s nine-strong staff has hit 30.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe centerpiece of GirlForward\u2019s operations in both Chicago and Austin has always been its mentorship program, which pairs refugee girls with successful women in their communities. Mentorship is not for flakes: Not only do the mentors work on a volunteer basis, but the time commitment is serious. \u201cThey dedicate two hours a week for at least an entire year,\u201d explained Levin, who runs the program in Austin. The mentorship program is home-based, too, rather than run out of the Austin headquarters. That way, she said, the mentors \u201cbuild relationships with not only their mentee but with their mentee\u2019s\n\n\n\nOn Thursday nights, college students tutor the girls and help them with their homework. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nfamily, and with their mentee\u2019s friends and community.\u201d\n\nThe mentorships are highly structured, though they leave room for improvisation. The rigor begins with the selection and matching process. GirlForward requires all mentors to have college degrees. Last year, some 70 women applied to be mentors in Austin\u2014though only 45 girls are in the program in total. The hiring process is tough: \u201cThe process began with a comprehensive written application consisting of questions about each applicant\u2019s personal history, professional accomplishments, [and] volunteer experience,\u201d recalled Deepina Kapila, a product manager at Visa and GirlForward mentor.\n\nOnce a mentor is selected, the matching process is a bit like the mad scramble for medical school residency: GirlForward tries to make matches based on both what would be a good fit for the mentor, and for the mentee. A Muslim mentor might be placed with a Muslim mentee, for instance. (A majority of girls in the Austin program are Muslim; a plurality come from Afghanistan.)\n\nThe mentorship program, which coincides with the academic year, begins every September, and has a mandated curriculum. One part is activity-based, dubbed the \u201cfour Ws\u201d for wisdom, wellness, wallet and world. A \u201cwallet\u201d activity, for example, might be teaching a mentee how to open a bank account. There\u2019s also a goal-setting component. \u201cMentors and mentees are setting goals, and the mentors are holding them accountable for achieving their goals,\u201d Levin said. Once mentorship starts, GirlForward keeps a close eye on the relationships, making sure that the curriculum benchmarks are hit. Girls are eligible\n\nAustin is a young, vibrant and growing city. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nto stay in the program for a year after they graduate from high school.\n\nKimya Kavehkar, 28 and a native Austinite, has been a GirlForward mentor for three years\u2014the entire time with the same mentee. Kavehkar, a magazine editor, had never worked with refugees before she heard a public service announcement on the radio appealing for volunteers. Her parents are immigrants from Iran, and she felt moved to apply.\n\nKavehkar was paired with an ethnic Afghan girl who had been living in Iran before coming to Texas. They quickly bonded over a shared love of volleyball. And in the ensuing three years they\u2019ve done just about everything together: from school work to SAT prep to learning how to navigate Austin\u2019s byzantine bus system.\n\nMore than simply teaching lessons to her mentee, Kavehkar has found that she also educate her by example. She \u201ccan provide an example that going to college is something she can do,\u201d for instance. After all, many refugees \u201cdon\u2019t have any women in their lives who go to college or work professionally,\u201d she said. Kavehkar added that, despite a lifetime of hardship, her mentee is fundamentally still just a teenage girl. \u201cShe cares about friends and classes and boys,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\n\nGirlForward moved into their new office space only a couple of months ago. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nwants to dye her hair a crazy color and paint her nails.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a similar story for Kapila. A native of India who spent her formative years in Curacao before moving to Austin in 2001, Kapila, 35, said of her mentee, a 17-year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo, \u201cShe\u2019s truly like a little sister to me. We do everything you can think of\u2014go out to eat, trying new restaurants together\u2014we both love spicy food. We take dance classes together, visit the Austin public library and the various hike and bike trails Austin offers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all fun and games though: \u201cWe\u2019ve also got several college application essay editing sessions in our immediate future,\u201d Kapila noted.\n\nIf there is one overriding long-term objective for the girls in the program, it\u2019s to get into college, which ensures they can chart their own path rather than remain at home, serving their families until they marry. And while the Austin program is still in its infancy, the Chicago branch of GirlForward can point to genuine successes. Take Amina Imran, a Pakistani refugee who completed the program in 2017. She used to joke that the only way she would ever be able to go to college would be if she robbed a bank. But today, she attends North Park University on a full scholarship.\n\nGirlForward\u2019s education program, launched shortly after the mentorships got off the ground, is the centerpiece of that plan. \u201cThe education program has three sub-programs,\u201d explains Elie Wu, 25, a Houston native and UT graduate who runs the Austin location\u2019s education efforts. One is tutoring, which coincides with the academic year and covers all manner of academic subjects. The other is summer camp, a six-week program held at a local school where girls learn English and other skills. And the third, still in development, is a support system that will follow girls once they enter college or vocational school. GirlForward also has a \u201csafe spaces\u201d program where the girls participate in workshops on feminist and social justice themes.\n\nTutoring takes place Tuesday and Thursday evenings at the Austin house. The girls usually stream in around 5:30. Some travel up to 90 minutes each way to get here. The program is only open to residents of the city of Austin, so refugee girls from even further flung suburbs\n\nRefugee Services of Texas helps resettle refugees in Austin. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nlike Round Rock, north of town, aren\u2019t eligible.\n\nTutors, like mentors, work for free. And like the mentors, too, they tend to be motivated by a sense of justice in their pursuit. They don\u2019t just want to teach, they want to teach refugees. Maddy Hitchcock, a 20-year-old San Antonio native and UT junior who tutors English told me she always wanted to work at a \u201crefugee-serving non-profit.\u201d\n\nUnlike the mentors, the tutors don\u2019t have to be female. Sahib Chandnani, a 20-year-old junior at UT majoring in computer science and liberal arts with a side interest in creative writing and slam poetry. Chandnani, from Houston, tutors primarily in math, though he dabbles in English and even Spanish as well. Chandnani had tutored before he applied to work at GirlForward, mostly at local schools. GirlForward, which he learned about from a friend at UT, represented a new challenge for him. Not only might his students be struggling in math\u2014they may lack basic English comprehension too. He initially found that prospect \u201cunsettling,\u201d he said. But over the more than a year he has been tutoring, his concerns have eased.\n\n\u201cNumbers are relatively universal,\u201d Chandnani said. \u201cSo, most of the time, if I can\u2019t explain a concept, I can draw it out for them. I can show them the steps.\u201d\n\nHumza Jamal is the only other male tutor at the Austin operation. Jamal, 21, a first-generation American whose parents come from Pakistan and who is studying petroleum engineering at UT, said the gender difference has provided some challenges. \u201cA lot of the girls are shy to a certain extent. \u2026 You just need to get around that. It\u2019s a challenge, but it\u2019s totally worth it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Pictures for POLITICO Magazine\n\n***\n\nGirlForward has no immediate plans to expand into any additional cities, but rather wants to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its current programs, said Brettschneider, the founder. For instance, it\u2019s developing a leadership council in Austin and Chicago, a board that refugee girls will sit on and help guide the organization.\n\nRefugee arrivals have plummeted in the last two years\u2014Caritas of Austin, which has helped settle refugees in the area for 44 years is actually shuttering at the end of 2018, citing declining resettlement numbers\u2014which means that GirlForward will work to strengthen and expand the programs for the girls who are already here. In a sense, the decline in refugee admittance, while lamentable in some respects, provides breathing room to GirlForward, as it can focus more on the girls who are already here.\n\nPerhaps GirlForward\u2019s greatest achievement is encouraging its refugees to have dreams that may seem ordinary to an average American middle-class girl but that are extraordinary given what the girls have overcome.\n\nGirlForward \u201chelped me a lot because I used to be really quiet and shy all the time,\u201d said Zarmina Mirzakhail, the 13-year-old younger sister of Fatima. \u201cI feel really powerful now. I go for everything.\u201d\n\nEthan Epstein is associate editor of The Weekly Standard."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nkorecki@politico.com (Natasha Korecki)", "title": "The Best Campaign Money Can Buy", "description": "J.B.

Pritzker and Gov. Bruce Rauner squared off at a local television studio in the highest-profile debate of the race.\n\nA few blocks away, a full-force messaging machine was lying in wait.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInside Pritzker\u2019s spacious campaign headquarters in downtown Chicago, 14 people crowded around a long conference room table, hanging on every word coming off the live TV event, waiting to pounce.\n\n\u201cPensions!\u201d Galia Slayen, the Pritzker communications director and the night\u2019s traffic cop, called out. \u201cGo!\u201d\n\nWith that, the machine whirred into action. One staffer pushed out an email with pension talking points to reporters across the state. Twitter accounts for Pritzker and staffers activated, drawing from a cache of 700 statements prewritten for social media, all printed across an Excel spreadsheet, each prepared for pushback against Rauner, or teasing out a Pritzker policy platform.\n\nPritzker\u2019s digital team was on hand, awaiting a Pritzker zinger or a Rauner flounder that could be posted as a breaking GIF. A separate staffer was tasked solely with tracking and compiling reporters\u2019 debate chatter over social media and emailing it to the communications team. As the debate wound down, the race to transcribe was on. Ten staffers, starting at staggered points in the recording, pounded away at their keyboards as one person edited. Within about 30 minutes of the event\u2019s conclusion, the campaign had produced its own edited transcript.\n\nBy night\u2019s end, some 35 people had a hand in churning out pro-Pritzker messaging; an operation far more expansive than any single newsroom in the Chicago metro area, if not the Midwest.\n\nThe debate blitz offers just a glimpse into the sophistication and exorbitance behind the record-spending, platinum-plated operation put together by Pritzker, who, after last week\u2019s 15-point rout over Rauner, became the country\u2019s wealthiest elected official, overtaking President Donald Trump, according to Forbes. POLITICO had an exclusive inside look at the Pritzker campaign, spending more than 30 hours shadowing operations, interviewing staff or traveling with the candidate himself.\n\nThe result was one of the most robust operations of any statewide campaign in U.S. history, with spending expected to surpass $250 million, rivaling only the $280 million spent in the 2010 California governor\u2019s race. All told, Pritzker\u2019s juggernaut had more than 200 employees, 33 field offices, wall-to-wall TV ads and a massive investment in digital advertising resulting in innovations that are likely to serve as a model for 2020.\n\n\u201cThis was on an unprecedented level. They applied science and innovation to it at every level and remained committed to it,\u201d said Doug House, a Democrat who has been involved in Illinois political campaigns for more than 30 years. \u201cThey looked at the entire state and mapped out an idea of the universe of people they wanted to engage and stayed involved in that in every level of innovation that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nHeaps of money also meant Pritzker could withstand a series of blows, from the devastating publication of FBI recordings between himself and imprisoned ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich to a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by former staffers three weeks before the election.\n\nThe contest between Pritzker, who is reportedly worth an estimated $3.2 billion, and Rauner, a near-billionaire who had stockpiled $70 million in campaign funds in anticipation of a stiff challenge, was always destined to break spending records. Divided out over 18 months, Pritzker spent roughly $313,000 each day of the campaign\u2014five times the median Illinois household income of $60,000. The total $171.5 million was more than any other candidate had spent to self-finance in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cThe Pritzker funding allowed Democrats to do everything on your campaign wish list from beginning to end: the voter ID, the digital, the television, the paid staffers. And we just got creamed on every level on money,\u201d said Pat Brady, who helped in Rauner\u2019s reelection campaign and served as former chairman of the state Republican Party. \u201cThe digital was unbelievable, it popped up everywhere. It\u2019s unusual in that no one has had unlimited money like that. When you sit down with a consultant and they talk about what they want to do, and we say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got to prioritize, let\u2019s do A, B, C and D.\u2019 They got to do A through Z.\u201d\n\nOn a trip to southern Illinois in mid-October, Pritzker pointed out that a candidate who\u2019s best known for having gobs of cash is not exactly endearing to voters.\n\n\u201cIf this was all plotted out, this would not be the year to run, right?\u201d Pritzker told me while we rode to a series of events. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a wealthy, crazy businessman as president. You\u2019ve got a wealthy, failed businessman as governor. Here comes another wealthy businessman. So you could make the argument that this is not the year to run.\u201d\n\nThe immediate obstacle was battling against an automatic voter perception that he was just another out-of-touch billionaire.\n\n\u201cThey caricature me and throw it up on a wall\u2014just a guy who comes from a wealthy family and comes from Chicago,\u201d Pritzker says. \u201cI think we all came to the conclusion that the best thing I can do is to make sure that I\u2019m present. This is not going to be a television race. Obviously, I ran ads, but I\u2019m not going to win this by being on TV. I\u2019m going to win this because people will meet me.\u201d\n\nPritzker said he had personally met or at least been in front of 200,000 people at hundreds of events, with a heavy emphasis on central and downstate Illinois.\n\nWhat else could make him relatable? Enter one of the most sophisticated digital operations in the country.\n\nDIGITAL PRICE TAG: $30 MILLION\n\nPritzker\u2019s digital director, Megan Clasen, who was part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign team, tested a new way to write ads showing a personal side to Pritzker, making him the first Democratic candidate to use it as an online paid persuasion tactic.\n\nSome of the spots, which aimed to bring out the lighter side of the candidate, had no campaign message at all. In one, Pritzker, his driver and a photographer talk to the camera individually about one another\u2019s car-riding habits. In another, a camera tracks Pritzker from a parking lot to a meeting and he talks about having just left a parent-teacher conference for his son, the last concert he\u2019s seen and his favorite sports team.\n\nPatrick Bonsignore, vice president with Pier 91 Media, who did digital media planning and buying for Pritzker, said Pritzker\u2019s operation was unique in that it made it a business practice to cut platform-specific digital ads, keeping in mind how content is consumed on each.\n\nSubtitles are a must for a mobile-friendly, Facebook ad, for example, since most users would see it without the sound on. In some cases, Pritzker\u2019s camp ran the same ad in six different ways to account for the nuances of six different platforms. This ad attempts to capture the breadth of Pritzker\u2019s retail stops in photos. This 30-second ad about Pritzker\u2019s support for a school lunch program ran on Hulu, CNN and MSNBC, but this animated GIF was the suitable Instagram version.\n\nNot only do users actually watch the content, there\u2019s some evidence it\u2019s persuading voters, Clasen says.\n\n\u201cWe can test them and see how they impact traits\u2014likability,\u201d Clasen said. \u201cWe found through our testing that these ads are actually helpful to us and they do impact voter decision-making.\u201d\n\nOf all the marquee races in the 2018 cycle, only two other campaigns spent more than Pritzker on Facebook advertising: Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign in Texas, and Trump'S in support of Republican candidates.\n\nUnlike the others, Pritzker\u2019s self-funded campaign didn\u2019t use Facebook for fundraising. The entirety of the $30 million spent on digital went toward persuading voters, getting out the vote and building out an email list of more than 400,000 and a list of 80,000 textable numbers.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a big transition of people communicating through text message,\u201d said Clasen.\n\nBonsignore said campaigns typically don\u2019t even have a digital team in-house. Pritzker had a team of 10 people, carved into different specializations, including staffers who could quickly create and post shareable graphics or GIFs.\n\nOn the digital side, speed is sometimes of the essence, Bonsignore said.\n\n\u201cThe way the internet blows up when things happen, think about any recent moment that is reacted to. The speed or the digestive systems of digital is generally fast. So when something occurs, the ability to have a digital video stood up, or a microsite stood up, or a graphic stood up, that\u2019s an important and unique thing,\u201d Bonsignore said. \u201cThat\u2019s only something you see on a presidential scale and not on a statewide.\u201d\n\nTV AD PRICE TAG: $67 MILLION (at least)\n\nThe campaign poured $67 million into the pure purchase of TV ads. That number is actually many millions more when you add in production and editing costs. Pritzker tapped a premier national media consulting firm, Shorr Johnson Magnus, and one of the firm\u2019s principals, Adam Magnus, was intensely involved in every aspect of the campaign. The sheer volume of ads was notable, but what really stood out was the geographic targeting.\n\n\u201cThe regional and market-specific advertising that has been done here has not been done in a governor\u2019s race in America,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t run one bus tour ad, we ran seven bus tour ads ... there\u2019s a Peoria version of the bus tour ad, there is a Rockford version of the bus tour ad.\u201d\n\nBy Election Day, Pritzker would run 160 different television ads, a staggering number for a blue-state race in which he consistently polled ahead by double digits. By comparison, typical competitive governors races might see 15 to 20 different ads appear on television.\n\nThat massive TV budget also helped raise and lower defense walls in a moment\u2019s notice. For Pritzker, it meant he could at least attempt to shout down a barrage of ads hitting him on his talks with Blagojevich. In one FBI recording, Pritzker can be heard asking Blagojevich about a possible appointment to a state office. Another set off a firestorm after Pritzker and Blagojevich could be heard discussing possible African-American appointees and Pritzker comments about one that is the \u201cleast offensive.\u201d The tapes were damaging to Pritzker and necessitated a full-fledged apology. They quite possibly could have taken down any other candidate.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, if something came out like that if you were unaware of in a Democratic primary, it would sink your campaign. Done,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cThe reason the campaign was able to make it through that period of time the way it did is completely a testament to who J.B. is. He had personally met with tens of thousands of individual African-Americans by the time that happened in the campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat also didn\u2019t hurt was an early investment in a separate track of TV ads directly targeting the African-American community, who make up roughly one-third of the voters in Cook County, the state\u2019s most populous county.\n\nThat included personal stories from a man whose conviction was overturned after serving 20 years in prison and thanking Pritzker for helping fund the Center for Wrongful Convictions.\n\n\u201cTo you, that may mean very little, but for some folks in the African-American community, that means a whole lot,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cThey had been seeing that \u2026 for eight months when the [Blagojevich] tapes came out. And the truth is, we didn\u2019t know that tape existed.\u201d\n\nThe excesses in the race afforded Pritzker the ability to cut ads and have them at the ready, just in case. If anticipated opposition research dropped, Pritzker\u2019s team was positioned to push back with messaging quickly. And if it didn\u2019t, that ad would just die\u2014a luxury not afforded typical campaigns.\n\nThat happened after a new ad hit Pritzker over a leaked government memo accusing him of having toilets pulled out of his opulent Gold Coast mansion to deem it uninhabitable and win a break on property taxes. In one ad, Rauner\u2019s camp dubbed Pritzker \u201cthe porcelain prince of tax avoidance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat night, there was an ad on television that was made two weeks prior to that,\u201d Magnus said.\n\nSTAFFING AND FIELD PRICE TAG: $24 million\n\nPritzker hired some of the highest-caliber campaign professionals in the country, starting with his campaign manager, Anne Caprara, who had previously served as executive director for Priorities USA Action, the main super PAC supporting Clinton. Slayen, the communications chief, had worked on campaigns across the country, including in Iowa and Florida. Several other top staffers, including Manfred Mecoy and Clasen, had previously worked on Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nCaprara oversaw more than 200 employees, which sometimes posed a challenge in managing her staffers' feistier dispositions\u2014and social-media feeds.\n\n\u201cA lot of young people, in particular, come into this as \u2018I have rights, I\u2019m not going to be treated poorly.\" \u2026 The old way doesn\u2019t work anymore. You can\u2019t think that you have 1,000 people and not a single one of them is not going to talk to the press,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t assume that you, as the manager, don\u2019t have the responsibility that the HR process works smoothly. You\u2019re consulting a lawyer about hire and fire them. You just have to remember that you are building a company in a lot of different ways.\u201d\n\nJust before Election Day, Caprara had to fire two campaign employees after one was pictured on social media wearing a black charcoal mask. The campaign is still grappling with allegations by former staffers who filed a lawsuit claiming a culture of harassment and discrimination existed on the campaign. The campaign denied the allegations and pointed to a $7.5 million demand by the employees.\n\nWhat else does $171 million buy? A whole lot of resentment.\n\nThis is Chicago, after all, so even a billionaire\u2019s campaign had to contend with a shakedown of sorts. A steady flow of vendors came knocking at the campaign\u2019s doors, sometimes with outrageous offers, said Quentin Fulks, who oversaw the Pritzker campaign budget.\n\nIn one case, Fulks said an owner of a local publication, which he would not name, asked that the Pritzker campaign pay $300,000 to bankroll the individual\u2019s personal book project that had nothing to do with the campaign or Pritzker.\n\n\u201cWe told them \u2018no\u2019 for the book and they got mad. The same person owns a newspaper publication and ran some pretty negative stuff against us when we didn\u2019t agree to publish,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cYou can make a lot of political enemies when people think you have an unlimited budget and you have to tell them \u2018no.\u2019 People take that really personally, they feel offended.\u201d\n\nIn the field\n\nPritzker\u2019s campaign opened more than 33 field offices across the state and flooded those areas with staff doing voter persuasion work. In the weeks leading up to the election, Pritzker\u2019s campaign regularly met with top campaign staffers across the state and shared resources with four competitive congressional races, two of which ultimately flipped blue. It supplemented resources for campaigns down to the county level.\n\nThe field operation was so coordinated, it knew enough to shift last-minute personnel to a competitive House race in the suburbs. A week before the election, Pritzker\u2019s campaign headquarters transformed into a full-blown, coordinated operation where staffers stuffed folders specific to the congressional district and down to the precinct. Results are still being tallied, but on Election Day, just one vote separated the two challengers.\n\nPARTY BUILDING (Blue Wave program) PRICE TAG: $22 million\n\nAlong the way, Pritzker doled out $20 million to Democratic groups and competitive campaigns, building up his own loyalties. The Blue Wave program that was an arm of Pritzker\u2019s campaign was almost entirely funded by Pritzker but took in some outside campaign contributions that were directed to competitive races.\n\nThe purpose was to relaunch, build out and co-opt an unstructured Illinois Democratic Party, one long ruled by a small but powerful Chicago-based machine so outdated it only recently launched its own website. It became clear that Pritzker was also working to edge out House Speaker and Party Chairman Mike Madigan\u2019s machine as the most powerful in the state.\n\nMadigan became the most unpopular politician in Illinois after Rauner went to war with the speaker and poured millions of dollars into negative advertising. Madigan remained quiet during the gubernatorial primary but behind the scenes was pressing for Pritzker, someone whose self-funding freed Democrats to maintain a legislative majority. (On a recent road trip, Pritzker bristled at the contention that he somehow owed his political ascent to Madigan. \u201cI know, I\u2019m his illegitimate son,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cJust to remind you, I didn\u2019t come out of anybody\u2019s political organization.\u201d)\n\nEarly on, Pritzker funded a Democratic grant program that challenged counties to build party infrastructure. That meant recruiting precinct committeemen, opening and staffing offices, developing a social media presence to start engaging local voters. Today, there are 70 new county party organizations with a Facebook presence, and in the past two years, Democrats added 2,000 new precinct committee people, building an army of 8,500 volunteer precinct committee people statewide.\n\n\u201cJ.B. opened up offices or headquarters in places that had not had a headquarters for a gubernatorial candidate or even any candidate headquarters in decades,\u201d said House, the former head of the Democratic county chair association.\n\nWhy don\u2019t these numbers add up?\n\nPritzker\u2019s folks spent another $8 million on an aggressive vote-by-mail program, and there\u2019s another $20 million that the campaign would not break out. That could account for big pots that weren\u2019t included above, including legal costs, polling and modeling and ad production and editing.\n\nIn the end, Mecoy, the general election director, held up these data points as evidence of a successful operation:\n\nPritzker won 54 percent to Rauner's 39 percent (though, of course, national forces also played against Republicans generally and Rauner specifically).\n\nDemocrats flipped two Republican congressional seats, in addition to the governor\u2019s office. Every constitutional office in Illinois is now blue, both legislative chambers stayed blue, and Democrats gained seats. It was the first time suburban DuPage County went blue in a gubernatorial election since 1932, and it was the lowest vote share for an incumbent governor in the past century.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ve seen of Pritzker\u2019s campaign. His top managers are already coveted recruits for key presidential races.\n\nFor now, Caprara took a position as Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff, but she\u2019s already considered a top prospect to lead a 2020 campaign.\n\nSo what did she learn? Caprara points to two takeaways for 2020: Digital rules, and so does authenticity.\n\nOn the digital piece, there\u2019s long been a fight between new- and old-school campaign operatives over how much of the budget should go to TV vs. digital.

Chief among them is a withdrawal from the economy\u2019s sugar high.\n\nFiscal stimulus from the GOP tax cuts is likely to start running out. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep bumping up interest rates. And few analysts expect a divided Congress \u2014 facing soaring deficits and with its eyes on 2020 \u2014 to join hands and pass a big infrastructure package or sweeping middle-class tax cuts to keep the fiscal juice flowing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe collection of all these factors, coupled with jittery investors already worried about trade wars and a global slowdown, could deny Trump the kind of big economic growth numbers he loves to celebrate. And they could undercut one of the GOP\u2019s biggest current arguments: You may not love what Trump says or does, but the Trump economy is awesome.\n\n\u201cThe first punch will be the lag effect of rising interest rates. Rates work slowly, but they do work eventually,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cAnd the second will be that by 2020, without a further package from Congress, the stimulus will be done. You put all these together and it\u2019s a little like Wile E. Coyote running over the cliff. You look down, and the ground you thought was under you suddenly isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d\n\nThe White House is well aware of the risks. Senior administration officials believe the big corporate tax cut will unleash a wave of sustainable growth in business spending that will keep the good numbers rolling \u2014 from job gains to higher wages \u2014 and keep producing GDP reports in the 3 percent territory that Trump loves, rather than the 2s or 1s that many economists expect.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201810/74/1155968404_5856060838001_5856057261001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut a prolonged business spending boom is no certainty, and some signals \u2014 including the third-quarter GDP report \u2014 suggest that capital investment is already slowing. So the White House is deeply engaged in efforts to boost growth through executive action, especially in the energy sector, by speeding the permitting process for natural gas pipelines and boosting the American shipping industry.\n\nWhite House officials are not counting on a big infrastructure package or a deal on the kind of middle-class tax cut Trump promised at the end of the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been noodling more on this middle-class tax cut, how to structure it, and even pay for it,\u201d National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in a recent interview in his West Wing office. \u201cI don\u2019t think the chances of that are very high, because the Democrats are going to go after the corporate tax and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nKudlow also was not enthusiastic about agreement between the White House and Democrats, who will control the House of Representatives, on a deal in 2019 to spend significant federal money on infrastructure projects. \u201cAnybody that thinks, you know, like this trillion-dollar [infrastructure spending] number, which is over 10 years \u2014 we don\u2019t have that,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\nKudlow said he still believed a \u201cboom\u201d in capital spending will continue in 2019 and 2020 and that he didn\u2019t worry about numbers like the recent GDP report showing capital spending nearly stalling out at 0.8 percent growth in the third quarter.\n\nBut while Trump\u2019s advisers remain bullish, many economists are now trimming their estimates for U.S. growth next year in part because of a reduction in the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases \u2014 more than $2 trillion worth \u2014 approved by Congress and signed by the president last year.\n\n\u201cI expect fiscal policy will still be stimulative in 2019, but not as stimulative as in 2018,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cIn round numbers, fiscal stimulus is adding maybe three-quarters of a point to GDP growth in 2018, will add maybe half as much again in 2019 and be close to neutral in 2020.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank estimates that fiscal policy will remain mildly positive in 2019 but turn into a drag of about 0.3 percent on the economy by 2020. \u201cYou should expect GDP growth to slow as we get into the second half of 2019 and in particular in 2020,\u201d said Torsten Slok, Deutsche\u2019s chief international economist.\n\nThe decline in fiscal stimulus will come as the Fed, much to Trump\u2019s displeasure, is likely to keep raising interest rates in 2019. The Fed is expected to hike rates again next month and several more times next year.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s main goal is to slow economic growth enough to prevent a surge in inflation as the labor market gets tighter. The Fed could pause its interest-rate hikes if the decline in fiscal stimulus from Congress kills economic growth entirely. But by the time it does so, the unemployment rate could be rising again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be quite surprised if unemployment is still falling by 2020, so Trump is very likely to be running against a backdrop of rising unemployment,\u201d said Shepherdson. He added that it is unlikely that the Fed could \u201cmagically manage to stabilize everything and freeze it where it is now and make everyone happy forever more.\u201d\n\nOrdinarily in such a scenario, Congress might step in and take stimulative measures to ensure that any slowdown is short-lived through higher spending and tax reductions. But a combination of political and fiscal factors makes this difficult, if not impossible.\n\nOn the political side, Democrats have limited incentive to cut a deal with Trump on an infrastructure spending package. And Republicans in Congress are growing increasingly alarmed by the ballooning size of the federal budget deficit, which hit $779 billion in 2018 and is expected to top $1 trillion in 2019. So when the Fed is tightening, Congress may be unable to push the other way.\n\n\"We poured a bunch of stimulus into the economy at precisely the time it didn\u2019t need it, and we are going to have to pay the price for that in the coming years,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cWhen the economy turns down, and by all accounts it will, we are likely to need to continue further stimulus. But because we are at such a higher debt position relative to normal, it\u2019s going to be harder to borrow and do that.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday flatly rejected the idea of doing a big infrastructure deal with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans are not interested in a $900 billion stimulus,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nInstead of debates about further stimulus, Congress could wind up stuck in bitter fights over funding the government and raising the debt limit. That could start next month if Trump demands more funding for his border wall as a part of a year-end bill to avoid a partial government shutdown on Dec. 8. The debt limit goes back into force in March, though Congress will likely have until summer to raise it before flirting with default.\n\nConcern over waning stimulus and rising rates has some of Trump's advisers, including Kudlow, scrambling to avoid a round of auto tariffs on Europe and a trade war with China next year. Those concerns helped turn October into the worst month for the stock market since 2011.\n\nAll the potential economic headwinds have Kudlow and other White House advisers banking hard on the idea that businesses will plow their tax-cut money into new spending in 2019 and beyond. \u201cThis economic boom is great. I personally believe it\u2019s going to continue for quite some time,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the capital expenditures, I\u2019ll be wrong. But I think we will.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "smurray@politico.com (Stephanie Murray)", "title": "Freshmen emerge as Instagram stars", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib \u2014all are amassing followings that dwarf most members of Congress.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/15/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-instagram-congress-pressley-omar-tlaib-991277", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/8e/e4/f6354ff54c73963f5be7c94731ae/20181114msmhouse-class139.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:06:57Z", "content": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chats were her fellow House freshmen during their class photo at the Capitol on Nov. 14. | M.

All of them ran campaigns that everybody, and women in particular, were so personally invested in,\" political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said. \"They were so invested in every step in this journey, and they want to continue it with them.\"\n\nWell over two-thirds of people ages 18 to 24 use Instagram in the United States, according to a report from the Pew Research Center published in March. And Instagram use is on the rise among adults more broadly. Thirty-five percent of U.S. adults say they use Instagram, up from 28 percent in 2016.\n\nDespite Instagram's popularity among millennials and young Americans, many House members don\u2019t even have an Instagram presence. Nearly all members are on Facebook or Twitter (about 98 percent), but only about half (47 percent) are on Instagram, according to an October report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\n\"Instagram allows you to share the journey, and you feel like you're with them every step of the way,\" Marsh said. \"You're pulling back the curtain and allowing people to view it in real time. You're able to demystify what goes on in Washington.\"\n\nAnd as the party gets younger and more diverse with this new wave of House members, the members' communication strategies are shifting, too. Instead of going radio-silent after their grass-roots campaigns, new members are taking followers along with them to orientation. That's no coincidence, Marsh said, because politics became more personal after President Donald Trump was elected, evidenced by the rise in large-scale activism like the Women's March and historically high voter turnout.\n\nAside from giving a behind-the-scenes look at what the first days in Congress are like, Ocasio-Cortez and other incoming freshman lawmakers are using Instagram to humanize themselves in a way that previous members of Congress didn't.\n\nOn her Instagram story, where temporary photos and videos last for 24 hours, Ocasio-Cortez posted videos jokingly calling the passages that connect congressional buildings \"secret underground tunnels\" and captioned a video from the Capitol \"Welcome to Hogwarts.\" She shared a close-up of Thomas Jefferson's copy of Plato's \"Republic\" at the Library of Congress and a \"SQUAD\" photo with Tlaib and Reps.-elect Lucy McBath of Georgia and Deb Haaland of New Mexico.\n\nMany of these new lawmakers have been in contact since primary season. Ocasio-Cortez quickly endorsed Pressley after her own win over the summer, and she also endorsed Tlaib and Omar.\n\n\"They all have powerful voices in their own right, and every single one of them went to represent their district, but also to raise their voices on a larger platform in Congress,\" Marsh said. \"All these new women, many of whom are women of color, are coming to Washington and they are going to change Congress and what happens in this country.\"\n\nAnd when these new lawmakers got to Washington this week, they were already spending time together in orientation meetings. Pressley posted a photo of herself leaning in for a selfie with Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib with the hashtag #NMO2018. Click over to Ocasio-Cortez's profile and there\u2019s a photo of the four incoming congresswomen with the caption \"Squad\" and a video of them walking down the hallway together and waving.\n\nThe early publicity has been positive: The Cut summed up their Instagram posts in this headline: \"Your Cool New Congresswomen Are Already Hanging Out.\"\n\nPressley also posted a candid photo of herself to Instagram sitting in a meeting at orientation with the caption, \"Good morning, Washington.\" It has more than 16,500 likes and 337 comments \u2014 a stunning number of likes for a post from a member of Congress.\n\nPressley reaches upward of 93,000 followers with her Instagram posts. To put that in context, the soon-to-be congresswoman has more Instagram followers than anyone else in the Massachusetts House delegation. Rep. Joe Kennedy III trails Pressley with 53,000 followers; outspoken Pelosi critic Rep. Seth Moulton has 5,600 followers; Rep. Katherine Clark, gunning for the No. 5 House leadership spot, has 3,000 followers; and Congresswoman-elect Lori Trahan has 857 followers. The most senior member of the delegation, Rep. Rich Neal, has just 282 followers \u2014 and has never posted anything.\n\nIn one Instagram story photo captioned \"just a few freshman orientation essentials,\" Pressley showed a to-go cup from Hill favorite Compass Coffee, a \"bring your own chair\" pin, an \"indivisible\" pen and a notebook arranged neatly on the table with a \"Washington, D.C.\" location tag.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has posted frequently on her Instagram story from orientation about everything from her decision to protest outside Pelosi's office to the tote bags and new phones every new member gets. The New York democratic socialist explained to her followers how new lawmakers can choose from a short list of high-security devices like tablets and phones, which come in a navy blue tote bag. \"You also get a freshman yearbook. It really is like orientation,\" Ocasio-Cortez says in the video, flipping through the New Member Pictorial Directory. \"And I get a folder with my ID, like a college ID.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez was one of several lawmakers who posted selfies from the new member dinner, and photos with the painting of trailblazing Rep. Shirley Chisholm in the Capitol. She documented the night down to the minute \u2014 a picture from the bus ride home included a 10:34 p.m. time stamp.\n\nRepublican Rep.-elect Dan Crenshaw, who grabbed headlines when he fired back at a dig from \"Saturday Night Live\" star Pete Davidson last week, posted on Instagram twice from orientation. He also shared a photo of that same tote bag emblazoned with \"UNITED STATES CONGRESS,\" with the caption \"Guess what's in the bag\u2026\" The tote bag also showed up on Tlaib's Instagram story with the caption \"Just got real.\"\n\nHaaland posted several photos from orientation on Tuesday night, including a shot with Kansas Rep.-elect Sharice Davids. Haaland and Davids are the first Native American women elected to Congress. Davids posted several photos to Instagram on Tuesday, including a picture of her and Haaland's new IDs side by side.\n\nWe did not come to play.\n\n\n\n\u270a\ud83c\udffc\u270a\ud83c\udffd\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udfff https://t.co/O6MzKKbCgI \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) November 13, 2018\n\nOmar posted a selfie to her Instagram story from the new-member dinner with Rep.-elect Dean Phillips, a fellow Minnesotan, cluing in her followers via a caption that he \"helped retire\" Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen. Also on Tuesday, Omar posted a candid black-and-white photo from a new-member meeting, where she is sitting between Haaland and Pressley with the caption \"we did not come to play.\"\n\nCrenshaw posted a black-and-white selfie from the rotunda with the caption \"name that background!\" and added that he toured the House floor with Speaker Paul Ryan after taking the photo. Ryan welcomed a new member on Instagram, too. He posted a candid photo with Republican Utah Sen.-elect Mitt Romney, writing \"an old friend dropped by to ask for directions to his new office.\"\n\n\"To many people, what goes on in Congress is still a mystery, and it shouldn't be because it affects everybody's lives every day,\" Marsh said. \"People wanted to be a part of their campaigns; they want to be part of the great work they're going to do. They want to see the good, the bad, the ugly, to go along on this journey with them and help them again when it comes time.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": null, "title": "Girls Uninterrupted: Helping Young Refugees Thrive in America", "description": "How GirlForward is providing a support community for refugee youth.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/video/2018/11/15/181029-wwn-austin-newman-1-067501", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:00:53Z", "content": "What Works Next How GirlForward is providing a support community for refugee youth.", "fulltext": "What Works Next\n\nGirls Uninterrupted: Helping Young Refugees Thrive in America\n\nHow GirlForward is providing a support community for refugee youth."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "(Associated Press)", "title": "Utah Rep.

His populism is largely, although not entirely, a matter of style \u2014 combative, lacerating, emotive, unpredictable and grandiose.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis sensibility is a central part of Trump\u2019s appeal. It marks him as distinctive, impossible to domesticate to the ways of Washington, and firmly anti-establishment. It also puts the accent on his personality, which is a double-edged sword, at best.\n\nFor every Trump voter that it lights up, it reminds a suburban woman why she hates his guts. The Democratic wave in the suburbs was mostly a function of a deeply felt personal revulsion toward the president. If Trump\u2019s populism is always based foremost on Rally Trump and Twitter Trump, i.e., on the behavior pushing the suburbs away from him, there is no way for him to try to tamp down the yawning geographic and demographic vulnerability underlined by the midterms.\n\nTrump is different from other Republicans on trade and immigration, the issues at the core of his populism, but other than that, he has governed as a fairly typical Republican. His biggest legislative accomplishment during the first two years of his presidency was a tax cut out of Republican Central Casting.\n\nIt would have been a disaster for the GOP\u2019s morale if it had whiffed on the tax cut, after failing on Obamacare repeal. But in the midterms, the tax cut proved an electoral nullity, in large part because it was an answer to a question that voters weren\u2019t asking.\n\nTrump knew that it didn\u2019t resonate as an issue. \u201cHey, did you hear that I cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and created a 20 percent deduction for pass-through income?\u201d wasn\u2019t the messaging he was looking for.\n\nHe showed an instinctual sense that he needed a genuine middle-class agenda. He talked of a fantastical middle-class tax cut about to be considered. And he insisted that Republicans would do a better job dealing with the problem of pre-existing conditions than Democrats, without offering any supporting policy.\n\nIn the absence of any populist substance, Trump was thrown back on the caravan, and more caravan, and his usual mediagenic provocations. This created his characteristic stew of acrimony and hysterical overreaction by his opponents, which pushed both his supporters and opponents to the polls, and \u2014 with the exception of some key red-state Senate races \u2014 more of the latter than the former.\n\nTrump\u2019s personality is never going to change, nor is he going to become the candidate of the suburbs, but small changes can make a difference. Trump\u2019s relatively disciplined finale against Hillary Clinton in 2016 helped him get over the hump. Going into 2020, he needs a populism that is a little less stylistic and more substantive, and one that has crossover appeal to Trump\u2019s working-class voters and suburbanites.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important to have a counter to the Democratic House, which isn\u2019t going to be sending many bills to the president\u2019s desk but will presumably be passing an exemplary progressive agenda on health care, college and wages in the runup to the 2020 election.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see a Trump counter, in rough outline. One focus should be work. Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute has written a new book, \u201cThe Once and Future Worker,\u201d that is a guide to new conservative thinking on how to support a healthy labor market. The Trump team should crib from it freely. A central idea in the book is a wage subsidy for low-wage work.\n\nAnother broad category should be the cost of living, especially health care and college. Although you wouldn\u2019t know it from the midterm campaign, conservatives do have proposals to deal with pre-existing conditions, even if few Republican candidates seemed aware of them. The thrust of the GOP health care agenda is to reduce costs to consumers, a theme Trump should emphasize. Hospitals are a key driver of health care spending and deserve much more critical scrutiny.\n\nIt should be natural to take on the costs of higher education, driven in part by the unintended consequences of federal programs, and promote alternative means of training and accreditation besides four-year college. The higher-education establishment is obviously politically uncongenial to Republicans, and Trump, of all politicians, should want to promote the interests of young people entering the workforce without a four-year degree.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s signature issue of immigration, it would go down easier in the suburbs if he began talking about E-Verify, which puts the focus on the employers who hire undocumented immigrants rather than the immigrants themselves.\n\nThe problem is that these are relatively small-bore ideas that don\u2019t lend themselves to Trump\u2019s rhetoric of large claims and easy-to-understand villains. Taken together, it can be an agenda larger than its parts, but it will need to be thought through and can\u2019t just be grabbed off the shelf.\n\nEven if last week\u2019s results weren\u2019t as encouraging to Trump as they appeared at first blush, he is still very much in the game. The Electoral College path is there \u2014 if he can hold the rest of his 2016 states, he can lose Pennsylvania and Michigan and still get over the top with Wisconsin. But unless some exogenous event boosts Trump\u2019s standing to another level, he is dependent on Democrats once again nominating a candidate unacceptable to the white working class (and not particularly popular in the suburbs, either).\n\nEven then, it could be a near-run thing. Best to deepen and widen his populism in advance of what could be another effort to thread the electoral needle.\n\n\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Nahal Toosi", "title": "Khashoggi killing tests Trump\u2019s love of sanctions", "description": "A decision could come soon on whether to penalize U.S. ally Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's murder.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/trump-sanctions-khashoggi-991271", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/e8/f0/a557653f4def8c7ee1ab62f420c9/181114-salman-trump-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:09:01Z", "content": "Lawmakers and activists will be watching to see if President Donald Trump specifically sanctions Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images The America First Trump administration has surprised critics with its willingness to sancti\u2026 [+10253 chars]", "fulltext": "Lawmakers and activists will be watching to see if President Donald Trump specifically sanctions Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images White House Khashoggi killing tests Trump\u2019s love of sanctions A decision could come soon on whether to penalize U.S. ally Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe \u201cAmerica First\u201d Trump administration has surprised critics with its willingness to sanction human rights abusers around the world. But with the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, that willingness is facing its biggest test yet.\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has permitted the use of a relatively new law, known as the Global Magnitsky Act, to slap economic penalties on more than 80 people and entities around the world strictly for human rights violations and corruption. The targets range from Myanmar generals to Nicaraguan officials to a former Gambian president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor the most part, the targets have been people or organizations in places not especially vital to U.S. strategic interests. That\u2019s not the case with Khashoggi\u2019s death, which has been blamed on officials at the highest level of the Saudi Arabia government, a critical U.S. ally in the Middle East.\n\nAt this point, aides to Trump are leaning toward imposing Global Magnitsky sanctions on at least some Saudi officials, according to a former U.S. official briefed by administration members. And the administration has already barred or revoked the U.S. visas of around 20 Saudis believed involved in the case of Khashoggi, who was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Many analysts suspect the crown prince, known as MBS, greenlit the murder of the dissident journalist.\n\nSuch a punishment would be \u201ca very useful tool for sending the message that this man perhaps should not be given the keys to the kingdom for the next 50 years,\u201d said newly elected Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat and former State Department human rights official.\n\nBut imposing sanctions, especially on the crown prince, could damage U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia, a major oil-producing nation that Trump views as key to countering the rise of Iran. Sanctioning the future Saudi monarch could also have economic repercussions given the intermingling of the royal family\u2019s wealth with that of the Saudi state. Saudi Arabia is a major global investor, including in tech titans such as Uber, Tesla and WeWork.\n\nStill, some type of economic penalty appears likely. In a call Sunday with Bin Salman, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u201cemphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same,\u201d according to the State Department. He gave no hint as to whether the crown prince himself was in trouble.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time the Trump administration has slapped Global Magnitsky sanctions on top officials in a U.S.-allied foreign power. Two government ministers in Turkey were suddenly penalized earlier this year over the imprisonment of an American Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson.\n\nThe Brunson-related sanctions were a rare rebuke of a fellow NATO member. But the tactic appeared to help free Brunson, whose case was a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters. The U.S. lifted the sanctions on the Turkish officials after Brunson was released; he\u2019d been held on spurious charges of aiding terrorists.\n\n\u201cWhen President Trump wants to move quickly on human rights sanctions he does,\u201d Sen. Robert Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cThe administration turned around Global Magnitsky sanctions on Turkish officials in a matter of days. They should do the same on Khashoggi-related sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act was signed into law by former President Barack Obama during his final months in office. Its roots lie in a sanctions law passed a few years earlier, known as the Magnitsky Act, which targets human rights violators in Russia. \u201cMagnitsky\u201d refers to Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died after being jailed and abused for investigating corruption linked to the Kremlin.\n\nThe Global Magnitsky Act gives the U.S. president authority to go after people or organizations around the world specifically for violating human rights or engaging in corrupt practices.\n\nA person, company or other entity targeted by Global Magnitsky faces penalties such as having their U.S. assets frozen and being barred from doing business with any U.S. person or company. Banks and other companies around the world that have any links to the U.S. are also unlikely to do business with those sanctioned under the law, severely restricting their ability to access financial resources and travel.\n\nWhen Trump took office, few expected his administration to make use of the Global Magnitsky Act. Trump did not dwell much on human rights during his presidential campaign. In fact, his calls to ban Muslims from the U.S. and \u201ctake out\u201d the families of terrorist suspects led many to worry he supported abusive tactics. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d view suggested a turn toward isolationism, and his flattery of authoritarians alarmed human rights activists.\n\nBut from the start the Trump administration has relied heavily on sanctions as a key foreign policy tool, and Trump aides apparently saw the Global Magnitsky law as a useful legal basis for imposing economic penalties. The president even signed an executive order last year that effectively loosened many of the Global Magnitsky law\u2019s definitions to make it easier for the U.S. government to crack down.\n\nOne practical effect of the executive order is that \u201cthe U.S. government doesn\u2019t need to prove that a particular foreign person was involved directly or indirectly in the Khashoggi affair in order to designate him,\u201d wrote Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president with Human Rights First, in a blog post. If a person is an official in an entity that commits human rights abuses, he could be sanctioned. \u201cIn the context of Saudi Arabia, this is likely a very low bar,\u201c Berschinski wrote.\n\nSince December 2017, the administration has imposed sanctions on at least 26 people and 58 entities under the law, according to the Treasury Department, which typically takes the lead on implementing Global Magnitsky penalties.\n\nIn Myanmar, the sanctions targeted military leaders implicated in the potential genocide of Rohingya Muslims. In Nicaragua, officials were accused of violence against protesters. The former Gambian president, Yahya Jammeh, was alleged to have used a terror squad against perceived enemies while simultaneously stealing from government coffers.\n\nOne of the most prominent targets was Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire businessman suspected of making illicit mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The case has proven deeply embarrassing to Congolese officials.\n\n\u201cThis administration is focused on this issue and will continue to take action against human rights and corruption related targets around the globe,\u201d a Treasury Department spokesman told POLITICO in a statement.\n\nThe spokesman also noted that the Trump administration has used other sanctions programs to combat corruption and human rights abuses, penalizing over 400 people and more than 85 affiliated entities.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to statistically compare the human rights sanctions record of the Trump administration to those of past presidencies. Trump is the first to have a tool such as the Global Magnitsky Act, and people and organizations targeted in the past were often sanctioned for multiple reasons beyond violating human rights, making the penalties difficult to track.\n\nAnecdotally, however, the Trump White House has turned to sanctions a striking number of times. Members of Congress have noticed, and some are pressing it to go even farther.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), have urged Trump to impose Global Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the large-scale detention and other abuses of the country\u2019s minority Muslims. A bipartisan group of lawmakers also has urged the administration to use the law against oppressors in Central America.\n\nIn the Khashoggi case, 22 senators from both parties wrote to Trump on Oct. 10 requesting that his administration determine who was responsible for the journalist\u2019s alleged torture and death. They made the ask under a special provision in the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows lawmakers to set a 120-day clock for an administration to investigate a human rights matter. Ultimately, however, the president gets to decide whether to impose sanctions.\n\nForeign policy experts say it\u2019s tough \u2014 and possibly too soon \u2014 to gauge how much Global Magnitsky sanctions change behavior.\n\nIn the case of Turkey, the end goal was freeing Brunson \u2014 and that happened. But Brunson was also freed amid U.S.-Turkey discussions about how to deal with the Saudi killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul. It\u2019s possible the Turkish government decided it was worth freeing Brunson to gain some U.S. goodwill to use against the Saudis. It\u2019s also possible Brunson would eventually have been released by Turkey\u2019s judicial system no matter what.\n\nOne indication that the laws do have an effect is how angry the original Magnitsky Act has made Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBecause the sanctions are specific to individuals or organizations, they are also believed to cause less \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to ordinary civilians in a country than broad sanctions aimed at an industry or government would.\n\nIf the Trump administration doesn\u2019t sanction Saudi officials at all, it\u2019s sure to be cited as an example of U.S. hypocrisy on human rights, especially when it comes to oppressive allies such as the Saudi government. But some human rights observers like Malinowski, the soon-to-be New Jersey congressman, also worry that the Trump administration will penalize \u201csacrificial lambs\u201d put forth by the Saudi royal family, and declare the crisis solved.\n\nSome activists say sanctions must come in tandem with U.S. demands for an independent, outside investigation of the Khashoggi killing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a moment where the U.S. has the opportunity to reassess its partnership with Saudi Arabia and reflect on the role human rights needs to play,\u201d said Sarah Margon, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cImposing the sanctions would be a positive step, but it can\u2019t be the only step.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "jbresnahan@politico.com (John Bresnahan)", "title": "CBC votes no confidence in DNC Chair Perez", "description": "Cedric Richmond said members \u201cfelt that the DNC pitted them against their constituents.\u201d", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/congressional-black-caucus-tom-perez-991270", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/94/b2/1ed0e5214be3a6eeaf3f0c1bc347/181114-tomperezlede-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:01:49Z", "content": "Congressional Black Caucus members said some of them were wary about voting no confidence in Democratic National Committee Tom Perez so quickly after the midterms. | Annie Rice/AP Photo The Congressional Black Caucus passed a vote of no confidence in Democrat\u2026 [+3250 chars]", "fulltext": "Congressional Black Caucus members said some of them were wary about voting no confidence in Democratic National Committee Tom Perez so quickly after the midterms. | Annie Rice/AP Photo Congress CBC votes no confidence in Democratic Chair Perez\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus passed a vote of no confidence in Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Wednesday, the latest sign of lingering bad blood between lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the Democratic Party\u2019s top official.\n\nAccording to CBC members, Rep.

Critics of superdelegates say the elite roles in the nominating process favored establishment figures and gave elected officials too much power in selecting the presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cAn overwhelming majority of DNC members approved these historic reforms to strengthen and grow our party, increase transparency, and put our nominee in the best possible position to win in 2020,\u201d said Adrienne Watson, a DNC spokeswoman. \u201cAs last Tuesday showed, when we empower our grassroots we succeed.
