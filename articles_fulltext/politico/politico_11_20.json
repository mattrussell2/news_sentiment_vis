It's a fight that could result in a historic subpoena and eventual Supreme Court ruling, pulling a defiant Trump into a legal squabble that could set groundbreaking precedent for presidential investigations for years to come. Depending on how the battle plays out, House Democrats may even try to pounce and launch impeachment proceedings.\n\nThings could get explosive fast. Next comes the perilous round of negotiations between Trump\u2019s lawyers and Mueller\u2019s prosecutors covering topics like Trump's intentions when firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That line of questioning \u2014 which Trump says he shouldn't have to answer \u2014 is tied to Mueller's ongoing obstruction of justice investigation.\n\n\u201cThese are very deep waters and complicated questions,\u201d said John Q. Barrett, a St. John\u2019s University law professor and former associate who worked under independent counsel Lawrence Walsh during the Reagan-era investigation into secret U.S. arms sales to Iran.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Mueller\u2019s prosecutors reportedly have made the threat before, but now the step comes with the added wrinkle that it could spark an internal Justice Department riff with his new supervisor, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who previously has been critical of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nShould the special counsel win DOJ approval and pull the subpoena trigger, he\u2019d still have to face off against a president who has relished taunting Mueller and enter into a legal battle that could quickly elevate to the Supreme Court, where a newly enmeshed conservative majority is widely seen as friendlier to Trump\u2019s arguments.\n\nRound Two of Mueller versus Trump could also fizzle, though.\n\nLegal experts say that the special counsel might have enough information from documents, presidential tweets and witnesses to wrap up the obstruction of justice portion of his investigation and file a report to his DOJ supervisors \u2014 all without forcing a court showdown just to nail down an interview with the president.\n\n\u201cMy hunch, at least at this time, [is that] the special counsel doesn't need the president's testimony and that he has provided the president with the opportunity to testify simply so that the president does not later complain about the special counsel's further prosecutorial actions or the conclusions of his report when it is made public in one fashion or another,\u201d said Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel under President Bill Clinton.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s unclear what path the dispute will take.\n\nMueller on Tuesday stuck to the same no-comment posture he\u2019s had throughout the 18-monthlong Russia investigation, refusing to show any of his cards in public beyond what\u2019s required in legal filings.\n\nThat\u2019s left a large vacuum that Trump and his attorneys have been eager to fill. The president told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace in an interview that aired Sunday that he \u201cprobably\u201d would not end up sitting for an interview with Mueller despite more than a year of his own public comments expressing a willingness to do so.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we\u2019re finished,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump and his attorneys have also left open some wiggle room for what\u2019s next. Giuliani recently explained to POLITICO that while the president\u2019s legal team has been focused on getting through the first round of questions related to the Russian hacking, they hadn\u2019t foreclosed holding talks with Mueller about an in-person Trump interview.\n\n\u201cWe both agreed to leave it open to discussion,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nBut Giuliani noted there is a catch: Trump\u2019s lawyers would fight a special counsel subpoena forcing his testimony on topics tied to his time in the White House \u2014 whether the questions cover the Comey firing or other areas tied to an obstruction of justice probe.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t argue that you can never a subpoena a president. I would argue that you can't in this particular case because to subpoena a president you have a burden you don't have with anybody else,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cBecause you're intruding on his presidential time. You've got to show a real need for it. A real need for it in terms of developing your case and not a real need in order to try to trap him. Trapping is not a legal legitimate objective.\u201d\n\nWhether Giuliani\u2019s arguments would hold up in court is an open question, and many legal experts say Trump would be up against a unanimous 1974 Supreme Court ruling that found President Richard M. Nixon had to comply with the request of the Watergate special prosecutor to relinquish Oval Office recordings of conversations with his aides.\n\nBut despite that historic Nixon opinion, Trump allies and even some of his critics say there\u2019s still wiggle room for a narrow ruling that deals directly with a subpoena for a sitting president\u2019s testimony related to a criminal probe involving his time while in office.\n\n\u201cIt would be a fascinating legal battle and probably a razor-thin margin,\u201d said Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor from New York.\n\nTrump allies say they are also bolstered by the views of Brett Kavanaugh, the newly confirmed Supreme Court justice. While Kavanaugh once helped craft a set of graphic questions for Clinton about his sexual affair with a White House intern while serving on independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s team, he later opined in favor of a change in law that would protect a president from a criminal trial subpoena.\n\n\u201cMueller has the most to lose in terms of litigating the authority of the Office of the Special Counsel,\u201d said a source close to the Trump White House. \u201cIf the president gets a subpoena, he\u2019s got a million ways to say, \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and National Review columnist whom the president has cited on Twitter for Mueller matters, said the special counsel faces the burden of proving a presidential interrogation is necessary.\n\n\u201cI think that the prosecutor should neither interview or subpoena the president unless he\u2019s got strong evidence implicating the president in a potential crime,\u201d he said. \u201cMueller is no dope. He knows that, too.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first round of written answers do mark the end of one critical phase of the Mueller probe. The president told reporters in the spring of 2017 he was \u201c100 percent\u201d willing to testify under oath about alleged Russian ties to his campaign. He has since backtracked on the pledge and pushed instead for Mueller to accept written answers.\n\nDuring the negotiations earlier this year, the Trump legal team compiled a list of about four dozen questions Mueller wanted to ask the president, covering everything from what knowledge he had of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s outreach to Russia, to what he knew about national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s call to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. after the 2016 election.\n\nAccording to Giuliani, the special counsel also rejected the written Q&A format earlier this year but later acceded to try out the approach \u2014 though the Trump lawyer also insisted the president was under no obligation to answer all of Mueller\u2019s questions.\n\nTrump\u2019s first round of written answers do have some downsides for prosecutors since the one-sided approach allows for evasive responses. His prosecutors also can\u2019t ask in-person follow-ups.\n\n\u201cWritten questions are a very poor substitute for an actual interview,\u201d said William Jeffress, a white-collar defense attorney who represented Nixon after he left the White House.\n\nBut they do carry some legal weight. The president is indeed now locked in on answers that carry the same legal burden of truthfulness as an in-person session \u2014 and they can be used for years to come.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan, for example, delivered written answers in 1987 to the Iran-Contra investigators. Three years later, prosecutors relied on the submissions to cross-examine the former Republican president when he appeared as a witness during a trial of his former national security adviser, John Poindexter.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, one of the four articles of impeachment adopted in December 1998 by the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee accused the Democrat of \u201cwillfully\u201d committing perjury and giving \u201cfalse and misleading testimony\u201d in writing as part of a federal civil rights lawsuit.\n\nThat specific article was later rejected on the House floor, though Clinton was nonetheless impeached on two other counts."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "DPalmer@politico.com (Doug Palmer)", "title": "Lighthizer: China has not corrected actions that led to tariffs", "description": "The comments, made as part of an update to a previous report, could complicate talks planned between Trump and China\u2019s leader late this month.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/lighthizer-china-trump-trade-tariffs-986829", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/aa/68/9fb06614418dbd0464733a84460f/170314-robert-lighthizer-ap-1160.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:14:17Z", "content": "The U.S. trade chief made the statement in conjunction with a 53-page update it released on a report on its investigation into China's intellectual property practices. | AP Photo China has not changed unfair and discriminatory practices that prompted Presiden\u2026 [+2486 chars]", "fulltext": "U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer made the statement in conjunction with a 53-page update it released on a report on its investigation into China's intellectual property practices. | AP Photo Lighthizer: China has not corrected actions that led to tariffs\n\nChina has not changed unfair and discriminatory practices that prompted President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on around $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. trade chief made the statement in conjunction with a 53-page update it released on a report on its investigation into China's intellectual property practices under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.

Marcia Fudge endorsed Nancy Pelosi for House speaker on Tuesday, just days after openly mulling a challenge to the California Democrat, providing a significant boost to Pelosi\u2019s quest to regain the gavel.\n\nFudge\u2019s endorsement is a significant blow to efforts by more than a dozen current and incoming Democrats to oust Pelosi, who has ruled over the caucus for the past 16 years.

Fudge is the only Democrat who has publicly considered challenging Pelosi.\n\nPelosi needs 218 votes to win the speakership if all members are present and voting in January. In addition to the 16 Democrats promising to vote against Pelosi, at least three other incoming House freshmen have said they will oppose her. If all of those Democrats stand firm, it would likely be enough to deny Pelosi the speakership.\n\nBut Pelosi has more than a month to work to persuade members to support her once she wins the caucus vote next week. And the latest move \u2014 offering Fudge a plum subcommittee chairmanship overseeing an issue important to her \u2014 is evidence of the persuasive tools Pelosi has at her disposal to offer to lawmakers.\n\nThe House Administration subcommittee Fudge will lead was eliminated by Republicans in 2013.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Fudge apologized for sending a letter several years ago supporting a former Ohio judge who is now accused of killing his ex-wife.\n\nIn the 2015 letter, Fudge asked for leniency in sentencing for Lance Mason after Mason admitted to brutally beating his then-wife, Aisha Fraser. Mason was arrested Saturday in connection with his ex-wife\u2019s murder.\n\n\u201cMy support of Lance in 2015 was based on the person I knew for almost 30 years \u2014 an accomplished lawyer, prosecutor, state legislator and judge.

Mark Walker (R-N.C.), newly elected vice chairman of the Republican Conference, said in an interview.\n\nEven if the proposal had been offered during the GOP meeting, it was not expected to be adopted, according to one senior Republican aide. \u201cI think most members would want to wait for [Democrats] to bite the bullet first,\" the aide said.\n\nIn January, House Democrats are expected to do just that by taking up the issue when the conference meets to establish its own rules. If that vote is successful, it will be just the first step in a lengthy process that would require making deals with both the Senate and the White House to ensure no subsequent spending bills sink due to the House's move.\n\nDemocratic leaders have not laid out a specific path.

Going against the wishes of a majority of the GOP caucus, House Speaker Paul Ryan moved to halt the debate to avoid a public relations nightmare.\n\nRyan and other Republican leaders did take some steps this year to restart the debate, after Trump suggested congressional leaders \"start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks\" to rekindle a \"friendliness\" among legislators.\n\nThis summer, the House Rules Committee held its first set of hearings on the issue of earmarks in years.

He estimated he will have a majority of senators in both parties on his side, though he\u2019s not sure whether he can accrue a veto-proof majority to stop the sales and override the president.\n\nBut he's confident there will be another referendum in the Senate, and he's still bullish on his prospects.\n\n\u201cAt some point in time, all of this will have to come forward, there is no way they can get by without a vote,\u201d Paul said.\n\nOn Tuesday, in the immediate wake of Trump\u2019s statement, with Congress gone and Washington beginning to clear out for Thanksgiving, Paul\u2019s supporters were mostly Democrats. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said Trump\u2019s avoidance of blaming bin Salman is a \u201cstain on our democracy,\u201d and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said the president sided with a \u201cmurderous regime over patriotic American intelligence officials.\u201d\n\nPaul would never put it that way, despite his pointed disagreement with Trump. And he said that despite being at odds with the president on a key foreign policy decision, he doesn\u2019t expect his relationship with Trump to change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he takes things personally, to tell you the truth, unless they\u2019re personal. I\u2019ve been a big defender of the president if there are any partisan attacks,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOn issues, we\u2019ve had lots of disagreements. \u2026 I don\u2019t think this will bother him at all.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Matthew Choi", "title": "Trump says he's going to a war zone", "description": "Previous news reports have claimed the president was &quot;afraid&quot; of going to such places.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/trump-military-war-zone-visit-1009223", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/6c/0e/baaffbdc4a94b1a976f9bffc3555/181120-trump-getty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:42:23Z", "content": "President Donald Trump has faced mounting criticism for never visiting U.S. troops in a combat zone nearly two years into his presidency. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images President Donald Trump rebuffed rumors that he's too afraid to visit U.S. troops in a war z\u2026 [+2091 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump has faced mounting criticism for never visiting U.S. troops in a combat zone nearly two years into his presidency. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump says he's going to a war zone\n\nPresident Donald Trump rebuffed rumors that he's too afraid to visit U.S. troops in a war zone, telling reporters that he does plan to visit a combat area at some point.\n\n\"Are you afraid to go into a war zone?\" a reporter asked Trump as he was leaving the White House on Tuesday for Mar-a-Lago.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"No, I'm going to a war zone,\" the president retorted without specifying which combat area or when he may go.\n\nTrump has faced mounting criticism for never visiting U.S. troops in a combat zone nearly two years into his presidency.

The explanation for why Ivanka Trump would think she could do something like this, however, can be summed up in one simple word: nepotism.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt seems quaint to recall it now, given everything that\u2019s happened since, but the selection of Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, in 2017 to serve as senior White House advisers hit Washington, D.C., like a shock wave at the time. After decades of institutional policy forbidding nepotism hires\u2014a policy that found its foundation in an anti-nepotism law passed in the wake of President John F. Kennedy selecting his brother, Robert, to serve as the attorney general\u2014the president relied upon a narrow loophole in the law to bring his daughter and son-in-law into the White House. Neither Ivanka Trump nor Kushner had any government experience, let alone any recognizable expertise in matters that would otherwise qualify them for their respective roles, aside from their familial positions. What they did have, of course, was the trust of the president.\n\nCritics of the move have long had other reasons to question the wisdom of hiring Ivanka Trump and Kushner. Both have been drawn into the Russian investigation\u2014albeit more directly in the case of Kushner, who testified before Congress and the special counsel\u2019s investigators\u2014and their continued retention of security clearances despite numerous red flags in their respective backgrounds has rankled legal and ethics experts.\n\nThe cavalier use of private email to conduct U.S. government business, however, is particularly galling given the prominence of the issue throughout the campaign. According to the Washington Post\u2014building on previous reporting by POLITICO\u2014when confronted about the issue in late 2017, Ivanka Trump\u2019s defense was that she was unaware of the relevant procedures and did not realize she could not use her private email account in that manner.\n\nTo which the only possible response is: Oh, come on.\n\nWhile there might have been a time when this defense would have been believable, particularly for someone who had not previously served in government, Ivanka Trump would have had to literally have slept through the entirety of the presidential campaign to not be aware of how much a similar use of private emails cost Clinton politically.\n\nTrump was there at campaign rallies where her father led \u201clock her up\u201d chants. She was at the Republican National Convention, where \u201clock her up\u201d chants took place during virtually every speech. She was at the presidential debates, during at least one of which President Trump stated point-blank that as president he would seek to have Clinton prosecuted for her email practices. There is no way Ivanka Trump was unaware of the seriousness of the issue.\n\nThat leaves two possibilities. One, Ivanka Trump is egregiously incompetent and honestly did not comprehend what the entire email scandal was about at its core. Two, she walked into the White House with the air of entitlement and invincibility that could only come with being an untouchable nepotism hire for whom the rules did not apply.\n\nAll other things being equal, the second possibility appears to be far and away the more likely of the two options.\n\nNow, to be fair, Ivanka Trump\u2019s actions may not have been as reckless as Clinton\u2019s. However, we do not know all the details about Trump\u2019s emails at this point. A review of the explanations put forth by her legal team is eerily similar to those that Clinton and her team put forth when news of her email habits first came to light.\n\nClinton, like Ivanka Trump, originally claimed there was no classified information in her emails; the subsequent investigation found otherwise. Clinton, like Ivanka Trump, claimed that thousands of the emails were personal and not government-related; to this day, the president still claims on Twitter that there was a conspiracy to hide relevant emails that were deleted from Clinton\u2019s server.\n\nIvanka Trump is one of the president\u2019s closest advisers, potentially privy to any number of important government secrets. Did she allow classified information to spill into some of her emails? Was she as reckless in her behavior as Clinton? Has her account been hacked by any foreign adversaries of the United States?\n\nIt took an exhaustive government investigation to get to the bottom of things with Hillary. For the sake of transparency and accountability, no less than the same should be done with Ivanka Trump\u2019s emails.\n\nBradley P. Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C. Law Office of Mark S.

The caricature of the rich, or about-to-cash-out, sleazy elected official out to further enrich themselves and wine and dine among the cocktail party set in Georgetown is well established. And indeed, the average member of Congress has a net worth of more than $1 million, according to the latest data available.\n\nSo when the public directly encounters some of the harsh realities of congressional finances or less-than-wealthy members, it is often a culture shock. Perhaps never has this been truer than with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the wonder-freshman from the Bronx, a former bartender who has become an objection of fascination on the left and the right. Her relatively meager savings and the challenges she faces affording a second home in Washington thrust her into a new light as freshmen attended their Capitol Hill orientation activities over the past few days.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFirst, conservatives should leave Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s finances alone, not only because it\u2019s the right and privacy-respecting thing to do, but also because reminding voters that she is like them, and you are not, is bad politics.\n\nAnd second, we should all want to encourage more middle-class people to run for office, not less. And we should make Congress more accessible to them by eliminating the housing quandary in Washington\u2014which has become one of the priciest real estate markets in the country\u2014and building a dorm-style apartment building near the Capitol. The side effects would benefit taxpayers immensely.\n\nThe idea of congressional dorms, or a stipend for housing, have been debated for decades. Meanwhile, we hear stories of members literally living in their offices\u2014among them is outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2014to save money, or of other representatives living in houseboats or in group homes that resemble flophouses. In 2011, one good-government group even filed a complaint, alleging that at least 33 members were sleeping in their offices in what constituted a misuse of official resources.\n\nOne problem Congress faces solving this problem is that it is politically impossible to vote yourself a new benefit or luxury. Most congressional pay raises take effect in the next Congress to avoid this appearance of conflict. Members of Congress earn a salary of $174,000 a year, which is well above the national median income, but they haven\u2019t had a pay raise since 2009.\n\nStill, who really feels sorry for Congress? Many are indeed independently wealthy, and again, $174,000 is not exactly the wages of poverty. Shouldn\u2019t that be enough?\n\nSet aside the political optics for a second, though, and the idea of subsidized housing for members of Congress makes a ton of sense.\n\nFor one thing, housing often causes controversy in itself. Many members have been ensnarled in the trap of renting from a donor or lobbyist because it seems like a good deal, only to find themselves in ethical gray areas, at best. Eliminating this incentive to enter into a financial relationship with The Swamp is good housekeeping.\n\nWashington is also very expensive. The high and rising price-per-square-foot can be directly attributed to the largesse of government, but that\u2019s hardly a new member\u2019s fault. Consider a member who is providing for a family in Orange County, California, but also needs housing in Washington. The bills are brutal, despite the seemingly hefty salary, and creates an unfair advantage for members whose districts are within driving distance.\n\nRenting or buying permanent housing in Washington also creates an incentive structure to spend more time in the capital and not back with voters in the district. Or to stay in Congress longer. The Swamp becomes a home and not simply the place of legislative business. And then it remains a home after they leave office, since this foothold makes transitioning to a new job on K street physically and mentally easier.\n\nAs noted, many members already sleep in their offices. This is essentially dorm living without the dorm, and some argue it\u2019s unseemly. Think about it: Do you want to meet with your representative next to the cot they slept on last night?\n\nBut my favorite reason for building Congress a dorm is simply fellowship. The comity in Washington is directly proportional to the amount of time elected officials spend with one another, and more specifically, with members of the opposite party. Nowadays, Democrats and Republicans are spending less and less time together, and it\u2019s one reason our politics have become so poisonous. If you want Washington to be less dysfunctional, then force members of Congress to get to know each other better.\n\nFor an added twist, how about making the room assignments explicitly with bipartisanship in mind? You\u2019re much less likely to attack a fellow member on a cable news panel if you\u2019re going to be splitting kitchen duties with them later that evening. And you may even come to find that while your political differences are stark, your humanity is mostly shared. Members representing coastal urban areas would benefit from living with a rural Midwestern representative and vice-versa, simply to understand the diversity of this nation better.\n\nThere\u2019s a famous yarn about Lyndon B. Johnson from his days as a new aide to a freshman member. Johnson rented a room at the Dodge Hotel and on his first night, took four showers in the shared bathroom and the next morning brushed his teeth five times, just so he could get to know the other aides.

Building a dorm for 535 members of Congress\u2014in theory, that\u2019s 535 fully grown adults\u2014sounds expensive.\n\nSecurity would and should be the first thought. You\u2019re creating another edifice for the U.S. Capitol Police to secure. But there is prime real estate within the already-secure Capitol complex, that could be built on, like the mostly useless park above the House office building garages.\n\nOn this spot, you could build a hotel-like building where any member could rent a room with a bathroom. Families could be offered larger suites or more temporary accommodations for short-term visits. Kitchens, eating areas and living spaces could be shared.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about building the Taj Mahal here. The budget could be sparse and paid for with minimal spending cuts elsewhere. The housing would be available for a very modest rent, and if you chose to live elsewhere, that would be fine, but you\u2019d be on your own financially. Taxpayers don\u2019t need to be subsidizing luxury high-rise condos if that\u2019s your preference.\n\nMembers of Congress will never build themselves housing so long as voters view it as self-enrichment. Perhaps it\u2019s better to think of this setup less as a benefit and more as a loose requirement of the job: We send you to Washington to spend your time there legislating and representing us, not becoming an advocate for your well-heeled neighbors in D.C.\u2019s posh enclaves.\n\nWant to drain The Swamp?

Consumers should also discard salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix and Caesar salad. Other types of greens, including iceberg lettuce, kale, spinach and arugula, are not part of the warning.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested the agency was taking quick action to try to prevent more illnesses, particularly before the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\"We want to get this information out to consumers early,\" he said.\n\nThe sweeping nature of the warning appears to break new ground. Federal health officials in the past have waited until they had more specific information before such a strong warning about a staple food was issued. The decision-making behind warnings of this type always involves striking a difficult balance between safeguarding public health and not wanting to decimate sales in a part of the food industry until there\u2019s conclusive evidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a broad warning, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Gottlieb told POLITICO, when asked about whether the warning was unprecedented in its reach, \u201cbut the truth of the matter is that this is likely isolated to one region.\u201d\n\nThe FDA believes California is most likely the source of the contaminated romaine, though there is also some product coming in from Mexico, Gottlieb said.\n\nCalifornia's Salinas Valley is known as America\u2019s salad bowl for growing an outsize portion of the country\u2019s greens and other vegetables.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position to prevent future cases of human illness,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cOur first mandate is to protect public health, fully recognizing that this is going to cause extreme hardship for growers and for consumers.\u201d\n\nSome food safety advocates praised the government for acting quickly.\n\n\u201cCDC and FDA did the right thing and gave a very broad warning to consumers. Hopefully they will find the source of the contamination and the cause quickly,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, director of food safety at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\n\u201cWe have seen so many leafy green outbreaks over the last year \u2014 it is really undermining consumer confidence in the safety of these otherwise healthy products,\u201d Eskin added.\n\nThe strain of E. coli O157:H7 in the current outbreak appears to be similar to a strain that caused an outbreak across the U.S. and Canada last year. In that outbreak, 25 people fell ill and one person died.\n\nPublic health officials were never able to pinpoint the source of last year's outbreak beyond tying it to \"leafy greens\" of some kind. There was no recall.\n\nGottlieb said the government is taking swift action this time because officials have much more information about the cause of the outbreak \u2014 and at a time when the product in question is likely still on the market.\n\nThe industry needs to improve its ability to track and trace product back to its source when problems arise, the FDA commissioner added.\n\nThe current outbreak is not believed to be related to another deadly E. coli outbreak earlier this year that was linked to romaine lettuce produced in the winter growing region around Yuma, Ariz. At least 210 people were sickened and five people died in that outbreak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: FDA\n\nAgriculture\n\nScott Gottlieb"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Jesus Rodriguez", "title": "Anti-immigrant activists in Tijuana hijack Trump\u2019s rhetoric", "description": "Demonstrators and local officials are embracing the U.S. president's nationalistic posture as they rail against the caravan.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/trump-immigration-rhetoric-1008218", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/aa/8c/d93847d742f08d243ba999bc3a1d/181120-migrants-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:31:22Z", "content": "More than 6,000 asylum-seekers who have been traveling in a caravan for over a month are arriving in Tijuana as they prepare to formally request asylum at the border. | John Moore/Getty Images A few hundred self-avowed nationalists waving flags at a demonstra\u2026 [+6405 chars]", "fulltext": "More than 6,000 asylum-seekers who have been traveling in a caravan for over a month are arriving in Tijuana as they prepare to formally request asylum at the border. | John Moore/Getty Images Immigration Anti-immigrant activists in Tijuana hijack Trump\u2019s rhetoric Demonstrators and local officials are embracing the U.S. president's nationalistic posture as they rail against the caravan.\n\nA few hundred self-avowed nationalists waving flags at a demonstration.

Anti-immigrant activists in Tijuana have hijacked the rhetoric of President Donald Trump to agitate against the caravan members, who are staying in temporary refugee shelters set up by local authorities.\n\nTrump for weeks cast the slow-moving caravan in the run-up to the midterms as a national security threat, warning without evidence that criminals and potential terrorists were in the mix. Two weeks after the midterms, the rhetoric seems to have stuck with a posse of tijuanenses who want the asylum-seekers out.\n\nThe local sentiment stands in stark contrast with the treatment the migrants received in southern Mexico, where towns doubled the size of their populations to give the Central Americans temporary refuge.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

That same morning, local residents woke up to a sign that migrants made and stretched between two palm trees that read, \"Gracias Mexico por su ayuda y cari\u00f1o\" \u2014 thank you Mexico for your help and kindness.\n\nJust a few days earlier, on Thursday, Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum had called into a television show and made his most jarring remark about the migrants yet: that \"human rights are for the right humans.\" He was later seen wearing a red hat embroidered with the phrase \"Make Tijuana Great Again.\"\n\n\"In this group of people there's a series of vicious people who are dedicated to other activities,\" Gast\u00e9lum said, raising the possibility that many of the \"undesirables,\" as he called them, are using drugs. \"I have to say there are some good people, [but also] some awful people for our city.\"\n\nGast\u00e9lum, who hailed Tijuana as a \"city of migrants,\" also accused the caravaneros of being rowdy and unclean. But on Saturday, they decided to organize themselves in small cleaning squads to sweep the city's streets block by block.\n\nTrump seized on Gast\u00e9lum's remarks Monday and fired off a tweet agreeing with the mayor's claim that a lack of resources to take the migrants in was a reason they should go back.\n\n\"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months,'\u201d wrote Trump, in reference to the interview. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. immigration authorities had temporarily closed the border to unravel more concertina wire in preparation for what Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen called a plan to rush the border from some of the asylum-seekers. It was unclear where the department received such a warning, and a Customs and Border Protection spokesman told POLITICO on Tuesday that \"both CBP and Mexican officials received the information from multiple sources.\"\n\nAnd then there's Paloma Zuniga, a dual Mexican-American citizen who has created a Facebook page called \"Paloma for Trump\" with a following of 32,000 users. She attended the march on Sunday, but before that, her string of Facebook posts railing against \"fake news\" and praising nationalism reveal a history of Trump devotion.\n\nWhen reports came out of Border Patrol agents fortifying the border, Zuniga was elated on Facebook: \"OMG MEXICO/US border POSSIBLY SHUT DOWN !!!!!\"\n\nBy Monday evening, after the military commander in charge of the U.S. troops deployed to the border told POLITICO the mission would begin winding down, she had a spot on Fox News.\n\n\"We should take of our Mexican people before we take care of anybody else, which is a very similar sentiment as Americans are having right now,\" Zuniga told Laura Ingraham during her nightly show, \"Ingraham Angle.\" \u201cTijuana people are terrified ... Tijuana will never be the same until these people leave.\"\n\nThe tensions appeared to have been sparked in part by the fact that for a brief period, the migrants who were arriving in Tijuana set up shop in the town's beach sector, displeasing locals and prompting a few residents to go to the area, where they began taunting the migrants. According to Mexican polling firms, over half of the population supports allowing the caravan to move freely through its territory, and another march in support of the asylum-seekers also took place on Sunday.\n\nThat public opinion of support has largely come to bear out in the government's response, even though local governments have variously rescinded offers of transportation made to the migrants and last week about 60 individuals traveling in a bus to Tijuana were taken from the bus into detention by immigration authorities.\n\nBut as the migrants waded through the small towns on their way northward, residents would often line the streets and toss bags of food at them. Local organizers say that while race and class divides may be driving some of the nativist sentiments \u2014 Latin America has had a deeply ingrained class hierarchy since colonial times \u2014 U.S. leaders are most at fault for stoking fears.\n\n\"Discrimination has always existed, [but] it becomes stronger not just through rhetoric, but through actions,\" said David Abud, a volunteer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which has accompanied the caravan since it left Honduras on Oct. 12. \"They closed the port of entry and blamed it on the migrants ... that generates rage and animosity against them.\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Sarah Zimmerman", "title": "Most turkeys only live a few months after a presidential pardon", "description": "Turkeys raised to be eaten are bred to be plump and tasty, but suffer health problems that advocates say amount to a sentence of premature death.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/trumps-turkey-pardon-isnt-much-of-a-pardon-at-all-985448", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/ee/56/116d5e4b418eb2bce5fadf229ac2/181120-donald-trump-turkey-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:41:12Z", "content": "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump participate in a ceremony to pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo A pardon from President Donald Trump ensures that this year's National Thanksgiving Turkey now known as Peas won\u2026 [+4285 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump participate in a ceremony to pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo Agriculture Most turkeys live only a few months after a presidential pardon\n\nA pardon from President Donald Trump ensures that this year's National Thanksgiving Turkey \u2014 now known as Peas \u2014 won't be anyone's dinner on Thursday, but it's unlikely he\u2019ll see another Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cThat turkey is so lucky.

Like other turkeys that are raised for human consumption, they\u2019ve been bred to be plump and tasty, but they grow so big that they are likely to suffer from a variety of health problems that put their lifespan at less than a year. Wild turkeys generally live three to five years.\n\nTake, for example, other previous, adorably named National Thanksgiving Turkeys and their alternates \u2014 \"Wishbone\" and \"Drumstick,\" \"Tater\" and \"Tot,\" \"Abe\" and \"Honest.\" Most lived for just a few months after being pardoned. Only Tater, pardoned by former President Barack Obama in 2016, \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d by living for two years, said Rami Dalloul, who helps care for post-pardon turkeys at Virginia Tech.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The pardoned birds clocked in at around 40 pounds each; wild turkeys typically weigh 20 to 30 pounds.\n\nCommercially bred turkeys are so large that their skeletons can\u2019t handle the extra weight, which renders them flightless. They also suffer from joint problems and can\u2019t reproduce naturally.\n\n\"Conventional turkeys are raised for consumption,\" said Beth Breeding, vice president of communications for the National Turkey Federation, which presents the pardoned turkeys to the president each year. \"Their lifespans can vary if not utilized for that purpose.\"\n\nTrump said Peas and Carrots were the first National Thanksgiving Turkeys that were raised in South Dakota. Their original names were Jeff and Ruben, according to a White House pool report. All 50 birds in this year\u2019s \"presidential flock\" were raised in Huron, South Dakota.\n\nSince June, the birds underwent various tests to see which could best handle being around large crowds, bright lights and loud music. They were fed a diet of corn and soybean meal to fatten them up with the expectation that nearly all of them would be sent to the dinner table. Peas and Carrots were the pick of the flock, and Peas won the right to be the official National Thanksgiving Turkey via an online poll.\n\nThe pair will now be under the care of Virginia Tech\u2019s Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences, and the school will pay for their food and medical care.\n\nDalloul, who is responsible for checking on the birds at Gobbler's Rest each day, said the presidential turkeys get to roam around campus and are commonly treated as celebrities, drawing crowds of admiring fans well after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nBut world-class care and veterinary attention can only do so much. \"We take really good care of them, and try to keep them around the same weight,\u201d Dalloul said. But, he added, \u201cthey don\u2019t have long life-expectancy because they\u2019re commercial birds.

That administration lacked money for family housing and faced a shortage of immigration judges that caused a years-long backlog for asylum seekers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said this year the asylum backlog reached a crisis point, ballooning nearly 2,000 percent over the past five years.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration tried to find some ways to stem the flow from Central America, but over time realized that there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Sandweg said. \u201cThe Trump administration tries to talk in simple ways, sound bites. But it\u2019s not simple.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling Monday, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco temporarily halted Trump\u2019s efforts to prohibit migrants who illegally cross the border from seeking asylum. \"Whatever the scope of the president's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" the judge wrote.\n\nTigar\u2019s order will remain in effect until Dec. 19, when the court will consider arguments for a permanent ban.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders blasted the ruling as \"yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences,\" saying the administration will \"take all necessary action.\" But she didn't say whether the Justice Department will appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a famously liberal court that has ruled against several of Trump\u2019s other immigration initiatives.\n\nThe outcome came as no surprise to immigration scholars, who noted that federal law explicitly allows border crossers to seek asylum no matter whether they come through a legal port of entry. The Trump administration\u2019s argument was so brazen, in fact, that many assumed its only goal was to whip up the Republican base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same rhetoric that we\u2019ve been hearing from this administration throughout \u2014 these liberal judges are blocking what the administration is trying to do, and we\u2019ve done everything we can do,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe they thought their maneuver was going to stand up to judicial scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe troops that Trump deployed, meanwhile, have run into a familiar issue: There\u2019s only so much for them to do at the border.\n\nFederal law prohibits the military from performing domestic law enforcement, and the Pentagon has not rushed to endorse Trump\u2019s suggestion that troops may return fire if any migrants throw rocks at them. Instead, the border deployment has included construction engineers and logisticians who have been erecting barriers near the ports of entry, as well as helicopter pilots, medical personnel and small \u201cquick response\u201d teams of engineers who could assist Border Patrol.\n\nOnce their duties are finished, the troops can begin heading home \u2014 something that could begin happening this week, Army Lt.

Jeffrey Buchanan told POLITICO on Monday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep these guys on just to keep them on,\u201d said Buchanan, who leads the land forces of U.S. Northern Command and is overseeing the deployment.\n\nHe added that all the troops should be home by Christmas, as originally expected. \u201cOur end date right now is 15 December, and I've got no indications from anybody that we'll go beyond that,\" he said.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Northern Command threw those estimates in doubt, issuing a terse statement that \u201cno specific timeline for redeployment has been determined.\u201d And rather than heading home, the statement said, some troops may be shifted from Texas to California as the caravans change direction.\n\n\u201cWe are continually assessing our resources and refining requirements in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe command issued no explanation for the shift in messages.\n\nTrump has not stopped his immigration efforts, of course, including demanding that congressional Democrats help provide billions of dollars for a border wall or risk a government shutdown just before Christmas.\n\nThe administration could direct more resources toward asylum that could speed up the process for migrants but has largely chosen not to, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a DHS official in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. The Justice Department has authority to redirect funds to hire more immigration judges, she said, and DHS could hasten the process for asylum claims, stationing staff at the border to take \u201ccredible fear\u201d statements from crossers before agents take them into custody.\n\nInstead, Trump officials have focused their effort on keeping asylum seekers out \u2014 an approach that often doesn\u2019t align with federal law.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach has been holding up the dike and saying \u2018Thou shalt not come,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t work with our legal system.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "tmeyer@politico.com (Theodoric Meyer)", "title": "Koch-backed advocacy groups for action during lame-duck session", "description": "Who is lobbying on the<i> </i>FIRST STEP Act", "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2018/11/20/koch-backed-advocacy-groups-for-action-during-lame-duck-session-423401", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:21:44Z", "content": "With Daniel Lippman, David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata PROGRAMMING NOTE: PI will not publish on Thursday, Nov. 22, and Friday, Nov. 23.

AFP\u2019s six-figure campaign includes a push for criminal justice reform and combating the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, while the LIBRE Initiative is pushing for a bipartisan solution for Dreamers.

PhRMA also gave $1.5 million to the American Action Network, a nonprofit closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, according to the trade group's IRS Form 990 tax filing. PhRMA's biggest single contribution was $3.87 million to the Addiction Policy Forum. It also gave $2.19 million to the nonprofit Addiction Policy Leadership Action Network, which are listed on the tax filing as sharing an address.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Addiction Policy Forum was launched in 2015. It was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year over questions about its ties to the drug industry. PhRMA President and CEO Stephen Ubl sits on the Forum's advisory board, along with the top executives of Alkermes and Indivior, which make opioid addiction treatments.

The industry group\u2019s efforts to raise doubts about the science have caused alarm among public health watchdogs who call them reminiscent of the tobacco industry\u2019s old playbook.\u201d Full story.\n\nINSIDE SAUDI ARABIA\u2019S PUBLIC RELATIONS PUSH IN NY: \u201cIn an apartment on New York City\u2019s Upper East Side, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most well-known diplomats stood in front of a crowd of 50 or so invite-only guests at a hush-hush, boozy soiree and tried to assuage worries about his country\u2019s rulers,\u201d the Daily Beast\u2019s Erin Banco writes. \u201cIt was Nov. 9 \u2014 more than a month after the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 and Turki al-Faisal, the kingdom\u2019s former intelligence chief, faced a slew of questions about his country\u2019s role in the operation in Istanbul. He\u2019d spoken publicly since the news broke, but this time, his audience was much more intimate. It included colleagues and writers, journalists, politicos, and think-tankers, many of whom attended political parties with him in the past.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhile it is normal for Saudi Arabian diplomats to hold meetings with influential individuals in media and politics under ordinary circumstances, the intimate cocktail party seems to have been Faisal\u2019s latest attempt to boost Saudi\u2019s image in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 2. Over the past month, Riyadh has attempted to manage the fallout of the Khashoggi murder and the subsequent international condemnation behind the scenes, enlisting well-known and respected dignitaries like Faisal to make amends\u2026 For the past several weeks, the diplomat, who lives in Virginia and teaches at Georgetown, has embarked on a campaign to reach out to politicians, businessmen, and think-tank leaders to restore relationships the Kingdom relies on to keep its voice alive in Washington. He\u2019s spoken publicly to news outlets and on panels. The party Nov. 9 marked the second time in the last month that the diplomat spoke to a small, exclusive group.\u201d Full story.\n\nDEMOCRATS PLAN AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT OF FEC: \u201cFor most of this decade, Congress has all but ignored the perpetually gridlocked Federal Election Commission, which exists to enforce and regulate the nation\u2019s campaign finance laws,\u201d the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s Dave Levinthal and Ashley Balcerzak report. \u201cNo longer, two Democratic congressional representatives tell the Center for Public Integrity. The bipartisan FEC is broken and needs fixing, they argue. \u2018In the next Congress, we will be conducting aggressive oversight and pursuing legislative reform so we can finally have an FEC that\u2019s fulfilling its mission of fighting corruption,\u2019 said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a member and potential chairwoman next year of the Committee on House Administration, which has jurisdiction over the FEC. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., concurred. ...

Regardless, Fudge is now tied to a criminal case that is dominating headlines back in Cleveland.\n\nMason previously served nine months in prison for beating up Fraser, a sixth-grade teacher, in front of their daughters.

I pray for Aisha\u2019s family, especially her children, as they attempt to deal with this tragedy,\u201d Fudge said in her statement. \u201cMy support of Lance in 2015 was based on the person I knew for almost 30 years \u2014 an accomplished lawyer, prosecutor, state legislator and judge. That\u2019s the Lance Mason I supported. The person who committed these crimes is not the Lance Mason familiar to me. They were horrific crimes, and I condemn them.\u201d\n\nMason had been working for the city of Cleveland as a minority business development administrator before his arrest.\n\nIn the 2014 case of domestic violence, Mason repeatedly punched Fraser in the head and slammed her face against a car dashboard, an attack that occurred in front of the couple\u2019s two young children, according to news reports. Fraser was severely injured and required facial reconstructive surgery.\n\nAt the time, Fudge wrote a letter to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutors Office on Mason\u2019s behalf, Dan DeRoos, a local Cleveland reporter, noted in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Fudge served as director of that office before being elected to Congress in 2008.\n\nIn the letter, dated Aug. 9, 2015, Fudge said her view of Mason had been shaped by two decades of friendship.\n\n\u201cThe Lance T. Mason that I know is a kind, intelligent man and loyal friend,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cThe Lance T. Mason that I know is an advocate for the people of his community.

Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2013 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2013 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm.

A bill released Tuesday morning by Sen. Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to reduce U.S. drug prices takes a cue from Trump\u2019s recent proposal to reduce Medicare drug costs -- both proposals seek to lower U.S. drug costs by tying them to international prices. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe proposed legislation stands almost no chance of gaining traction in a Republican-controlled Senate and is sure to face stiff opposition from the drug industry. But its similarities to Trump\u2019s far narrower proposal for drugs administered as part of the Medicare Part B program speaks to the mounting pressure on both parties to address drug costs.\u201d POLITICO\n\nMIDTERM RECAP -- \u201cHow a Blue Wave Wiped Out Republicans in the Largest County in Texas,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Dan Frosch in Houston: \u201cAn energized Democratic electorate wasn\u2019t enough to defeat Texas Sen. Ted Cruz this month, but in the state\u2019s most populous county, it created a blue landslide. Nearly every Republican in Harris County, home to Houston, was unseated on Nov. 6, including 59 judges and the top executive, Ed Emmett, a moderate who won in 2014 with 83% of the vote. \u2026\n\n\u201cMore than 75% of ballots cast in Harris County were straight-ticket votes, according to the county clerk\u2019s office. Roughly 55% of those went to Democrats, giving local Republicans little chance on a lengthy ballot with more than 90 races. ... Last year, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation ending straight-ticket voting in Texas beginning in 2020.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- FROM FLORIDA PLAYBOOK -- per Daniel Lippman: \u201cGina Loudon \u2014 the Trump surrogate and conservative TV personality known as \u2018Dr. Gina\u2019 \u2014 was spotted wearing a lanyard that said \u2018Republican Attorney\u2019 at the recount in Broward County last week. But she\u2019s not an attorney. She even posted two nearly identical pictures on Instagram wearing the badge, posing shoulder to shoulder next to RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. What\u2019s ironic is this is the second time that Loudon has attracted attention for a credential she doesn\u2019t actually have.\n\n\u201cThe Daily Beast reported in September that the jacket bio on her recent book said she had a \u2018Ph.D in psychology,\u2019 when she actually has a Ph.D. in \u2018human and organization systems\u2019 from the online school Fielding Graduate University. A GOP official told POLITICO that the badges that were sent down to Broward had a disproportionate number that said \u2018attorney\u2019 vs. \u2018observer\u2019. \u2026 \u2018I think the wrong shipping came down honestly. ... 95 percent of the people that showed up got an attorney credential\u2019 even though fewer than 2 percent of the approximately 150 or so Republican observers were actually attorneys.\u201d POLITICO\n\nON THE WORLD STAGE -- \u201cVeteran Russian Official Nominated for Interpol Presidency,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Amy Simmons in Moscow: \u201cInterpol confirmed that a veteran Russian Interior Ministry official and a South Korean police commissioner had both been nominated to become its next president, amid allegations that Moscow has used the international police agency to go after political foes.\n\n\u201cThe nomination of South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-yang and Russia\u2019s Maj.

The new law has attracted attention in policy circles because it\u2019s the most specific thing the Trump administration has done to help \u2018left behind\u2019 areas, and could cost more than $1 billion a year, at least initially.

Only a day after the elections, Trump fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and more top officials are expected to follow.\n\nHere are some of the Cabinet hot seats, and a rundown of who is waiting in the wings.\n\n\n\nAttorney General\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSessions' relationship with Trump grew testy after the former attorney general recused himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election. The new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, has voiced skepticism over the Mueller investigation, prompting calls from both sides of the aisle to find a permanent replacement soon.\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 Chris Christie: The former New Jersey governor was the first prominent Republican to back Trump in 2016 and was a high contender for AG before Sessions was appointed.\n\n\u2022 Alex Acosta: The Washington Post reported in March that Trump mused about making Acosta attorney general after seeing the labor secretary on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d But Acosta said he\u2019s hesitant to take the job before Mueller\u2019s report is released.\n\n\u2022 Bill Barr: Trump's team contacted Barr, a veteran attorney general from the George H.W. Bush administration, for the role, but he suggested they look at other options. Still, he didn't say no.\n\n\u2022 Mark Filip: Filip, another more traditional option, served as deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u2022 Kris Kobach: When Kansas Secretary of State Kobach ran for governor this year, Trump said on the he hopes he loses so he can join his administration. Kobach did lose, freeing him up for the job, but at least one informal adviser doubts he would be ready for the job.\n\n\u2022 Matthew Whitaker: It's a long-shot given the outcry over his initial appointment, but The Washington Post reported Trump toyed with making Whitaker a permanent replacement weeks before he pushed out Sessions.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security Secretary\n\nRumors have been circulating that Kristjen Nielsen will likely be out soon. Trump has expressed frustration with Nielsen\u2019s handling of his immigration policies, and her replacement will likely take a tough stance on immigration.\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 Thomas Homan: As former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and an immigration hawk who has defended separating families at the border, Homan would be a prime pick to energize Trump's base.\n\n\u2022 Kevin McAleenan: The current commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, McAleenan has been tasked with finding locations and designs for Trump's border wall.\n\n\u2022 Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese: Coglianese currently runs the Marine Corps Installations Command, and being on active duty could bar him from taking the job. But he is ideologically aligned with Trump.\n\n\n\nChief of Staff\n\nIf Nielsen is out, many believe John Kelly could soon follow. The chief of staff has been one of Nielsen\u2019s closest allies and would likely quit on his own if Nielsen were to go, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nPotential replacement:\n\n\u2022 Nick Ayers: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff has already curried favor within the Trump family and has emerged the leading candidate to replace Kelly at only 36 years old.\n\n\n\nCommerce Secretary\n\nWilbur Ross may deny rumors that he\u2019ll leave the administration any time soon, but those within the Trump orbit say he may be out as soon as January. Ross has played a role in trade negotiations with China, and his replacement would oversee the 2020 census.\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 Mick Mulvaney: Mulvaney, who currently serves as head of the Office of Management and Budget, previously made a bid for White House chief of staff. But now he's speaking openly of becoming Ross' successor.\n\n\u2022 Linda McMahon: Before joining Trump's cabinet as small business administration administrator, McMahon was a wrestling tycoon who helped turn WWE into a global brand \u2014 a feat Trump viewed as a qualification for her current position.\n\n\u2022 Ray Washburne: A major Republican donor, Washburne initially supported Christie's presidential bid before the New Jersey governor conceded to Trump. Washburne now serves as the president and CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a government entity.\n\n\u2022 Karen Dunn Kelly: Currently serving as undersecretary for economic affairs at Commerce, Kelly is vying within the department to claim the top job. An agency spokesperson denied that Kelly was jockeying for the position.\n\n\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nRyan Zinke is being investigated for possible ethics violations following a POLITICO report that he maintained ties to a real estate deal with the chairman of Halliburton. Zinke has also garnered a reputation for lavishly spending taxpayer dollars.\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 David Bernhardt: Zinke could name his own heir, passing the baton to his deputy secretary, a long-time lobbyist who will likely continue Trump\u2019s anti-regulatory policies.\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary\n\nJim Mattis has long clashed with Trump, offering more moderate views than the president had hoped. Trump called him \u201csort of a Democrat\u201d during an interview on \u201c60-Minutes\u201d and said \u201cat some point, everybody leaves.\"\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 Tom Cotton: The Republican senator from Arkansas is one of Trump's fiercest supporters. But Cotton said he isn't interested in the job and has already announced his bid for reelection in 2020.\n\n\u2022 Lindsey Graham: A similarly hawkish Republican senator, Graham proved his loyalty to Trump during the tumultuous confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But Graham hasn't expressed much interest in the position.\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Ambassador\n\nNikki Haley announced in October she would resign from her post at the end of the year. In her resignation letter, Haley insisted she won\u2019t challenge Trump in 2020 for the presidency.\n\nPotential replacements:\n\n\u2022 Heather Nauert: A former Fox News host, Nauert now serves as the State Department's spokeswoman and acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.\n\n\u2022 Kelly Knight Craft: Currently serving as ambassador to Canada, Craft has prior U.N. experience as an alternate delegate during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u2022 Jamie McCourt: McCourt served as California co-chair for the Trump campaign and is currently deployed as ambassador to France and Monaco.\n\n\u2022 Ric Grenell: A U.S. ambassador in Europe serving in Germany, Grenell also has U.N. experience working as a U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the Bush administration."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "jarkin@politico.com (James Arkin)", "title": "Embattled Hyde-Smith posted photo of herself in Confederate hat", "description": "'Mississippi history at its best,' she said after a 2014 visit to a Mississippi museum where she posed for a picture she put on Facebook.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/hyde-smith-confederate-hat-picture-1008010", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/af/82/0e2cd3f74a99b448134ac71481f7/181120-cindy-hyde-smith-2-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:58:27Z", "content": "Several companies, including Walmart, requested that their donations to Sen.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe world \"may never know\" the truth, Trump concluded.\n\nThe remarkable statement \u2014 populated with numerous exclamation points and punchy asides \u2014 was a case study in Trump\u2019s worldview. It painted Iran as the predominant threat in the Middle East and stressed the importance of financial considerations in making strategic alliances.\n\nSeemingly dictated by Trump himself, Tuesday\u2019s statement was also an ode to the nationalism the president espouses. He began his remarks by describing the world as \u201ca very dangerous place,\u201d acknowledged the \u201cterrible\u201d crime against Khashoggi, but stressed the importance of remaining \u201ca steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia\u201d to promote American interests.\n\nHours later, when leaving the White House for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump told reporters the approach is \"all about America first. We're not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China and everybody else have them. It\u2019s all about, for me, very simple, America first.\"\n\nIt's a theme he hammered repeatedly in the short gaggle with reporters.\n\n\"It\u2019s about make America great again, it's about America first,\" he said. \"We're going to stay with Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nTo his critics, it's a world view that prioritizes deal-making over human rights. To his backers, it's a pragmatic realism that prioritizes American citizens.\n\nBipartisan opposition rose against the president\u2018s statement on Tuesday night, with the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee invoking a law that will force Trump to say whether the crown prince is behind Khashoggi\u2018s murder.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the panel\u2018s chairman, and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member, made their request through the Magnitsky Act, a law that can require Trump to determine whether world leaders violated human rights and, if they did, allows for sanctions previously named by the pair.\n\nCorker, who is retiring, returned to his old form as a Trump agitator by adding on Twitter: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\u201c\n\nThe president is also facing opposition from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has golfed with the president but who is echoing his long-held skepticism of U.S. foreign policy toward the kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the US won\u2019t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree,\u201c Paul tweeted.\n\nJust days ahead of the G-20 summit in Argentina later this month, which both Trump and bin Salman will attend, the president praised the Middle Eastern power for committing to invest $450 billion in the United States \u2014 a figure that experts have questioned.\n\n\u201cThis is a record amount of money,\" Trump said. \"It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States.\"\n\nAs of October, the Saudis had only followed through on $14.5 billion in arms purchases.\n\nWhen asked by reporters whether he would meet with the crown prince at the G-20 summit, Trump said, \"I would, yeah.\"\n\nThe eight-paragraph missive comes as Trump faces pressure from across the political spectrum to further punish Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing. The White House recently sanctioned 17 Saudis, including some high level officials, accused of being responsible for the killing. But Trump's statement indicated no more punishment was in the works.\n\nIn a press conference shortly after Trump issued his statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the president was making the \"commitment\" that \"the United States will continue to have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe response has rattled even some within Trump's own party.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a government-to-government, institutional relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to have a Trump-Kushner, family-to-family relationship with the King and MBS, that\u2019s not how a democratic republic does business,\u201d said Eric Edelman, former undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration, referring to the close relationship between the crown prince, often called MBS, and Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nTrump's memo bore similarities to how Trump reacted in the initial days following reports of Khashoggi\u2019s death: jumping to defend Saudi Arabia and leaving the tough language to his secretary of State, while carefully declining to declare the crown prince culpable.\n\n\u201cHere we go again with you\u2019re guilty until proven innocent,\u201d he told the Associated Press two weeks after Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where his murder occurred.\n\nSaudi officials have offered shifting stories about Khashoggi\u2019s death since early October, when the Washington Post columnist was killed in a Saudi embassi in Istanbul. The latest explanation came last Thursday, when the country\u2019s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, described the murder in remarks last Thursday as a \u201ctremendous mistake,\u201d but maintained that the crown prince had zero involvement.\n\nIn mid-October, the state-run Saudi Press Agency also threatened retaliation against any sanctions, responding to Trump\u2019s assertion that Riyadh might face \u201csevere punishment\" over the incident.\n\nWhile Trump's Tuesday remarks would indicate that he is done penalizing Saudi Arabia, the president acknowledged that members of Congress might press him to take a harsher stance \u201cfor political or other reasons.\u201d\n\nThe president said he would \u201cconsider whatever ideas are presented to me [by Congress], but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America.\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats swiftly took up the president's challenge Tuesday afternoon, vowing to revive legislation that would punish Saudi Arabia for its involvement in an ongoing war in Yemen, and forcing the intelligence community to release its conclusions regarding Khashoggi's death.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s habit of siding with murderous foreign dictators over American intelligence professionals is a stain on our democracy that undermines the American ideal,\u201d said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who has previously backed legislation that would put pressure on the Saudis and Trump administration to reduce their involvement in Yemen's civil war.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, threatened legislation if intelligence leaders refuse to \"state publicly ... what the U.S. Intelligence Community believes about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Khashoggi's employer, The Washington Post, called Trump's reaction to the situation \"a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights.\"\n\nTrump's equivocating regarding the crown prince's involvement in Khashoggi's murder comes after the Washington Post \u2014 followed by several other media outlets \u2014 reported last Friday that the CIA had already concluded the young leader did play a key role.\n\nTrump, however, appeared to suggest that the intelligence probe remained incomplete. The president had said he would receive an intelligence assessment on the issue Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated the point later in the day to reporters.\n\n\"They didn't make a determination,\" he said of the CIA.\n\nIn his own remarks, Pompeo said the government had made an \"enormous effort\" on \"fact finding\" regarding Khashoggi's death.\n\nBut he declined to comment on what the CIA had concluded about the crown prince's culpability.\n\n\"Facts will obviously still continue to come to light,\" Pompeo said. \"I\u2019m confident of that. It\u2019s the way the world works.\"\n\nEliana Johnson, Elana Schor and Burgess Everett contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "eschor@politico.com (Elana Schor)", "title": "House ethics panel makes bipartisan push for deal on Hill harassment reform", "description": "&quot;The reforms we have advocated have overwhelming bipartisan support in the House,&quot; the ethics committee's members wrote.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/congress-harassment-reform-deal-1007649", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/a6/37/a1ba65e64555b509ebda2a588fe8/181120-capitol-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:27:00Z", "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a hopeful note last week about the prospects for reaching a final agreement before Congress recesses for the year sometime next month. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images The House ethics committee's 10 members on Tuesday\u2026 [+1998 chars]", "fulltext": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a hopeful note last week about the prospects for reaching a final agreement before Congress recesses for the year sometime next month. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images Congress House ethics panel makes bipartisan push for deal on Hill harassment reform\n\nThe House ethics committee's 10 members on Tuesday called for a final deal this year on overhauling Capitol Hill's sexual misconduct system, a nudge that comes after months of stalled talks on reconciling the House and Senate's approaches.\n\nIn a letter to House and Senate leaders in both parties, the ethics panel's GOP and Democratic members lauded the Hill misconduct legislation that the House passed in February \u2014 amid multiple sexual harassment scandals that ended careers on both sides of the aisle.

NTSB: Federal railroad regulators are pushing ahead with a nonbinding safety advisory for railroads operating with suspended track signals, despite concerns from NTSB, unions and other experts that it doesn\u2019t go far enough, your host reported Monday. The finalized advisory from FRA, published in the Federal Register today, outlines best practices and gives recommendations following a fatal crash earlier this year in South Carolina where signals had been suspended for positive train control testing. NTSB had commented on a draft version of the advisory, warning that it doesn\u2019t adequately ensure safety because it doesn\u2019t require railroads to take action.\n\nExpert\u2019s take: Rail consultant David Schanoes said he doesn\u2019t think the safety advisory, without any requirements attached, is sufficient \u201cwith the risk of life and limb at stake.\u201d He gave the example of an incident from his former employer, New York's Metro North Railroad (which occurred after he had left to start his own firm). A train going over the speed limit crashed in the Bronx, killing four people. FRA issued a safety advisory recommending that railroads check their territories for areas where rapid decelerations were required, Schanoes said. Two years later, an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, which led to another safety advisory, which was later followed by another speeding crash in Dupont, Washington. \u201c99.99 times out of 100, everything\u2019s going to go well.

Officials from Ireland to Australia cast a wary eye at the statutory rate cut \u2014 to 21 percent from 35 percent \u2014 and other international tax changes that took effect this year under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). Not only did they worry it would make their countries less attractive for U.S. investment, but they also feared it may make the U.S. a more attractive destination for their own companies.\n\nOne sign that some of that is happening emerged recently in a report by a U.N. economic agency, which found that repatriation of profits by U.S. multinationals drove a 41 percent plunge in global foreign direct investment in the first half of 2018. Another: The European Commission warned earlier this month that the economic outlook for one of the major destinations of U.S. corporate investment, Ireland, \u201cis subject to significant uncertainties related, inter alia, to changes in the international taxation and trade environment. A large degree of unpredictability remains linked to the activities of multinationals, which could drive headline growth either up or down.\u201d Yahoo Finance reported that U.S. investment in Ireland slid by $51 billion in 2017.\n\nSome countries are trying to meet the threat head-on. On Wednesday, Canada\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, is \u201cexpected to announce accelerated ability for Canadian firms to deduct capital spending, stopping short of 100 percent expensing as in the U.S.,\u201d POLITCO Pro Canada\u2019s Luiza Savage reports.

Economic development boosters in rural areas are worrying that most of the benefits of the Opportunity Zones created by the new tax law will flow to urban areas. \u201cWhen it does flow to rural places, they warn, it\u2019s more likely to flow to real estate projects \u2026 rather than to local startups desperate for capital,\u201d Stateline reports. Paul Major, who heads the Telluride Foundation, a philanthropy that focuses on Western Colorado, told the publication, \u201cYou can see 99 percent of the money going to urban redevelopment projects and accelerating gentrification.\u201d\n\n\u201cPast tax incentives intended to spur growth in distressed areas, such as the New Markets Tax Credit program, have had mixed success,\u201d Stateline says. \u201cAbout 83 percent of New Markets money from 2001 to 2015 went to cities, according to research by Rebecca Lester, an assistant professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who studies tax policy.\u201d\n\nSALT IN THE WOUNDS: Did the TCJA\u2019s cap on the state and local tax deduction help deliver the House to Democrats? \u201cDemocrats won 10 of the 20 Republican-held districts where the largest proportion of taxpayers claim the deduction, including seats in California, Virginia and New Jersey,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cSome Democratic challengers in those districts criticized the SALT limit on the campaign trail.\u201d But there are some caveats to consider. Most Republicans in those districts were vulnerable anyway, given President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the suburbs. And some of them voted against the TCJA and lost their races anyway. Still, the SALT cap probably didn\u2019t help.\n\nGENERATION TAX: At a time when seemingly no one can agree on anything across party lines, millennials are united in who they think should be carrying the biggest tax load. \u201cDemocrat or Republican, Millennials across the board feel that high-net worth individuals and large corporations should carry more of the burden of taxes \u2013 64% of Millennials in 2018 think high-net worth individuals are not paying enough,\u201d Ernst & Young said after surveying 1,202 members of that generation. But they are split when it comes to their view of how the TCJA affects those groups. Among millennials identifying as Democrats, 70 percent said large corporations would pay less, compared to 46 percent of Republicans. And 72 percent of Democrats said high-net-worth individuals would pay less, while only 39 percent of Republicans did. What about how the law will affect them personally? Twenty-seven percent think their taxes will go up, 26 percent think they will go down and 39 percent think they will stay the same. Millennials are an amorphous group. EY surveyed 20- to 36-year-olds.\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nCALIFORNIA DREAMIN\u2019: Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom wants to insulate California from the revenue boom-and-bust cycle that can result from the state\u2019s reliance on the wealthiest 1 percent of earners to pay 50 percent of its personal income taxes. \u201cAmong a laundry list of other big and ambitious policy goals, the Democratic governor-elect has expressed interest in revising the state tax structure,\u201d the Sacramento Bee reports. \u201cWith revenues booming and a historic Democratic supermajority elected for the next legislative session, this may be his best chance.\u201d But liberals might resist, concerned \u201cthat any changes will push more of the tax burden onto lower-income residents.\u201d So far, Newsom hasn't provided any details. California hasn\u2019t overhauled its tax system since 1935, the Bee notes.\n\nLOOK OUT, HOOSIER SMOKERS: Indiana has one of the lowest cigarette taxes in the nation, despite having one of the largest concentration of smokers. A coalition of health and business groups is out to change that, pushing state lawmakers to boost the tax by $2 a pack, which would put the total at around $3. \u201cThe Raise It for Health Coalition held a rally last week at the Statehouse and 14 other events around the state to launch its latest campaign for the tax hike,\u201d the Associated Press reported. The group says the tax hike \u201cwould raise more than $350 million to invest in Indiana's workforce, improve its business climate and reduce tobacco use.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nIS THAT A THREAT? A top Google executive would not rule out shutting down Google News in the EU if Brussels imposes a \u201clink tax.\u201d Richard Gingras, the tech giant\u2019s VP of News, told the Guardian \u201cthat the future of Google News could depend on whether the EU was willing to alter the phrasing of the legislation. \u2018We can\u2019t make a decision until we see the final language,\u2019 he said.\u201d The tax would require Google and other online aggregators to compensate publishers for articles that appear in search results on their news pages. \u201cIn Spain, Google closed its news service in 2014 because of a similar requirement for it to pay royalties to Spanish publishers,\u201d CNBC notes. \u201c\u2026However, as Spain is a much smaller jurisdiction than the EU as a whole, there are doubts about whether Google would take such action.\"\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nBreaking down the lessons of the quest for Amazon\u2019s HQ2.\n\nTax fraud convict to CNBC: Don\u2019t call me a hacker.\n\nInspector general says IRS falls short on some taxpayer protections following data breaches.\n\nState tax collections surged 6.2 percent in 2017.\n\nDeFazio sees possible Dem-Trump cooperation on raising gas tax.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe top five U.S. Google searches in 2017 were \u201cHurricane Irma,\u201d \u201cMatt Lauer,\u201d \u201cTom Petty,\u201d \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d and \u201cLas Vegas shooting.\u201d A lot of folks also wanted to know how many calories there were in a Unicorn Frappuccino.\n\nCORRECTION: The Nov. 19 edition of Morning Tax gave an incorrect figure for losses Donald Trump claimed in 1995.

Meanwhile, Mexico defended USMCA\u2019s new LGBT provisions that more than three dozen House Republicans want removed. And the European Union says Brussels is not ready to negotiate a full-fledged free trade agreement with the U.S. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nMEXICAN ENVOY EXPECTS TARIFFS DEAL THIS MONTH: Trump is expected to agree to a deal to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada before the three countries sign their new trilateral trade agreement at the end of this month, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. said late on Monday.\n\n\"It is the expectation that by the time of the signing there will be either a solution or a very clear track that gives enough certainty to all parties that a solution is coming,\" Mexican Ambassador Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez told reporters. That would clear the way for Ottawa and Mexico City to remove the retaliatory tariffs it imposed against roughly $15 billion in U.S. exports.\n\nThe quota question: It remains unclear whether the deal would involve exchanging the tariffs for quotas, which would limit the amount of each material that Canada and Mexico would send to the United States each year tariff-free, or whether the U.S.\u2019s two North American partners would escape penalties entirely. Guti\u00e9rrez said he did not have precise details on the status of the talks.\n\nCritics of the tariffs in Congress and in the private sector have argued that quotas \u2014 which countries like Argentina and South Korea have agreed to in exchange for relief \u2014 would still be harmful, potentially even more so than the duties.\n\nMark your calendars: Guti\u00e9rrez also confirmed that the three countries will sign the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement during the upcoming G-20 Leaders Summit next week in Buenos Aires, Argentina. But it remains unclear whether Trump and his counterparts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, will sign the deal or whether their top trade officials will hold the pen. More from Doug Palmer here.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire: Nearly three dozen prominent business, agricultural and manufacturing groups sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday urging him to remove steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and Mexico before the USMCA is signed. They warned that failure to do so would jeopardize the pact\u2019s chances of passing in Congress and runs counter to the goals of the new agreement. More on that here.\n\nIT'S TUESDAY, NOV. 20!

Mexico and Canada strongly pushed for the LGBT provisions to be included.\n\n\u201cMexico's goal was to create a more inclusive agreement and we did it,\u201d Smith Ramos tweeted. \u201cThe three #NAFTA partners realized that in order to create a consensus in favor of #trade agreements, state-of-the-art and progressive disciplines that encompass economic and social issues needed to be included in the new agreement.\u201d\n\nHolding firm: The tweets come just days after POLITICO reported that the new LGBT provisions have drawn the ire of 40 House conservatives, who are now pushing for the Trump administration to change the agreement before sending it to Congress. One congressman warned that the issue could be a \u201cdeal-killer.\u201d\n\nU.S.-CHINA TRADE TALKS SLATED FOR BUENOS AIRES: American and Chinese trade negotiators are scheduled to sit down in Buenos Aires at the end of the month, a change from a previous plan of holding talks in Washington ahead of the G-20.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported Monday night that Vice Premier Liu He, China's chief trade negotiator and the top economic aide to President Xi Jinping, changed his plan to come to D.C. after \u201cwork-level discussions\u201d between Beijing and Washington. The change was partly intended to ensure the talks will have a more direct effect on the subsequent meeting between Xi and Trump, a source said, and it will likely raise the stakes for the leaders\u2019 discussions. Full story is here.\n\nTHE FREE TRADER IN TRUMP\u2019S WHITE HOUSE: National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow says he has notched a few wins in his quest to push a free-trade message in the Trump White House \u2014 but he also knows his limits.\n\n\"If the president is going to apply tariffs, let's say on China, he's going to do it. And you know, it might not be my first choice, but you know what? The Chinese have been so intransigent,\" Kudlow said in this week's POLITICO Money podcast. \"I know I'm a free-trader. But they're not \u2014 this is different. This is different. This isn't free trade.\" Listen here.\n\nEU: DEAL WITH U.S. WON\u2019T EVEN BE \u2018TTIP LITE\u2019: The Trump administration has already put Congress on alert that it plans to engage in formal trade-deal negotiations with the European Union, but Brussels is pushing back against that idea. EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said Monday that the EU is \u201cnot going to make a free trade agreement with the U.S.,\u201d not even a \u201cTTIP lite\u201d \u2014 a reference to the broad Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that the U.S. and EU were negotiating until talks were put in a deep freeze in late 2016.\n\nInstead, the nascent talks that can formally begin as soon as mid-January will be aimed at reaching \u201ca very limited agreement on industrial goods only,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m said.\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m walks the tightrope: She added that if Brussels were to negotiate a full-fledged free trade agreement, then the EU would have to insist that the U.S. rejoin the Paris climate agreement before talks get off the ground.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: The European Commission has repeatedly said that the planned industrial tariffs agreement between the two trading partners needs to cover about 90 percent of bilateral trade, because WTO rules say any trade agreement must cover \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d between countries. Since Malmstr\u00f6m and the Commission portray themselves as the guardians of the multilateral system, they can\u2019t ignore that rule.\n\nIn other words, Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s \u201cvery limited agreement\u201d is actually very substantial, or no agreement at all.\n\nPOLITICO Pro PROVIDES DEDICATED CALIFORNIA COVERAGE: There is a new authority on California politics and policy.

Bernd Lange, the European Parliament\u2019s trade committee chairman, said American officials told him that \u201cthunder is coming\u201d if Brussels does not bow to American trade demands such as agriculture and car quotas.\n\nLange said the main priority of Trump\u2019s trade policy, besides cracking down on China, was the \u201cbreaking down of global value chains and the relocation of production in the U.S.,\u201d which is particularly relevant to the automotive industry.\n\n\u201cThis will also be reflected in their negotiating interests\u201d with Brussels, Lange warned. \u201cThis can\u2019t be accepted by the European Union.\u201d\n\nEU TAKES METAL TARIFFS FIGHT TO THE WTO: Brussels is also hard-pressed on challenging Trump\u2019s duties on steel and aluminum at the World Trade Organization, even if such a move would risk provoking an existential crisis for the global trading body. More here.\n\nKOCH GROUP LAUNCHES THANKSGIVING CAMPAIGN TO OPPOSE TARIFFS: Americans for Prosperity, a pro-free trade Koch network group, launched a mail campaign this week to urge a bipartisan group of lawmakers to oppose the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. The group is sending cards encouraging Americans to call certain lawmakers to ask them \u201cto support U.S. jobs by opposing harmful tariffs and supporting American trade.\u201d The campaign targets Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Reps. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) and Will Hurd (R-Texas). AFP is also offering thanks to a group of more than 20 lawmakers who \u201chave held their ground against\u201d the tariffs.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 Tension between Vice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit over the weekend shows that Beijing should be preparing for tough talks ahead of the meeting with Trump at the G-20, the South China Morning Post reports.\n\n\u2014 A new paper shows China is paying for most of Trump\u2019s trade war, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u2014 Qatar is ramping up a trade dispute against Saudi Arabia over an alleged intellectual property violation, Reuters reports.\n\n\u2014 Despite the trade war, U.S. companies don\u2019t appear to be in a hurry to leave China, CNBC reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

But her new role heading Manatt, Phelps and Phillips\u2019 venture capital fund is more complex: applying what she\u2019s learned to areas such as financial technology, digital media and education. POLITICO chatted with Suennen, formerly of GE Ventures, about her current health tech interests, including voice-controlled health assistants, venture-backed primary care businesses, and what major health deals such as the CVS-Aetna acquisition could mean for patients. Pros can read our Q&A here.\n\nFDA ROLLS OUT NEW RX-USE-APP PAPER: Many apps that offer information about prescription drug use wouldn\u2019t require FDA approval before going on the market, the agency proposed in a new concept paper Monday.\n\nApps offering or tracking basic information, such as symptom trackers, wouldn\u2019t require agency pre-approval, but would need to meet post-market requirements for promotional drug labeling. But apps offering significant changes to clinical outcomes would likely require more review. The agency thinks most of these apps would fit the former category.\n\nProducts that have already been reviewed by the agency\u2019s device center likely wouldn\u2019t face scrutiny from the drug office.\n\nDevelopers had long griped about differences in standards between the agency\u2019s drug and device offices, and the proposal \u2014 a prelude to later draft guidance \u2014 addresses that.\n\nBradley Merrill Thompson of Epstein, Becker and Green said he was glad the agency was starting to address the subject, but he still expressed significant reservations. The proposal only covers apps developed by drug sponsors in conjunction with their products, and Thompson says that independent companies need attention too.\n\n\u201cIt is, though, nice to see the agency start to publish anything on software used with pharmaceutical products,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe just hope that we will see more soon.\u201d Pros can read Darius\u2019s story on the topic here.\n\n...Speaking of apps, Pear Therapeutics and Novartis on Monday announced the commercial launch of an app they say is the first FDA-authorized prescription digital therapeutic intended to help with the treatment of substance use disorder.

Will Hurd, a leading congressional voice on tech policy issues, secured reelection in his Texas border district as his Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones conceded defeat following two weeks of uncertainty about the outcome, our POLITICO colleague Cristiano Lima reports.\n\nAs chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on information technology, Hurd has called for the government to upgrade its aging computer systems and modernize its approach to AI. He has also been a major advocate for bolstering federal cybersecurity.\n\nLast April, Hurd introduced a bill, H.R. 2227 (115) aimed at creating a fund to boost federal IT investment. It was eventually included in a defense measure, H.R. 2810 (115), which was signed into law by President Donald Trump last year.\n\nHurd was initially declared the winner by the Associated Press on election night, but a few hours later AP withdrew the call, saying the vote count for Jones was \"higher than anticipated.\"\n\n...Elsewhere on the Hill, Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette has withdrawn her bid for Democratic whip, our Playbook colleagues report. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn is now the only candidate seeking that post. DeGette was a key architect of the 21st Century Cures Act.\n\nHEALTH IT BUSINESS WATCH\n\nNOTABLE AMAZON HEALTH VENTURE HIRE: The health venture led by Atul Gawande is getting a health data expert focused on improving patient health. CNBC reports Dana Gelb Safran, who was leading performance measurement and improvement at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, is joining the new, still-undefined health venture formed by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway.\n\n...In other tech leadership news, the head of a major technology lobbying organization whose members include Amazon and IBM is defecting to Netflix, our POLITICO colleague Steven Overly reports. Dean Garfield is exiting the Information Technology Industry Council after nearly 10 years as president and CEO, creating a key vacancy at one of the tech sector's largest trade associations during a tumultuous time for the industry.\n\nITI has been a prominent voice in tech policy battles, which will only heat up next year as lawmakers look to hold the industry to account on issues like protecting user data. Under Garfield, ITI has sought to align companies around consumer privacy principles that could underpin federal legislation, a difficult task as members like Facebook, Google, Apple and IBM have taken divergent stances.\n\nThose principles, including giving consumers more control over data, were released last month and will be key industry talking points as it urges Congress to create rules that override state privacy laws, including a California law taking effect in 2020.\n\nITI has also opposed Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, which the association argues punishes tech companies that import parts and products. The group aggressively backed Trump's tax reform efforts last year, however, which delivered a windfall for companies that repatriated cash held overseas.\n\nREWARDING REUSE: The Wellcome Trust, a biomedical research charity, is handing out cash to groups who can generate new insight from information already available in open databases. The first prizes will be for insights related to antimicrobial resistance and malaria. Sage Bionetworks is also partnering with Wellcome on the re-use contest.\n\nSTUDY TO EXAMINE PREGNANT WOMENS\u2019 SMARTPHONE USE: The National Science Foundation has given the University of Texas at Austin a $1.2 million grant to study the smartphone habits of 1,000 pregnant women, hoping the data will help create individualized care plans. Participants will download an app that gathers data about their movement, social network interactions, screen time and typing speed.

Brandon Levene, head of applied intelligence, found via Google online file scanning service VirusTotal that the tactics the new campaign uses are identical \u2014 down to the metadata \u2014 to those attributed to the group in 2016, the year Cozy Bear allegedly was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhile FireEye\u2019s details about a State Department campaign have drawn the most media attention, Levene found another element of the campaign noteworthy. \u201cIf the reports that media is a target are true, it would be interesting and could show that attackers are attempting to observe and manipulate news cycles,\u201d he said via email. \u201cFor instance, attackers would have advance notice of news stories and could prepare social media posts to go out when the news hits that could discredit the news or otherwise manipulate it.\u201d He also predicted the group would return with more sophisticated tactics because this campaign was discovered so quickly.\n\nChronicle joins CrowdStrike, Kaspersky Lab and FireEye as companies pointing out the apparent connections to APT29, with varying degrees of confidence. FireEye released additional details on the attack campaign Monday. \u201cAnalysis of this activity is ongoing, but if the APT29 attribution is strengthened, it would be the first activity uncovered from this sophisticated group in at least a year,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cGiven the widespread nature of the targeting, organizations that have previously been targeted by APT29 should take note of this activity.\u201d That it could be part of a broader deceptive campaign, planned at least a month in advance, makes it all the more concerning, according to FireEye.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

There have even been recent affiliate offerings geared toward this specific type of activity,\" she said. Consumers already are getting Thanksgiving-themed spam emails advertising sales. Retailers, meanwhile, should be on the lookout for ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks, she said.\n\nDIVIDE BY ZERO \u2014 Devices infected with botnets need to be brought down as close to zero as possible, two researchers argue in a report from the Council on Foreign Relations released Monday \u2014 contrary to the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that botnets have to be managed rather than shut down entirely. A country can easily harness millions of botnets for geopolitical purposes, such as using DDOS attacks to shutdown large portions of the internet, the report states. Even a small percentage of infected devices, they argue, have \u201cenormous disruptive potential.\u201d Countries should create \u201cbotnet goals\u201d such as establishing an international organization to take down botnets, they said. Nations should be held liable for harm caused by botnets within their borders and develop incentives for ISPs to clean up their networks.\n\nCYBERSECURITY FOR SECURITIES \u2014 The securities market is a particularly vulnerable segment of the banking and payments industries, according to an analysis of cyber threats out Monday from BAE Systems and the SWIFT financial system. \u201cThis is due to the large numbers of Participants and infrastructures in that market, the complexities of their interactions, and inherent characteristics such as long chains of custody, unstructured communications and trusted practice \u2014 all of which combine to provide opportunities for APT groups to exploit,\u201d the analysis states, referencing \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d groups usually tied to nation states.\n\nRUSSIA\n\nTALKING ABOUT TROLLS \u2014 Contrary to public belief, most tweets by Russian trolls in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election did not lead to shady fake-news websites, according to new research. Instead, so-called junk news sites accounted for only 6 percent of links in Internet Research Agency tweets, while legitimate local and regional news sites accounted for 30 percent of links.\n\n\u201cBut the number of links to junk news sites spiked sharply in the weeks immediately leading up to the election, suggesting that the trolls put extra effort into spreading falsehoods just before Election Day,\u201d wrote the New York University researchers who conducted the study. The researchers said they suspected that the Russian trolls relied on local news websites because of data showing that Americans overwhelmingly trusted such sources. Another possibility, they said, was that local-news-sharing accounts were \u201csleeper accounts\u201d meant to develop a legitimate reputation to increase their \u201ceffectiveness in future influence campaigns.\u201d\n\nOUT OF OFFICE \u2014 Some Microsoft Office 365 and Azure users got an unwelcome surprise on Monday when they found themselves unable to log in to their services. The tech giant told customers they \u201cmay be unable to sign in using multi-factor authorization\u201d and \u201cmay also be unable to carry out self-service password resets\u201d during the global outage that lasted much of the day. Thus far, no explanation has been given as to why the services went down; Microsoft is likely still investigating, although it applied a patch.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Rep.

About 24 hours later, massive fires swept the area.\n\n\u2014 Pepperdine was hit especially hard. The Malibu campus opted to shelter in place during a particularly intense period as fires raged nearby. Nearly 80 students and faculty lost their homes.\n\n\u2014 The presidents of both universities say their campuses continue to grieve. At Cal Lutheran, President Chris Kimball told Morning Education that in addition to losing Justin Meek, an intensely popular recent grad, at least 30 students from his university were in the bar during the shooting and some sustained minor injuries. \u201cThere is a sense of loss of innocence out here by this happening,\u201d Kimball said.\n\n\u2014 In many ways, the fires provided a distraction, Kimball said. A campus gym became a Red Cross shelter location for fire evacuees, and students and faculty volunteered making peanut butter sandwiches for those in need. The university has hired more counselors and is rethinking security precautions.\n\n\u2014 Trying to relieve stress, campus leaders have brought in puppies for students to play with, miniature horses and food trucks. \u201cThat grieving process has been a little bit delayed. It\u2019s going to happen and probably be even more difficult than it normally would be,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very attentive to try to find ways to try to bring the community together.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Andrew Benton, president of Pepperdine, said the campus was stunned by the death of student Alaina Housley. He said Housley was an accomplished student and vocalist whose parents also went to Pepperdine. \u201cTo have her life taken from us that way, it\u2019s just been very hard for us to process \u2014 particularly students 18, 19, 20 years of age who have never experienced anything like this, and I hope they never will again,\u201d Benton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help them process and at the same time process our own grief.\u201d\n\n\u2014 As the campus mourned, the fires closed in. Benton described how students were called to two separate locations to shelter in place with breathing masks, food and other supplies. \u201cIt served us well, but the moments were indeed frightening,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 To assist with the community\u2019s recovery, the university is working with a local grocery store to offer a Thanksgiving meal on campus. Its law school is providing free legal assistance to residents needing help with insurance or other fire-related paperwork. Pepperdine also created a fund where people can donate to help students and faculty affected by the fires.\n\n\u2014 Benton said the campus will host a memorial service for Housley on Nov. 28. \u201cThe healing, I think, has begun, but it will be a very important moment of healing,\u201d he said.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY, NOV. 20.

The question is: What can Washington do to foster more opportunity and prosperity in struggling communities across the country?

Read the latest issue of The Agenda to learn more.\n\nPUSH TO RENAME SCHOOL HONORING BEN CARSON CRITICIZED: Members of a group representing conservative African-Americans are condemning an effort underway to rename a Detroit school that honors HUD Secretary Ben Carson, a surgeon and Detroit native. The Project 21 Black Leadership Network called it a \u201cpurely political act\u201d that \u201cwillfully ignores the accomplishments and charitable acts\u201d by Carson.\n\n\u2014 The Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine \u2014 a science and medicine-themed school \u2014 was intended to honor Carson before he joined President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, according to the Detroit Free Press. Last week, the Detroit Board of Education voted 6-1 to approve a process for seeking new names, but the newspaper reports that the vote doesn\u2019t guarantee the name will change. The vote means the process of seeking input from stakeholders will begin.\n\nFLORIDA SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION SEEKS TO BOLSTER FUNDS FOR ARMED GUARDS: The commission in Florida investigating the Parkland school shooting that left 17 dead on Feb. 14 wants the state to give school districts more money to pay for armed guards. It is also proposing a statewide formula to determine how many security personnel are needed for each campus.\n\n\u2014 The commission, in a draft report obtained by POLITICO through a records request, also wants the state to increase law enforcement's access to student records and school facilities, and to strengthen communication between agencies. The 99-page document includes dozens of recommendations of varying cost and detail, each drawing on discussions between commissioners who have met over the last few months. A final report must be sent to state lawmakers by Jan. 1.

In a letter to the VA, he notes that since Aug. 1, hundreds of thousands of veterans have either not received their monthly housing allowance for the fall 2018 semester or received an incorrect amount as the agency struggles to implement changes made by Congress to the GI Bill last year.\n\n\u2014 Enzi wants to know how much the VA has spent on the IT problems that continue to plague the agency. He also wants to know how long it will be before the VA reimburses recipients who have not been receiving the correct housing allowance while the department works to correct processing problems.\n\n\u2014 Last week, VA officials testified on Capitol Hill that it\u2019s not clear when the problem will be fixed \u2014 although they emphasized it\u2019s a priority.\n\n\u2014 Soon after, Stars and Stripes reported that the VA official leading the implementation of the GI Bill expansion, Robert Worley, is being reassigned to a regional office in Texas.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 The Bipartisan Policy Center says in a new \u201cearly learning facilities policy framework\u201d that more attention needs to be focused on improving the facilities that house young children.

Our next Morning Ag installment will publish on Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nIN THE HOPPER: Key lawmakers with power over USDA and FDA spending want more information on the two agencies\u2019 plan to divide up jurisdiction over cell-cultured meat before they\u2019ll consider nixing a provision in an upcoming funding bill that would give USDA lead responsibility over the budding sector.\n\n\u2014 Trade aid and city life: USDA records show that trade aid payments have been made to hundreds of people who live in urban areas. The Environmental Working Group said it\u2019s evidence that the next farm bill should tighten payment limits for farm subsidies.\n\n\u2014 Pressure building for tariff deal with Mexico, Canada: The new North American trade agreement is in line to be signed at the end of next week, but Mexico and Canada want relief from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by then.\n\nCELL-BASED MEAT ISSUE COULD STILL BE SETTLED ON THE HILL: USDA and FDA ended their turf war over cell-cultured meat by announcing they have agreed to split up jurisdiction of the burgeoning industry \u2014 but the issue has not been fully resolved. Some members of Congress haven\u2019t yet backed off from their efforts to dictate regulatory control of the products, Helena Bottemiller Evich reports this morning.\n\nA rider tucked into next year\u2019s agriculture spending bill would mandate that USDA lead oversight of cell-based products. The White House had urged the Hill to drop the provision and leave it up to USDA and FDA to figure it out, but lawmakers have not backed down. Appropriators have until Dec. 7 to pass the ag spending package for fiscal 2019.\n\n\u2018Talk is cheap\u2019: Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Robert Aderholt, who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture, are holding firm. The Alabama Republican wants to learn more about what the divided jurisdiction would look like before making a call on whether to jettison the rider, a spokesperson told Helena.\n\n\u201cAs I have seen over the years when jurisdictional battles brew, that talk is cheap when written words matter,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOn the Senate side, John Hoeven, head of the Appropriations panel on agriculture, is also gathering more information to \u201censure that the agreement works,\u201d according to his spokesperson. Livestock groups have aggressively pushed for USDA to take the lead in regulation, and Hoeven took heat previously for not strongly supporting the rider from the start.\n\nPros, read Helena\u2019s story here.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY, NOV. 20!

With lawmakers out of town this week for the Thanksgiving holiday, updates have been few and far between.\n\nTime is of the essence: MA readers are well aware that negotiators don\u2019t have much time to make a deal and get the details wrapped up so Congress can move in early December. Significant policy tweaks at this stage will also need new CBO scores (not the easiest thing to accomplish the week of Thanksgiving).\n\nAbraham blames Democrats: Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.), a member of the House Agriculture Committee, on Monday accused House Democrats of trying to delay farm bill talks to punt the issue to the next Congress. \"We can ram this through, and I think that's what we've got to do at this time,\u201d he told a local outlet. A spokesperson for House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway did not respond to an inquiry about whether he agrees with Abraham.\n\nHUNDREDS OF TRADE-AID RECIPIENTS LIVE THE URBAN LIFE: The Environmental Working Group\u2019s release Monday of early USDA data on the tariff-relief package showed that more than 87,700 direct payments were made to individuals and farm entities through Oct. 31 \u2014 and that 1,142 of those recipients reside in some of the nation\u2019s largest cities, Pro Ag\u2019s Catherine Boudreau reports. The average payment to city dwellers was $881.\n\nThe advocacy group, a longtime critic of farm subsidies, used its analysis of records obtained through a FOIA request to renew its calls for Congress and the Trump administration to tighten payment limits in the next farm bill.\n\nQualifying for subsidies: Aid should be going to \u201cactual\u201d farmers who have been hit by retaliatory tariffs due to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies and not to those who have little role in agriculture, said Scott Faber, the group\u2019s senior vice president of government affairs.\n\nA USDA spokesperson said that in order to be eligible for trade assistance, individuals must meet the department\u2019s \u201cactively engaged\u201d criteria for subsidies \u2014 or contribute significant capital to an agricultural operation, or provide land and equipment, labor, or management. The same eligibility standard is also applied across commodity support programs in the farm bill. Unlike those commodity programs, however, a producer also has to prove actual production of a crop to qualify for trade aid, the spokesperson said.\n\nEWG and other critics of farm subsidies argue that USDA\u2019s definition of \u201cactively engaged\u201d is rife with loopholes that allow non-farmers, like people living in cities, to collect payments.\n\nTHE ADAGE \u201cWORK HARD AND GET AHEAD\u201d is a waning reality in America today.

MEXICO, CANADA HOPE SO: A top Mexican official said Mexico and Canada expect to reach a deal with the Trump administration to lift U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum by the time the three nations sign the new North American trade agreement at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of next week.\n\n\u201cIt is the expectation that by the time of the signing, there will be either a solution or a very clear track that gives enough certainty to all parties that a solution is coming,\u201d Mexican Ambassador Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez told reporters Monday, Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer reports.\n\nA deal would clear the way for Canada and Mexico to lift retaliatory duties on about $15 billion worth of U.S. exports, including several agricultural products.\n\nAg, business groups join push for pre-signing deal: Gutierrez\u2019s comments came the same day that nearly three dozen prominent agricultural, business and manufacturing groups, including the National Pork Producers Council, wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to urge him to remove steel and aluminum duties against Canada and Mexico before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is signed.\n\nThe groups warned that failure to do so would jeopardize the pact\u2019s chances of passing in Congress.

A few days after it was published earlier this year, Heidi Green, Perdue\u2019s chief of staff at the time, asked for it to be rescinded, according to Sonny Ramaswamy, NIFA\u2019s director at the time. Green left USDA in May to return home to Georgia.\n\nThe policy, intended to expand LGBT membership and modernize the organization, caused a rift among some 4-H volunteers and outside conservative and evangelical groups, the Register reported. It also led to the firing of the Iowa 4-H director, John-Paul Chaisson-C\u00e1rdenas, who had advocated for the policy.\n\nUSDA\u2019s response: \u201cThe document in question was developed by a regional 4-H leadership group, did not set national 4-H policy, and should not have been disseminated,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement, adding that \u201cdecisions on such topics rightly belong on the local level.\u201d\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Kudlow on life as a free-trader in Trump world: Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, talks with POLITICO\u2019s Ben White about progress he\u2019s made in pushing a free-trade message in the White House (think NAFTA 2.0) and the clashes with more hawkish, pro-tariff forces in the administration. Listen to the latest POLITICO Money podcast.\n\n\u2014 Criminal justice reformers frustrated with hemp ban for felons: Hemp farmers are eagerly awaiting potential passage of a farm bill that contains a provision from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that would legalize hemp, a boon for the industry. But a late addition that would also ban people convicted of drug felonies from growing hemp has angered lawmakers, hemp industry participants and religious groups who view it as a punishment to minorities.

Trump, is a win for immigrants, halting implementation of a fast-track regulation and presidential proclamation issued Nov. 9 that barred migrants who cross the border between ports of entry from seeking asylum.

According to Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who\u2019s overseeing the border operation, the deployment is on track to end Dec. 15.\n\nCaravan migrants from Central America have been arriving for the past week in Tijuana. Early Monday morning, the Border Patrol closed northbound lanes into San Ysidro, Calif. for three hours at the Tijuana port of entry (the busiest in the U.S.) \u201cafter @CBP officials were notified that a large # of caravan migrants were planning to rush the border in an attempt to gain illegal access to the US,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted Monday afternoon. The Wall Street Journal quoted a DHS official citing \u201cintelligence reports, including from the Mexican government.\u201d\n\nBut Buchanan cast doubt on the severity of the threat, saying that if there were \"reliable reports\" that a mob was about to rush the border, or something similar that could put agents at risk, \"we would close the port.\u201d More from Morgan here, and POLITICO\u2019s Rebecca Rainey on the border closing here, and more from the Journal here.\n\nLAWMAKERS PUSH ON ASYLUM: Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif), the likely next appropriations chair for the DHS subcommittee, joined Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) in writing President Trump Monday urging him to rescind the presidential actions restricting asylum access at the U.S.-Mexico border, which, they said, \u201cviolate domestic and international law.\u201d The Democratic House members said that the policies, combined with the Border Patrol\u2019s \u201congoing efforts to meter and turn back asylum seekers at ports of entry along the southern border,\u201d served to \u201ceffectively create an asylum ban. Read the letter here.\n\nUNIONS\n\nCOLUMBIA CAVES: Columbia University said Monday that it will start bargaining with its graduate student employees union more than two years after the NLRB handed down a precedent-setting ruling that allowed student workers to unionize. Columbia refused to recognize the student union after the 2016 decision, saying it would seek a review in federal appellate court. But the university backed down Monday, facing a Dec. 4 strike deadline, the Columbia Spectator reports.\n\nA framework agreement announced by the university \u201csets forth mutually agreed upon principles to guide negotiations toward collective bargaining agreements on wages, hours, and other working conditions for Columbia\u2019s student research and teaching assistants and for our diverse postdoc community,\u201d Lee Bollinger, the university president, said in a written statement. Negotiations are expected to begin by late February 2019. More here.\n\nMeanwhile, a 60-percent majority of Brown graduate students voted to unionize, the university announced Monday. Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees and the American Federation of Teachers will represent approximately 900 doctoral and master\u2019s students working as \u201cteaching assistants, research assistants or proctors,\u201d according to a university press release. \u201cThis win means a voice for parents who are graduate employees and in need of better childcare, and a voice for international graduate employees facing complicated immigration issues,\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a separate statement. The actions at Columbia and Brown follow the news earlier this month that Georgetown University graduate students voted overwhelmingly to unionize. Read the press release from Brown here and AFT\u2019s statement here.\n\nREFUGEES GO TO WORK: The Trump administration\u2019s moves to scale back refugee admissions has led to a 74 percent decrease in arrivals, from 85,000 in fiscal year 2016 to 22,500 in fiscal year 2018, according to an issue brief released Monday by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The new 30,000 cap on refugees that the Trump administration announced in September could reduce that number further. Check out the brief here.\n\nSHARING CENSUS DATA?: \u201cTrump administration officials have privately discussed the possibility that in the future census information could be shared with law enforcement,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Tara Bahrampour reported Monday. Or anyway, the officials discussed the possibility of discussing it.\n\nAfter a May hearing, Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) submitted a written query to the Justice Department seeking reassurance that DOJ continued to interpret the 2001 USA Patriot Act not to override a 1954 law that required the Census Bureau not to share information collected in the census with any other government agency or court. In an email exchange about how to respond, Ben Aguinaga, chief of staff to John Gore, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, advised Gore, \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to say too much there in case the issues addressed in the [earlier] opinion or related issues come up later for renewed debate.\u201d Gore didn\u2019t appear in the email to be advocating a change so much as noting that someone else (perhaps then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose hawkish immigration views were well known) might do so. Incidentally, NPR Census reporter Hansi Lo Wang tweeted a copy of the document on Saturday. More here.\n\nNEW REFUGEE LEADERSHIP: Scott Lloyd, the Trump administration's controversial refugee office director, may have more time to work on his book about his anti-abortion beliefs.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Rachana Pradhan reports that the former Knights of Columbus lawyer is being reassigned after fallout from DHS\u2019 lack of preparation for the surge of migrant children it became responsible following Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy.\u201d\n\nA top HHS official conducted a \u201ctop to bottom\u201d review of the department's handling of the migrant crisis, and senior officials concluded that Lloyd mismanaged aspects of the response, POLITICO reported last month. In one example, \u201cLloyd told staff to stop keeping a spreadsheet tracking separated families.\u201d\n\nDemocrats too have long sought Lloyd's ouster over his efforts to block unaccompanied teens in federal custody from obtaining abortions. His career has been devoted to promoting Catholic causes. The refugee office\u2019s current chief of staff, Jonathan Hayes, will serve as interim director, a spokesperson confirmed to Morning Shift.

She departed DOJ last Friday. Rachael Tucker, a senior counselor to the attorney general, could also exit \u201cin the next couple of months,\u201d citing her fidelity to Sessions, or possibly take another job within the agency, said two sources close to the situation. Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeff Wood, another former Sessions Senate staffer, may also soon make an exit, according to one senior administration official.\n\nAnd while the White House could find another strident immigration hawk to lead DOJ and name ideologically similar aides, several of the names being floated for attorney general \u2014 such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and George H.W. Bush-era Attorney General Bill Barr \u2014 represent a more GOP establishment line on the subject.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIt\u2019s a situation that conservatives who support reduced immigration have long feared. Even Trump\u2019s critics concede that Sessions\u2019 staff has dutifully guided the president\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, propped up the president's most contested executive actions and added a record number of adjudicators to U.S. immigration courts. Sessions also made headlines for his defense of the administration\u2019s decision to separate migrant children from parents who have crossed the border illegally.\n\nMore recently, Sessions personally guided the White House as Trump attempted to dramatically limit asylum applications, removing some language in the process and ultimately signing off on the new rule, according to two DOJ officials.\n\n\u201cFor better or for worse, you cannot say [Sessions] has not had a very profound impact,\u201d said Leon Fresco, head of the DOJ\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation under President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a guiding force in moving both the DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security to draft and implement some of the most restrictive rules on immigration,\u201d he added.\n\nA DOJ leadership void could leave DHS to take up the immigration mantle, a prospect that worries advocates of stricter border laws, many of whom have been disappointed in current DHS chief Kirstjen Nielsen's performance. While DHS has the power to enforce immigration policies \u2014 a topic Trump recently claimed Nielsen could be \"much tougher\" on \u2014 DOJ is the agency that can set uncompromising rules.\n\nAnd DHS may soon be poised to get a more pugnacious leader on the subject, increasing the chance that the agency asserts itself more on topics like border crossings. Trump is considering replacing Nielsen with Thomas Homan, a tough-talking lawman who once recommended charging so-called sanctuary-city politicians \u201cwith crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepending on who is named DHS secretary, some leadership may shift back over to the person in that role,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nWithout Sessions and his cohort of aides atop the agency, immigration hard-liners are wondering whether his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, can stay the course on the administration's effort to remake decades of immigration policy by boosting border enforcement and immigration prosecutions and challenging states that refuse cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\n\u201cEveryone involved on immigration issues has witnessed a long list of things that got done\" under Sessions, said Vaughan. A fan of Sessions, Vaughan griped about the lack of an \u201cobvious candidate\u201d to take control of the agency if the president wants immigration to continue to be one of its highest-priority issues.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, combined with growing expectations that the White House won\u2019t announce its nominee until mid-December at the earliest, has left some fifth-floor staffers feeling as though they\u2019re in limbo, wondering whether it\u2019s time to leave the administration or worth the wait to see who takes over as attorney general. Sessions has encouraged his loyalists to stick around to see who might take over for him.\n\nAlthough Cutrona has already left DOJ, several other senior leaders eyeing the door are expected to stick around long enough to ensure \u201ca smooth transition,\u201d said one senior administration official, who claimed staffers who have been at the agency since Trump\u2019s inauguration are \"burnt out.\" And a DOJ spokesperson said Tucker \"plans to stay [and] may take on a different role,\" though such a move has yet to be finalized or announced.\n\n\n\nMatthew Whitaker, Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff, has taken over as acting attorney general, but multiple sources said they doubt Trump will nominate Whitaker to take over permanently. Whitaker\u2019s appointment has also been challenged by Democratic lawmakers and conservative legal scholars, including George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who argue that Trump illegally evaded the normal DOJ line of succession. The White House has justified its decision by pointing to the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows the president to temporarily fill most empty executive branch positions.\n\nTo replace Whitaker, the White House is looking at a slate of candidates. In addition to Christie and Barr, Trump is eyeing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, outgoing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Mark Filip, a deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, is another option. McClatchy also reported that the White House had discussed the job with Janice Rogers Brown, a retired D.C. circuit judge and former California Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201c[Sessions] would want them to stay there and do their job if they really enjoy it,\u201d said a source close to the former attorney general, adding that \u201csome are still going to feel that out of a sense of loyalty [they] need to leave.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mlevine@politico.com (Marianne LeVine)", "title": "Schumer demands probe on Whitaker's ties to Trump", "description": "Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general has drawn scrutiny from Democratic and Republican senators.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/schumer-demands-probe-whitaker-trump-1005771", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/52/33/da9e3a1b45aea51cbd4c5ca88185/181120-chuck-schumer-gty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:41:51Z", "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested that the inspector general provide information on whether Matthew Whitaker provided any assurance to the White House that he would interfere with the Mueller investigation. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images S\u2026 [+1759 chars]", "fulltext": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requested that the inspector general provide information on whether Matthew Whitaker provided any assurance to the White House that he would interfere with the Mueller investigation. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Legal Schumer demands probe on Whitaker's ties to Trump\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a letter Tuesday requesting that the Justice Department inspector general investigate communications between Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and the White House.\n\nIn his letter, Schumer cited news reports of Whitaker\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump during his former role as chief of staff to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI am particularly concerned about whether Mr. Whitaker may have shared with the White House, or could share in his new role, confidential grand jury or investigative information from the Special Counsel investigation or any criminal investigation,\u201d Schumer wrote in a letter to Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz.\n\nSchumer added that disclosure of such information could \u201cimplicate criminal contempt of court, obstruction of justice\u201d or violate the Justice Department\u2019s policy on contact with the White House on criminal investigations.\n\nSchumer requested that the inspector general provide information on whether Whitaker had access to confidential information related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation when he was chief of staff and whether Whitaker provided any assurance to the White House that he would interfere with the Mueller investigation.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is blaming \"radical environmentalists\" for the forest fires, Nancy Pelosi is fending off a growing challenge \u2014 and wanna talk about challenge? Thy name is Facebook.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cWe know the problem. It\u2019s been years of neglect, and in many cases it\u2019s been these radical environmentalists that want nature to take its course. \u2026 You know what? This is on them.\u201d -- Just days after telling Gov. Jerry Brown that \u201cit\u2019s not time for finger-pointing\u201d with regard to the California wildfires, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke tells Breitbart News that ... it\u2019s time for finger pointing.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY: Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter @amyewalter: \u201cIncumbent Dems who signed \"anti-Pelosi\" letter sit in safe seats.

Eric Swalwell was on national television lauding Pelosi\u2019s strategy of emphasizing health care \u2014 an approach adopted by multiple triumphant California candidates \u2014 saying \u201cthis election was about health care, and Nancy Pelosi was the architect of the health care law. She helped hold Democrats together to stop it from being completely eviscerated.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff strongly tweeted his support, and so did Rep. Ro Khanna who argued that after the \u201cblue wave\u201d of the midterms, \u201cto deny the first woman speaker who led us to that victory the gavel would be a slap in the face to the voters who sent us here.\"\n\n-- SOME NEWCOMERS AGREE: Soon after their victories were official, two of the newest California Democrats \u2014 Reps.-elect Katie Hill and Mike Levin \u2014 released a joint statement backing Pelosi as the Democrat who could deliver on their campaign promises with \u201cleadership that is bold, pragmatic and capable of swift results.\u201d\n\n-- As the jostling over the speakership intensified last week, Rep.

Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are on the same page on drug pricing once again.\n\nA bill released Tuesday morning by Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to reduce U.S. drug prices takes a cue from the president\u2019s recent proposal to reduce Medicare drug costs \u2014 both proposals seek to lower U.S. drug costs by tying them to international prices.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s the latest alignment on drug prices by populist politicians on opposite sides of the aisle. During their 2016 presidential campaigns, both Sanders and Trump advocated for negotiating the cost of drugs in Medicare and importing cheaper drugs from overseas. Now, they\u2019re embracing the idea of indexing U.S. prices to the lower prices paid by other countries \u2014 in effect, relying on price controls set by other countries.\n\nThe proposed legislation stands almost no chance of gaining traction in a Republican-controlled Senate and is sure to face stiff opposition from the drug industry. But its similarities to Trump\u2019s far narrower proposal for drugs administered as part of the Medicare Part B program speaks to the mounting pressure on both parties to address drug costs.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that everyone is discussing this \u2014 and you can\u2019t escape it \u2014 suggests there will be action,\u201d although not necessarily on these proposals, said Zeke Emanuel, a former Obama administration health adviser now at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPrescription Pulse A weekly briefing on pharmaceutical policy news \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSanders and Khanna\u2019s bill would incentivize drug companies to charge prices in the U.S. that are comparable to those paid in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan. If the companies don\u2019t cooperate, the federal government could intervene to allow generic companies to produce cheaper knockoffs.\n\nThe legislation comes just a few weeks after Trump unveiled his own plan to overhaul how Medicare Part B pays for drugs by slowly tying payments for physician-administered drugs to international prices. The administration says it will release a proposed rule for the pilot project in early 2019.\n\nKhanna told POLTICO that one of the reasons he and Sanders are rolling out their approach now is to piggyback on Trump\u2019s proposal. But the lawmakers would take the idea of using international reference pricing much further \u2014 applying it to the entire U.S. market, not just to one part of Medicare.\n\n\u201cThe president has given this window, and I think it is really important to do this in the lame-duck [session] \u2014 to say, \u2018If the president is serious about this, he can endorse the proposal,\u2019\u201d Khanna said.\n\n\u201cIt definitely invites Donald to put his policy where his mouth is,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a left-leaning group that works to safeguard Social Security, when asked whether this is a bill Trump might be able to support.\n\nHealth policy experts said one reason Trump, Sanders and Kahanna are drawn to the idea of international reference pricing is that it\u2019s an easy policy to explain to the public. It is, for all intents and purposes, another form of government price-setting, but it allows politicians to avoid saying they want the U.S. government to set the prices of medicines \u2014 a policy reviled by drug companies and, traditionally, by many Republicans as well.\n\nWhile some may see international reference pricing as \u201csuper left-wing,\u201d that\u2019s not really the case, said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes and a former Medicare and Medicaid official under George W. Bush.\n\nGovernments typically regulate prices set by monopolies, such as those given to brand drug companies, he said.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s fundamentally been a blind spot for us that we grant monopolies for drugs, and we do nothing about companies taking advantage of that monopoly,\u201d Bach said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly reasonable policy to say, \u2018We will grant you a monopoly. We will grant it to you for \u2018x\u2019 number of years and we will let you charge a lot of money for it. But there will be a limit.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut critics on both the left and right of the proposals by the lawmakers and Trump wondered why the U.S., as the world\u2019s largest market for drugs, would rely on other countries\u2019 price controls rather than setting its own.\n\n\u201cOne question \u2026 is why would the U.S. outsource our determination of the right price to other countries and not just make an independent assessment ourselves?\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cWhy do we think Canada and Germany [are] better than we are at determining the right price?\u201d\n\nBen Ippolito, who works on health economics at the free-market think tank American Enterprise Institute, had a harsher assessment: \u201cIt certainly feels like even Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t want to talk too much about actually setting prices; instead we\u2019d like to back our way into it,\u201d he said. But \u201cif you really want to regulate prices at the federal government, then just regulate prices.\u201d\n\nThe drug industry, meanwhile, panned the legislation before it was formally unveiled.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would have the same devastating impact on patients as the administration\u2019s proposed International Pricing Index model,\u201d said Nicole Longo, spokesperson for the drug industry trade group PhRMA. \u201cPatients in countries whose governments set prices wait years for new medicines and have far fewer treatment options. These policies reduce investment in research and development, slow progress in creating tomorrow\u2019s cures and will result in Americans having access to fewer new medicines.\u201d\n\nSanders and Khanna will formally introduce the legislation in the next Congress, but say they are putting it out now to help set the agenda for the next Congress, in which House Democrats plan to make drug pricing a top priority.\n\nIf their bill were to become law, they say, the median price of brand name prescription drugs could go down by more than 40 percent. For example, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma medicine Advair Diskus, which currently costs about $390 for a 30-day supply, could drop to $222, based on the prices paid in the five countries outlined in the bill. Lantus, an insulin made by Sanofi, could cost $220 for a 30-day supply, down from $387, based on what other countries pay.\n\nDespite Trump and Sanders getting on the same page, many conservatives think the Republican Party will not back international reference pricing approaches to drug costs.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see a swell of support for this,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum. \u201cThis is tantamount to bringing to the U.S. price controls \u2026 and conservative aren\u2019t fond of it.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "nmccaskill@politico.com (Nolan D.

Constituents pressed Moulton on his plan for who should replace Pelosi as party chief in the House, while a few thanked him for calling for change.\u201d Moulton told constituents no candidate has emerged to challenge Pelosi because it\u2019s best to wait until after the anti-Pelosi contingent has proven she doesn\u2019t have the votes to become speaker.

Moulton, a former Marine Corps officer, is a leader of the effort to block Pelosi from becoming speaker. \u201cAs we emerge into the 116th Congress, we need a speaker who has a proven record of serving our veterans and advancing policies that enhance our national security interests,\u201d the members wrote. \u201cNancy Pelosi has that record.

JEFFRIES -- The next chair of the House Democratic Caucus will come from the Congressional Black Caucus, joining incoming House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) in leadership. While it\u2019s rare to see two CBC members going head to head for a Democratic leadership post, CBC members say it\u2019s good for the black caucus, whose members are also poised to chair five congressional committees. Democrats say neither Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) nor Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has emerged as a clear front-runner. The two represent opposite sides of the country and different generations of the party.\n\n\u201cLee, 72, has paid her dues, playing the waiting game before seeking a jump into leadership. But Jeffries, 48, a rising star in the Democratic Party, is already ready to soar,\u201d Bres and I write. Lee predicts she will win. She launched her campaign in June and began securing commitments well before Jeffries announced his candidacy after Election Day. The caucus chair post is a launchpad for the future that puts the member in the room where key decisions are made. But members say the choice between Lee and Jeffries is tough, even those who stand by their pledge to back Lee. \u201cI told Barbara I was for her,\u201d one member told me. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be sad if he wins.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2Q74ze8\n\nRelated: \u201cElijah Cummings endured two painful years.

The Boston-based fantasy sports company is hoping to expand its online sports betting operation in Massachusetts.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on most commercial sports betting earlier this year, it's up to states to give the go-ahead. Massachusetts would have to pass legislation allowing the state to participate in sports betting, determine a tax rate and decide where that extra revenue would go. Sound familiar?\n\nSo far, DraftKings operates online sports betting New Jersey, which can be done via web browser or over an app by anyone in the state. DraftKings paid out $150 million to winning bettors in New Jersey since online sports betting started in August, DraftKings Director of Public Affairs Jamie Chisholm told me last week.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker's office calls it \"an issue worth analyzing\" and expects the Legislature and the sports industry to discuss it when the next session starts in January. The company has 700 employees and announced its move to a new Back Bay office in January.\n\nSports betting in Rhode Island will begin any day now, but that state does not allow for online wagers. Instead, betting will happen in casinos. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission reported earlier this month that gambling revenues at the new MGM Springfield casino dropped in its second month open, and slots parlor and horse track Plainridge Park also saw a revenue decline, according to the Associated Press .\n\nDraftKings is hoping Massachusetts will take the New Jersey route and legalize the kind of sports betting you can do on your phone. And the company has hopes that Beacon Hill can get it done fast.\n\n\"We want to see sports betting live in Massachusetts from the start of the 2019 NFL season, or earlier,\u201d DraftKings Global Public Affairs Director James Chisholm told me. \u201cThat would be ideal.\u201d\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

He also died after turning the gun on himself. What an awful story. Witnesses described the scene as \u201cchaos,\u201d \u201clike a movie.\u201d Hospital staff who see gun violence every day in the critically wounded they treat were quick to respond. It was the second time in a year that a Chicago Police officer was killed while in the line of duty. The gunman also confronted his girlfriend, a doctor in the hospital's emergency room, and shot her multiple times. The cause: a \"broken engagement,\" the Tribune reports.

Sun-Times story here\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nIn a Monday night forum about diversity, Chicago mayoral candidates Toni Preckwinkle and Susana Mendoza instead came out to fight. It was the first time the mayoral candidates had a chance to face off and both took advantage of it.\n\nPreckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, found herself defending her friendship with outgoing county Assessor Joe Berrios, widely criticized for a shift in the property tax burden from wealthy homeowners to everyone else. And Mendoza, the state comptroller, defended her stand on criminal justice reform\u2014given she had previously supported the death penalty. The invitation-only event also featured former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Austin Chamber of Commerce Director Amara Enyia. Mark Brown of the Sun-Times has a full report . And so does the Tribune.\n\nBefore the forum, some candidates took part in an old-timey political tradition: turning in signed petitions to get on the February ballot. The only thing missing from this spectacle was the popcorn. Campaign workers held hand-made signs or handed out \u201cvote for me\u201d buttons like hucksters at a circus. Toni Preckwinkle made the most dramatic entrance into the county building, walking alongside campaign manager, Ken Bennett (aka Chance the Rapper\u2019s dad). Bennett rolled in a dolly carrying petitions with 60,000 signatures, which one Twitter observer called \u201cthe ballerest move on signature day.\u201d Mayoral candidates Paul Vallas and Willie Wilson beamed like schoolboys having collected 60,000 and 50,000, respectively. Jerry Joyce, another mayoral candidate, says he brought in 30,000. Vallas credited \u201cgrass-roots support\u201d for being able to come in on Day 1 with so many names. Candidates can turn in petitions up to Nov. 26.\n\nA few aldermen outdid themselves in turning in more than the 473 required for their races. Ald. Ed Burke confirms he brought in 7,100 signatures. Ald. Gilbert Villegas collected 8,216. And Ald. Marty Quinn collected more than 10,000 signatures, one source whispers. What an army of help he must have had. Quinn is the lawmaker who got caught in the middle of a #metoo scandal when he didn\u2019t do anything to stop his brother from harassing a woman. Quinn is a business partner House Speaker Mike Madigan--they run Madigan-Quinn constituent services company. The business does everything from tree trimming to water repairs to notary public work, which may be handy for getting those petitions stamped and delivered.\n\nWelcome to POLITICO\u2019s Illinois Playbook.

The event was titled \u201cIllinois GOP: Now What?\u201d\n\nAt one point Brady also called out Dan Proft, who runs a right-wing PAC, for funneling $1.2 million to a primary candidate challenging Illinois House Republican leader Jim Durkin\u2014who ultimately won. That kind of financial support could have benefited Erika Harold, Brady said of the GOP attorney general candidate who fell short. Brady wants financial support to carry candidates through the general election. But Proft, also a panelist, disagreed, saying, \u201cCompetition produces better goods and services. Primaries are for improving the quality of the caucus and generals are for growing the caucus.\u201d\n\nThere was a glimmer of unity. Proft agreed with Brady on the need to do a better job recruiting young people, women and minorities.

Yet, legislation that lawmakers are considering, SB 2641, would deny Illinoisans from an opportunity to make money while their cars sit idle and unfairly double tax car owners. Car sharing is not the same as car rental, and the two industries cannot be treated the same. With car sharing, car owners can benefit financially while they aren\u2019t using their cars. When regular Illinoisans buy a car, they pay sales tax. Rental car companies don\u2019t because they have a sales tax waiver. But, this bill would force a car owner who has already paid sales tax to pay twice if they want to earn extra money sharing their car. Legislators should VOTE NO on the SB 2641 override. www.ILCarSharing.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter Shia Kapos @shiakapos"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "daniel@politico.com (Daniel Lippman)", "title": "New York\u2019s shrinking GOP \u2014 CUOMO\u2019s Iowa ground game \u2014 DE BLASIO spars with fired Investigations chief", "description": null, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2018/11/20/new-yorks-shrinking-gop-cuomos-iowa-ground-game-de-blasio-spars-with-fired-investigations-chief-private-money-for-nycha-349696", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:13:47Z", "content": "Presented by Airbnb Whither the New York Republican Party?

No Republican has won a statewide race since George Pataki\u2019s final re-election victory in 2002, and few of the statewide races since then, including those for U.S. Senate, have been remotely competitive.\n\nNow, of course, they\u2019ve lost what had been their one remaining hold on power: The state Senate, which the Democrats won in stunningly easy fashion on Election Day.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nState Sen. Fred Akshar thinks the GOP will benefit from Democratic overreach. \u201cThe Democrats conducted themselves a certain way in \u201909 and \u201910, and if they do that again, the pendulum will come swinging back just as hard,\u201d Akshar said, referring to the last time Democrats ran the Senate.\n\nBut then again, Akshar isn\u2019t willing to remain all that passive. He\u2019s among those who are looking for new leadership to replace current state chair Ed Cox. \u201cI have the deepest admiration and respect for [Ed]. Cox, but the time has come for some youthful, energetic and aggressive leadership, and we really need to revisit our playbook,\u201d Akshar said.\n\nOther Republicans, including Cox, weighed in with thoughts about the state of the party as it approaches 2020, after which maps will be drawn for new legislative districts. Some elected officials want to see better messaging, others hope for better candidates.\n\nWhat\u2019s undeniable, though, is that something has to change, otherwise the once-vaunted GOP organization will be reduced to cult status in a state that gave the party one its greatest heroes, Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nRoosevelt died in 1919 at the age of 60. In his final years, he sought to leave his imprint on the state party \u2014 to the chagrin of its conservative wing.

In a state that hasn\u2019t had a wide-open campaign in more than a decade, recent Iowa success is a hot commodity.

By Monday, it had ballooned into a public-relations crisis for the mayor, exposing him to lurid allegations that he or his administration had tried to cover up embarrassing inquiries, accused the commissioner of being disloyal and ultimately dismissed him in the interest of damage control. Mr. de Blasio on Friday took the rare step of firing the investigations commissioner, Mark G. Peters , whose role scrutinizing all areas of city government normally comes with a broad measure of independence.It did not take long for Mr. Peters to fire back.

In one example, Peters said he was summoned to meetings and calls where he was \"pressured to not issue certain reports.\" He also detailed a \"late night screaming call from the mayor,\" and another instance where senior City Hall staff informed him the mayor and his staff were \"really angry\" and wondered if he was \"still a friend.\" POLITICO\u2019s Gloria Pazmino and Sally Goldenberg.\n\nWHAT ALBANY'S READING\n\nCUOMO\u2019S TAKE ON AMAZON CRITICS \u2014 \u201cGov.

A draft of legislation submitted to Gov. Phil Murphy last week held taxes on recreational sales at 12 percent, which would make New Jersey\u2018s tax rate one of the lowest among states with a legal cannabis program, according to three sources with knowledge of the most recent draft. Local governments would be able to impose a separate excise tax on sales of up to 2 percent. Murphy, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin met last month to discuss legalization, but the administration\u2019s problems with a draft of the legislation remain unchanged from earlier this year, five sources with direct knowledge of the talks said. \u201cWe\u2019re at an impasse over some of the aspects of the bill,\" an administration source said Monday.

Having fantasized since his first year in office about his likeness hanging in the Statehouse, Christie finally had his official portrait, the most expensive in state history, unveiled Monday evening during a ceremony in Princeton. It depicts Christie at his most dynamic, and often his most imperious. \u2018I thought that\u2019s the way I\u2019d be remembered,\u2019 Christie, a two-term Republican, said Monday of the choice of pose. \u2018And being behind that podium was when I always felt most in command.\u2019 The portrait, painted by an award-winning Australian artist, is the ultimate affirmation for Christie of his rise from one-term Morris County freeholder and failed Assembly candidate to 55th governor of New Jersey \u2014 on par with the few dozen other men and one woman who have shaped the history of the Garden State from their perch atop state government. Christie commissioned the painting for an unprecedented $85,000 in taxpayer money \u2014 more than his three predecessors, all Democrats, combined and the highest since Democrat Jim Florio paid $58,000 for his in the 1990s.\u201d Read more here\n\n33.3 RADIOACTIVE MASTROS \u2014 BPU: Nuclear subsidy will cost roughly $300M, even if operators need less, by POLITICO\u2019s Danielle Muoio: The Board of Public Utilities on Monday closed the door on any possibility the state\u2019s nuclear subsidy program could cost less than $300 million a year. In May, Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law a bill allowing nuclear plant operators to apply for a subsidy that will be paid for through charges on ratepayers\u2019 bills. If the BPU determines a plant is eligible for the subsidy, the law allows operators to recover $0.004 per kilowatt-hour from retail distribution customers, or roughly $300 million a year. The bill\u2019s language immediately sparked backlash from a diverse group of opponents, including environmental advocates, ratepayer advocates and business groups. Opponents, who contend the subsidy isn\u2019t necessary in the first place, took issue with the amount of financial assistance being pre-determined in the bill. At its meeting on Monday, the BPU shut down the idea it would dole out less than the full $300 million, stating its hands were tied by the way the law was written. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going with the law and that\u2019s what the law said,\u201d BPU President Joseph Fiordaliso told reporters when asked if the agency would consider a smaller subsidy.

House Republicans suffered heavy Election Day losses in districts where large concentrations of taxpayers claim a popular tax break \u2014 the state and local tax deduction \u2014 which the law capped at $10,000 per household.

That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\n\u201cThe discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s prac\u00adtices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton, an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign. He attacked his Democratic challenger as untrustworthy and dubbed her \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 for using a personal email account as secretary of state.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- FLASHBACK: JOSH DAWSEY in POLITICO on Sept. 24, 2017: \u201cKushner used private email to conduct White House business\u201d\n\nON PELOSI \u2026 RACHAEL BADE, HEATHER CAYGLE and JOHN BRESNAHAN: \u201cPelosi\u2019s bid for speaker imperiled as public opposition grows\u201d: \u201cThe show of force underscores the depth of the challenge facing Pelosi, who has led the caucus for 16 years.

Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman -- the crown prince\u2019s 82-year-old father -- is still alive, the sources said.\n\n\u201cThey recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.

On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted that a migrant caravan planned to rush the border checkpoint, though officials later questioned the seriousness of the threat.\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the president's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Tigar wrote in his opinion. \"Asylum seekers will be put at increased risk of violence and other harms at the border, and many will be deprived of meritorious asylum claims.\"\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

He said little about the caravans in the immediate aftermath of the election but recently resumed tweeting about them.\n\n\"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months,'\" the president wrote Sunday. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nStill, military officials said Monday they would begin withdrawing the 5,800 troops that had been deployed to the border. Trump's decision to send them earned criticism from members of both parties, who described it as a pre-election gambit.\n\nThe general overseeing the deployment told POLITICO some of the troops are already unneeded, having completed the missions for which they were sent.\n\nIn the asylum ban case, East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the lawsuit on behalf of several nonprofits, argued that the presidential actions contradicted statutory language that allows migrants to apply for asylum \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival.\"\n\n\u201cThe president cannot simply discard federal statutes,\u201c said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who argued the case. \u201cWithout judicial intervention, migrants would have been in immediate danger.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU also argued that, in fast-tracking the rule, the Trump administration flouted its legal requirement under the Administrative Procedures Act to solicit public feedback.\n\nThe Trump administration answered that it had the authority to impose additional restrictions on asylum because it's a \u201cdiscretionary immigration benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule and proclamation aim to save lives by discouraging asylum seekers from making dangerous, unlawful border crossings,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in its response to the complaint.\n\nBut the court found that the administration\u2019s actions were an attempt to rewrite immigration law, which explicitly states that migrants may seek asylum whether or not they arrive at a designated port of entry.\n\n\u201cCongress,\u201d Tigar wrote, \u201chas clearly commanded that immigrants be eligible for asylum regardless of where they enter.\u201c\n\nWesley Morgan contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": null, "title": "America\u2019s widening equality problem, in charts", "description": "Here are five charts that illustrate America\u2019s growing economic divide.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/11/20/americas-economic-divide-000864", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/1a/68/ee726be94f048a4eb116dae16cde/graphic1.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:34:47Z", "content": "America is a land of opportunity as long as you live in the right place.

Just five counties account for the entire gain in business establishments; the rest of the country has fewer than before the recession hit.\n\nWe need to spread prosperity more widely, but we have little experience doing that well. Government efforts to spur development in a particular place tend to falter, with resources steered by the political process toward boondoggles that do little to buttress a region\u2019s economic vitality. Most support ends up coming from our safety net\u2019s transfer payments, which help to meet people\u2019s immediate needs but perversely weaken the labor market in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s a better way, one with bipartisan pedigree, mechanisms for implementation in place and funding available. It\u2019s called a \u201cwage subsidy.\u201d\n\nThe principle behind a wage subsidy is simple enough: If society recognizes the value of work and truly wants to promote it, we should be prepared to help pay for it. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. Subsidizing work makes jobs pay more than they otherwise would, attracting people from the sidelines into the labor force. Some of the subsidy\u2019s value accrues to employers, too, who will find it more attractive to create jobs for less-skilled workers. The result is higher employment levels at higher wages, with enormous benefits for not only struggling households, but also struggling communities.\n\nWe subsidize work on a limited scale today, through a program called the Earned Income Tax Credit that makes low-income households eligible for substantial payments during tax season each year\u2014more than $5,000 for some families. But the EITC\u2019s annual, lump-sum payments have serious limitations: They align poorly with the financial needs of people living paycheck to paycheck. They don\u2019t make clear the full earnings that workers can expect from low-wage jobs. And as structured today, the benefit goes almost entirely to households with children, even though drawing young, single workers into the labor force should be a top priority.\n\nA properly designed wage subsidy would operate much like the current payroll tax, but in reverse\u2014instead of deducting money from each paycheck based on how much the worker has earned, the government would put money in. The amount would be calibrated to the worker\u2019s hourly wage, so someone earning $9 per hour might get a $3-per-hour subsidy; someone earning $13 per hour might get an extra $1. Once a worker\u2019s market wage reached $15 per hour, the subsidy would cease.\n\nThe critical distinction between a wage subsidy and traditional approaches to supporting struggling households and communities is its direct attachment to work. America already transfers more than $1 trillion annually to lower-income households, a total that has surged four-fold since the 1970s even as median wages stagnated. But nearly all that support is provided without reference to work, and in fact usually discourages work. That\u2019s because increases in earned income reduce benefits, which makes the decision to try to earn a living seem a losing proposition for recipients. With a wage subsidy, by contrast, the incentive is reversed: taking a low-wage job is the way to become eligible, and working more is the way to receive a larger benefit.\n\nA parallel problem, and solution, exists for depressed places. Local economies suffering from deindustrialization now rely on the safety net to stay afloat, which means in practice that they \u201cexport need.\u201d In other words, instead of making things that others want in return for the goods and services they want from the wider world, they rely on their own lack of earned income to attract transfer payments. Taxpayer largesse supplies them with the things they want in return for nothing at all. The thriving occupational therapy office in an otherwise vacant plaza becomes the town\u2019s exporter, selling to the nation its care of local residents on disability. Using similar logic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture promotes food stamp enrollment as a \u201cwin-win for local retailers and communities. Each $5 in new SNAP benefits generates almost twice that amount in economic activity for the community.\u201d Add in Medicare and Social Security, and in vast swaths of the country a third or even a half of all personal income arrives via government benefits .\n\nAs with people, a wage subsidy reverses this dynamic for places. Subsidy payments are also transfers, of course, but they arrive in paychecks attached to the community\u2019s productive workers. Rather than rely on people not working to attract dollars from Washington, the community\u2019s workers become its engine of prosperity\u2014and all jobs within the community can be ones that generate resources. To be sure, an economy in which all communities support themselves without transfers is the goal; but until we reach it, a wage subsidy represents the best substitute. Instead of suggesting food-stamp enrollment as the way to help your local economy, the government can suggest getting a job\u2014any job.\n\nSome wage-subsidy proposals have a more explicitly \u201cplace-based\u201d orientation , targeting support to depressed regions. This goes too far. For one thing, the politics of deciding who should be eligible would be a nightmare. For another, low-wage workers struggling to make ends meet are a pervasive feature of our national economy, and they deserve this form of support wherever they live. By setting a standard subsidy calculation nationwide, most of the subsidy will already flow to those places that have the weakest labor markets and lowest wage structures.\n\nCertainly, a nationwide subsidy costs more than a targeted one, but America\u2019s ever-expanding safety net already contains the resources to fund the program\u2014resources that are being spent less effectively, in ways that deliver less value to recipients and often discourage work in the process. Without disrupting our support for people who cannot work, we could shift assistance for people who can work\u2014or, indeed, already are working\u2014toward this new form that encourages work and delivers cash in each paycheck to those who do work. Substantial funding would come from replacing the existing Earned Income Tax Credit. Programs like food stamps and disability could revert to their pre-recession scales. Some Medicaid spending, which yields appallingly low returns for recipients, could likewise be redirected. Best of all, as the subsidy moves people back into the workforce, their need for government transfers will decline.\n\nThe principle of supporting work is a bipartisan one, but Republicans resist the creation of yet more programs, while Democrats reject any shifting of funds from existing programs as \u201ccuts\u201d\u2014even when the resources would still flow toward low-income households, but in a more effective manner. Both sides, however, can achieve their goals through a wage subsidy. It would make what we already spend go further, strengthen labor markets, reward work and move more families and communities toward self-sufficiency.\n\nOren Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of the new book \u201cThe Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bwhite@politico.com (Ben White)", "title": "The $100 billion question", "description": "A conversation with Sen.

And he\u2019s championed essentially the only congressional effort to close this economic divide during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nScott\u2019s Opportunity Zones would provide tax incentives for investment in parts of the country that have not seen big gains since the Great Recession ended. He helped get the provision tucked in the tax bill signed by Trump in December 2017, and along the way won the support of several Democrats.\n\n\u201cI am certainly an advocate of the free market, without any question,\u201d Scott told me in an interview. \u201cHowever, my worldview, really, is oftentimes seen through the eyes of a 7-year-old kid, growing up in a single-parent household, mired in poverty, feeling hopeless, at times frustrated, realizing that there was more potential in me than I could get out.\u201d\n\nScott acknowledged in our interview that, contrary to conservative orthodoxy, he does believe that government can play a role in pushing against the economic tendency for investments to cluster in certain areas while leaving others behind. \u201cWe always struggle with an even spread of resources,\u201d he said, noting that one way government can address this is to ensure better access to broadband internet outside of major metropolitan centers.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, a Republican and the first African American to represent South Carolina in the U.S. Senate, outside his childhood home in North Charleston. | Raymond McCrea Jones for POLITICO\n\nThe idea for Opportunity Zones initially came from the Economic Initiative Group, a D.C. think tank set up by Sean Parker, the tech billionaire who co-founded Napster and served as the first president of Facebook. Parker eventually enlisted Scott in his effort to get the Opportunity Zones into legislation.\n\nThe program would allow investors who direct their money into distressed communities to defer capital gains taxes for up to 10 years. It is not yet operational; the Treasury Department in October released proposed rules to guide investors on how to take advantage of the tax incentives. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested that the program could attract $100 billion in investment in distressed areas.\n\nTax incentives haven\u2019t always proved successful in addressing entrenched poverty or stopping the decline of local economies based on old-line industries. And some progressives worry that programs like Scott\u2019s can turn into boondoggles that give tax breaks to wealthy investors without doing much for the places they\u2019re supposed to help. In a paper earlier this year, Adam Looney, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said there isn\u2019t good evidence that tax incentives actually boost low-income local residents; Empowerment Zones, a previous government effort to boost troubled areas, wound up costing $850 per resident and in the end was limited to just 11 neighborhoods.\n\nScott, for his part, said he thought the program could create enormous investment within just a couple of years. \u201cThere\u2019s over a trillion dollars on the sidelines that could be deployed,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think a realistic estimation, in the first few years, would be about $100 billion.\u201d\n\nScott spoke to POLITICO from his office in North Charleston, S.C. The following transcript has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nBen White: I wanted to start with a kind of existential question. When we think of using the tax code to effect economic change and stimulate investment, we tend to think of it as something that Democrats do more than Republicans. How do you approach this as a Republican, when the classic Republican thinking is, \u201cJust let the market decide\u201d?\n\nSen. Tim Scott: What I have tried to do is create a program that is not a government-centric program, but that does create an incentive for people to take a second look at parts of the country that have been missed by the economic recovery that we\u2019ve experienced over the last few years. In the Opportunity Zones, the poverty rate is over 30 percent. I look at it from a common-sense perspective and I ask myself, \u201cIs there a way for me to positively impact the lives of 50 million Americans by providing an incentive to unlock investments for those areas?\u201d And from my perspective, this is a free-market approach to doing so.\n\nWhite: Let\u2019s just explain to people exactly what Opportunity Zones are.\n\nScott: The short answer is, Opportunity Zones are aimed at folks who are willing to make a long-term investment in one of the distressed communities around our country ... If you will make a long-term investment in one of these zones, then you can defer\u2014you don\u2019t eliminate, but you defer\u2014your capital gains tax for up to 10 years, or through the year 2026. So it\u2019s a phenomenal incentive for people to take a second look at areas that they would not necessarily pay attention to because they would feel like the return is too low, or the risk is too high.\n\nWhite: OK. And then when we\u2019re talking about these Opportunity Zones, I think you referenced a number, 50 million, as in the number of people that could be impacted by this. How does it break down between rural and urban? A lot of times, when we\u2019re talking about economic opportunity and inequality, there\u2019s a tension there.\n\nScott: Ben, that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ve been on a national opportunity tour. I\u2019ve gone to states like West Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire, that have large rural populations, including South Carolina \u2026 It absolutely works in rural areas, from poverty to the opioid crisis, and in inner cities. It certainly allows for the creation of jobs and, frankly, for a walkable economy, for the ability to walk to work. Its application is universal. As long as there is need, I think the Opportunity Zone legislation provides an answer for those areas.\n\nWhite: Let\u2019s just take South Carolina as an example, since it\u2019s your backyard. What type of business do you see taking advantage of this Opportunity Zone?\n\nScott: Sure. Let me give you just two real-world examples. First would be, in South Carolina, we are a transportation-centric state. So high-tech manufacturing is booming from the coast to the mountains in Greenville. And so you could see the development of a support company for the Boeing Corporation here in North Charleston, whether it\u2019s providing paint for the planes, or rubber for the wheels, or any other aspect of the engineering for the planes, there\u2019s a ton of opportunities out there that you could see. The second example would be, we are heading towards a service economy in South Carolina. So while we\u2019re going to continue to celebrate our success as a manufacturing headquarters, we are, at some point in the future, going to become what we call the \u201cSilicon Harbor\u201d in Charleston, in the upstate. We\u2019re going to have a focus on the jobs of the future. And so you could see a company started in the Medical University of South Carolina spill into an opportunity zone. And as that company grows, you would see how quickly investors might find it attractive \u2026 not only do you have the tax deferral from your initial tax burden, but as your company starts to grow in that zone, that growth is capital gains tax free during those first 10 years of your growth.\n\nWhite: Have you put a dollar figure on how much investment you think that this tax program could generate?\n\nScott: There\u2019s over $1 trillion on the sidelines in the United States that could be deployed. I think a realistic estimate in the first few years would be about $100 billion. Talking with Secretary Mnuchin and others, they see, on the sidelines, $5 billion to $10 billion initially, looking to be deployed in just a few states. The states that I\u2019ve talked to, I would add on top of that number another $10 billion or $15 billion.\n\nSo in the next several months, $25 billion to $30 billion. And in the next couple of years, $100 billion or more.\n\nScott grew up in poverty, spending his high school years living in this apartment complex in North Charleston. He\u2019s now working to bring more investment to disadvantaged communities through Opportunity Zones, a new program enacted as part of the 2017 Republican tax cut package. | Raymond McCrea Jones for POLITICO\n\nWhite: Let\u2019s pull back the lens a little bit to talk about the broader question of access to opportunity in the United States, and the fact that it is so unevenly distributed through our economy. How do you think we got to this point?\n\nScott: I\u2019m a young fellow. Not as young as you are, Ben, but I\u2019m a young fellow. And I will tell you that all my life I\u2019ve seen the same thing play out, and that is that there\u2019s always an uneven recovery. And frankly, there\u2019s typically an uneven success trajectory. There have been communities that have been mired in poverty for generations. And the real question is, how do we break that cycle? One of the ways that you do that is by making sure that the private sector, the free markets, have the ability to operate fully. When that happens, you see the most even spread of our resources. As an example, 10 years ago, the African American unemployment was about 12 or 13 percent. Less than six months ago, it was under 6 percent. Today, it\u2019s in the low 6 percent range. What happens is, as we grow the pie, we see more folks being able to engage in finding and chasing the American dream, which is the fastest way to actually even out the recovery. I think we\u2019ve seen that number improve for every minority group.\n\nSo when you take those dots and you connect them back, what do you find? What you find is that educational success seems to be still a strong indicator of the evenness of this opportunity in America. And so, for me, there are two major pillars. One is the economic pillar. The second is the education pillar. And if our goal is to make sure that we spread opportunities and success throughout this nation in an even way, we have to focus first on the education system, particularly the education system in the poorest parts of this country. A poor education system or a failing school typically leads to higher unemployment. Higher unemployment typically leads to more government services. And frankly, obviously, it leads to lower net worth. The correlation, of course, is that education and opportunity are like wet and water. They are very difficult to separate.\n\nWhite: I want to ask you, more broadly, about what role government can play here. Are there other policy levers that we could be pulling? What else can Washington be doing to kind of work with states to address this problem of access to opportunity?\n\nScott: We could spend a long time talking about education because I think it really is the forerunner to opportunity. Another issue, of course, is the connectivity issue. Broadband and online services are a prerequisite for success in most of America. I think what you\u2019re going to see in the next 10 to 15 years, and you\u2019re seeing it start now, is the fact that people can live where they want to and then decide the type of work they want to do. Our economy is absolutely moving in the direction of people deciding the quality of life they want, the location they want. And then later deciding on the job they want because of the ability to work from home. So the truth is that we\u2019ll probably see more opportunities in rural America than we\u2019ve ever seen before, as people have the chance to pick and choose their site and then their jobs. That is going to be a unique experience for many people in the workforce because, up until now, they really haven\u2019t had that as a real option.\n\nWhite: It\u2019s somewhat ironic that I\u2019m recording this with you and talking to you from my basement in Englewood, New Jersey, even though I work for POLITICO.\n\nScott: In Washington, D.C.\n\nWhite: So I\u2019m a distributed worker and I\u2019m\u2014\n\nScott: And I\u2019m in Charleston.\n\nWhite: \u2014taking advantage of connectivity. Exactly. We are dispersed right now, you and I. Just one more thing on the broad macroeconomic level that I\u2019m interested in: the federal deficit and the national debt, and the fact that we\u2019ve seen the numbers go up pretty significantly. An increase in 17 percent to $779 billion in deficit for the last fiscal year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably hopeful that the tax cuts will pay for themselves long term. But how much do you worry now about that growing deficit and the debt on economic growth and interest rates going forward?\n\nScott: I was at lunch today with some folks and the primary question on their minds was the national debt and how we wrestle with that. One of the things that was clear to most of us at the table is that the tax cuts, so far, have actually increased revenues to the federal government, not decreased it. So we\u2019ve cut taxes, but we always have believed in the Laffer Curve or the inverse relationship. Unfortunately, at the exact same time, what we\u2019re seeing is that spending has not leveled off, it\u2019s not plateaued. It continues to increase. About 70\u2014maybe it\u2019s 67 percent\u201467 percent of the budget is on automatic increase because those are our mandatory spending programs. We are going to have to not look at cutting benefits for our current people. That\u2019s one of the fictional stories that you can find out there. You can actually reduce our long-term exposure without touching current beneficiaries, or, frankly, people within a 10-year window of receiving their benefits from an entitlement perspective of Medicare and Social Security. But we do have to wrestle with the long-term consequences of mandatory spending that we haven\u2019t wrestled with before. But in order for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to do that in a bipartisan fashion or it just will not happen."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "mreynolds@politico.com (Maura Reynolds)", "title": "Who has access to prosperity?

But increasingly, opportunity in America depends on where you live.\n\nThe United States has always had richer communities and poorer communities, but for much of its history, all boats rose together, and the differences between one place and another were diminishing. No longer. Starting around 1980, economic growth began to concentrate more in some communities than in others, and even whole regions began to diverge. Over the next four decades, it was the wealthy places that saw virtually all increases in household income, new jobs and new businesses. Many of the others saw no growth at all.\n\nToday, the geography of opportunity in America has become woefully uneven, and those disparities are a big part of what\u2019s driving the current period of social unease and political discord.\n\nIn this issue of The Agenda\u2014the second installment of our \u201cFuture of Prosperity\u201d series\u2014we tackle the question of how to make sure all Americans have access to the kind of good jobs, affordable housing and reliable transportation that are the building blocks of economic mobility and financial security. The picture is a vivid one, as you can see in our graphic guide to America\u2019s growing inequality. The policy equation involves three factors that aren\u2019t always in alignment: good jobs, affordable housing and reliable transportation to connect them.\n\nTo come up with solutions that both Republicans and Democrats can embrace, The Agenda convened a working group of 14 top-level thinkers, decision-makers and experts from around the country. The discussion, held under Chatham House rules to promote candor, identified several tools federal policymakers can use to promote opportunity in places that need it\u2014everything from credential reform to benefits portability to fixing the sewers. Read about those and more in our eight-page working group report, \u201cThe Geography of Opportunity,\u201d which we\u2019re also publishing as a downloadable PDF.\n\nWe assigned reporters to dive into several factors in the opportunity equation. POLITICO transportation reporter Tanya Snyder explored the transit landscape of one of America\u2019s most iconic and most troubled cities, New Orleans, riding buses and hopping streetcars to report on how federal aid fell short as the city rebuilt from Katrina\u2014and how a new mayor is trying a fresh, jobs-focused approach. POLITICO\u2019s Lorraine Woellert finds that house-buying is an arena becoming more and more tilted toward the \u201chaves,\u201d a challenge that hits young adults particularly hard. And policy writer Danny Vinik uncovers a shortcoming of the Opportunity Zones law, a promising new policy intended to help lift up distressed areas, but with a major hole that may prevent us from ever knowing if it works. And POLITICO housing reporter Katy O\u2019Donnell finds six ways that federal policymakers can help make housing more affordable for middle-class Americans.\n\nFinally, we offer two groundbreaking sets of ideas from policy thinkers for helping Americans get ahead and build wealth. In the first, researchers Joseph Blasi and Maureen Conway explore the difference between income inequality and wealth inequality and provide three out-of-the-box policy solutions for how Washington can help more Americans build the kind of financial assets that provide true economic stability. And Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute argues that the best way to help low-income or nonworking Americans get out of poverty may be for the federal government to subsidize their wages\u2014a policy that would also improve the economies of disadvantaged communities.\n\nWelcome to The Future of Prosperity: Access to Opportunity."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dvinik@politico.com (Danny Vinik)", "title": "The Gap in the GOP\u2019s Economic Plan", "description": "Will \u2018Opportunity Zones\u2019 work?

Tucked into the 2017 Republican tax law, Opportunity Zones, as the program is called, offer huge tax incentives for financiers who invest in downtrodden communities.\n\nThe promising idea has one potentially huge flaw, however: As the Treasury Department finalizes the program\u2019s rules in preparation for its launch in 2019, researchers and economists are increasingly worried that the agency is leaving out critical requirements to track the law\u2019s effects\u2014and as a result, we may never know if Opportunity Zones actually work.\n\nThe new law has attracted attention in policy circles because it\u2019s the most specific thing the Trump administration has done to help \u201cleft behind\u201d areas, and could cost more than $1 billion a year, at least initially.\n\nBut it\u2019s far from a sure thing. Earlier versions of the idea have been tried, with an unproven track record. The Opportunity Zones provision was originally drafted with a requirement for the Treasury Department to provide detailed information on the distressed regions and the impact of investments, but that dropped out when the tax bill was finalized. And when the Treasury Department released its proposed rules for the program last month, it didn\u2019t require investors to disclose much detailed information.\n\nWithout better reporting requirements in this version, critics say, it\u2019s hard to know if the law will have any effect besides saving investors money and draining federal tax revenues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never going to be a really rigorous evaluation of this program,\u201d said Tim Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute. \u201cThere will always be questions.\u201d\n\nFederal programs often pass Congress without any evidence they work, in part because it\u2019s so difficult to collect data on the impact of broad policies. But Opportunity Zones are a trackable scheme, operating in the data-rich field of finance, where investments and returns are all carefully measured by the financial players involved. It appears, however, they won\u2019t need to report those results to Washington.\n\n\u201cThe regulations, as they are right now, don\u2019t include any of the data fields we were hoping for,\u201d said Nick Fritz, an official at the Sorenson Impact Center at the University of Utah, which focuses on improving the social impact of investing. Fritz is optimistic about Opportunity Zones but worries that the lack of data will make it hard to know whether the program actually succeeds.\n\nTax incentives for investing in distressed areas first gained traction in the 1980s, when they were pushed by NFL-player-turned-congressman Jack Kemp as a free-market solution to regional poverty. They were expanded during the Clinton administration, which liked to back ideas that were politically centrist and didn\u2019t sound like \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\nBut despite billions of dollars targeted toward communities\u2014through both direct spending and the tax code\u2014policymakers know little about the results. In numerous studies over the years, some have found small positive gains, others small negative ones. Two major studies, conducted by the Government Accountability Office in 2006 and 2010, concluded that there simply wasn\u2019t enough data to evaluate.\n\nAs a result, many economists are skeptical that Opportunity Zones will do what they promise, helping lift up impoverished areas. Instead, they argue, money will be funneled to areas that are on the cusp of a development boom and don\u2019t need the extra help. Since the zones were designated by state governments\u2014which could designate up to 25 percent of their low-income communities as Opportunity Zones\u2014they also worry that political considerations and lobbying efforts influenced the states\u2019 selection process.\n\n\u201cThe places that got picked got picked for a reason, and the ones that got passed over got passed over for a reason,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has been closely tracking Opportunity Zones. That initial design choice, he said, will make it difficult to fairly compare the results of the program without deeper information on the areas that actually received the investments.\n\nThe program is built on the fact that investors nationwide are sitting on $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains\u2014money that they\u2019ve made in the stock market and other investments but haven\u2019t put to new use because doing so would trigger a tax payment. The new law will allow investors to defer those taxes by rolling that money into \u201cOpportunity Funds,\u201d new vehicles that invest primarily in distressed areas. If they hold that investment for 10 years, any new returns are tax-free. (They do eventually have to pay taxes on the deferred capital gains.)\n\nSupporters believe the law will result in a flood of new investor money into those areas. But it comes at a cost to the government: The Joint Committee on Taxation projects that the tax break will cost $7.7 billion during the first five years, falling to $1.6 billion over a decade as investors pay their deferred capital gains.\n\nGiven the disagreements over the potential for the program, experts on both sides agree that good data is essential. The original bill, introduced by Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) in February 2017, required Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress, starting five years after enactment, with detailed information about how the tax incentive was affecting Opportunity Zones, including which communities and projects actually received investment.\n\nThat section was dropped from the bill when it was inserted into the GOP tax package, however, because the Republican Congress passed the tax law through budget reconciliation\u2014a process that, by Congress\u2019 rules, can include reforms that only affect taxes or spending. The reporting requirement fell outside that boundary.\n\nThat\u2019s left Treasury with broad authority to collect information about the program\u2014or not. The agency\u2019s initial proposal and an accompanying proposed IRS form require Opportunity Funds to provide basic information, such as the name of the fund, and aggregate investment numbers. Those numbers are used to prove to the IRS that investors are actually investing their money in Opportunity Zones, but they don\u2019t provide the granular, transaction-level data that would show which specific tracts and types of projects received money. The omission has left even supporters concerned that limited data will make it harder to grow political support for the program.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the crux of really realizing the power and potential of this incredibly exciting bill,\u201d said Tracy Palandjian, CEO of Social Finance. \u201cWithout an intentional framework about how to think about how to measure the payment over time \u2026 we\u2019re going to be back to the old tales that these things are ineffective.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so concerned. John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a leading proponent of the program, dismissed the skeptics\u2019 concerns that states designated less-needy tracts for investment. He pointed to recent research from the Urban Institute, which found just 3 percent of the selected areas were experiencing substantial socioeconomic improvement. As a result, he said, researchers will be able to analyze the program\u2019s impact, even without the additional data.\n\nLettieri agreed that additional reporting requirements would be helpful and was optimistic that they would be added in the future. But he added that the agency had to craft such requirements so they don\u2019t impose a heavy burden on investors or, worse, require them to turn over proprietary information.\n\n\u201cYou want to avoid implicitly restricting or inhibiting the very things the incentive was designed to do,\u201d Lettieri said, adding, \u201c[The] right balance needs to be struck.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury Department said the agency hasn\u2019t written off the idea and is \u201cconsidering whether the initiative could benefit from a more robust data collection effort in future tax years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe we can spend some time to get this right and still have enough data to analyze its effectiveness,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cOur current focus is on ensuring that the tax incentives of [Opportunity] Zones best serve communities and benefit investors.\u201d\n\nIf the Treasury Department does add new requirements going forward, it won\u2019t be a huge surprise. The agency had a tight timeline for drafting rules and launching the program, forcing it to prioritize some elements of the rollout over others. If reporting requirements are added, researchers will breathe a sigh of relief. Given the long-term nature of the investments\u2014the tax benefits rise substantially as investors hold their investments for longer\u2014a retrospective requirement could be enough to answer their questions about whether it works.\n\nBut, said Fritz, the researcher at Sorenson Impact, the real challenge with later reporting is the effectiveness of the funds themselves. The longer Treasury takes to collect and analyze data, the less investors will know about what types of projects have the greatest impact on low-income communities. \u201cThis limits the ability of municipalities and funds to learn from others' best practices and make sound, impactful investments,\u201d Fritz added.\n\nEven with the best economic data, debates over the effectiveness of public policies are never settled. Despite decades of evidence on minimum wage increases, for instance, researchers are still sharply divided on its impact. In other words, experts suggested, even if Treasury imposes significant reporting requirements on Opportunity Funds, disagreements over such place-based policies will continue\u2014but that\u2019s not a reason to not collect the data at all.\n\n\u201cWill we be able to evaluate the efficacy of this tax expenditure and, in particular, who it\u2019s benefiting?\u201d said Laurel Blatchford, president of Enterprise Community Partners and a former senior official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement and a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nDanny Vinik is a student at the Georgetown University Law Center and former assistant editor of The Agenda.

She remembers startling her co-workers with an audible gasp after she read a headline: \u201cNHS hands over patient records to Home Office for immigration crackdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was aghast,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic trust in a confidential health system is vital.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe article detailed a Memorandum of Understanding between Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), which provides free health care for people living in the U.K., and the Home Office, which handles immigration and keeps track of undocumented immigrants and people waiting for visas or citizenship. In the document, the NHS agreed to send the addresses of specific patients on request to the Home Office to help it carry out its mission to \u201creduce the size of the illegal population, and prevent harm caused by illegal immigrants.\u201d The memorandum contended that there were no legal barriers to the data-sharing practice and stated that \u201cthe public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining confidentiality.\u201d\n\nBut Potter, who treats patients with tuberculosis, thought the memorandum was a disaster, likely to threaten not just her patients, but overall public health in Britain as well. Most of Potter\u2019s patients are immigrants, and she knew that many, legal or not, would refuse to come see her if they thought their home addresses could be handed over to immigration enforcement. Avoiding treatment would be bad for their medical health. It would also threaten the general population, since untreated people can spread diseases to others.\n\nMany doctors and nurses agreed with Potter, and some physicians groups issued scathing statements. British newspapers covered the burgeoning uproar in close detail. Politicians, several of whom were doctors themselves, began writing memos and planning hearings. In the end, the massive pushback forced a change: A dedicated coalition of doctors, immigrant advocacy organizations and politicians was able to get the order rescinded\u2014at least for now.\n\nNearly two years later, a similar push to limit immigrant access to government-provided health care is playing out in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. portion of our story begins in September, when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security responded to an inquiry from POLITICO by posting a plan it had been working on to deny residency to legal immigrants who have benefited from certain government programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. In October, after intense pushback from medical and immigrant groups, DHS published a slightly less restrictive plan in the Federal Register that includes Medicaid as a reason for disqualification, but asks for comments on CHIP.\n\nThere are distinctions between the U.S. and British policies. The proposed American method of taking health care into account while considering immigration applications, for instance, is different from Britain\u2019s use of data-sharing to find immigrants being sought by the Home Office, or scare them away. (A DHS spokesman says the agency does not get information on immigrants from the Department of Health and Human Services.) But the likely result would be the same, U.S. doctors have warned: Immigrants, even those with papers, will avoid the health care system for fear of losing their chance at permanent residency, or having it taken away.\n\nAs the Trump administration embarks on this new effort, a look at Britain\u2019s attempt to mix health care and immigration policy\u2014and the bitter reaction to it\u2014holds some telling lessons for the U.S.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding that so upset Potter was all done in secret, quietly signed by the Home Office, NHS Digital (the data-gathering arm of the NHS) and the Department of Health in November 2016. The idea was that, with the help of NHS records, the Home Office would be able to find the addresses of \u201cimmigration offenders,\u201d people who\u2019d overstayed their welcome or gotten into legal trouble and were now lost to the Home Office, which was interested in arresting or deporting them. The measure was also intended to scare undocumented immigrants away from entering Britain in the first place, or encourage voluntary return to their home countries, other goals of the Home Office under Prime Minister Theresa May. Even before she became prime minister, May repeatedly said she wanted to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for immigrants who lacked permission to be in the country. NHS data collected later showed the agency was on track to deliver 5,200 or more records in 2018; how many arrests have occurred based on that data is unknown.\n\nAt the time of the signing, NHS doctors and nurses weren\u2019t informed. The signers hadn\u2019t consulted Parliament, and there had been no public debate. The existence of the memorandum was only revealed more than three weeks after it went into effect in January 2017, as a result of a journalist\u2019s freedom of information act request. The media jumped on the story with pieces like the one in the Guardian that had shocked Potter.\n\nImmigrant advocate groups, already on alert because of May\u2019s stated intentions, snapped into action to fight against data sharing and its intended effects.\n\nDoctors of the World, whose clinics provide basic primary care separate from the NHS, immediately began warning its patients\u2014many of whom chose the clinics over the NHS because they were already worried about data-sharing\u2014that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be safe going to the NHS for further care. \u201cIt turns out their fears were well-founded,\u201d said Anna Miller, who handles policy and advocacy for the Doctors of the World. The organization also alerted health care providers with an ad in the BMJ (formerly called the British Medical Journal) warning doctors and nurses that the information they were recording from their patients was being used to arrest them.\n\nLiberty, the British equivalent of the ACLU, contacted journalists, blogged, spoke to Members of Parliament, wrote briefing papers and eventually joined a court case. Other groups got active as well, and organizations such as the British Medical Association spoke out against the practice.\n\nSarah Wollaston, chair of the Health Select Committee in the House of Commons, and herself a doctor with the NHS for 24 years, wrote an unusually sharp and direct public letter to the NHS. A Conservative herself, she was questioning the actions of a Conservative government. Did the memo signers consider the impact on people\u2019s confidence in the NHS, and would it discriminate against any groups of people, she asked. Was it done legally?\n\nIn March 2017, NHS Digital replied. Yes, the chief executive, Sarah Wilkerson, assured Wollaston. The memorandum was done correctly, and with all due attention to confidentiality and legal data sharing. It merely put into words what was already being done and made things more efficient. There wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence to say that the policy was harmful to public health, Wilkerson wrote, and there\u2019s a public interest in immigration control. The Department of Health response echoed the NHS response.\n\nBut within the government, another agency checked in on the side of the immigrant advocates. Public Health England, which advocates on public health issues, issued a public statement saying that having NHS Digital share information with the Home Office \u201crisks undermining public confidence\u201d in the privacy of their medical records and the integrity of the NHS, and could have \u201cunintended and serious consequences\u201d to both individuals and the wider community. The statement pointed to reports that fear of being reported had been enough to keep even legal immigrants away from the doctor.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-immigration advocates stayed quiet\u2014no testimony before the Health Select Committee, no ads, no obvious public outreach. Coverage in the media was generally sympathetic to data-sharing opponents, though there was some pro-memorandum coverage from the traditionally conservative Daily Mail Online and the Sun.\n\nAs for Jessica Potter, she quickly wrote an opinion piece so strong her journalist husband suggested she back off a bit. The toned-down version referred to a \u201cgross violation of trust.\u201d A second version, picked up by the Independent, warned readers that they were waking up to a new NHS where patients would be racially profiled and discriminated against.\n\nIn January 2018, a year after the memorandum was signed, the House of Commons\u2019 Health Committee held a hearing to discuss it. Representatives of advocacy groups told the committee about pregnant immigrant women who were already avoiding prenatal care, an immigrant from the DRC who hadn\u2019t come in for mental health care until he was suicidal, and others affected by the new agreement.\n\nThen it was the turn of representatives of the NHS, Home Office and Department of Health. They were not looking for health information, they reassured the committee, just addresses. The immigrants they were after shouldn\u2019t be in the country, and they were using up the resources of the NHS.\n\nUnreassured, the committee, a mixture of liberals, conservatives and moderates, called for NHS Digital to withdraw immediately from the memorandum a couple of weeks later, and cease all data sharing. \u201cWe do not believe that NHS Digital has fully considered and appropriately taken account of the public interest,\u201d committee head Wollaston wrote. She complained that it hadn\u2019t adequately consulted with doctors or representatives of the immigrant community.\n\nThe Home Office stood by its plan.\n\nBut a second hearing three months later, led by a visibly angry Sarah Wollaston, did not go well for the government, with the committee finding the agency had not acted in good faith. Finally, on May 9 of this year, the head of NHS Digital released a statement saying it would supply information only on immigrants who\u2019ve been \u201cconvicted of more serious criminal offences, or are a risk to public security.\u201d The Home Office issued a statement saying it would request data only on foreign national offenders who\u2019d gotten a prison sentence of 12 months or more.\n\nThen, in early November 2018, the NHS, facing a court challenge, canceled the memorandum entirely. But in a statement, it said it is working on a new memorandum with the Home Office, one based on \u201ca different legal basis\u201d for data sharing.\n\nThe initial suspension of the memorandum wasn\u2019t a victory for the advocates of an end to data-sharing. \u201cWe celebrated cautiously,\u201d says Miller of Doctors of the World. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still cautious.\u201d The cancellation, she says, isn\u2019t a promise that the NHS will never turn over data; they\u2019re waiting to see the new memorandum. And even if the new memorandum agrees to limit the data sharing agreement to immigrants convicted of crimes, her group and others are concerned that the final definition of \u201cserious criminal offences\u201d will prove too wide. As for Potter, she half-jokingly says she plans a book, \u201cDiary of a Pissed-Off Doctor.\u201d\n\nAnd so the advocacy groups remain on alert, waiting to see the new plan. Depending on the details, Liberty is ready to take legal action. The NHS and Home Office haven\u2019t announced yet when the details will be released.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., immigrant advocacy groups like the National Immigration Law Center and the Center for Law and Social Policy are encouraging people to comment on the Federal Register plan before the comment period ends on December 10. There are already more than 68,000 postings, which may set a record for comments. Alvaro Huerta of the NILC says that the comments, along with pushback from some state and local governments, will provide the administration with \u201ca wealth of data\u201d showing that scaring immigrants away from Medicaid would, as Jessica Potter in the U.K. said of the situation there, be \u201cnot only inhumane but harmful to society.\u201d If the public response fails, Huerta says, advocates will challenge the plan in court.\n\nJoanne Silberner is a freelance health policy journalist living in London.

After O\u2019Rourke\u2019s narrow loss to Senator Ted Cruz, his Senate campaign staffers quickly leaked their interest in keeping the band together for a presidential primary tour. Democrats from Iowa didn\u2019t waste time inviting him to speak. Even Golden State Warriors basketball coach Steve Kerr posted on Twitter: \u201cBeto 2020.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe hype is based on the premise that even though O\u2019Rourke lost, he nearly won in the largest red state. He helped lift several down-ballot Democrats to victory with a proudly progressive message, a mastery of online media, a relentless campaign schedule and a smile brighter than a solar panel in the Texas sun. He has a gigantic small donor list and oodles of free time, both great resources to fuel a presidential campaign. This is the candidate who can beat Donald Trump with soaring turnout from a multiracial coalition. This is Obama 2.0.\n\nBut before O\u2019Rourke announces a presidential run, he should step out of the echo chamber and consider the possibility that the hype doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s not grade O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign on its own curve. Yes, he made great strides in Texas, earning 48 percent of the vote, 5 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton did in the state two years ago. But two states over in Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema\u2014the only Democratic Senate challenger to win in a Trump state\u2014 posted a similar improvement over Clinton of 4.5 percentage points.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s steady stream of viral video has been credited with his strong youth support. But exit polling shows that O\u2019Rourke and Sinema got the exact same percentage of the under-45 vote. She did better than him with Latinos, as well as whites. And Sinema\u2019s campaign was everything O\u2019Rourke\u2019s was not: robotically centrist and devoid of hipster cool.\n\nLike O\u2019Rourke, she was attacked as a far-left loon, but Republicans had to rely on vintage Sinema clips, because she tacked to the center after joining the U.S. House. In contrast, O\u2019Rourke willingly gave the Cruz campaign fodder, on the logic that he was galvanizing the left base.\n\nWhen O\u2019Rourke said, referring to the anti-racism protests by NFL players, there was \u201cnothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights,\u201d the progressive video site Now This News, declared his answer \u201cperfect,\u201d set it to inspiring music, and generated 20 million views. Then the Cruz campaign used the footage in its own ads, juxtaposing O\u2019Rourke with a veteran who lost both legs in Vietnam who said, \u201cI expect you to stand for me when that national anthem is being played.\u201d Red state Democratic candidates like Sinema who steered clear of the culture wars had better results on Election Day than forthrightly progressive candidates like O\u2019Rourke.\n\nIf O\u2019Rourke had made real inroads in Trump territory, then it would make perfect sense to dispatch him to similar territory across the country as the party\u2019s standard-bearer. But he was crushed in Texas\u2019 more rural, lightly populated counties by a 2-to-1 margin. Where O\u2019Rourke was strong was the five most populous, urban-suburban counties, four of which Clinton and Barack Obama won in the past two presidential elections. O\u2019Rourke improved upon Clinton\u2019s performance in all five counties, including a narrow win in the Fort Worth area that Clinton and Obama had lost. But Clinton had improved upon Obama\u2019s performance in all five counties as well, which suggests that O\u2019Rourke benefited more from the continuation of a demographic shift in Texas than his own charm.\n\nWhat about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s down-ballot coattails? Wasn\u2019t he able to juice Democratic base turnout so much that Democrats flipped two U.S. House seats, two state Senate seats and 12 state House seats?\n\nLet\u2019s not be so quick to give Beto all the credit. All those red-to-blue wins were on urban-suburban turf, the same kind of turf that was fertile for Democrats nationwide. The two U.S. House seat flips in Texas were in districts that Clinton won, districts already primed to turn blue.\n\nOutside Texas, other, less viral Democrats were able to win U.S. House seats in more challenging territory, such as Oklahoma\u2019s 5th District and South Carolina\u2019s 1st District. And Democrats flipped 380 state legislative seats nationwide, including 10 state House and six state Senate seats in North Carolina, and seven state House seats in Iowa\u2014both swing states that went to Trump. No electrifying progressive superstar was at the top of the ticket in any of those four states.\n\nIt was surely better for Texas Democrats to have a viable Senate nominee than not. But after accounting for Democratic victories nationwide, it\u2019s hard to argue that Betomania provided a unique benefit for Democrats in Texas.\n\nYou may say, so what? Regardless of how his 2018 electoral numbers compare with other midterm candidates, Beto has other numbers that prove his 2020 potential: $69 million in campaign cash, more than 800,000 donors and zero dollars from political action committees. Maybe a rhetorically flat centrist, the argument goes, can thread the needle in a Senate or House race, but in a national campaign, such a candidate won\u2019t be able to generate the kind of grassroots energy that O\u2019Rourke can. Furthermore, many people in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s inner circle are likely telling him: This is your moment. And moments are just that, one tick and they\u2019re gone.\n\nO\u2019Rourke may not want to end up like Chris Christie, who passed on his moment in 2012\u2014remember in September 2011 when the New Jersey governor was begged to run by an adoring crowd during an address at the Ronald Reagan Library? By 2016, he had angered conservatives one too many times and fizzled out in New Hampshire.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren also appears to be a cautionary tale. She ignored the calls from the \u201cReady for Warren\u201d PAC in 2016, dousing the dreams of progressives who thought she had the stuff to sell anti-Wall Street populism to middle America. Perhaps Warren will prove the doubters wrong in 2020 and gut out a victory, but it is indisputable that her star has faded in the past two years, eclipsed by the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders and sullied by her own difficulty in responding to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d barbs.\n\nSo why wait? Obama didn\u2019t, even though in early 2007 he had barely begun his first Senate term and nearly everyone assumed Clinton was a lock for the 2008 nomination. On the heels of a wildly successful book tour, he seized his moment and made history. Shouldn\u2019t Beto do the same?\n\nObama is an excellent example of meeting one\u2019s moment. But there are also examples of succumbing to one\u2019s own hype. Marco Rubio was a young first-term senator touted as the fresh face Republicans needed to stave off demographic disaster. But in the 2016 presidential primary, he proved to be in over his head, skewered by Christie as an overly scripted empty suit. He won one state.\n\nOr take John Edwards. Democrats fancied the syrupy sweet-drawling first-term North Carolina senator as the solution to winning back the South. But while he didn\u2019t embarrass himself (at first) like Rubio, neither did he make Democratic dreams come true. Edwards won only one state in the 2004 primary before dropping out. He still generated enough buzz among Democrats to persuade the nominee John Kerry to put him on the ticket (against Kerry\u2019s gut instincts), and then Edwards proceeded to add precisely zero Southern states to the Democratic column. After losing luster, Edwards would try again, but his presidential 2008 bid was quickly overshadowed by the rivalry between Obama and Clinton.\n\nGranted, Edwards didn\u2019t help himself by spending 2007 trying to hide the fact that he had impregnated his mistress while his wife was dying from cancer. But the more important point is that being showered in early hype doesn\u2019t mean much if you can\u2019t live up to it. For years, many Democrats were convinced that Edwards could pick off red states, without much proof beyond his personal charm, a superficial interest in poverty and his lone Senate campaign victory (which is one more Senate campaign victory than O\u2019Rourke has.) In the end, Edwards didn\u2019t have enough substance, not to mention character, to match the image.\n\nObama\u2019s moment came together because he was not only a charismatic campaigner who could build a powerful multiracial coalition, but also because he was on the right side of the 2008 campaign\u2019s dominant issue: the Iraq War. When all the other top-tier Democratic candidates voted for George W. Bush\u2019s war resolution, the then-state Senator Obama was predicting it would be a \u201cdumb war.\u201d And he was able to speak cogently enough about a wide range of foreign and domestic policy issues to beat back arguments that he was a paper-thin, single-issue candidate.\n\nO\u2019Rourke wouldn\u2019t come into the 2020 campaign with a signature issue that would distinguish himself among the sprawling Democratic pack and define his candidacy. The main argument for a Beto campaign comes down to little more than, well, he\u2019s Beto, and people really like Beto. But a successful presidential campaign needs a lot more than that to survive the presidential primary marathon. While it\u2019s possible O\u2019Rourke has what it takes to be Obama 2.0, the risk remains he could be Edwards 2.0.\n\nIf this was truly O\u2019Rourke\u2019s only moment to become president, the logical choice would be to seize the moment. But he has another, more promising path: Stay in Texas first and finish the job of turning it blue.\n\nWhile Texas\u2019 changing demographics may well mean that a Democratic future in the state is inevitable, Democrats still need solid candidates to turn favorable demographic trends into election wins\u2014and good candidates can make the inevitable arrive sooner than it otherwise might. Yet the bench is thin. Despite the relatively good 2018 election, Democrats still have no statewide elected officials in Texas. No Democrat in Texas has a better statewide profile, and statewide campaign apparatus, than O\u2019Rourke.\n\nO\u2019Rourke would have to survive a cage match with about 20 other Democrats if he is to be the 2020 presidential nominee. But the 2020 Senate nomination to run against incumbent Senator John Cornyn is his for the taking. He could literally announce today, immediately clear the Democratic field, and focus like a laser on Cornyn for the next two years.\n\nAnd Cornyn appears ripe for the plucking. Dr. James Henson, who teaches government at the University of Texas-Austin, recently noted Cornyn is \u201cone of the least popular top-tier statewide officials in Texas,\u201d with an approval rating among Texans that\u2019s 28 points lower than Cruz\u2019s. In turn, Henson concluded, \u201cCornyn\u2019s relatively soft support among the GOP base, coupled with presidential year turnout among Democrats, makes Cornyn appear less formidable in 2020 than Cruz in 2018.\u201d\n\nDemocrats will not be lacking in choices in their presidential primary. There will be candidates old and new, left and center, heartland and big city. O\u2019Rourke is not needed there. But in Texas, there is only one Beto.\n\nAnd yes, sometimes people, like Obama and Trump, become president because they catch lightning in a bottle. But others become president after years of toil at the job of governing, like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Even John F. Kennedy, America\u2019s youngest elected president, first accumulated more than a decade of service in Congress. None of those politicians lost their charisma as they gained valuable experience. If Beto truly is a president-in-waiting, he can wait.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Politics\n\nAnalysis\n\n2020"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Jenny Ament", "title": "'I so desperately wanted to do well': Entrepreneur Gazelle Hashemian", "description": "The IT executive's latest venture is the wellness company Blue Flower.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/women-rule-podcast-gazelle-hashemians-1005393", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/e9/d9/33f0857a445bb2ef4296137cf0ca/181119-gazelle-hashmein-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:09:50Z", "content": "IT executive Gazelle Hashemian showed an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, founding a club in high school for immigrant students. | Samineh Photography Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here.

But it\u2019s also a symptom of the leadership bottleneck threatening to shake up the entire Democratic Caucus in January.\n\nWhile relatively obscure, especially compared to the high-profile speaker role, the caucus chair is an important position. In addition to being a launchpad for the future, the job puts the chairperson in the room where decisions are made, giving that member a say in the strategy the Democrats will use as they figure out how to take on President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans in 2019.\n\nLee and Jeffries represent opposite sides of the country and different generations of the party.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said. \u201cSo don\u2019t ask me about that.\u201d\n\nAccording to interviews with more than a dozen Democrats, no clear front-runner has emerged.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s locked down the votes,\u201d said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who predicted that the candidate who works the phones the best during Thanksgiving recess will prevail in the Nov. 28 vote.\n\nThe contest changed significantly the day after Election Day, when Jeffries jumped in and Rep. Linda S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.) dropped out following her husband\u2019s indictment on criminal charges of misusing federal dollars for personal use. But many members said they\u2019ve already pledged to back Lee, and they intend to stand by that commitment.\n\nLee was first elected in 1996 and is perhaps best known for being the lone vote against the Afghanistan War in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. She chaired the CBC, co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus and originally sought the Democratic Caucus chair post in 2012.\n\nAt that time, Lee withdrew her challenge to Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), now the outgoing caucus chairman who was trounced by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), when it became clear he was going to win. However, she ran for vice chair in 2016, losing to S\u00e1nchez by a razor-thin, two-vote margin.\n\nLee, who was born in El Paso, Texas, earned her bachelor\u2019s degree from Mills College in the San Francisco Bay Area and her master\u2019s from the University of California, Berkeley. She served six years in the California State Assembly and a year and a half in the state Senate before she won a special election for her seat in Congress.\n\nLee declared that the days when it would be a problem for two black lawmakers to run against each other are over. And she expressed confidence that she will join the leadership ranks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna win,\u201d said Lee, who added that her \u201cnumbers look good.\u201d\n\nJeffries currently serves as a co-chair of the Democratic Policy & Communications Committee, which helps Democrats develop their messaging operation. Colleagues call him smart, eloquent and aggressive. Jeffries\u2019 biggest weakness is his lack of experience, which he hopes to remedy by snaring the Democratic Caucus post.\n\nJeffries, a Brooklyn native, has a master\u2019s degree from Georgetown University and a law degree from New York University. A former law clerk, Jeffries served six years in the New York State Assembly before he won a spot in Congress, where he has focused on criminal justice reform and economic inequality, two huge issues inside the party. Jeffries was the top Democrat behind a bipartisan prison reform bill that overwhelmingly passed the House this summer. The bill is part of a broader package of criminal justice changes backed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker was a lead author of the Music Modernization Act, a bill governing royalty and copyright laws for songwriters that was signed into law in October.\n\nJeffries is framing the race as an opportunity to bring about the generational change younger members are clamoring for. He has endorsed Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for speaker and expects her to win the gavel. Her deputy, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), is running unopposed for majority leader. Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) is likely to win his race for majority whip after his sole challenger, Diana DeGette of Colorado, withdrew.\n\nBut Jeffries notes that younger members have an opportunity to jump into leadership in open races for assistant Democratic leader, caucus chair and vice chair, and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s gonna be some generational change moving forward,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.\n\nRegardless of who wins, it\u2019ll benefit the CBC, whose members are also poised to serve as majority whip and the chairs of several committees: Oversight and Government Reform, Homeland Security, Financial Services, Education and the Workforce, and Science, Space, and Technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there are three people running and [Lee and Jeffries] are taking votes from one another,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cOne of them will win. So a CBC member will win. It\u2019s good for the CBC.\u201d\n\nRep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.), who is undecided in the race, challenged the notion that Lee\u2019s head start over Jeffries gives her the upper hand. But he agreed that questions about developing the next generation of leadership will come up in the contest for caucus chair.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Hey, you know, you got the top three races that are likely to go to some of our more senior statesmen: Pelosi, Hoyer, Clyburn. Are we doing everything we need to do to make sure we\u2019re developing that next generation?\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cHakeem clearly is in kind of that next generation.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) told CNN she\u2019s supporting Lee, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a woman of color in that position.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Jeffries\u2019 ambition is the only thing standing between Lee and history as House Democrats\u2019 first black chairwoman.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both great candidates,\u201d Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d vote for both.\u201d\n\nConnolly, of course, can\u2019t back both. But even members who have committed to Lee early say choosing between the two is tough. \u201cI told Barbara I was for her,\u201d one member told POLITICO. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be sad if he wins.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "dstrauss@politico.com (Daniel Strauss)", "title": "Mississippi Senate race devolves into racial melee", "description": "One ad showed Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith with black men in nooses.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/20/mississippi-senate-race-cindy-hyde-smith-mike-espy-1002739", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/8e/26/281100714dfb93d80ee7ddbdef0b/181119-poster-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:05:21Z", "content": "Protesters assembled Friday outside Sen.

Democrats and allied outside groups have seized on Hyde Smith\u2019s musings to spur black voters to the polls and paint her as an embarrassment to the state. They\u2019re trying to crack open a narrow path for Democrat Mike Espy \u2014 a Cabinet secretary under Bill Clinton who would be the first African-American to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction \u2014 as a viable alternative.\n\nThe California-based PowerPACPlus political action committee released an ad featuring images of Hyde-Smith and hanged black men in nooses. The Black Voters Matter Fund, a get-out-the-vote group, has been organizing in the state to boost Espy. The Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic Senate super PAC, is pouring $500,000 into the state to help Espy.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s remarks \u201ccreated a lot of indignation among the progressive white community in Mississippi \u2014 which is a small but growing group \u2014 and it has caused a lot of indignation among African-Americans as well,\" said Rickey Cole, a former chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party.\n\n\"Our hope is that contrary to popular belief, instead of turnout going down in this runoff, that black turnout will actually go up,\" added Black Voters Matter Fund co-founder Cliff Albright.\n\nSen. Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed in March to succeed retiring Sen. Thad Cochran. She is the Republican candidate in the special election to fill the rest of his term. | Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo\n\nIn a sign that Republicans are taking the threat seriously, President Donald Trump is set to travel to Mississippi on Monday to campaign for Hyde-Smith. The incumbent senator was appointed in April to succeed Thad Cochran and is running to fill out his term.\n\nDemocrats are working to keep Hyde-Smith's comments in the spotlight while Espy stays mostly above the fray, campaigning on pocketbook issues like health care and college affordability. Hyde-Smith is the undisputed favorite to prevail in the Nov. 27 runoff, but the GOP\u2019s stunning loss in a special election for Senate last year showed nothing is guaranteed.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s comments \u2014 she was caught on video telling a supporter she\u2019d be in the \"front row\" of a public hanging if he invited her, and that perhaps Mississippi should make it harder for \u201cliberal folks\u201d to vote \u2014 are expected to be front and center Tuesday during the only debate between Espy and Hyde-Smith. Her campaign has released statements denying ill intent with either remark.\n\nThough they\u2019re under no illusion about the odds, Democrats say winning in a deep-red state like Mississippi is a bit more realistic after last year\u2019s Senate race in Alabama, when Democrat Doug Jones, buoyed by African-American support, defeated Republican Roy Moore. Mississippi has a larger African-American population than Alabama, and arguably a more active one. African-Americans helped Cochran fend off state Sen. Chris McDaniel in the runoff of a Republican primary for Senate in 2014, allowing Cochran to coast to reelection.\n\nDemocrats estimate that Espy needs at least a quarter of white voters to back him, plus high turnout among African-American voters, to win the race. But according to voter survey data during the first round of voting on Nov. 6, Hyde-Smith had 57 percent of the white vote vs. 21 percent for Espy and 18 percent for McDaniel. Among black voters, Espy had 83 percent backing, while Hyde-Smith received 8 percent and McDaniel had 3 percent. Those figures were based on an analysis by Fox News conducted in partnership with The Associated Press.\n\nThe Democratic brigade isn\u2019t limited to outside groups. In recent days, some of the party\u2019s most popular surrogates to the black community have moved to help Espy. Over the weekend, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) campaigned for Espy in Mississippi. Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu did the same. Next up was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who came to the state on Monday, the same day former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Espy. All of those figures are mulling presidential bids in 2020.\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy, a former Cabinet secretary under Bill Clinton, could be the first African-American to represent Mississippi in the Senate since Reconstruction. | Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo\n\nThe surrogates have used the comments to frame Hyde-Smith as divisive, in contrast to Espy.\n\nLandrieu stumped for Espy among mostly African-American audiences and said it was clear that they were aware of Hyde-Smith's remarks and were offended by them.\n\n\"It reminded them of what the stakes are,\" Landrieu said in an interview Monday. \"It certainly made [the race] a little more high profile than it originally was.\"\n\nHarris, during her swing through the state, said \"racism, anti-semitism, homophobia, these issues are real in this country. \u2026 Let's speak those truths so we can deal with that.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Espy said Hyde-Smith's comments exposed her as a relic of the past.\n\n\"This is 2018. Mississippi is going into the third decade of the 21st century, and we've got to have a senator that will unite everybody, such as myself, not divide,\" Espy said in an interview with Sirius XM. Espy added that \"her comments are hurtful to all of those in Mississippi, white or black.\"\n\nRepublicans remain bullish on the race, but private polling has shown the margin between Espy and Hyde-Smith shrinking.\n\nHyde-Smith's comments, Trump's visit and the recent visits by Democrats popular among African-Americans have both Republicans and Democrats expecting a higher turnout than is typically seen in a special election.\n\n\"That's why Trump's coming in,\" former Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, a top Republican leader before he left the chamber, said in an interview on Sunday. Lott, now a lobbyist, has raised money for Hyde-Smith. He said Trump \u201cwill get massive attention, and it will really make people aware this election is a week from this coming Tuesday and it's big, so don't forget to come out and vote.'\"\n\nFor most of this year, the Mississippi Senate race has been an afterthought for Democrats aiming to elect African-Americans to prominent offices. Their focus was on higher-profile races like Democrat Andrew Gillum's campaign for governor in Florida and Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial bid in Georgia.\n\nBut after Hyde-Smith's comments, Landrieu said, attention has shifted to Mississippi.\n\n\"The elections across the country were winding down. We had the recounts going on,\" Landrieu said. \"I think in Mississippi, certainly African-Americans who were watching the Gillum race or the Abrams race, all of the sudden said, 'We've got one more thing to do here before we finish.'\""}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "smurray@politico.com (Stephanie Murray)", "title": "Rep.

Seth Moulton faces town-hall pushback for opposing Pelosi\n\nAMESBURY, Mass. \u2014 The push by Rep. Seth Moulton against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's bid to become speaker took center stage on Monday night at a town hall in his district, where constituents shouted and interrupted Moulton and one another in a lively debate over the future of the chamber.\n\nMoulton (D-Mass.) and some of his constituents say the midterm elections show that it\u2019s time for new leadership in the House, while his critics on Monday night called his opposition to Pelosi a product of sexism and ageism.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThis election was a call for change,\u201d Moulton told reporters after the town hall. \u201cI think if our party answers that call, that call for change with the amazing victories we had across this country, by just saying we\u2019re going to reinstall the same status quo leadership we\u2019ve had since 2006, for over 10 years, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re answering the call of the American people.\u201d\n\nPelosi, who has represented districts in California for 31 years, previously served as speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011.\n\nDozens among the 150 people crowded into the Amesbury Town Hall pushed back against Moulton\u2019s comments. Several shouted \u201cno\u201d when he said, \u201cThe majority of Democrats want this change.\u201d Some protesters held signs that were green on one side and red on the other. When Moulton or another attendee said something they didn\u2019t like, the protesters held up the red signs to signal disagreement.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe hourlong question-and-answer session rarely strayed from the speakership question. Constituents pressed Moulton on his plan for who should replace Pelosi as party chief in the House, while a few thanked him for calling for change.\n\nThe congressman, who has floated Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) for the post, said a confirmed candidate hadn\u2019t emerged because it is smartest to wait to announce a bid for speaker after it is proved that Pelosi doesn't have the votes.\n\nSo far, more than a dozen House lawmakers have come out against Pelosi for the position, an organizing effort that Moulton said on Monday had been underway for several months. Sixteen congressional members and members-elect signed on to a letter opposing Pelosi that surfaced Monday afternoon. Among them were Moulton and Rep. Stephen Lynch, another member of the Massachusetts delegation who has had a testy relationship with Pelosi over the years.\n\nPelosi, who has been on a charm offensive to win over new lawmakers, told reporters last week that she\u2019d be speaker \u201cno matter what he says,\u201d referring to Moulton.\n\nMoulton has voiced opposition to Pelosi since November 2016, just after the election of President Donald Trump. At that time, Moulton signed on to a letter from several dozen House Democrats who called for new leadership, even though months earlier he\u2019d sent a glowing letter to Pelosi thanking her for his spot on the Armed Services Committee, according to a Boston Globe report.\n\nA teenage constituent was brought to tears on Monday while asking Moulton a question about gun violence in schools. Moulton said the inaction in Congress on issues like gun reform and climate change, and his push for new leadership, took on a new meaning for him when his daughter was born earlier this fall.\n\nAfter the midterm elections two weeks ago, Moulton led the charge to oust Pelosi. Less than 24 hours after the polls closed, he was on a 90-minute call with other House members to discuss leadership options besides Pelosi.\n\nMoulton\u2019s political brand is built on challenging the establishment. He beat a longtime incumbent, Rep. John Tierney, in his 2014 primary, and hasn\u2019t had a Democratic challenger since.\n\nThat could change in 2020 if some members of the party have their way. The fight for speaker has sparked several calls for a new candidate to challenge Moulton in the next primary. Organizers are considering using Crowdpac, an online platform that raises money for Democratic and independent candidates, to support a Moulton challenger.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat says he isn\u2019t worried.\n\n\u201cI won by a primary. Primaries are good,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I hadn\u2019t taken on a primary challenge myself. That\u2019s what elections are all about, and that\u2019s exactly the attitude that we should have right now. I think it\u2019s sort of ironic the same people saying they should primary me are saying we shouldn\u2019t have that primary we\u2019re having right now in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nBut if Moulton runs for a different office in 2020, that will foil plans to challenge him. Additionally, many of Moulton\u2019s constituents aren\u2019t enrolled as voters, meaning a challenger to his left could be a hard sell in a Democratic primary. For his part, Moulton says he\u2019s focused on changing the leadership in the House, and is \u201cabsolutely\u201d running for reelection in 2020.\n\nThe Monday night protest at Moulton\u2019s town hall was organized by artist Isa Leshko and Bambi Snodgrass, director of Freedom North Shore, a women\u2019s group that came out of the Women\u2019s March. A longtime progressive, Leshko said Monday night\u2019s protest was her first time organizing. She told Moulton his call for new leadership felt like a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to women, and pointed out that the letter calling for new House leadership that surfaced on Monday included signatures from only two female lawmakers.\n\n\u201cHow can you say you have this huge outpouring of female support for new leadership?\u201d Leshko asked.\n\nAnother constituent told Moulton that criticism of Pelosi felt personal. \u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m targeted,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m old and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d\n\nBut Moulton denied that his call for a new party leader was based on gender or age.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of sad people have turned this into a sexist argument, because women have been leading it from the very beginning,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nHe pointed to Rep.

There will be one town hall for each of the \u201c5 rights\" on Steyer's platform: the right to an equal vote, to clean air and water, to learn with pre-K education through college, to a living wage, and to health.\n\n\u201cThese rights should be the basis of the Democratic Party\u2019s platform,\u201d Steyer wrote on his updated site in what was referred to internally as a \"preamble.\" \u201cTogether, we will achieve these rights for all Americans.\u201d\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Armed with the 6 million-plus person email list gained from his $50 million Need to Impeach campaign, NextGen America\u2019s grass-roots resources and lists, and an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion to dig into, Steyer would immediately start out with a potentially potent political machine.\n\nBut before that can happen, Steyer wants to define himself beyond calls for impeachment and lay out a proactive vision for what he wants the world to look like, with Tuesday being the beginning of that process.\n\nPerhaps anticipating that the left will be skeptical of a billionaire former hedge fund manager, Steyer presents himself as something of a disillusioned traitor to his class.\n\n\u201cOver time, I saw private greed overcome public good,\u201d Steyer writes in his preamble. \u201cThe time arrived when I could see that our economy was rigged to funnel virtually all the enormous benefits of our growing productivity to the wealthy and their large corporations, while the vast majority of Americans \u2014 the people who do the work \u2014 gained little or nothing.\u201d\n\nAfter Steyer left his investment firm in 2012, he and his wife promised to give away most of their wealth in their lifetimes. On top of his philanthropic spending, Steyer became the most generous donor in Democratic politics, with more than $280 million doled out over the past three election cycles. He has given millions to candidates and the party\u2019s committees, but he has poured most of his political money into NextGen America and Need to Impeach.\n\nSteyer has always been front-and-center with those groups as he toured field offices, visited college campuses (often with a rented food truck in tow), conducted over 40 town halls the past year, and spoke direct-to-camera in national ads. That activism led to speculation, even among his own staff, that he ultimately wanted to run for office himself. Most of that prognostication centered on statewide office in California, but now he is laying out a national agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are a country divided,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut we have the power to reunite and, once united, the people are unstoppable.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "Zhou Xin | South China Morning Post", "title": "China and U.S. teams bypass Washington and go straight to Buenos Aires for trade talks", "description": "The trade negotiation teams change the venue for high-level talks at the last minute.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/19/china-trade-war-trump-1005613", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/33/dd/0e80006849dfa794dca0df05c3fa/181119-donald-trump-gtty-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:46:17Z", "content": "President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet at the G-20 summit next week. | Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images This story is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post.

It originally appeared on scmp.com on Nov. 19, 2018.\n\nChinese and American trade negotiators have made a last-minute change to their original plans and rescheduled their talks for Buenos Aires instead of Washington, a source who was briefed on the matter has told the South China Morning Post.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Post reported last week that Vice-Premier Liu He, China\u2019s chief trade negotiator and the top economic aide to President Xi Jinping, was planning to fly to Washington for talks with the U.S. delegation, possibly led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nHowever, a person who was updated on the latest changes said the plan had been adjusted after \u201cwork-level discussions\u201d between Beijing and Washington.\n\n\u201cThe latest plan is that the two countries\u2019 trade negotiation teams will meet in Buenos Aires,\u201d the person, who declined to be identified, said.\n\nThe source said the change was partly intended to ensure the talks would have a more direct effect on the meeting between Xi and President Donald Trump during the G-20 summit in the Argentine capital late next week.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Both countries confirmed the meeting.\n\nHowever, the two sides have not released any information regarding the trade team talks.\n\nTrump said on Friday that the U.S. had made progress towards resolving the trade dispute after receiving a response to his demands from Beijing. But he told reporters that it was lacking in four or five key areas.\n\n\u201cChina wants to make a deal, they sent a list of things they are willing to do, which is a large list, and it is just not acceptable to me yet. But at some point I think that we are doing extremely well with respect to China,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said he would proceed with his threat to impose additional tariffs on $267 billion worth of Chinese products if the two countries did not reach a deal, but added: \u201cWe may not have to do that; China would like to make a deal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Xi told the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea on Saturday that China was committed to giving more market access to foreign companies. He urged Asia-Pacific leaders to help protect the global trade system.\n\n\u201cMankind will have to choose between cooperation or resistance \u2014 opening up for mutual benefits or a zero-sum game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHistory has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners.\u201d\n\n"}]
