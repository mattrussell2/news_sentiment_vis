The official described the plan as a workaround to put pressure on Mexico.\n\nInternal strife over the administration\u2019s asylum policies escalated in recent days, with Chief of Staff John Kelly and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vocally opposing a Cabinet order granting the troops deployed at the southern border the right to use lethal force to defend border patrol agents. The pair relented eventually, though the exchange revived speculation that Trump will soon fire Nielsen \u2014 an idea he\u2019s floated to friends and associates since the midterm elections.\n\nTo carry out its latest asylum plan, the administration would likely have to convince Mexico to cooperate \u2014 a difficult task, Quigley said, since Mexico has far fewer asylum officers to handle the influx of refugees. Mexican officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe plan could spell more legal trouble for the Trump administration, which has lost a string of court battles in an effort to stop migrants traveling to the U.S. A federal judge in San Francisco this week temporarily halted a fast-track regulation and presidential proclamation issued Nov. 9 that barred migrants who cross the border between ports of entry from seeking asylum.\n\nImmigration advocates likely would challenge the latest plan. Federal law states that asylum seekers intercepted by border officers \u201cshall be detained for further consideration of the application.\u201d If it\u2019s determined the person does not have a \u201ccredible fear of persecution,\u201d the law says, that person will be \u201cremoved from the United States without further hearing or review.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you get into legally dubious territory,\u201d Quigley said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called migrant caravans a national security threat and dispatched 5,800 troops to the border before the midterm elections. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday bluntly criticized Trump\u2019s attacks on the courts after the president excoriated the \u201cObama judge\u201c who halted his asylum order.\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Roberts said in a statement. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.

It\u2019s become very strong, we\u2019re getting some terrible decisions from the Ninth Circuit as usual. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever had a victory in the Ninth Circuit.

Yet a small group of Washington foreign policy hands\u2014at the State Department, at the Pentagon and in congressional offices\u2014continue to make the case for Turkey as a \u201cstrategically important\u201d partner to the United States. On paper, the country looks good: It sits at the center of many of America\u2019s most pressing foreign policy concerns, it is a member of NATO, it is stable, and it can offer foreign partners access to its airbases and intelligence cooperation. I used to think of all of these as strong points. Now, I think they are mostly overrated, and often available elsewhere.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLast year, a friend of mine took 11 people out for Thanksgiving dinner; nine of them ordered steak, one ate pasta, and only one had turkey. Nothing happened to them. The sun came up the next morning. And so, I\u2019ve been wondering: If, maybe, it\u2019s time to rethink what we eat on America\u2019s national day of thanks (anyone for tacos?), could it also be time to rethink what it means to say the United States has a strategic partnership with Turkey?\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president, it seemed the Turks might warm to him, thanks to his railing on the campaign trail against the American \u201cestablishment,\u201d which Turkish leaders perceive to be unfailingly hostile to Ankara. Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, fist-bumped at a meeting of NATO leaders in July and have spoken warmly about each other. But the U.S.-Turkey relationship still has major fault lines when it comes to Syria, Russia, Iran, the treatment of Americans in Turkey and the fate of Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania resident whom the Turks accuse of masterminding the failed 2016 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Turkey. After Erdogan over the summer refused to release the American preacher Andrew Brunson, whom the Turks had held on terrorism charges since October 2016, Erdogan and Trump exchanged a war of words, and Trump imposed sanctions. When Brunson was eventually released last month, Trump tweeted that he was looking forward to \u201cgood, perhaps great, relations between the United States & Turkey.\u201d Indeed, Trump seems willing to entertain Turkey\u2019s demands that the United States extradite Gulen, despite inconclusive evidence against him. Yet, the Turks\u2019 drip, drip, drip of information about the recent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul likely has not done Turkey any favors with Trump, who seems committed to the Saudis.\n\nWhether or not you agree with Trump\u2019s positions on these particular issues, it\u2019s clear that Turkey today is not proving to be the partner that many of us had long hoped it would.\n\nHere is a thought experiment: If you called turkey, the bird, \u201cchocolate cake,\u201d but described an exceedingly dry meat that is edible only when drenched with gravy and stuffing, would you like chocolate cake? When, three days after Thanksgiving, you are confronted with the choice of either eating chocolate cake\u2019s scarily large drumstick or the cold spaghetti that\u2019s been sitting in the fridge for a week, a normal human recognizes the so-called chocolate cake for what it is and thinks, \u201cYum, pasta!\u201d\n\nYou can play the same game with Turkey, the country. Let\u2019s call it \u2026 \u201cChicken\u201d instead. Chicken is the leading jailer of journalists in the world. Since 2016, Chicken\u2019s government has purged more than 200,000 people\u2014not just journalists but also academics, bureaucrats, scientists and judges, in addition to police and military officers\u2014claiming they all were implicated in the failed coup. Chicken was once thought to be a country that would become a consolidated democracy, but instead it has become an elected autocracy, complete with personality cult around a great leader, with no checks and balances. The judiciary in Chicken has been politicized; the parliament is firmly under the control of the ruling party; and journalists have been bought, intimidated or arrested. In Chicken, government agencies\u2014including once well-respected state news outlets\u2014have become crude instruments to attack critics of the great leader and overwhelm citizens with propaganda.\n\nOn foreign policy, Chicken is in the process of buying an advanced Russian air defense system that could pose a threat to American warplanes, which Chicken also wants for its military inventory. Although Chicken is formally an ally of the United States, its leader has threatened American soldiers in Syria and undertaken military operations against Washington\u2019s Syrian-Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State. In fairness, Chicken quite rightly considers American allies in Syria to be connected to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has been waging war on Chicken since Trump\u2019s first marriage. But there is also the fact that when the United States was trying to maximize pressure on Iran during the Obama administration, Chicken helped the Iranians in the largest sanctions-busting scheme in history. As if this were not enough, Chicken\u2019s agents have been stirring up trouble on the Temple Mount, or Haram al Sharif, in Jerusalem. Regardless of what one thinks about the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the transfer of the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Chicks are being irresponsible.\n\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of the press in Chicken is in the hands of people who support the leader of the country. Those media outlets\u2014known to be particularly close to the presidential palace\u2014have engaged in a relentless campaign of particularly pernicious anti-Americanism, anti-Semitism and conspiracy-mongering. This has consequences. Anywhere from 15 to 20 Americans\u2014all dual nationals\u2014and three Foreign Service Nationals (Chicks working for the U.S. Embassy and its consulates around Chicken) have been arrested on charges, often on the flimsiest of evidence, that track closely with the absurd narratives in the press.\n\nI hope by now I have convinced you that no matter what we call this country\u2014no matter how much we dress it with phrases like \u201cstrategic partner\u201d or \u201cally\u201d\u2014Turkey today is no such thing. Its rulers harbor ambitions to lead the Middle East and the Muslim world in their own right, and chafe at the American-led order in Turkey\u2019s neighborhood that render it a junior partner or an asset whose function is to help advance U.S. interests. This is problematic for Erdogan not just for reasons of pride\u2014though they are surely a factor\u2014but also because Ankara does not share American interests.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Turkey is not an important country or that Washington should break ties with Ankara. There will be times when the Turkish government can be very helpful. Perhaps another analogy will help draw out the point: You know how when your flight takes off at 11 a.m. in one time zone and lands at 2:17 p.m. in another time zone, and you forgot to buy some food before getting on the plane because you are too busy playing on Twitter, and because you are in Economy Plus on United Airlines you still only get peanuts, and when you finally get off the plane, half dizzy from hunger and you are confronted with Panda Express, Bugles from Hudson News, or a turkey and Swiss on ciabatta with Sriracha mayo aioli? It is moments like that when Turkey is invaluable. Like the bird, there are going to be times and places where Turkish and American policies or priorities overlap, making cooperation entirely possible and hopefully constructive\u2014such as in Afghanistan or in checking Russian power in the Black Sea.\n\nYet because the two governments differ on so much, those moments of alignment will likely be episodic. It is tempting to believe that this state of affairs is the product of two presidents\u2014Trump and Erdogan\u2014with unique and strong personalities, and that when their tenures are over, U.S.-Turkey relations will get better. The tone might change, the emphasis on certain issues might be different, but a return to strategic partnership does not seem likely. That is because our two countries do not confront a common threat, domestic political changes are our transforming foreign policies, and our values are diverging, perhaps irrevocably.\n\nErdogan often tells his supporters that the \u201cworld is bigger than five,\u201d referring to the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Turkey clearly has ambitions. It wants to be at the table, not the meal, and it has every reason to pursue this goal. But as long as this comes at Washington\u2019s expense, there is no reason to defend a strategic partnership that isn\u2019t. From now on, instead of pretending about how delicious the big, beautiful Turkey tastes, I\u2019ll be having carne asada, al pastor and carnitas tacos, hold the sour cream.\n\nSteven A.

They were vocally opposed by, among others, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller; Chris Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council; and Brandon Judd, president of the border patrol union. Also present was Vice President Mike Pence, who did not take a stand on the issue, according to one of the people briefed on the debate.\n\nKelly and Nielsen eventually came around to the president\u2019s position, and the bitter dispute ended Tuesday evening when Kelly, on Trump\u2019s orders, signed a Cabinet declaration granting the military the disputed authority. The move ran afoul of the guidance offered by the White House counsel, Emmet Flood, who cautioned that it was likely to run into constitutional roadblocks, according to a second source familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe debate took place in the context of a discussion about how the White House could stem the rising number of apprehensions at the Southern border, a subject that has obsessed and enraged the president.\n\nThe decision to sign the declaration was the result of dozens of White House meetings, and no single discussion was definitive, according to a senior official involved in the conversations. The declaration itself went through dozens of drafts before it was finalized on Tuesday. Kelly was the final hold out arguing against the measure, this person said, adding that Nielsen saw the president\u2019s mind was made up and came around before the chief-of-staff.\n\nThe debate culminated Monday, leading to Tuesday\u2019s signing of the declaration, which vests Nielsen with the power to request military action to protect U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. The final order illustrated the extent to which immigration policy in the Trump White House is engineered by a small group of hawks, including Miller.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

In reality, I have been clear: our agents and officers must have the ability to protect themselves, and to be protected by others, if they face critical situations on the border,\" the statement said. \"I have been and will continue coordinating closely with Secretary Mattis to ensure that our people have the support and protection they need to do their jobs.\"\n\nMattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday that the mission itself had not changed, but that the order gave him the authority to do what was necessary to support border control. Any new action would have to come at the request of Nielsen.\n\n\u201cThe secretary of homeland security has to ask me to do stuff,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cI mean, I now have the authority to do more; now we'll see what she asks me for.\u201d\n\nMattis also suggested he was aware that Kelly had signed the order at Trump\u2019s insistence: Kelly \u201chas the authority to do what the president tells him to do,\u201d Mattis said, adding that regardless of what he himself is asked to do, he will not order troops to violate the law.\n\nIn a separate statement, a White House spokesman did not dispute the details of the call, but stressed the legitimacy of the order.\n\n\u201cThe brave men and women at Customs and Border Protection willingly put themselves in extremely dangerous situations every day to protect Americans and their families,\u201d said deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley in a statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s authorization ensures the Department of Defense can step in to protect those who protect us.\u201d\n\nThe move comes at a time of intense speculation over both Kelly\u2019s and Nielsen\u2019s future in the administration. Since the midterm elections, the president has told friends and associates that he is intent on firing Nielsen, but has yet to make a move. He has criticized her repeatedly for what he views as her weakness on immigration and border issues, matters on which Kelly has repeatedly come to her defense.\n\nKelly has argued, for example, that Nielsen bears no responsibility for the rising number of apprehensions at the southern border, and White House aides speculated that he had signed a declaration he personally opposed \u2014 and that empowered her to take actions she had also resisted \u2014 in another effort to protect her position.\n\nThe president\u2019s move on Tuesday is also illustrative of the extent to which, on immigration in particular, he has stretched the limits of his constitutional powers, preferring to issue executive orders rather than work through Congress. It\u2019s an instinct that has been encouraged by advisers like Miller, who have pointed out that previous presidents have extended the powers of the executive branch further.\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday temporarily suspended an executive order that denies asylum to all migrants who cross the border illegally, and a federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that Trump\u2019s decision last year to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which granted legal status to children brought into the country illegally, was unconstitutional.\n\nSome legal experts are saying the same about Tuesday\u2019s declaration, arguing that it violates the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that prohibits the U.S. military from acting as law enforcement agents on American soil. A White House official said the Justice Department supports the measure, arguing that it is \u201cconsistent with the protections offered to federal personnel ... in prior instances.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s appropriate for the military, and at that point, things like Posse Comitatus obviously are in play,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay in strict accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nThe tense White House meeting came after the commander overseeing the mission at the southern border, Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, told POLITICO earlier this week that the 5,000-plus troops deployed there did not have the authority to use lethal force to protect CBP agents.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized a statement by Defense Secretary James Mattis suggesting he was surprised by the order and had not seen it in advance of its signing. His statement, in which he said he was \u201creviewing that now\u201d was referring not to the order itself, but to how requests from Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen might change the mission of troops deployed at the border."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "lwoellert@politico.com (Lorraine Woellert)", "title": "Religious right to start pressure campaign around criminal justice reform", "description": "The Faith and Freedom Coalition will ask members to flood Mitch McConnell and other Republicans with calls backing the Senate legislation.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/22/religious-right-criminal-justice-reform-1009543", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/77/2b/c6ce12f44f23a25230b581c5af0e/181121-mitch-mcconnell-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:58:38Z", "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is blocking a Trump-approved plan to revamp the criminal justice system. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Religious leaders buoyed by a successful alliance with the Trump administration are readying a pressure campaig\u2026 [+6618 chars]", "fulltext": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is blocking a Trump-approved plan to revamp the criminal justice system. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Congress Religious right to start pressure campaign around criminal justice reform The Faith and Freedom Coalition will ask members to flood Mitch McConnell and other Republicans with calls backing the Senate legislation.\n\nReligious leaders buoyed by a successful alliance with the Trump administration are readying a pressure campaign with a new target: Senate conservatives who are blocking criminal justice reform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, backed by Republicans with evangelical ties such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is blocking a Trump-approved plan to revamp the criminal justice system, the latest priority of religious groups after they focused much of their earlier efforts on stocking the courts with conservative judges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMcConnell so far has resisted efforts to bring to the floor the bipartisan bill that would reduce maximum penalties for repeat offenders and give judges more discretion in handing down prison sentences, knowing it has already created deep divisions within the GOP caucus.\n\nBut religious leaders \u2014 who have the weight of President Donald Trump behind them \u2014 are preparing to pressure McConnell and other senators, such as Cruz and David Perdue (R-Ga.), to change their minds.\n\nStarting next week, the Faith and Freedom Coalition will ask its 2 million members to flood Congress with letters and phone calls, said coalition Chairman Ralph Reed. Religious groups hope they can put enough pressure on Republicans with large evangelical constituencies to get a rare piece of major bipartisan legislation passed in a bitterly divided Congress.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Trump, surrounded by pastors and police officers, endorsed the First Step Act, which Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) have taken lead roles in negotiating. Since then, more than 2,000 church pastors have signed a letter in support, an effort organized by Paula White, a spiritual adviser to the president.\n\nBut lawmakers such as Cruz and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), normally allies of the religious right, have remained outspoken opponents of criminal justice reform, and the effort also drew staunch opposition from Jeff Sessions, who served as Trump\u2019s attorney general until earlier this month.\n\nReforming prisons and sentencing rules have generally taken a back seat to hot-button issues such as abortion for evangelicals. But religious leaders say the subject has been important to them since the 1970s, when Charles Colson, a former special counsel to President Richard Nixon imprisoned for crimes connected to Watergate, launched the Prison Fellowship after finding faith behind bars.\n\nThe fellowship, an outreach program built on the deeply held Christian belief in redemption, has grown into a global organization with an annual budget of nearly $38 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a base issue for conservative Christian voters,\u201d said Craig DeRoche, head of advocacy and public policy at the Prison Fellowship. \u201cThe entirety of the Christian faith is based on a second chance that we all get because of Jesus\u2019 sacrifice.\u201d\n\nThe cause gained traction with fiscal conservatives after the 2008 financial crisis, when Republicans began looking at ways to reduce government spending and seized on the idea of reducing prison populations. Texas, South Carolina, Michigan and other states reduced state prison populations with no adverse effects on public safety, according to a recent study from the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nThe issue gained prominence on the left, too. In 2015, former President Bill Clinton \u2014 whose policies led to the mass incarceration of drug offenders \u2014 called for a bipartisan fix to sentencing rules that swelled prison populations.\n\nIn 2016, every Republican presidential candidate but Trump had a criminal justice reform platform. Even Cruz endorsed giving judges more leeway to set sentences.\n\n\u201cThe religious right has been advocating for prison reform for a while, from the second-chances, Christian-compassion perspective,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar, a director at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cConservative leaders have played a very large part in this.\u201d\n\nThe same evangelicals who voted Trump into office helped win his support for the First Step Act. Religious leaders have been meeting regularly with Vice President Mike Pence and worked closely with White House adviser Jared Kushner, who has made the criminal justice system one of his main issues.\n\nBut in the Senate, tensions remain high between Republicans. A disagreement between Sens. Cotton and Mike Lee (R-Utah), who supports the First Step Act, spilled into public view this week.\n\nFaith leaders said they want to get the Senate\u2019s attention before Tuesday\u2019s party caucus lunches. They plan to send texts and emails to followers starting next week, urging them to send letters and make phone calls pushing their representatives to back the Senate deal. They also plan to ask for help from megachurch pastors in states represented by conservative senators who threaten to impede legislation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider the First Step Act to be a compromise solution to everything that ails the criminal justice system,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical step toward bringing the American criminal justice system closer in line with what we consider to be a biblical model of a more redemptive justice system.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll also reach out to sympathetic liberals, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who want to see sweeping criminal justice reform and would like to see the First Step Act go further.\n\nSome supporters of the current effort are worried that if it doesn\u2019t pass in the lame-duck session of Congress before the end of the year, Democrats who take over the House in 2019 might try to add provisions to the bill that would threaten conservative support. But Reed and other religious leaders said they aren\u2019t banking on the First Step Act to pass in the next few weeks and are planning to keep up the pressure into 2019.\n\nPrison Fellowship also has been conducting focus groups and surveys of church leaders and churchgoers to gauge support for criminal justice reform, and they\u2019ll remind conservative lawmakers that many in their base support change.\n\nA June 2017 survey by the group found that practicing Christians and evangelicals were more likely than the general public to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that the goal of the justice system should be returning inmates to society.\n\n\u201cThe faith community sees this as a long-term investment in a top issue,\u201d DeRoche said. \u201cThis is not a one-off thing.\u201d\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "drubinstein@politico.com (Dana Rubinstein)", "title": "Ocasio-Cortez takes on the Amazon fight in New York", "description": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made no secret of her opposition to the deal.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/22/amazon-hq-2-new-york-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-1012546", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/fd/a4/34ae06f149428339a820a620aee3/181121-aoc-ap-773.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:56:03Z", "content": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has no hard tools at her disposal to influence the outcome of the Amazon deal, but she can draw on her army of supporters. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo NEW YORK Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is assuming a leader\u2026 [+5223 chars]", "fulltext": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has no hard tools at her disposal to influence the outcome of the Amazon deal, but she can draw on her army of supporters. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Technology Ocasio-Cortez takes on the Amazon fight in New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made no secret of her opposition to the deal.\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is assuming a leadership role in efforts to combat Amazon\u2019s plan to build a new headquarters in Queens, an initial test of the incoming House freshman's clout in her home city.\n\nThe 29-year-old progressive darling headlined a closed-press, standing-room-only meeting of activists in lower Manhattan on Monday, near the site of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park. The meeting\u2019s purpose, according to those who attended, was to strategize about how to kill Amazon\u2019s deal to build a headquarters in Long Island City \u2014 a deal that proponents say would bring at least 25,000 well-paying jobs in exchange for roughly $3 billion in subsidies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOcasio-Cortez did not explicitly say she wanted the deal to die, according to two attendees.

The only local politician who has real leverage appears to be state Sen. Michael Gianaris, who could theoretically kill the deal via an obscure state review board.\n\nBut she does have the ability to energize the same organizers who helped her defeat Queens County boss Joe Crowley, a stunning upset that catapulted Ocasio-Cortez into the realm of national Democratic royalty. And those organizers are already talking about unseating New York politicians they deem too friendly to Amazon.\n\nThe instant outrage that greeted Governor Andrew Cuomo's and Mayor Bill de Blasio's announcement that Amazon would come to Queens appeared to take both politicians by surprise. Critics of the deal point to the absence of a meaningful oversight role for the New York City Council, Amazon\u2019s anti-union record, its talks with ICE about facial recognition technology, out-of-control gentrification and the deal\u2019s inclusion of a helipad.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who declined comment for this story, has criticized the deal from the start.\n\n\u201cFrom Minnesota to NYC, everyday people all over the country are organizing to resist Amazon\u2019s predatory practices on working class communities,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday, referring to a successful effort by Amazon workers near Minneapolis to exact concessions from management.\n\nOn Tuesday, POLITICO reported that a former Ocasio-Cortez staffer, Jake DeGroot, responded to a local assemblywoman's support of the Amazon deal by saying, on her Facebook page, that she should consider her job at risk. \"Get ready for your 2020 primary challenge,\" DeGroot wrote.\n\n\"People are activated in a durable way,\" DeGroot, a lighting designer, told POLITICO in a subsequent interview, while making clear that he was speaking for himself, not Ocasio-Cortez. \"And I think local and state politicians, and anyone who downplays that or minimizes the impact that could have, could be doing so at their own peril.\"\n\nAmazon\u2019s future campus on Long Island City does not lie within Ocasio-Cortez's district, as she acknowledged Monday. It\u2019s in the district of Rep.Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), who supports the deal and sat on the dais during the press conference announcing it. However, two of the district\u2019s three local officials are stridently opposed.\n\nNeither of the two who oppose it \u2014 Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer \u2014 attended the Monday meeting in lower Manhattan.\n\nBut the jam-packed crowd did include representatives from: the Ocasio-Cortez-allied Democratic Socialists of America; the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (whose leader happens to be in London for an unrelated anti-Amazon organizing event); Queens Neighborhoods United; and CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities.\n\nJonathan Westin, whose group New York Communities for Change helped organize Monday's meeting, was surprised both by the turnout \u2014 \u201c100 people from 40 to 50 different groups\u201d with 48 hours' notice \u2014 and the multiple reasons activists elucidated for opposing a deal that city and state leaders tout as a boon for New York City, and for Queens in particular.\n\nSupporters of the deal contend that Ocasio-Cortez is in the wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unfortunate that instead of spending the energy to get the best benefits possible for the local community out of this potentially transformative economic development project, [Ocasio-Cortez] is instead trying to kill 25,000 good-paying jobs and it\u2019s not even in her congressional district,\u201d said one establishment Democrat who supports the project and requested anonymity to avoid further politicizing the issue.\n\nActivists plan to follow Monday\u2019s meeting with a \u201cbig march\u201d next Monday in Long Island City, Westin said.\n\n\"It\u2019s uniting so many different people,\" Westin said. \"I think people were completely unprepared for how much anger this has caused.\"\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "bcheney@politico.com (Brendan Cheney)", "title": "Bloomberg\u2019s 'stop-and-frisk' legacy would complicate presidential bid", "description": "Even though Bloomberg poured millions of dollars into helping Democrats retake the House this year, he could face a backlash from progressives should he run.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/11/22/bloombergs-stop-and-frisk-legacy-would-complicate-presidential-bid-707075", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/3f/e7/a1f945db44b388c2c8101f50856a/170409-mike-bloomberg-ap-51294841507.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:02:44Z", "content": "The stop-and-frisk policy goes to the heart of the police abuse debate that has been lighting up Democratic circles throughout the country in recent years. | AP Photo NEW YORK Mike Bloombergs tortured history with stop-and-frisk policing is shaping up to be a\u2026 [+11909 chars]", "fulltext": "The stop-and-frisk policy goes to the heart of the police abuse debate that has been lighting up Democratic circles throughout the country in recent years. | AP Photo Bloomberg\u2019s 'stop-and-frisk' legacy would complicate presidential bid\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Mike Bloomberg\u2019s tortured history with \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing is shaping up to be a hurdle as he flirts with a potential presidential run as a Democrat.\n\nWhile often touted as contributing to a precipitous drop in crime in New York City, the controversial policy that Bloomberg presided over during his time as mayor disproportionately affected black and Latino men and is widely condemned in liberal circles as a civil rights violation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo even though Bloomberg poured millions of dollars into helping Democrats retake the House this year, he could face a backlash from progressives looking to make racial justice issues a centerpiece of the 2020 primary fight, should he decide to run as a Democrat.\n\n\"When you couple [stop-and-frisk] with him being out of step with where the party increasingly is on things like taxes, universal healthcare and financial regulation, along with a more progressive base of the party having a louder voice, it creates challenges and obstacles he frankly didn\u2019t have to navigate in his mayoralty,\" says Neal Kwatra, a Democratic operative who has worked on the campaigns of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nBloomberg's approach to the issue appears to be evolving, though he defends his legacy \u2014 to the surprise of some liberals.\n\n\"The evidence is clear that stop-and-frisk was not what drove the decline in crime. It did drive a huge number of African-American and Latino young men being detained for having done nothing at all,\" says New York City Council Member Brad Lander, who clashed with Bloomberg over the policy. \"I don't know why anyone would continue to support it, especially someone running in a Democratic primary in 2020.\"\n\nThe stop-and-frisk policy goes to the heart of the police abuse debate that has been lighting up Democratic circles throughout the country in recent years. Under Bloomberg, New York City police conducted so-called Terry stops \u2014 where an officer stops a passerby, subjects them to questioning and a possible search \u2014 often on flimsy grounds, with little accountability, of mostly black and brown men.\n\nNone other than President Donald Trump, whom Bloomberg would seek to topple, recently praised the tactic, saying it should be instituted in Chicago. That endorsement was likely a troubling one for Bloomberg, who plans to make a decision on his presidential run by January.\n\nJust two months ago, Bloomberg \u2014 who was elected as a Republican and became an independent in 2007 \u2014 continued to take a hard line on the practice. \u201cI think people, the voters, want low crime,\u201d Bloomberg told The New York Times when asked about stop-and-frisk. \u201cThey don\u2019t want kids to kill each other.\u201d\n\nAnd in a statement to POLITICO Wednesday, the billionaire former mayor sought to explain why he so aggressively pursued the tactic when he first took over as mayor in 2002.\n\n\"New York City had 650 murders a year when I came into office, and the toll fell heaviest on black and Hispanic young men,\" Bloomberg said. \"We were determined to do everything possible to stop gun violence, both by taking guns off the street and by taking on the NRA \u2014 when few other elected officials were willing to do that.\"\n\nThe mayor touted steep drops in crime, \"while also reducing the number of number of people who were incarcerated.\"\n\nBut in a reversal of his long-standing stance on the practice, which he defended just two months ago in an interview with The New York Times, Bloomberg took credit for a decline in police stops during his final years as mayor \u2014 the first time he's appeared to embrace that part of his legacy.\n\n\"The history of the decline in police stops is misunderstood,\" Bloomberg said. \"As crime hit historic lows, and more than a year before any court ruling, I pledged to a Sunday congregation in Brooklyn and to all New Yorkers that 'we must and will do better' by reforming police practices while continuing to drive down crime. And that's exactly what we did, on our own accord. We cut police stops by 94 percent, while continuing to reduce crime and incarceration.\"\n\nRecent police data shows little to no correlation between a decline in police stops and a surge in major crime.\n\nThe number of reported police stops have dropped by a total of 98 percent since their peak in 2011. In that time, homicides have decreased 43 percent, while major index crimes have declined 9 percent.\n\nThe current mayor, de Blasio, likes to take credit for the decline in stops, but police data indicates the sharpest drop in police stops came between the middle of 2012 and the end of 2013, decreasing 94 percent during the waning years of the Bloomberg administration.\n\nIn May 2012, then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly sent a memo to New York City police officers telling them that they should not racially profile when conducting stops. A former police department executive under Bloomberg said that police officers were responding to pressure from the public, though, and not necessarily an official change in policy. All of the negative attention made them wary of making and reporting the stops, the source said.\n\nNew York City Council Members Lander and Jumaane Williams came to the Council in 2010 when stops had reached their peak and played a central role in ratcheting up that public pressure. Both men led efforts to rein in the police department and fought a war with Bloomberg to tamp down the practice.\n\n\"With all the information and data that we had, he still refused to accept that this policy was wrong and that was very frustrating,\u201d Williams said in an interview. \u201cWe had to spend a lot of energy and time pushing back instead of working together to make it a safe city like it is now.\"\n\nLander expressed bewilderment that Bloomberg until recently still stood behind a policy that current data shows has little correlation to a drop in crime.\n\nRegardless of how or why the stops declined, the damage has been done for Bloomberg among a key demographic of the Democratic party, observers say.\n\n\u201cStop, question, and frisk \u2014 it\u2019s not just the act itself, it\u2019s sort of the psychological damage that it does not just to the individual but to full widespread communities,\u201d said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University. \u201cThat\u2019s the piece that Bloomberg either doesn\u2019t understand, or doesn\u2019t care about, or a combination of both.\u201d\n\nAnd even if the billionaire former mayor appears to be taking credit now for a decline in stops, he\u2019ll have a hard time squaring his past positions.\n\nFollowing the passage of two bills by the City Council in 2013 that sought to reign in the practice further \u2014 with one creating an inspector general for the NYPD and the other allowing people to sue for racial profiling \u2014 Bloomberg said it could be argued that police were stopping too few people of color and too many whites.\n\nIn August 2013 a federal court ruled that the NYPD\u2019s policy was violating constitutional rights. Bloomberg, at the time, said he wasn\u2019t going to change tactics overnight and he hoped the appeal process would allow the current practice to continue through the end of his administration.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying,\u201d he said then.\n\nTime would show that decreasing the stops dramatically did not result in mass carnage on the city\u2019s streets.\n\nIn fact, scholars and law enforcement experts can only speculate as to why homicides and major crimes have been decreasing in New York City and around the country since the early 1990s. There have been dramatic differences in local and national administrations and policies since then. And academic research has only found, at most, small relationships between crime and stops.\n\nIn a 2012 paper on police stops and robbery and burglary rates, Richard Rosenfeld and Robert Fornango said that \u201cif there is an impact, it is so localized and dissipates so rapidly that it fails to register in annual precinct crime rates, much less the decade-long citywide crime reductions that public officials have attributed to the policy.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating Bloomberg\u2019s position is that it is unclear exactly why the number of stops declined. Some insiders and observers POLITICO spoke to attributed the decline to public pressure. A former police official said the attitude inside the department changed, and that filtered down to officers.\n\nUnder the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, a police officer is allowed to stop a person for questions without violating his or her Fourth Amendment rights if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the individual has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.\n\nThe interactions are sometimes called \"Terry stops,\" street stops, \u201cStop and Frisk\u201d or \u201cStop, Question and Frisk.\u201d And the officer can frisk someone if they have a reasonable suspicion that they or someone else is in danger.\n\nThe tactic gained significant attention in New York City in the mid and late 2000s as the number of reported stops skyrocketed. In 2004, the NYPD reported roughly 80,000 stops per quarter, on average. In the first quarter of 2012 the NYPD made 203,500 stops.\n\nAfter that, even as Bloomberg defended the practice, stops began to plummet. By the last quarter of his term, the city reported less than 12,500 stops.\n\nBut Bloomberg never seemed to want credit. De Blasio seized on the issue as part of his successful \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d campaign and stop and frisk helped propel the underdog candidate to City Hall.\n\nJust two weeks into de Blasio\u2019s new administration, his first police commissioner, Bill Bratton, said the stop-and-frisk problem had already largely been solved.\n\nThe reality behind the decline in stops is likely a combination of many factors.\n\nIn early 2007 The New York Times reported on police stop numbers released for the first time in years, finding there had been more than 500,000 stops in 2006.\n\nWithin two years, the first of three court cases targeting stop and frisk were filed. In 2008, Floyd et al v. the City of New York, challenged the NYPD\u2019s \u201cstop, question and frisk\u201d policies and practices. Davis v. City of New York, filed in 2010, challenged stops and arrests for criminal trespass in NYCHA buildings. And Ligon v. City of New York, filed in 2012, challenged the NYPD\u2019s criminal trespass enforcement in and around private apartment buildings.\n\nThe City Council then got in the game passing bills restraining the department in 2013, but by that point, stops had decreased 71 percent compared to early 2012. Bloomberg vetoed the bills but the Council overrode the bills in August.\n\nOn May 16, 2012, federal Judge Shira Scheindlin granted class-action status to Floyd. The next day Kelly sent his memo to the department. The stops started to show a dramatic decline after that.\n\nRoughly a month later, Bloomberg did admit in a speech at a church in Brooklyn that the policy needed to be changed but has since then doubled down on the policy.\n\nIn August of 2013 Scheindlin ruled in the Floyd case that the policy as the NYPD was practicing it was violating constitutional rights. Although some attribute the decrease to the court decision, stops had already decreased roughly 90 percent from the peak the year and a half prior.\n\nAlso that month, de Blasio released a television ad featuring his son saying his father would be the only one to end stop-and-frisk era. The ad is considered a significant factor in de Blasio\u2019s primary victory.\n\n\u201cThis is the period in which not only was litigation at its most intense point, but also the most negative press around the issue and NYPD practices was really in that same time period,\u201d said Darius Charney, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights and the lead counsel on the Floyd case.\n\nBut political perception trumped the data, fueled in part by Bloomberg\u2019s continued stubbornness on the virtues of stop and frisk. Perhaps more than any other single issue, de Blasio was able to use the practice to great effect in the \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d narrative that propelled him to the mayoralty.\n\nGloria Pazmino contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "jgerstein@politico.com (Josh Gerstein)", "title": "DNC seeks to have Carter Page suit thrown out", "description": "Among other things, the Democratic National Committee claims the ex-Trump adviser filed the lawsuit in the wrong place.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/22/democrats-carter-page-1012548", "urlToImage": "https://static.politico.com/34/9a/ff64d4e742abb04e0096577e14e7/170303-carter-page-ap-1160.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:58:21Z", "content": "Carter Page has accused two attorneys acting on behalf of the Democratic National Committee of providing reporters with information that defamed him. | AP Photo The Democratic National Committee and two of its top lawyers have asked a federal judge to toss ou\u2026 [+4288 chars]", "fulltext": "Carter Page has accused two attorneys acting on behalf of the Democratic National Committee of providing reporters with information that defamed him. | AP Photo Legal DNC seeks to have Carter Page suit thrown out\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and two of its top lawyers have asked a federal judge to toss out a lawsuit former Trump adviser Carter Page filed last month claiming the attorneys and the party libeled him through opposition research painting him as an agent of Russia.\n\nIn a motion filed Wednesday in federal court in Oklahoma City, the DNC, attorneys Marc Elias and Michael Sussman and their law firm, Perkins Coie, unleashed a fusillade of technical and substantive attacks on Page\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe 46-page filing also seeks to shoot down some of Page\u2019s more extreme claims, like an assertion that he is the victim of \u201cterrorism\u201d and that the conduct of the DNC, Elias and Sussman amounted to racketeering under federal law.\n\nHowever, the main thrust of the defense motion is that Page\u2019s suit is fatally flawed, particularly because he filed it in Oklahoma, and none of the parties appear to have strong ties to the state.\n\n\u201cDefendants deny the baseless allegations set forth in the Complaint. But Defendants need not address Page\u2019s bizarre and speculative narrative here because even if Page could state a viable legal claim based on the vague facts alleged, this decidedly is not the appropriate forum in which to do so,\u201d wrote the defense team, headed by former Obama White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler.\n\nPage\u2019s suit alleges that Elias and Sussman \u2014 acting on behalf of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 gave reporters information that led to the publication of a September 2016 Yahoo News article calling attention to Page\u2019s dealings with Russia as an energy consultant. The suit also blames the DNC, the attorneys and their firm for BuzzFeed\u2019s public release in January 2017 of a so-called dossier on alleged links between Russia and various figures in Donald Trump\u2019s camp.\n\nThe DNC argues that Page\u2019s claims of damages to his business are dubious because he has repeatedly acknowledged and boasted about extensive connections in the energy sector in Russia.\n\n\u201cAs Page makes clear throughout his Complaint, Page has significant business and political ties to Russia,\u201d the DNC lawyers wrote. \u201cFar from believing such Russian contacts were embarrassing or defamatory, Page believed they were an \u201chonor,\u201d and sought out and cultivated these connections. That these ties to Russia were also of significant interest to media publications and law enforcement due to the allegations (and conclusions) of Russian hacking does not \u2014 of themselves \u2014 make them defamatory.\u201d\n\nPage declined to comment on the DNC's filing, but referred a reporter to another court submission this week disputing many of the DNC's arguments.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s formal response to the litigation says that Oklahoma is not the place to sue over the Yahoo and BuzzFeed stories, even if they were readily available to readers there via the internet.\n\n\u201cNothing in the record demonstrates that Defendants were aware of Page\u2019s tenuous connection to Oklahoma, and \u2026 there are no facts alleged to suggest that Oklahoma was the \u2018focal point\u2019 of either the story or of the harm Page purportedly suffered,\u201d wrote the DNC attorneys.\n\nPage previously filed a similar suit in federal court in Manhattan, naming as defendants Yahoo\u2019s parent company, Oath, and the entity that runs the Voice of America, the Broadcasting Board of Governors. A judge dismissed that suit in March.\n\n\u201cPage attempts to re-package the same deficient claims and assert them against different parties. But his allegations fare no better, and the same outcome \u2014 dismissal with prejudice \u2014 is appropriate in this case,\u201d the DNC lawyers wrote.\n\nThe suit is assigned to Chief U.S. District Court Judge Joe Heaton, a George W. Bush appointee. He has yet to schedule a hearing in the case.\n\nPage has become kind of cause celebre for some GOP lawmakers, who view him as a victim of a politicized process to gather intelligence on Trump allies in advance of the 2016 election. In February, Trump declassified a House report detailing surveillance Page was put under through court orders obtained by the FBI. In July, highly sensitive court applications the FBI made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were made public.\n\nThe unusual releases led to heated charges and counter-charges about whether the FBI properly disclosed all it knew about the political origins of some of the allegations behind the complaint.\n\n\n\n"}, {"source": {"id": "politico", "name": "Politico"}, "author": "ANDREW GLASS", "title": "President Kennedy assassinated in Dallas, Nov. 22, 1963 - Politico", "description": "Politico President Kennedy assassinated in Dallas, Nov. 22, 1963 Politico Shortly after noon on this day 55 years ago, John F.

A priest was summoned to administer last rites, and at 1 p.m., JFK was pronounced dead. He was 46 years old.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKennedy\u2019s body was taken to Dallas\u2019 Love Field and placed on Air Force One. Before the plane took off, a grim-faced Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the presidential oath of office administered by U.S. District Court Judge Sarah T. Hughes in a front compartment of the Boeing 707.\n\nLess than an hour earlier, police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald, a recently hired employee at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald was held as a presidential assassin and for having fatally shot, shortly afterward, J.D. Tippit, a Dallas police officer.\n\nTwo days later, a Sunday morning, Oswald was being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail. Viewers watching live television coverage saw Oswald shot at close range. The assailant was identified as Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. Oswald died two hours later at Parkland. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, although the verdict was later overturned on appeal. Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\n\nOn that same Sunday, the slain president\u2019s flag-draped casket was moved from the White House to the U.S. Capitol on a caisson drawn by six gray horses, accompanied by one riderless black horse. At Jackie Kennedy\u2019s request, the cortege was modeled on the funeral of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Silent crowds lined Pennsylvania Avenue, and many people wept as the caisson passed.\n\nDuring the 21 hours that the president\u2019s body lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda, some 250,000 people filed by to pay their respects. Some waited to do so in near-freezing temperatures for as long as 10 hours in a line up to 10 people wide that stretched 40 blocks.\n\nAbout 1 million people lined the route of the funeral procession, from the Capitol to the White House, then to St. Matthew's Cathedral, and, finally, to Arlington National Cemetery. Tens of millions more followed the funeral on their black-and-white television sets. Those who watched the funeral on television were the only ones who saw the ceremony in its entirety. The nation\u2019s three networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, used at least 50 cameras for their joint coverage to allow viewers to follow the proceedings in their entirety from the Capitol to Arlington.\n\nSOURCE: JOHN F.

Criticisms of Soros, who is Jewish, often echo long-standing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish financiers shaping world events.\n\nSchrage said Facebook hired Definers following the election of President Donald Trump to diversify its relationships in Washington, amid \"growing pressure from competitors in tech, telcos and media companies that want government to regulate us.\" He said Definers was asked to probe whether Soros was backing the company's opponents.\n\n\"When the 'Freedom from Facebook' campaign emerged as a so-called grassroots coalition, the team asked Definers to help understand the groups behind them,\" he wrote. \"They learned that George Soros was funding several of the coalition members. They prepared documents and distributed these to the press to show that this was not simply a spontaneous grassroots movement.\"\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have denied knowing about the company's work with Definers, and Facebook has said it ended its relationship with the firm. Open Society, meanwhile, has called on Facebook to \"stop engaging in practices inspired by the enemies of democracy across the globe.\"\n\nIn an addendum to Schrage's post, Sandberg said when she read the Times report, she didn't remember a firm called Definers and asked her team to look into it. She said some of the firm's work \"was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced.\"\n\nSandberg added: \"It was never anyone's intention to play into an anti-Semitic narrative against Mr. Soros or anyone else.\"\n\n\"Being Jewish is a core part of who I am and our company stands firmly against hate,\" she said. \"The idea that our work has been interpreted as anti-Semitic is abhorrent to me \u2014 and deeply personal.\"\n\n"}]
