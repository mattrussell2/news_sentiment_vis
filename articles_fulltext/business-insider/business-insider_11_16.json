So let's be clear, this is not a speech of concession.\"\n\nAbrams blamed the state's voter roll purges \u2014 which, under Kemp's direction, removed 1.5 million voters from the rolls, the classification of about 50,000 voters as \"pending\" because their information didn't exactly match that in government files, long lines, faulty equipment, and closed polling places for disenfranchising an untold number of Georgians, a group that disproportionately comprises people of color.\n\n\"I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right,\" said Abrams, who would have become the country's first African American female governor. \"But my assessment is that the law currently allows no further viable remedy.\"\n\nRead more:Hotly contested recounts are underway in Florida, as Georgia and Arizona scramble to finalize results in key races\n\nThe Georgia race was one of the most contentious and closely-watched in the country, as Abrams, who received a last-minute boost from Oprah, battled it out with Kemp, a strong Trump supporter who benefited from the president's endorsement. Abrams, the former state House minority leader, came closer to winning a statewide race in Georgia than any Democrat has in decades.\n\nOver the last two weeks, thousands of provisional ballots were counted \u2014 including at polling sites that initially said they had completed their counts.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the former secretary of state was deliberate and intentional in his actions,\" she said. \"I know that eight years of systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment, and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia.\"\n\nAbrams also said her team would be filing a \"major lawsuit\" against the state of Georgia for \"gross mismanagement\" of the election.\n\n\"Voting is not a right for some, it is a right for all, and it is not a privilege,\" Abrams said.\n\nRead more: Democrats' 3 biggest rising stars came up short in an otherwise successful night for the party\n\nBut Abrams also said she would \"pray for the success of Brian Kemp that he will indeed be a leader of all Georgians.\"\n\nTrump offered some praise for Abrams on Friday evening: \"Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future!\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday evening, Kemp, who previously called Abrams' refusal to concede \"a disgrace to democracy\" and a \"temper tantrum,\" said he looked forward to moving past the divisive race.\n\n\"I appreciate her passion, hard work, and commitment to public service,\" Kemp said of his opponent. \"The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward.

It's also, interestingly, $10 cheaper than Ring's five-piece home security system right now.\n\nEach piece of Ring's kit is designed to protect a different part of your house. The contact sensors detect when windows and doors are opened or closed; the motion detectors use infrared beams to sense movement and heat in a room; the keypad lets you arm and disarm the system; the base station keeps the system online, and has a 110-decibel siren that sounds when motion is detected; and the range extender keeps the sensors connected to the base station. Both the base station and range extender have a 24-hour battery backup that will keep the system online in case of a power outage.\n\nWhen the system is triggered, the alarm from the base station will sound, and you'll receive a notification on your phone so you can investigate the situation or call the police. If you subscribe to a Nest Protect plan for $10 a month, a professional home security service will monitor your home and check in on you when the system is triggered.\n\nThis bundle is a pretty comprehensive home security system, but the one thing it doesn't include is a camera. You can add Ring Video Doorbell or Ring Spotlight Cam to it, and both will integrate seamlessly with the pieces in this kit. The motion sensors in Ring's cameras will trigger the alarm in the base station, while also giving you video evidence in case of a break-in.\n\nHome security isn't something most people want to think about, but Ring's Alarm Home Security System can help put your mind at ease when you go to sleep, or leave town for a vacation."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Scott Davis", "title": "We're learning more about what Draymond Green told Kevin Durant during their blow-up, and now teams are circling the Warriors to see what happens next", "description": "Draymond Green reportedly told Kevin Durant. \"You're a b---- and you know you're a b----\" and told Durant that the Warriors didn't need him during their heated exchange on Monday.

Green responded by attacking Durant, reportedly calling Durant a \"b----\" several times and criticizing the handling of his impending free agency. Now we're beginning to learn some more specifics of what was said.\n\nThe Athletic's Shams Charania reported that after Durant yelled at Green for not getting him the ball. Green responded (as written by Charania): \"Don't talk to me and come at me like I'm [unnamed Warriors big man]. I've won before you came.\"\n\nYahoo's Chris Haynes reported further details of Green's tirade.\n\n\"You're a b---- and you know you're a b----,\" Green reportedly said to Durant, adding: \"We don't need you. We won without you. Leave.\"\n\nBob Levey/Getty The Athletic's Sam Amick reported that Green's words were even worse than what was reported, in part because of the biting nature of them.\n\nThere's a lot to parse in the whole matter. The Warriors suspended Green for one game, docking him over $120,000 in game pay. Reports since have suggested that the Warriors not only wanted to make clear that Green crossed the line, but that the punishment was public, just as Green's blow-up came in public.\n\nBut despite most believing Green crossed a line, according to reports, some also felt that his criticism of Durant's handling of his free agency struck a chord. Durant is a free agent at the end of the year and has neither committed to staying with the Warriors nor leaving. He also hasn't shut down questions on it, as some other stars have before free agency in the past. According to several reports, the lingering cloud of Durant's free agency has rubbed some Warriors, notably Green, the wrong way, with The Athletic's Tim Kawakami calling it \"Durant Free-Agent Fatigue.\"\n\nRead more: Kevin Durant has twice taken the same contract gamble as LeBron James, and it seems to be at the source of the Warriors' tension\n\nWhat happens next is anyone's guess, but NBA teams are playing close attention. Haynes reported: \"Rival teams and opposing players are attempting to gather more information on the morale and status of the Warriors, sources said. The whole affair is being viewed as promising to the opposition.\"\n\nGreen issued a statement to reporters on Thursday, saying he is passionate and sometimes that passion goes too far. Notably, he did not mention any sort of apology in his statement (though he spoke with Durant in private, and the two were seen walking into the Houston Rockets arena together and shooting at the same basket).\n\nChris Szagola/AP Also notable, Green gave almost an ominous quote, saying that whatever happens next, the Warriors have had a good run.\n\n\"At the end of the day, as I've said before, whatever Kevin decides to do, whatever Klay decides to do, whatever who decides to do, we had great years together.\"\n\nIn Green's first game back with the team, they lost in rather flat fashion to the Rockets, 107-86.\n\nThere's little doubt that Green and Durant will make up and the team will move on. In Green's statement, he issued a warning to other teams that they will have to beat the Warriors, as the Warriors won't beat themselves.\n\nBut Green's explosion, while inappropriate, also signaled that there had been building tension, and finally, it boiled over. It's worth wondering how much that will linger with the team, even if Green and Durant drop the matter."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Brian Pascus", "title": "Japan Airlines has enacted strict rules limiting employee drinking after its pilots failed 19 breathalyzer tests over the past year", "description": "Japan Airlines announced it will enact stricter measures to monitor its crew members' alcohol consumption after the carrier's pilots failed multiple alcohol tests over the past year.

For the first time since Norway's Magnus Carlsen took the title in 2013, the two highest-rated players on the planet are competing for the win.\n\nCarlsen, 27, is taking on Fabiano Caruana, 26, and the latter is the first American to make it to the championship match since Bobby Fischer in 1972. The players are well-prepared contestants who have faced each other numerous times over the past few years. Before Game 6 of the match, Carlsen's FIDE rating was 2835, Caruana's 2832, but Carlsen has a career edge in wins, with a lead on decisive results against Caruana.\n\nIn Game 1, Caruana showed some nerves with the white pieces, as Carlsen played the Sicilian Defence against Caruana's 1. e4 opening, avoiding the drawish Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez. The Rossolimo variation of the Sicilian quickly developed, and Carlsen developed an edge before Caruana was able to wrangle a hard-fought draw after 115 moves and seven hours.\n\nGame 2 led to another draw, after 49 moves. Game 3 saw the Rossolimo Sicilian again appear, this time with some befuddlements created by Caruana, who also missed chances to sharpen the position despite better preparation than Carlsen. Nonetheless, the result was another draw.\n\nIn Game 4, Carlsen opened with 1. c4, the English game, a move essayed by Fischer at times, but infrequently seen in recent World Championship play. It manifested a theme for the 2018 WCC: an intriguing opening that peters out into draws. This time, the bloodless result occurred after 34 moves.\n\nGame 5 was another Rossolimo Sicilian, but this time Caruana uncorked the obscure Gurgenidze variation, a gambit with the b pawn. A new theme crystallized: Caruana's deeper opening preparation versus Carlsen's oft-touted ability to ignore complicated opening theory and find the best analysis of nearly any position.\n\nAnd still, a draw after 34 moves. The WCC consists of 12 classical games, followed by rapid/blitz tiebreaks. This was how the 2016 Championship match, played between Carlsen and Russia's Sergey Karjakin, ended. Karjakin and Carlsen won games, but a deadlocked score after 12 games gave Carlsen an advantage given his superior rapid and blitz skills. This led to speculation that Carlsen was looking to draw the classical games against Caruana and again throw the Championship to faster chess, where he's also better by his results that Caruana.\n\nThe thriller of Game 6\n\nCaruana grabbed a slim advantage in Game 6. Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for World Chess\n\nAnother wrinkle was that by starting with the white pieces, Caruana had to deal with two games in a row with black after Game 6. And so in Game 6, things got a bit crazy. Carlsen opened with 1. e4, and Caruana was at last able to use the Petroff Defence, at which he's considered an expert. Carlsen dealt with it by moving a knight an almost absurd number of times in the opening, a violation of a fundamental chess principle.\n\nCaruana wasn't confused by the gonzo tactic, and by the endgame, Caruana had found a slight edge, after Carlsen sacrificed a knight in exchange for two extra pawns. By move 54, Caruana was winning. For the first time in the 2018 Championship match, Carlsen found himself fighting for a draw rather than pressing for a win. Ten moves later, Carlsen's king was cornered, and the World Champ was trying to salvage an analytically lost position.\n\nBut Caruana couldn't delve 30 or 40 moves into the position, finding a very esoteric plan, and was unable to move in for the kill. Regrettably, for the challenger, another draw was agreed to after 80 moves. However, Caruana headed into the second half of the match having notched his strongest game to date in World Championship Play.\n\nAfter a rest day on Saturday, the match will resume Sunday, tied 3-3, after both players have collected 0.5 points for each draw."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Lydia Ramsey", "title": "Clover Health, a $1.2 billion startup backed by Alphabet, is still losing money \u2014 but less than it was before", "description": "We just got a look at the third-quarter financial results for Clover Health, an Alphabet-backed health insurance startup valued at $1.2 billion.

The company offers private health insurance plans for seniors, a product called Medicare Advantage.\n\nThe results put it in better shape than it was in in 2017, when it posted a net loss of $31.6 million through the first nine months of the year, according to the filing. By the end of 2017, it reported a $21.5 million loss in its business in New Jersey.\n\nThe insurer currently operates in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Georgia, and is expanding to more states in 2019, including parts of South Carolina, Arizona, and Tennessee. Business Insider reviewed filings from New Jersey, which makes up the majority of Clover's business now.\n\nOther notable figures from the first nine months:\n\nClover's revenue in New Jersey was $223 million .\n\n. The company paid out $204.9 million in medical expenses for its customers.\n\nin medical expenses for its customers. Clover had 31,902 Medicare Advantage members as of September 30.\n\nBloomberg in March reported that Clover expected 2018 revenue to hit $330 million in 2018. For the full year of 2017, the company generated $267 million in revenue.\n\nClover's New Jersey Medicare Advantage plan currently has a three star rating out of five from the government, down from 3.5 in 2017. That reduces the amount of money the government will pay Clover for insuring seniors.\n\nClover Health sells Medicare Advantage health insurance plans. When seniors in the US turn 65, they can choose to be part of either traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage, which is operated through private insurers like Clover and often provides additional healthcare benefits. The hope for San Francisco-based Clover and other technology-based health insurers is to use data to improve patients' health.\n\nThe Medicare Advantage market is highly competitive. Oscar Health, another Alphabet-backed insurer, is planning to enter the Medicare Advantage market in 2020.

Those companies tend to generate substantial profits from Medicare Advantage.\n\nIn January, CNBC reported that Clover had hit some rough patches, including upsetting members who faced unexpected bills, and missing financial targets.\n\nFounded in 2014, the company most recently raised $130 million in May 2017 from investors including Alphabet's venture arm GV at a $1.2 billion valuation.

We're pushing our land border 1,500 miles deep into the ocean here a little bit, and that's where we find the success taking large loads of cocaine down at sea,\" Adm. Karl Schultz, the commandant of the Coast Guard, said Thursday during the offload.\n\n\"When we take down drugs at sea it reduces the violence. It maximizes the impact. When these loads land in Mexico, in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, they get distributed into very small loads, very hard to detect, and there's associated violence, corruption, instability,\" Schultz added. \"It's just very hard to govern in that space when there's that much associated disarray here that surrounds these drugs, so we're really proud of the ability to push that border out.\"\n\nBricks of cocaine visible among bales of cocaine seized by US Coast Guard ships, aboard the USCG cutter James, in Ft.

They're hard to detect ... from the air.\"\n\nSemi-submersibles and low-profile vessels are pricey, running $1 million to $2 million each. But the multiton cargoes they carry can fetch hundreds of millions of dollars, making the sophisticated vessels an expense traffickers can afford.\n\nA brick of seized cocaine, labeled with an image of a crown, aboard the US Coast Guard cutter James, in Ft.

Within a few years, however, the company realized it was in a perfect position to make its own products: eBags could take reviews of other products posted on its site and use them as market research, incorporating reader feedback into designs for a new in-house line.\n\nToday, eBags is one of the best destinations for luggage and travel bags of all shapes and sizes, whether school bags, daypacks, carry-ons, or suitcases. It sells products from hundreds of brands, but its own line of eBags-branded luggage stands out for its intelligent designs, smart functions, and competitive prices. The only downside, on some products, at least, is that they aren't as stylish as other brands \u2014 a trade-off that's often worth making.\n\nOn eBags' newest piece of luggage, the brand managed to bring form, function, and price without making any compromises \u2014 even style.\n\nThe new Fortis Pro Smart hardside spinner begins with a lightweight polycarbonate shell, which eBags describes as \"unbreakable.\" While I didn't have time to take the bag on an actual trip before this review, the Insider Picks team decided to test this out in the office.\n\nWhile we stopped short of standing on top the closed bag, we can confirm that despite our kicks, drops, bangs, bends, beatings, and even a throw down half a flight of stairs, the bag did not break. We also skipped hitting the bag full-strength with a hammer \u2014 we didn't have a hammer handy.\n\neBags also describes the bag as \"hardly scuffable.\" This, I'm sad to say, was not quite the case. By the end of our abuse, the bag was showing unmistakable signs of scuffing \u2014 most particularly, scuffs. While we were able to wipe most of them away with a damp paper towel, there are still some scuffs and scratches left behind, so I would recommend ignoring the \"hardly\" and focusing on the \"scuffable.\"\n\nThat said, scuffs aren't a deal breaker, and I'm far more concerned about the function of my bag and the safety of its contents than I am with the uninterrupted shine of its outside.\n\nIn that respect, the eBags Fortis Pro is a force to behold.\n\nThe bag unzips and opens like a standard valise, and stores clothing and contents on both sides. One half features a nifty compression strap that has two built-in packing cubes \u2014 these are perfect for storing small items like socks or undershirts. You can fill those, and then buckle the strap they rest on to hold and compress everything else in that side of the main compartment.\n\nThere's also an interior divider on that side, which can be removed or adjusted to fit whatever you pack. The other side of the main compartment is a large open space, and can be sealed with a zippable netting.\n\nThis is the new \"smart\" edition of eBags' carry-ons, and it reflects this with an integrated USB pass through cable. You can take any USB power bank, and put it in a small interior pouch near the top of the bag. Just plug in the USB cable, and you can access power through a USB port near the handle \u2014 without removing the battery.\n\nThe bag evokes obvious comparisons to Away, the popular luggage startup.\n\nWhile the Fortis Pro is certainly similar to the smaller Away carry-on, it's a little less expensive, and has one major feature that the Away bags don't \u2014 an expansion zipper. Simply unzip it, and you can expand the Fortis bag by about an inch and a half.\n\nThe bag is incredibly lightweight considering its size, and even when we fully loaded it, the wheels spun effortlessly, a necessity for any quality spinner bag. The telescoping handle has three positions, and the bag has a built-in TSA-approved combination lock that's easy to set \u2014 and reset.\n\nThe eBags Fortis Pro is a solid product, and representative of the deliberation with which eBags designs its products. While the description of \"hardly scuffable\" is optimistic at best, I \u2014 and the Insider Picks team \u2014 remain impressed at how the polycarbonate shell withstood our pummeling and, as crucially, held its shape, even when we tried to bend and snap the shell's edges. Plus, the bag has a lifetime warranty, so if something stronger than us gets to your bag, you're covered.\n\nIf you're looking for a new bag, or a gift to give for the holidays, the Fortis Pro is a great bet.\n\nPlus, until November 25, Business Insider readers can save 30% on the bag when they use promo code INSIDER30.

Meanwhile, the president's decision to send thousands of US troops to the border with Mexico to confront a migrant caravan has been decried as a \"stunt,\" including by fellow Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that we have soldiers there, and frankly in Arizona they are stationed in Tucson about 90 miles from the border. So, they are not forward deployed actually on the border,\" Republican Sen. Jeff Flake told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" earlier this week. \"I think you can't call it anything but a stunt here, and it's unfortunate that they are going to be away from family during the holidays coming up, and we just don't know what really for.\"\n\nAdditionally, the president's decision to not visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day has been frowned upon. Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace in an interview set to air on Sunday he'd been \"extremely busy\" that day with phone calls. Wallace noted Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, went to the cemetery every year on Veterans Day.\n\nRead more: Trump talks tough about the military, but he hasn't visited a war zone where US troops are fighting \u2014 unlike his predecessors\n\nTrump has also been bashed for not visiting US troops in a war zone, which is something his two most recent predecessors did early on in their first terms. The president last month told The Associated Press he will eventually make such a trip, but said he's been \"very busy\" thus far.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Monday slammed Trump for not visiting troops in a war zone yet at this point in his first term, even as Trump's orders have sent troops to Afghanistan and Syria, as well as on counterterror missions in Africa.\n\n\"I think it's bigger than just a misstep \u2014 I think it's a failure of an obligation, of a basic obligation of a commander in chief,\" Hagel said. \"He's commander in chief of our forces, and not to go to a war zone where we have men and women dying, that's just wrong.\"\n\nOne of the reasons Trump has not yet taken a trip to visit troops involved in America's ongoing military engagements is reportedly because he doesn't want US forces in these places in the \"first place,\" his aides told the New York Times.

Streaming games would require a strong internet connection, but would greatly reduce the amount of power and storage space needed to deliver a premium gaming experience.\n\nGame streaming won't be exclusive to new consoles either; the company has promised that their recently announced cloud-gaming service, Project xCloud, would be capable of streaming Xbox games to smartphones and computers across the world. Project xCloud is expected to enter beta testing next year.\n\nIf Microsoft is indeed willing to create an Xbox without a disc-drive, it could spell the end of an era for video games as publishers continue to promote more digital content.

Google Cloud encompasses G Suite, the company's productivity suite, and a major rival to Microsoft's Office 365, as well as the Google Cloud Platform, which lets customers rent supercomputing power from the Silicon Valley giant's own data centers.\n\nAs a seasoned veteran of the enterprise software space, and the cofounder of tech giant VMware, Greene was supposed to help Google Cloud reach new, lucrative big-business customers customers \u2014 and, in so doing, reach its pie-in-the-sky goal of supplanting advertising as Google's biggest source of revenue by 2020.\n\nThat was the plan, anyway.\n\nGoogle Cloud isn't where it could be\n\nA little under three years later, though, Google Cloud is still not living up to expectations. Make no mistake, Greene led Google Cloud to some key wins: Target, Apple, and other big customers all signed on under her watch. Wall Street has lauded her strategy, with one analyst expecting Google Cloud to do $8 billion in revenue this year.\n\nAt the same time, Google Cloud is still a distant third place to the market-leading Amazon Web Services and its chief rival, Microsoft Azure. Those same Wall Street analysts who say that Google Cloud is on the right track acknowledge that there's a tremendous gap between Google's cloud business and Microsoft's, let alone Amazon's.\n\nAmazon Web Services launched years before either of its main competitors, and has aggressively gobbled up the lion's share of the market since. Microsoft, for its part, has turned its existing relationships with enterprise customers into its greatest strength, as it slowly but surely transitions them to the cloud.\n\nOutgoing Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene Greg Sandoval/Business Insider\n\nWhile Google Cloud is often seen as the furthest ahead in terms of pure technology, it doesn't have the business advantages of its rivals. This is where Greene was intended to help: Her pedigree in enterprise technology was intended to help Google Cloud close deals with deep-pocketed global-scale companies.\n\nThat's worked, to a large extent \u2014 but Google ultimately has to share some of its biggest wins with its competitors. Apple, for example, uses both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to power its iCloud service. It's still a win for Google, to be sure, but it's not the kind of clean victory that shows inarguable dominance.\n\nAt the same time, Google has tried to make this so-called \"multi-cloud\" approach a cornerstone of its strategy, and when Google Cloud pulled out of contention for the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI contract, it chided the Department of Defense for only wanting to bank on one cloud platform (which will probably be Amazon's).\n\nSee also: Meet the 22-year Oracle veteran executive who's going to lead Google in the cloud wars against Amazon and Microsoft\n\nAnd even years into the Greene years, Google Cloud had become known for poor customer service. Over the summer, Google Cloud infamously threatened to permanently and automatically shut down an energy management company's critical app unless the right forms were filed. The company vowed reform, but some damage was done to its brand.\n\nCloud is unlikely to replace advertising as Google's chief business any time soon, either. Google generated some $22.6 billion in advertising revenue in the last quarter alone \u2014 almost four times what that analyst believes Google Cloud will bring in over the entire year.\n\nIt won't be easy\n\nAt the same time, Google Cloud has some real opportunity ahead of it. Backed by the engineering might of Google, its cloud platform is seen by many developers as the most future-looking option out there.\n\nTechnologies like Kubernetes and Tensorflow were invented by Google for its own use, but have since become smash hits with developers in Silicon Valley and beyond. While the other platforms generally support these and other Google-born tools, Google Cloud has a reputation as being the first and best place to run them. Over the years, Google has underlined these advantages by aggressively adding new technologies and capabilities to its cloud.\n\nKurian himself seems to have a good handle on what real users actually want, too, judging by the reported circumstances of his departure from Oracle. He is said to have pushed hard against Oracle founder Larry Ellison to have the database giant support Amazon's and Microsoft's clouds, rather than focus solely on its own.\n\nThis would indicate that Kurian is of a mind to focus on the customer experience \u2014 to \"meet the customer where they are,\" to borrow a Silicon Valley chestnut of wisdom. It's a similar mindset as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, whose embrace of rival technology has only improved the positioning of its overall cloud business.\n\nStill, it won't be easy for Kurian.\n\n\"I'm not sure Thomas will be any better a fit than Diane was with the young, disruptive, and energized employees of Google,\" says Dave Bartoletti, VP and principal analyst with research firm Forrester.\n\nKurian has the potential to bring his Oracle chops to bear at Google \u2014 but remember that Oracle, one of the most established enterprise companies in the world, is very different than Google, which still makes its money from search advertising.\n\n\"If he can bring sales and strategic rigor to the enterprise selling motion, it will help Google penetrate the enterprise cloud market further,\" says Bartoletti. \"But it's going to be quite a culture clash from his days at Oracle.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Clancy Morgan", "title": "Here's how perfectly rectangular icebergs are formed", "description": "A perfectly rectangular iceberg was spotted by NASA scientist Jeremy Harbeck in October off of the Larsen C ice shelf in Antarctica.

It included the re-imposition of oil sanctions and designation of more than 700 Iranian entities, individuals, aircraft, and vessels. However, so far, the impact has fallen short of what will be required for true maximum pressure, though the administration is on the right path.\n\nIran's currency, the rial, has shown surprising resiliency. On Nov. 4, the price of the U.S. dollar in Tehran reached 149,000 rial. One week later, on Nov. 12, the price decreased by 7% to 138,500 rial. Admittedly, Iran's underground forex market is shallow and subject to heavy manipulation by the Central Bank, but the rial appreciation is in line with other signals.\n\nThe Tehran Stock Exchange has shown similar signs of life. The Overall Index on Nov. 4 was 182,918. One week later, on Nov. 12, it stood at 182,211 - a drop of only 0.4 percent. And in terms of the dollar value of the index, it actually shows a significant 7 % increase in value.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran's Energy Exchange celebrated its second crude oil deal this week. To fight the oil sanctions, Tehran found a workaround. It now sells its crude on an anonymous Energy Exchange platform to customers whose identity will remain secret. These customers, in turn, sell the oil in the international markets. This is how unknown buyers purchased 700,000 barrels of Iran's crude oil on Nov. 11 for $64.97 per barrel. The cost was roughly 9% below the going rate posted by the National Iranian Oil Company. But it was a victory nevertheless in that sanction busters around the world now see a possible way around U.S. restrictions.\n\nAlistair Bell/Reuters\n\nIn an even more significant development, the Saudis are now pushing for an output cut. Riyadh had previously pledged to flood the market to ensure that Iran could not cash in on high prices resulting from a restricted market stemming from U.S. sanctions. Higher prices mean more revenue from the oil that Iran does sell.\n\nFurthermore, by issuing waivers for eight countries, the U.S. has not reduced Iran's oil exports to zero, though it has taken offline 1 million barrels per day in six months without spiking oil prices \u2014 an impressive achievement. Iranian funds now will be locked up in escrow accounts that can only be accessed for approved humanitarian and limited commercial purposes, further squeezing accessible Iranian foreign exchange reserves. But much more needs to be done to collapse Iranian oil exports and police the escrow accounts to prevent the wide-scale sanctions busting that occurred last time around.\n\nU.S. policy on SWIFT, the ubiquitous electronic banking transfer system, received some long-awaited clarity with the disconnection of the Central Bank of Iran and a number of designated Iranian banks. The administration permitted some Iranian banks to remain on the SWIFT system for humanitarian transactions but, as my colleagues Mark Dubowitz and Annie Fixler argued, the administration will have to redouble its efforts to police this humanitarian channel. Iran has used humanitarian exemptions to U.S. sanctions in the past to run massive sanctions-busting schemes.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. has issued waivers for Iraq and Afghanistan to trade with Iran. Both countries suffer from corruption and lack of transparency, which make them fertile grounds for Tehran's sophisticated sanctions-busting operations. Iraq, in particular, has become a major destination for Iranian goods and services.\n\nFinally, there is the waiver issued for India's Chabahar port in Iran. Delhi was desperate for the exemption to permit a land-based supply route to Afghanistan as a substitute for the one controlled by its archenemy Pakistan. But Washington needs to understand the tradeoff. This port will allow India to grow its trade relationship with Iran. Delhi already is one of Tehran's top trade partners.\n\nAccording to the National Security Advisor John Bolton, more sanctions and stricter enforcement are on their way. They are sorely needed. The impact of the new sanctions to date is not sufficient to change the Iranian regime's behavior. To ensure maximum pressure, the U.S. sanctions campaign needs to cut Iran oil export to no more than 500,000 barrels per day in the next six months. The United States should continue to push countries like China, Turkey, and India to reduce trade, especially oil purchases. Iran's access to the escrow funds should be limited to humanitarian transactions only, with strict oversight to ensure there is no abuse.\n\nFrom there, Washington should aggressively target Tehran's network of illicit financing and procurement in East Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Turkey, the Caucuses, and Persian Gulf. Additionally, the U.S. needs to drain Tehran's resources by sanctioning and weakening its proxies in the region, especially in Syria and Lebanon, which Tehran sees as strategic strongholds.\n\nAlthough Iran's economy has shown resiliency in the immediate aftermath of the latest round of sanctions, Tehran is on shaky ground. Its economy is still under strain, and its access to hard currency is shrinking. Meanwhile, discontent among everyday Iranians is on the rise. The Trump administration has a historic chance to force the clerical regime to alter its dangerous course, but such an extraordinary result requires extraordinary measures.\n\nSaeed Ghasseminejad is a senior advisor on Iran at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based nonpartisan research institute focusing on national security and foreign policy."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Caitlin Foster", "title": "The FDA is taking steps to reduce testing on dogs while the VA doubles down on its harmful experiments", "description": "The FDA announced plans on Friday to begin researching ways to reduce and potentially eliminate canine testing.

However, the Venture's consistently strong rewards earning rate goes a long way toward making up for that.\n\nHere's what you need to know about this overwhelmingly positive change to the Capital One Venture card.\n\nTransfer ratios\n\nCapital One is positioning points transfers with this card as a wonky option for travel experts. You'll need your wits and a calculator to figure out how to get the best value out of this program. Don't let that dissuade you, though. This card can offer good value for people who are willing to put in the work to uncover it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the transfer ratios. At launch, 12 airline programs will transfer at a rate of 2 Capital One Venture miles to 1.5 airline miles. This means that 75,000 Venture points equals 56,250 airline miles in the following programs:\n\nAeromexico Club Premier\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan\n\nAir France/KLM Flying Blue\n\nAlitalia MilleMiglia\n\nAvianca LifeMiles\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles\n\nEtihad Guest\n\nEVA Infinity MileageLands\n\nFinnair Plus\n\nHainan Fortune Wings Club\n\nQantas Frequent Flyer\n\nQatar Airways Privilege Club\n\nSign-up bonus\n\nThe sign-up bonus of 75,000 Capital One miles (when you spend $5,000 in the first three months) can yield a total of up to 120,000 miles\u2014 although that only works if you spend the full $5,000 on hotel stays booked and paid for through Hotels.com/Venture, which would earn you 10x points per dollar. This is enough for up to 90,000 airline miles.\n\nOf course, if you don't complete the entirety of the minimum spend with Hotels.com, you'll end up with fewer points, but still enough to make some awesome redemptions. Since the card earns 2x miles on everything besides Hotels.com, you can reasonably expect to have at least 85,000 Capital One miles after meeting the spending requirements, which can translate to about 64,000 airline miles.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Capital One Venture Rewards card from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nNew partners \u2014 should you use them?\n\nIf you have a Chase, American Express, or Citi card, you may be familiar with some of these programs. For example, Flying Blue partners with American Express, Chase, and Citi. Aeroplan, Etihad, and LifeMiles all partner with American Express. However, Capital One is the first card to offer points transfers to Qatar, Finnair, and Hainan. Additionally, the only other transfer partner to Qantas is Citi.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the new programs are poor value. Hainan and Aeromexico, for example, awards points based on kilometers traveled rather than miles, so their award chart is relatively expensive compared to other programs. Finnair Plus offers access to oneworld partners, but at some of the most expensive redemption rates of any program member.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar Qmiles and Etihad Guest both recently devalued their award charts and have made redeeming points extremely difficult (all redemptions must be done online, and most partner bookings can only be done via an email form). While both airlines, in theory, offer good redemption rates for flights on American Airlines, these are just too hard to book in practice.\n\nTop program choices, and how to get where you want to go\n\nFor most people, the best programs to focus on with the Capital One Venture card will be Flying Blue, Aeroplan and LifeMiles. All three offer some attractive \"sweet spot\" redemption rates and easy-to-navigate English-language websites, and they provide access to flights throughout the SkyTeam and Star Alliance networks. For access to the oneworld alliance, Qantas will generally be your best bet.\n\nRemember that for most programs, Venture points transfer at a rate of 2:1.5 airline mile. That means if 50,000 airline miles are required for a particular redemption, you'll need 62,500 Venture miles in order to transfer enough points.\n\nEurope\n\nOne of the best ways to Europe is via the Flying Blue program. The Flying Blue program offers the best pricing and availability on the airlines of its partners, which are Air France (including Hop and Joon), KLM, Aircalin, Kenya Airways, TAROM, and Transavia. While award pricing is variable, flights on Air France (to Paris) or KLM (to Amsterdam) from North America often cost below 25,000 points each way in economy class.\n\nPrefer to sit up front? Enjoy a lie-flat seat to anywhere in western Europe served by SWISS, Turkish, Brussels Airways, United or TAP for just 55,000 Aeroplan points (and no fuel surcharges) one way. Other Star Alliance airlines, like Austrian and Lufthansa, are better booked with LifeMiles for 63,000 points one way, because LifeMiles doesn't pass along fuel surcharges.\n\nAsia\n\nWant to fly on the Hello Kitty plane? Yes, it's real and with Aeroplan, it's possible! Not only will you be on the cutest airplane in the sky, you'll enjoy some of the world's best service. Book from Los Angeles to Taipei for only 75,000 Aeroplan points one way in business class with no fuel surcharges.\n\nWhile Flying Blue offers access to Asia inventory that can be hard to book with other SkyTeam partners, their pricing is generally very high. In Asia, this should mostly be considered as a program to use when you're traveling to a particularly difficult destination. There is, however, one exception: flights on Bangkok Airways. Short-haul flights on \"Asia's boutique airline\" cost just 20,000 Flying Blue points round-trip, providing access to adventure destinations such as Yangon and Luang Prabang, along with more conventional beach destinations like Koh Samui. Want to travel farther afield? Catch a hop from Bangkok to Male, Maldives for just 20,000 Flying Blue points one way.\n\nAustralia\n\nG'day, mate! Throw another shrimp (and clich\u00e9) on the barbie in Sydney. Use 80,000 LifeMiles to travel in business class one way on Air Canada with no fuel surcharges (this is a better deal than paying the same number of Aeroplan miles, which require fuel surcharges).\n\nHawaii\n\nSeats are tough to find, but with a lot of patience and flexibility, you can sometimes find economy class seats on Delta to Hawaii for as little as 30,000 Flying Blue points round-trip. Availability is much better on United, which you can book with Aeroplan or LifeMiles for 22,500 points each way in economy class. Business class is available with both programs for 40,000 points each way.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nWant to visit one of the world's most beautiful places? Consider Costa Rica. English is widely spoken, you can safely drink the tap water, and best of all, it's affordable. If you're coming from the central or southern part of the US, Costa Rica is closer than Hawaii and award availability can be much better. Delta flights in economy class start from 15,000 Flying Blue points. Fly Copa, Avianca or United for just 20,000 Aeroplan or LifeMiles points.\n\nCanada\n\nWant a quick getaway? Canada isn't far away, but it feels a world away. This is especially true in French-speaking Quebec! Short-haul flights to (and within) Canada cost 7,500 Aeroplan points on Air Canada in economy class one way. It costs 8,000 Qantas points to fly American Airlines short-haul routes, and 10,000 Qantas points to fly Alaska Airlines short-haul routes (under 600 miles).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe best award travel values are for people who are willing to do some extra work and research. While few new \"sweet spots\" are opened up through the availability of new transfer partners, Capital One has changed the game with the Venture Rewards card.\n\nThis is a great card to pick up for the limited-time increased sign-up bonus, and an even better one to use for booking hotels.\n\nEvery award travel junkie should pick up this card, at least for the first year."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Becky Peterson", "title": "'Stay away from endpoint security' \u2014 Here's why insiders say Blackberry's $1.4 billion Cylance acquisition could be the last deal of its size (BB)", "description": "BlackBerry's $1.4 billion Cylance acquisition, announced on Friday, came after tough negotiations, sources told Business Insider.

The startup was weighing going public, sources said, where it potentially could have eventually ended up worth more than $1.4 billion.\n\nOne source close to the deal said while there may have been some back-and-forth in the negotiations, overall the process was very straightforward.\n\nThe 34-year-old BlackBerry was in the market for a cutting edge AI and security product, which it decided was easier to buy than to build internally. And Cylance was ready for a big exit \u2014 IPO or otherwise \u2014 and was attracted to its acquirer's reach in sectors like government, finance and automotive, the source said.\n\nThe all-cash deal ate up more than half of the $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents that BlackBerry had on hand as of August 31. Chen was careful to ensure that the company didn't spend its whole budget on one deal, the source said, especially since the company wants to be ready in case another good acquisition opportunity presents itself.\n\n\"Stay away from endpoint security\"\n\nNot everyone is convinced that Cylance would have thrived on the public markets, or that it can prove its value as it joins BlackBerry.\n\nCompetition from Microsoft and other security startups is steep, said Yoav Leitersdorf, an investor at the YL Ventures, which invests heavily in cybersecurity. That means Cylance risks losing \"most of its market share similar to the demise of the BlackBerry smartphone.\"\n\n\"The endpoint security space has become the most crowded in cybersecurity. Cylance has had a difficult time recently battling it out with CrowdStrike,\" wrote Leitersdorf, who said executives in the space consider CrowdStrike to be a superior product. George Kurtz, CEO and founder of CrowdStrike, a $3 billion company, is an advisor to YL Ventures.\n\nLeitesdorf said that YL Ventures doesn't invest in endpoint products, however, and encourages entrepreneurs to \"stay away from endpoint security, as margins will strongly erode and industry players will go out of business or be acquired for much lower multiples than what BlackBerry is paying for Cylance today.\"\n\nLeitersdorf added that while he expects more acquisition in the space in 2019, he thinks those startups will sell at a \"very low multiple\" \u2014 as low as 1x, which would mean investors basically just get their money back.\n\n\"Many of these vendors will seek to be bought due to the intense competition in the space and the increasing threat from Microsoft, and buyers (acquirers) will have the strong negotiating leverage, thereby eroding multiples at acquisition,\" he wrote."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Travis Clark", "title": "The Satanic Temple says it's 'finalizing an amicable settlement' with Warner Bros. to its lawsuit over a goat-headed statue in Netflix's 'Sabrina' reboot", "description": "On Friday, a spokesperson for The Satanic Temple told Business Insider that it was in the \" process of finalizing an amicable settlement with Warner Bros. now\" in its lawsuit over the Netflix \"Sabrina\" reboot.

That's more than enough to get through a week's worth of commutes and a couple of hours of music listening during the day.\n\nIt's hard to find too many genuinely good audio deals, but this is one that any music lover or early Black Friday shopper should seriously consider. These headphones regularly cost twice as much money, and they check all the boxes.

Now, it's possible to make changes and release them to customers instantly \u2014 the same way that Facebook, Google, and other tech companies roll out new features that appear as soon as you refresh your browser.\n\nNow, as software continues to eat the world, investors are flocking to companies that are helping their customers achieve the same kind of speed.\n\nThe key practices are called continuous integration and continuous delivery. With CI/CD, companies can release changes to customers as often as they want, whether it's once a month or 20 times a day. At first, mostly startups used this process, but as larger companies continue to modernize their digital footprints, they too are jumping on board, as a way to keep up with their Silicon Valley rivals.\n\n\"The benefits are really speed and agility,\" Edith Harbaugh, the CEO of the feature-management platform LaunchDarkly, told Business Insider. \"If you release every year, you're a dinosaur now. If everyone releases multiple times, you're left behind. \u2026 Nobody wants to be the Blockbuster of tech.\"\n\nIndeed, companies like Netflix, Etsy, and Sony are said to have adopted CI/CD to keep up with competitors, small and large.\n\nGitLab cofounders Dmitriy Zaporozhets, left, and Sid Sijbrandij. GitLab\n\nThere are already high-flying startups that have begun emerging as leaders in CI/CD. GitLab, named by analyst firm Forrester as the top leader in CI, has raised $145.5 million in total, as the $1.1 billion startup grows beyond its roots as an alternative to Microsoft's just-acquired GitHub. Other CI leaders include CircleCI, which has raised $59 million, and CloudBees, which has raised $113.2 million.\n\nAnd the growth isn't going to stop anytime soon. Research shows that the market for CI tools is expected to grow from $483.7 million in 2018 to $1.14 billion by 2023. As for CD tools, the market is expected to grow from $1.65 billion in 2018 to $3.85 billion by 2023.\n\n\"The speed with which you can innovate in a business is determined by how fast you can ship software,\" GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij said. \"CI and CD helps you ship software faster. That's what all the businesses need. By testing it automatically and deploying it, you don't have to wait for human testing.\"\n\nWhat is CI/CD, anyway?\n\nAlthough the concepts of CI and CD have been around the 1990s, it started becoming more popular after the birth of Jenkins, the widely used open-source CD platform, in 2004. CloudBees took the free Jenkins software and used it to build a popular version designed for larger businesses, which is also popular.\n\n\"CI and CD will be part of any organization. We're just at the start of this,\" CloudBees CEO Sacha Labourey said. \"It's an exciting time for the CI industry. The entrenched vendors are not equipped with that. At the same time, we're able to generate a meaningful business model. What we're seeing on the market is this big war between the classic players who are not in shape.\"\n\nCI/CD really took off with the rise of cloud computing. It's hard to push out big changes to a code base that lives across multiple servers, across multiple data centers. It becomes much easier, however, when all that code is centralized in a public cloud platform like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.\n\nCI means that developers integrate their software to an organization's central code base as often as possible \u2014 as in, continuously. But before the code gets added to the code base, these developers must run automated tests that make sure the code is working correctly. So, to properly do CI, you need to be continually testing the code, too.\n\nContinuous delivery builds off of CI, but involves the processes by which those code changes are released to customers. With the click of a button, development teams using CD can update their apps and services with new features for some or all of their users.\n\nWhile most people talk about CI/CD as two halves of a whole, there's a third process that's sometimes used, too: continuous deployment. Under a continuous-deployment model, code is automatically released to customers as soon as it passes those code tests, with no human intervention involved.\n\nContinuous deployment is the ultimate expression of these principles: The only thing that stops new code from being integrated and rolled out to customers are those tests. It actually makes some companies uncomfortable, according to cloud-hosting company DigitalOcean, because it means taking humans entirely out of the loop.\n\nWhy are investors excited about CI/CD?\n\nDave Munichiello, general partner at GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), said the firm's criteria for investment now includes how much time a startup spends inventing \u2014 that is, actually writing code and improving their product \u2014 versus managing their servers, infrastructure, and information-technology operations.\n\n\"Software developers are creating and generating intellectual property. The more time software developers can spend on inventing and less on wrangling developer operations, the faster the company will be able to innovate,\" Munichiello said.\n\nLast year, GV invested $20 million in GitLab. In the past year, Munichiello said, CI/CD has grown like crazy, driven by the fact that the largest of large companies now want the same capabilities as the most innovative startups. Ideally, engineers should focus on the product, rather than doing infrastructure work that is now increasingly being automated by CI/CD tools.\n\n\"Investors are excited about CI and CD because it accelerates inventors' ability to innovate within companies,\" Munichiello said.\n\nGV's Dave Munichiello. GV\n\nGrowth in CI/CD has accelerated since the beginning of 2017, said Jim Rose, CEO of startup CircleCI, which creates tools to automate software delivery.\n\n\"From a software-development perspective, to run fast, you need to be able to automate as many processes as possible,\" Rose said. \"It's an opportunity for you to create automation around that task so your developer doesn't always have to reinvent the wheel. You can focus your software developers and team on higher-value problems.\"\n\nAnd the fact that CircleCI makes the process much easier for developers really enticed investors. Andy Vitus, a partner at CircleCI investor Scale Venture Partners, said that when meeting with developers, they often complain about the time spent fixing bugs. With CI/CD tools, testing for bugs is more automated, saving time and energy.\n\nRead more: Investors used to balk at startups for software developers \u2014 but after Microsoft bought GitHub for $7.5 billion, they're all in\n\nThe downfall of 'waterfall'\n\nTools like these contrast with the days of the \"waterfall model,\" the traditional method for getting software out, in which code goes from an engineering team, to a testing team, to an operations team, to customers, in a process that's often criticized as too slow-moving and rigid for speedy software development.\n\nLaunchDarkly's Harbaugh has seen the pain of bad releases in her career as an engineer and product manager. This motivated her to create a platform that makes it easier to push out features to customers.\n\n\"When I started as an engineer, it was the heydays of waterfall,\" Harbaugh said. \"It just didn't work. We would release once a year, and stuff wouldn't work. Then we would have to spend an entire year fixing it. Versus, if we had to release monthly, we could have a more dynamic turnaround time.\"\n\nJens Schumacher, the head of software teams at Aussie tech giant Atlassian, also recalled that when he was working in software 20 years ago, releases came every 18 months or every year. When he joined Atlassian 14 years ago, he was excited to find that it released new updates every 90 days. Today, software teams at Atlassian and elsewhere deploy to the cloud all day, every day.\n\n\"The changes you make in the day or the week are much smaller than the changes you make in a year,\" Schumacher said. \"Imagine 20 developers working on a product for a year and having to figure out what went wrong when they ship it. It's much easier to debug changes that just happened yesterday. It's much easier to revert changes.\"\n\nJust the beginning\n\nThese companies are continuously working to make the development process more automatic. And CI/CD isn't going to go away anytime soon. In fact, insiders say it's the beginning of a trend.\n\n\"I don't see it slowing down at the speed we release software,\" Vitus, the investor with Scale, said. \"Once you're there, you don't ever go back. I would say the idea of doing things continuously will never go away.\"\n\nAnd for companies that want to move to using CI/CD, they have to completely upend their design process and spend time writing automated tests. But once they get past these hurdles, the investment pays off.\n\n\"When we spend time with companies, we're not asking what their cash flow is or their profitability,\" GV's Munichiello said. \"We're spending time thinking about what are you innovating, how fast will you invent, and how well is your team able to respond to feedback from the market and adapt over time.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Eliza Relman", "title": "2,000 women are taking state legislatures by storm, even as men hold on to the vast majority of seats", "description": "Much attention has been paid to the wave of women elected to go to Washington this fall, but women are also storming politics at the local levels.

While women remain small minorities in the vast majority of bodies, they could end up making up majorities in the Colorado House and Nevada Assembly.\n\n\"We are very encouraged by these results. This is the largest increase in women's representation in state legislatures we've seen in some time, after more than a decade of relative stagnation,\" Debbie Walsh, director of the Rutgers center, told the AP. \"The only question that remains is whether 2018 was a one-off or a new norm.\"\n\nRight now, 1,875 of the country's 7,383 state lawmakers are women. Sixty-one percent of these women are Democrats, while about 37% are Republicans. Experts have pointed out that as long as women struggle to gain a foothold in the Republican Party, their overall numbers won't rise much above the 25% mark.\n\nThe last surge of women winning state legislative seats was in the 1970s and 1980s, but in the decades since, female representation in these bodies has remained relatively stagnant. This year's enthusiasm among female candidates, voters, volunteers, and donors was in part fueled by deep-seated anti-Trump sentiment and the #MeToo movement, which have grown the gender gap between Democrats and Republicans to historic highs.\n\nWhile more women than ever before will sit in the US Congress next year, women didn't manage to break records in the Senate or in governors' mansions.\n\nExperts say there is a host of reasons why female candidates are running in larger numbers, including anger at the current administration and frustration with the imbalance in power at every level of politics. There's also evidence that women, particularly when running in Democratic primaries, can use their gender to their advantage.\n\n\"I think we're getting closer to a time when we can talk about gender and particularly the gender experience you have as a credential for office and not as a hurdle that you have to overcome or avoid,\" Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Rutgers center, told INSIDER in August.\n\nBut the so-called \"pink wave\" has much work left to do.

He added that the company is in talks with Ford about possible cooperation in making light commercial vehicles.\n\nEstablished automakers as well as several U.S. startups are rolling out electric models to compete with Tesla , currently the market leader. Auto companies need electrics to meet new environmental standards in many countries.\n\nIn Europe, manufacturers need to sell more battery-powered cars to meet tougher EU limits on carbon dioxide emissions that come into force 2021 and aim to fight global warming. Automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW risk penalties of thousands of euros per vehicle if they can't meet requirements for lower average emissions.\n\nAuthorities in China, where Volkswagen gets much of its profit, have also mandated a bigger share of electrics and hybrids.\n\nYet right now, such vehicles remain a niche market due to higher price and lack of places to charge.

The next model up the scale starts at 30,625 euros.\n\nGeneral Motors, Nissan and Mitsubishi already are selling mass-market electric vehicles, but they're still more costly than cars with gasoline engines, and they haven't sold in great numbers.\n\nHigher cost is one reason consumers are not yet buying purely electric vehicles in large numbers. The lack of charging points is another, leaving many owners of electric vehicles to use them mainly in cities or for shorter trips. Volkswagen and other automakers are working together on building a freeway network of fast-charging stations to enable longer trips with battery powered cars.\n\nChinese automakers as well as U.S. startup companies also are getting into the electric car market. Rivian, a Detroit-area company, plans to unveil a high-end electric pickup and SUV later this month, to go on sale in late 2020. Lucid Motors, a Newark, California, startup whose leadership includes six former Tesla executives, plans to deliver its first cars in 2020 as well.\n\nThe shift to electric cars is a big one for a company the size of Volkswagen, which has over 600,000 employees and makes about 10 million vehicles a year.\n\nIt is converting three of its German plants from internal combustion to battery car production as it pivots away from diesel vehicles in the wake of its emissions scandal.

Trailing by two with just over two minutes remaining, running back Ty Montgomery was back to return a punt. Instead of kneeling the ball when he got in the end zone, Montgomery instead ran with the ball, eventually fumbling and returning possession to the Rams.\n\nAfterward, several Packers players criticized the decision, noting that by kneeling, Montgomery would have given the ball to Rodgers with the game on the line.\n\nRead more:Packers players rip running back who went rogue and returned a late kick, then fumbled to end the game\n\nIn Week 9 against the New England Patriots, with the score tied, 17-17, the Packers had just made a second consecutive stop on Tom Brady and company.\n\nNow with the ball to start the fourth quarter, running back Aaron Jones fumbled, giving the ball back to the Patriots. The Patriots scored to make the game 24-17, and momentum permanently shifted. Rodgers and the Packers did get two more stabs at scoring but were unable to convert. They lost, 33-17.\n\nWill the Packers be in the market for a new kicker?\n\nIt hasn't been the finest season for Mason Crosby. The 34-year-old kicker has seen his field goal accuracy drop from 78.9% to 76.9% and has already missed two extra-point attempts this season, the same amount he missed in 16 games last year.\n\nCrosby had a disastrous week against the Lions in Week 5, missing four of five field goals and an extra-point attempt. The Packers lost by eight.\n\nOn Thursday, Crosby also missed a field goal in the first quarter. The Packers lost by three.\n\nMason Crosby has missed some costly kicks this year. Duane Burleson/AP\n\nThe Packers problems go further. They've only just recently established a run game through second-year running back Aaron Jones, who Rodgers stumped for earlier in the season. Rodgers has lamented a lack of chemistry with some of his receivers, including rookies Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Equanimeous St. Brown. Tight end Jimmy Graham is now injured, but his connection with Rodgers hasn't been seamless in their first year together.\n\nRodgers himself hasn't been perfect either. It's the first year Rodgers' passer rating isn't over 100, and his completion percentage stands at just 61.8%. The problem is, the Packers simply aren't a great team unless Rodgers is close to perfect.\n\nThe Packers might have to win out to have a shot at the playoffs. That may be easier said than done, as they still have to play the Minnesota Vikings, Chicago Bears, and Atlanta Falcons, plus the Lions, who beat them earlier and seem to get up for big games.\n\nIf the Packers miss the playoffs for two seasons in a row, leaving their $180 million quarterback at home in January, there may be changes to be made in Green Bay."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Antonio Villas-Boas", "title": "Leaked photos show Google could be working on a budget Pixel 3 with a headphone jack that costs $400 \u2014 and it could have the same amazing camera (GOOG, GOOGL)", "description": "Google apparently isn't done with its Pixel 3 smartphone just yet, as a \"budget\" that costs between $400 and $500 could have just been leaked via Russian tech site Rozetked.me.

Unlike political action committees, these 501(c) nonprofits are not required to register with the FEC and disclose their donors.\n\nGingrich's lamenting of a \"green wave\" of dark money carrying Democrats to victory \u2014 also echoed in a Fox News op-ed from earlier this month\u2014 is somewhat contradicted by the actual fundraising data available so far in Southern California Congressional races.\n\nIn the race for California's 45th district, non-disclosing outside groups actually spent more than four times as much money support to Walters, the Republican candidate, than to support Porter, the Democratic nominee. While two 501(c) groups spent a total $256,000 to support Walters, a mixture of 501(c)s spent a total of $57,680 to support Porter.\n\nAccording to FEC disclosures analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, none of the candidates who ran in Orange County general election contests raised more than 1.73% of their direct campaign funds from non-profit groups that do not disclose their donors.\n\nRead more:Tensions flare as candidates accuse each other of ballot tampering and \"foul play\" in a close California congressional race\n\nIn terms of money not donated directly to a candidate's campaign and spent to support the candidates in the form of TV ad buys, for example, \"dark money\" groups expended $1.5 million to support the five Democratic candidates in competitive Southern California races and $1.27 million supporting the Republicans, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThis means that while spending from non-disclosing groups slightly favored Democrats, Southern California candidates of both parties benefited from the \"green wave,\" as Gingrich put it. And if outside money could really \"buy\" a House seat, Republicans would have won in at least two districts.\n\nOutside groups spent more on Democrats than Republicans in two races, the contest for California's 39th district and the 25th, groups supporting the Democratic and Republican candidates spent almost exactly the same amount in the 48th district, and 501(c)s spent more on Republicans than Democrats in the 45th and in the 49th district."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Matthew DeBord and Benjamin Zhang", "title": "15 cars that changed the world", "description": "We selected two cars from each decade that lived up to our criteria.

Clarke\n\nThe Trtl pillow is our top pick \u2014 even though it's not a pillow per se \u2014 because it is comfortable, very portable, and affordable.\n\nTrying to fall asleep on a plane is incredibly difficult, but having the right travel pillow can help you get some shut-eye during your epic flight across oceans and continents.\n\nI love flying in business class. It's not something I can do very often, but using points and miles for upgrades and free tickets, I've gotten to fly in that front cabin a few times.\n\nThe reason I love it so much is that I've always been a terrible airplane sleeper, and the added comfort of business class helps. When I sit in a regular coach seat on a red-eye flight, I have a lot of trouble getting any decent rest. That means spending much of the next day like a zombie until I can get to the hotel, hop in the shower, take a nap and start adjusting to the jet lag.\n\nOver the last few years, though, I've been figuring out a better routine to help me get at least a bit of rest on planes. First, I eat dinner in the airport, not on the plane. I make sure to brush my teeth, and I wear earplugs and a sleeping mask once we take off. Finally, I use a travel pillow.\n\nI used to think those pillows weren't helpful. You know the ones, the U-shaped things that look kind of like life preservers. My moment of clarity came when I realized I could simply turn the pillow around and wear it backward. That meant that as my head nods forward, my neck and chin are supported.\n\nFor people like me who tend to have trouble getting settled in economy seats, and who might not find the traditional travel pillow useful when nodding off, now is a great time to try a new pillow. There are a ton of fresh, innovative options today, as well as fresh takes on the classic U-shaped travel pillow.\n\nWhether it's a regular U-shaped travel pillow or something a bit more advanced, Insider Picks has you covered with the best travel pillows you can buy.\n\nHere are the best travel pillows you can buy:\n\nUpdated on 11/16/2018 by Lulu Chang: Added two new travel pillows and updated prices and formatting.\n\nRead on in the slides below to check out our top picks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "Facebook is sliding after Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg respond to the New York Times expos\u00e9 (FB)", "description": "The New York Times Wednesday published a 6,000-word expos\u00e9 saying Facebook leadership is \"delay, deny and deflect\" when dealing with crises, such as Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election.

For the first time, patients are transforming from passive recipients of healthcare services to active participants in their own health. They're flocking to online review sites to choose which doctor to see, skipping hospital visits in favor of a health clinic in their local CVS, and aren't afraid to ditch providers that don't offer them an engaging experience.\n\nThe superior customer service expectations of millennials, declines in hospital profitability, and threats from startup providers and retail pharmacies intensify the need for providers to revamp the patient experience. Providers' current engagement capabilities are weak, and deficiencies around scheduling, appointment wait times, and billing are dragging on patient satisfaction, driving patients elsewhere and draining provider revenue.\n\nIn this report, Business Insider Intelligence explores the trends that are driving providers to revamp their care services. We then outline how patients' expectations for transparency, convenience, and access are transforming the way they interact with providers across each stage of care. Finally, we detail strategies health systems and hospitals can implement to create a consumer-centric patient experience that fosters satisfaction, loyalty, and patient volume.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: 98point6, BayCare, Cleveland Clinic, CVS, Integris, Kaiser Permanente, Luma Health, New York-Presbyterian, One Medical, Publix, Target, Walgreens, Walmart, Yelp, and Zocdoc.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Remi Rosmarin", "title": "Save up to 50% on a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Williams Sonoma \u2014 and more of today's best deals from around the web", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Politico Pro reported on Thursday that Amazon's eight million-square-foot headquarters will likely squash previous plans to build affordable housing on that site.\n\nPlaxall, a plastics company, owns much of the land that Amazon plans to build on. As Politico Pro detailed, Plaxall was readying a proposal to build 4,995 new homes on that site. A quarter of those homes \u2014 1,250 residences \u2014 would qualify as affordable housing, meaning it's fit for individuals earning as little as $18,000 annually.\n\nHowever, most of that 14.7-acre site will become part of Amazon's office campus.

And I'm happy to say that Caple pulled it off.\n\nEssentially hand-picked by Coogler to take on the sequel, Caple orchestrates a worthy sequel that still has those needed references to the \"Rocky\" franchise the fans crave, but makes a point to build up Adonis' own story.\n\nFrom a screenplay by Stallone and Joel Taylor, \"Creed II\" picks up six fights after Creed lost to \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan in the first movie. Having won them all, he's now up against the champion Danny \"Stuntman\" Wheeler (Andrew Ward) for the title. Creed takes the belt (and the keys back to his car that Wheeler took from the brief fight they had in the first movie) and closes the night by proposing to his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson). All seems to be going right for Creed.\n\nDolph Lundgren, left, and Florian Munteanu in \"Creed II.\" MGM\n\nBut in the Ukraine, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) has dreams of a hero's return to Russia by shaping his son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), into an even more powerful boxer than he was. In exile since losing to Balboa in \"Rocky IV,\" the Dragos wake up every morning with a singular goal: beat Creed like Ivan did his father. This leads father and son to Philadelphia to challenge Creed and Balboa to a title fight. With footage from \"Rocky IV\" used in ESPN highlights, Creed can't look away from footage of his father dying in the ring at the hands of Drago over 30 years ago. Of course, the two sons are going to fight.\n\nThe movie then turns to the deep-rooted drama that happens in all the \"Rocky\" movies: why fight? With the guilt of not calling off the Apollo Creed-Ivan Drago fight still hanging over him, Balboa doesn't want any part of it. But of course, Adonis wants to avenge his father. This leads to an impasse between the two that causes some soul searching for both men.\n\nRead more:Emma Stone told us \"The Favourite\" was her first movie in 4 years she wasn't constantly \"fixing'\n\n\"Creed II\" gives us the intense training montages and incredible fights that are a trademark in the \"Rocky\" franchise, but what really stands out are the things that happen outside of the ropes. What starts out as a revenge tale slowly evolves into a story of fathers and sons and the building of new legacies. At its core is the work of Jordan, who again as Creed delivers a performance that shows why he's a movie star. His charisma matched with his talent is a total package that any franchise dreams of. Then there's the chemistry between Jordan and Thompson that adds another powerful layer. Stallone, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Balboa in \"Creed,\" once more delivers in the role that has defined his career \u2014 especially in the movie's powerful ending.\n\nWhat Coogler did with \"Creed\" was special: taking a beloved franchise like \"Rocky\" and reshaping it for a new generation. But Caple took on an even riskier assignment by doing the sequel. Thankfully he succeeded, and he did it by focusing on the characters and not the legend of the intellectual property."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Troy Wolverton", "title": "Google replaces Diane Greene as head of its cloud business (GOOGL)", "description": "Google has replaced Diane Greene as the head of its cloud business, CNBC reported on Friday.

We established a training and professional services organization and partnering organizations. We revamped customer engineering and added a team of experts in the Office of the CTO. We also pioneered a way to help enterprises adopt AI through our Advanced Solutions Lab. We built out a full marketing organization that in just three years has received many recognitions including Cannes Lions awards. We set up our industry verticals org where we have achieved massive traction in health, financial services, retail, gaming and media, energy and manufacturing, and transportation. We set up the Cloud ML and the Cloud IoT groups. We acquired Apigee, Kaggle, qwiklabs and several great small startups. Our technology development has been recognized throughout the industry, and Google Cloud is differentiated in security, AI, open hybrid application modernization, G Suite, and many other areas. We are now recognized as a leader in 11 Gartner Magic Quadrants and Forrester Waves. But here's what I'm most proud of: the phenomenal team assembled and how we together have built out all of our functions for customer-facing enterprise readiness and engineering enterprise execution. When this journey started, some people would say that Google had great technology but they weren't sure that customers would rely on Google as their enterprise partner.

He didn't realize until after the game that his last name, made famous by his Naismith Hall of Fame father, was misspelled on the back.\n\n\"It's kind of ironic,\" the freshman told ESPN's Myron Medcalf.\n\nAccording to Medcalf, university officials were not sure how the misprint occurred, especially given that the school supplied its own jerseys for the team.\n\n\"Not a rational [explanation],\" Syracuse spokesman Pete Moore told ESPN. \"The event did not supply it.\"\n\nPerhaps that's why Boeheim failed to live up to his namesake Thursday night. The walk-on guard and former three-star prospect provided just one point and one assist in the 76-83 loss, but fellow freshman Jalen Carey poured in 26 points and seven rebounds to lead all scorers.\n\nEven with two other Orange players reaching double digits, Syracuse could not hold off UConn's evenly-distributed scoring effort after falling behind in the first half. Star guard Tyus Battle converted on a contested layup to cut the Huskies' lead to five with just 21 seconds remaining in the contest, but UConn sank all of its subsequent free-throw attempts to seal the win.\n\nFirst-year Huskies head coach Dan Hurley was understandably excited about the win:\n\n\"I thought they played harder than us,\" Coach Boeheim said after the game, per the New York Post's Howie Kussoy. \"We got out-toughed. That's something we're gonna have to look in the mirror about and figure out.\"\n\nThe Orange will have less than 24 hours to reevaluate as they gear up to face the No. 13 Oregon Ducks \u2014 who also lost to an unranked opponent in their opening game of the tournament \u2014 Friday afternoon."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Amir Ismael", "title": "EBay's new Toytopia section has millions of new and vintage toys for the holiday season \u2014 here are 12 of the best ones to buy", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

When I graduated ... I know I want to be creative in my life. Do I want to write music or do I want to write books? At that point, at 22, I thought, well, music's going to be much more fun. I moved out to Los Angeles, and it's generous to say I was a songwriter. I was a starving songwriter. I was there for a couple of years, signed a record deal, and had a record come out that sold about a dozen copies, most of them to my mom.\n\nI simultaneously wrote an article for an alumni magazine about what it was like to be sort of a preppy geeky kid from Phillips Exeter Academy living in Hollywood among punk-rock musicians. A literary agent saw the article and called and said, \"I love the way you write. I think you're a writer.\" I said, \"No, no. Actually, I'm a musician.\" A couple of years later I actually had lunch with him. He said, \"When you're ready to write, let me know.\"\n\nAbout a year later, I woke up and decided I was ready to write. Wrote a novel called \"Digital Fortress.\" Sent it to him. Now, I had failed endlessly in the music industry. This novel was picked up by the first New York editor who read it, Tom Dunne over at St. Martin's Press. I thought, \"Wow, writing books is easy.\" Of course the book came out and did nothing. It was an instant failure.\n\nMy first three books were, in fact, commercial failures, I guess you would call them. I really didn't sell many copies. It was not until \"The Da Vinci Code\" came out that I had really any success at all. Of course, the previous three novels, which had not sold, went on to sell, went on to No. 1 on the best-seller list. I had not changed a word. That's an important message to everybody: that some of these products and ideas that you have early in your career that may flop actually may be assets later in your life. They may end up having an audience.\n\nIf 'The Da Vinci Code' didn't land, he was going to switch careers\n\nGraham Flanagan: You said you struggled at first, and your first few things you wrote did not do well. Was there ever a point when you were writing early on that you thought, \"Maybe I tried it, maybe I should pivot to something else?\"\n\nBrown: Yes, there was actually. I had written \"The Da Vinci Code.\" I had finished it. It had not been published yet. The galley came out, the advanced reading copy. I took it out to a park and sat down with it, and read it in a whole day. Read the whole thing from cover to cover. And thought, if this book doesn't work, then I shouldn't be a writer. Because to my taste, this is a terrific book. This is a book I would want to read. When you're a creative person, all you have to guide you is your own taste. I don't care whether you're a painter, a musician, or a writer. You have to create the piece of art, the piece of music, the literature that you like. Then hope other people share your taste. So when I read \"The Da Vinci Code\" and thought, \"I think this is exactly what I set out to do,\" if it had failed, I would have to assume nobody shares my taste, so therefore it's impossible for me to be a writer. I'll go do something else.\n\nFlanagan: So what happened? When did you realize \"The Da Vinci Code\" was a success?\n\nBrown: It was about six months before it came out. The preorders were so high from Barnes and Noble. This was back in the days of Borders and Barnes & Noble and all the independent booksellers. It was a much different market. There was enormous buzz among booksellers saying, \"We, as booksellers, love this novel. We know we can hand-sell it to everybody that walks in the door.\"\n\nSo Random House kept calling, saying, \"Wow, they just doubled their order, they tripled their order, they quadrupled their order.\" And they actually put me on book tour four months before the book came out. They said, \"We want you to go meet all the booksellers.\" I said, \"I don't understand.\" They said: \"They love your book; they just want to know you're not a jerk. Just go have dinner with them.\" I met all the CEOs and all the independent booksellers. It was a lot of fun. That was in the days when we hand-sold books to readers.\n\nBrown began a relationship with Hollywood when director Ron Howard decided to adapt \"The Da Vinci Code\" into a film that premiered in 2006. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nFlanagan: So how did you process the success in the first week of that book going on sale? It was like an instant phenomenon. Just you as person, who'd been starting out as a musician, struggling as a writer before this piece, then this happens. How do you even process that?\n\nBrown: It was difficult. I was very, very grateful, of course. You kind of think every day you're going to wake up and find out it was all a dream. You pinch yourself saying: \"OK, this is actually happening. Yes, this is what's happening. This is how many books we sold today. I guess I'm going to go be on the following TV shows. The book has sold around the world.\"\n\nAt some level, you just sort of laugh and say, \"Wow, how lucky am I!\" It applies pressure, of course, because you have such a big readership. You want to make sure that what you create is worthy of their time, and makes them happy, and nobody ever feels, like, \"You know what, he had some success, and now he's not even trying.\" I actually end up trying harder now that I have had some success.\n\nFlanagan: Why did \"The Da Vinci Code\" do so well? What was it that connected with so many people?\n\nBrown: Some of it was luck. It was timing. It was unplanned timing. When I started that book, I wanted to write a book about religion. I grew up in a very religious household. I'd always struggled with the battle between science and religion. I'd had some experiences that had led me away from the church. And I wanted to write an alternative story of Jesus. What would it mean for Christianity if Jesus were not literally the Son of God? If he were a mortal prophet? I sort of felt, like, \"Well, that's an OK question to ask.\" Of course the book comes not \u2014 not everybody thought it was a great question to ask. It became very controversial. But it came out, just by luck, at a point when a lot of people were questioning the church. There'd been a lot of scandal. People were looking for a different voice. They were saying: \"Wait a minute. If the church isn't telling us the truth about this, maybe they're not telling us the truth about the story of Jesus either.\"\n\nNow, I didn't set out to convert anyone to my way of thinking. This is a story that I told that made sense to me. But it's a thriller. I happen to believe it, but that's sort of irrelevant with my readers. If you want to believe it, great; if you don't, it's a fun story. So, it was timing, and I had an absolutely amazing publisher. I changed publishers. I came here to Random House. And they read the first 100 pages of this novel, and before I had even finished it, they said: \"We love this. We're going to do everything we can to make this a popular book.\" It just sort of took off. It was a real thrill.\n\nFlanagan: When it did generate controversy, how did you react?\n\nBrown: You know what? This will sound naive, but I didn't anticipate any controversy. I grew up in a household that ... encouraged questioning, and, you know, I'll never forget. I grew up sort of believing in Adam and Eve, and then went to the Boston Museum of Science and saw this exhibit on evolution, and went to my priest and said, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Like, which story is true?\" This priest said, \"Nice boys don't ask that question,\" and I immediately sort of went off into the world of science.\n\nFlanagan: That really \u2014\n\nBrown: That was a moment for me.\n\nFlanagan: Lit a fire under you.\n\nBrown: Yeah, it did, because I thought, wait, I was taught nice boys ask questions. Smart boys ask questions. You ask every question you have, and so when I wrote \"The Da Vinci Code,\" which literally asked a pretty simple question, not all that aggressively. It just said, \"Hey, what if this happened?\" And people were so angry. I was stunned. It took me ... I like to say it took me a long time to get used to it. I didn't have a long time. I was on talk shows with people outside boycotting, you know, burning me in effigy. It was, like, \"Whoa \u2014 OK!\" so, I had to basically address the concerns the way I've tried to do everything, with some integrity, and with some honesty, and essentially say: \"Look, I didn't set out to offend anyone. I set out to tell a story that made sense to me, and I have no vested interest in whether you believe the narrative of 'The Da Vinci Code' or not, any more than you believed the narrative of '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.'\"\n\nI mean, it's a story. To me, it makes more sense than what I learned in Sunday school. I think the reason there was so much controversy is it made sense to a lot of people, and because it was so popular. If that book had sold a thousand copies, nobody would have boycotted it. The problem was, you know everybody in every church was reading it, and going into their church saying: \"Hey, wait a minute! I didn't know that the Council of Nicea did this. Is that true?\" It was really upsetting to the church.\n\nLearning how to ignore the noise\n\nFlanagan: What was the first professional decision you made after the success of \"The Da Vinci Code,\" where you decided, \"This is going to be my next step\"?\n\nBrown: In a word, trust. You have to trust yourself, meaning that you have a lot of people whispering in your ear, telling you which way to go, telling you you're good, telling you you're bad. You've got reviewers saying, \"This is the best book ever\"; you've got reviewers saying, \"This is the worst book ever.\" You've just got a lot of noise. This idea of sitting down to write your next book, I struggled for a couple weeks. I would write a paragraph and say, \"Well, now millions of people are going to read this. Is it good enough?\" I would delete it. You become self-aware. You become the batter standing in the batter's box who's thinking of the mechanics of his or her swing. You become the singer who can't make the right noise because you're imagining how to move your vocal chords. Self-awareness for any creative person, or I'm imagining any CEO who's working on gut, self-awareness is not helpful. So for me, it was trusting my gut, saying: \"Wait a minute: Just write the book you want to read. That's all you've ever been doing. These first four books, you've sat down, and if you read the paragraph and you liked it, you said, 'OK, I'm done.' So get back to that mindset where you say, 'Just write for you.' Because other people share your taste.\" That was the first thing I did.\n\nFlanagan: So you figured out a way to alleviate the pressure.\n\nBrown: You compartmentalize and realize that whatever you're doing, you're doing for yourself. You are writing the book that you would want to read, then hoping other people share your taste. In my case, I knew at that point people shared my taste. The worst thing I could do for my brand was to chase what I thought they wanted. I know what they want. It's what I want. So just do what you, as a leader, or an artist, or whatever it is, want to do.\n\nFlanagan: The self-awareness of artists and writers in particular can create a lot of anxiety. You've seen a lot of authors who had these blockbusters, like Harper Lee and J.D. Salinger. Did you ever think, \"OK, why do I need to try and top this? Why not just sit back and let the success of this book give me the life that I want to have? Not try to wade in those waters anymore?\"\n\nBrown: Well, the life that I want to have is a creative life, so rather than saying: \"I guess I'm done. Now I can just sort of sip gin gimlets and look at the ocean.\" I thought, \"Wow, now I have the means to travel the world, and write about different places. I can meet fascinating people.\"\n\nYes, there was a lot of pressure, and there was some self-awareness along the way that became a muddled process. I navigated that and feel very, very fortunate that I'm able to continue to be creative. For most creative people, the process has to be enough. You look at someone like John Grisham, one of the most successful authors in history. He writes a book a year. He doesn't need the money; he doesn't need the accolades. He just loves to tell a story. Those are the people that are successful, the people that love what they do.\n\nFlanagan: When you sit down to decide what your next project is going to be, what drives the decision to continue with the [\"Da Vinci Code\" hero Robert] Langdon saga versus doing something completely different?\n\nBrown: Really, it has to do with whether or not Langdon, the character Langdon, can bring a fresh look to a world or to a topic. With the novel origin, I really felt like Langdon needs to be thrown into the world of modern art. He knows nothing about it. This will be amusing to watch him walk into the Guggenheim and see a wheelbarrow full of Jell-O under a spotlight, and say, \"I don't get it.\" As an academic. From that standpoint, I felt like Langdon is the character. As I go forward, I'm looking at new projects. It's very possible my next book will be a stand-alone thriller in a totally different genre.\n\nPassing on his best career lessons\n\nFlanagan: What is the biggest challenge you've had to overcome in your career?\n\nBrown:Wow\u2014 there are so many. But I think just a level of calmness about what you do, about just trusting your process, saying, \"You got this far.\" Putting one foot in front of the other every morning. Focusing and just doing what you do. And you need to put on the blinders and just keep doing that. Because the success that people have is often \u2014 those seeds are built 20 years before their success. And when I see creative people who go off the rails a little bit and try to say, \"Oh, now I'm successful; I need to do something else.\" The answer is \"No, you don't. What you did to get here is what you need to keep doing.\" And that, for me, has been sort of the challenge to say, like, \"All these people are saying this and that. And there are all these distractions.\" The reality is, if you want to stay successful, you need to realize that it's about hard work. It's not about necessarily positioning your brand and doing this and doing that. It's about actually creating the product that people read, and immediately call a friend and say: \"Have you read? You're going to love this.\" That's the challenge, to say in that mind-set.\n\nIn his MasterClass series, Brown shows how process is as important as ideas when it comes to writing novels. MasterClass\n\nFlanagan: So, you got a lot of wisdom and experience that people, obviously, they're paying for through this MasterClass product. Why did you decide to do this class?\n\nBrown: You know, my dad's a teacher, my mom's a teacher. I think teaching is the noblest of all professions. I've been a teacher. I love teaching. And I wanted to create a class that was full of specifics. Now, a lot of writing students hear ethereal advice: \"Write what you know,\" \"Be passionate,\" \"Show, don't tell.\" It's all true, but it's not all that helpful. And I wanted to really get down to the nuts and bolts of what it is to tell a story. And this is a class that will help people write in their own voice. It will help them write the story they want to write. Or write a story that's their own. This isn't about how to write like me. Some people love the way I write; some people hate the way I write. It's about storytelling. And the amazing thing about story, when you step back from it is, you realize that every great story, whether it is an ancient myth or literary fiction or a modern thriller or a TV series that you're addicted to on Netflix. Whatever it is, these stories all have the same exact elements. It's like a car. There's all these different kinds of cars, but when you open the hood, you see the same stuff. Put together differently, modeled a little bit differently, but you don't have a car without a gas tank \u2014 at least until Tesla came along. But I'm just saying, they all have the same elements. And that's what this MasterClass is about. What are the elements of storytelling? Whether you're writing scripts for TV, writing thrillers, writing literary fiction, it's all there. It's all the same thing. And if I'd had this MasterClass, I'd be a better writer today because I would have had a head start a long time ago, to learn all these things that I've learned through trial and error, through the process of just creating.\n\nFlanagan: Was it always all there for you? Did you always just have that, the foundation and fundamentals of storytelling in your bones that allowed you to create?\n\nBrown: No. I had an appreciation of storytelling in my bones, but certainly not the knowledge of how to put them together. A lot of that is trial and error. And a lot of that is reading, critical reading. A lot of that was early on ... All the writings of Joseph Campbell, this idea of the hero myth, and the hero of a thousand faces. This idea that, there really is just one story. And we tell it over and over and over. And it's not about what happens; it's about how it happens. And, we always joke: You look at how Ian Fleming wrote James Bond, this amazingly successful series. And at the beginning of every James Bond, you say, \"Well, there's a ticking clock, a bomb's going to go off, and is he going to get the girl.\" Well, of course, he's going to save the world, he's going to get the girl. The question is, how? So, that really is what this class talks about. How do you give the reader what it is they want in a way they don't see coming?\n\nFlanagan: What piece of advice would you give to the young Brown that had yet to really figure it out, figure out the correct path to be on, that probably would have gotten you to where you were faster?\n\nBrown: I think it's about trust. I think that the creative process is filled with hesitation. It's filled with self-doubt for all artistic people. And it's one thing when you're successful to say, \"Well, this person says that I don't know what I'm doing.\" But those 37 million people say, \"Yes, you do.\" OK, you have to that fall back on. You say, \"Well, I'm pretty successful.\" Early on in your career, no matter what your business is, you don't have that. You can't, if you've got a business idea that a lot of people say, \"I don't get it.\" \"But you really get it,\" I think I would have told Dan Brown, \"You get it. Just trust your gut. It's going to take some time to build this business, to build an audience, to build a craft. Don't worry quite so much. Just get back to work.\"\n\nFlanagan: This is something that people can find out about in detail if they take the MasterClass, but I just want to know about your process. Can you give me a bird's-eye view of the order of operations from conception to research?\n\nBrown: Sure.\n\nFlanagan: And your writing process?\n\nBrown: Yeah. When I sort of get to the point, after a book has come out, there's usually a year when I don't write, when I'm just reading a lot, promoting. I'm just sort of not in the writing process, but I am always casting around for ideas. I'm traveling the world as I promote and sort of saying, \"Well, that's a pretty interesting thing,\" you know, this underground whatever it is in Iceland. It's kind of a double-edged sword, because I like to keep my topics secret. So when I research, it used to be that I could go to a museum and talk to a curator and nobody would care. Now, if I go to the Uffizi and want to talk to the curator about a specific painting, I need to know that there may be an article in the paper tomorrow saying, \"Brown was here looking at the following Botticelli.\" So it becomes a little bit of a cat-and-mouse game. It's a lot of fun.\n\nSo there will come a point when I sort of decide, \"OK, Dan, it's time to write another book.\" By that point, I usually have enough choices of what I call \"worlds,\" where is this going to be set, and I don't necessarily mean Paris. I might mean, you know, brain surgery, or finance, you know, whatever it is, and I'll say, \"Well, I want to write a thriller set in the world of finance.\" OK, well, I don't know a lot about finance, and I'm going to need to learn a lot, so I'm going to reach out to contacts and find somebody who can bring me down to New York and show me how it all works, and give a sense of some of the moral gray areas. Then I will immediately set out to find character \u2014 you have to find somebody who's an expert in finance. Maybe you take a page from John Grisham's book, and it's like \"The Firm.\" It's a young broker who gets in with the wrong people. Whatever it is.\n\nYou immediately need to find the antagonist. The villain is even more important than the hero, because the villain defines the action. If it weren't for the villain there would be no conflict. As you start to populate this world with characters, you start to create a plot. I usually create a finale first, which is almost invariably the hero conquering the villain, good conquering evil, morality over immorality, those sorts of things. I will write an enormous structure, usually about a hundred pages long for this novel. Once all of that is done, you know, then just comes ... I hate to think of it as a grind, but it is. It's two or three years of getting up at 4 a.m., walking to the other end of the house where there's no internet, no phone, no nothing, sitting down at my desk, and starting to put words on the page. One of every 10 words works and stays and, you know, for every one page you read in the novel, I threw 10 out. I get it wrong, get it wrong, get it wrong, and finally get it right.\n\nFlanagan: Since your books have been adapted into films that have been widely successful, how does that influence your writing process and your conception of plot and everything? Are you thinking, \"Oh, this could be cinematic\"?\n\nBrown: You know, I'm not really. I wrote books a long time before Tom Hanks was Robert Langdon. I've been very, very lucky to have Tom Hanks play Robert Langdon. He does an amazing job.\n\nFlanagan: Is he who you envisioned?\n\nBrown: No.\n\nFlanagan: Was there an actor you sort of envisioned?\n\nBrown: There wasn't an actor. He's sort of a conglomerate of many, many, different people. I think in \"Da Vinci Code\" he's referred to as Harrison Ford in Harris Tweed, sort of, you know he's professorial, but handsome, and he's sort of the guy you wish you could be if you're in the world of academia. You've got to put a little of yourself in every hero. It's vicarious living through a much better version of yourself, somebody who's more daring, somebody who's smarter. I've had funny moments. I had a woman once say, \"Are you Robert Langdon,\" and I gave my usual answer, \"No, he's the guy I wish I could be. He's smarter. He's all this stuff.\" She said, \"Well, how can he be smarter, because everything he says you had to think of?\" I had to point out that when Robert Langdon walks by a painting and just glances over and gives a perfect 30-second soliloquy, that took me three days to write and research, so trust me, he's a lot smarter than I am.\n\nFlanagan: How do you measure success for yourself?\n\nBrown: In the simplest of terms, do I enjoy what I do when I get up every morning? Do I wake up, excited to get to my desk, or whatever it is I'm doing that day? If the answer's yes, I feel successful.\n\nFlanagan: What about once you've delivered a book, a product \u2014 at this point do you even care if it's successful?\n\nBrown: Oh, yes, you do. You pretend you don't, but you care a lot, of course. I'm very fortunate. I've got a lot fans who've really enabled me to do what I love for a living. I'm able to afford to write. So there's a feeling of obligation to make sure that what I write, they enjoy. If they do, it makes me happy, and if they don't, I'm concerned about that. I've been fortunate so far that the books have been well received.\n\nFlanagan: Finally, what is one piece of advice you would give someone who wants to have a career like yours?\n\nBrown: To be patient. To continually work. There is no substitute for hard work, and the thing that people forget is when they get insecure, and when they get frustrated, that they stop working, and you have to work through those moments. You just say, \"Well, this novel didn't work. Let's try the next one. Let's try the next one.\" Whatever business you're in, to be patient, and to not let your impatience interfere with your process.\n\nFlanagan: Well, we will patiently await your next project. Thank you so much for your time.\n\nBrown: My pleasure."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mark Matousek", "title": "Tesla customers in China can now order the Model 3 (TSLA)", "description": "Chinese customers are now able to order Tesla 's Model 3 sedan, according to the automaker's Chinese website.

Julio Aguilar/Getty Images For teams in the GoF conferences (Conference USA, Mid-American Conference, Mountain West Conference, Sun Belt Conference, and UCF's American Athletic Conference), the Knights' plight is strong evidence that the teams in those conferences have their playoff fate determined before the season starts. Even if a team wins every game on their schedule, they still have no shot to compete with the Power Five teams in the playoff.\n\nThe biggest problem is the playoff itself. With only four spots, five Power Five conferences (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, and Pac-12), and Notre Dame, it is already designed to exclude good teams. It is hard to justify the inclusion of a school from a lesser conference when we already know good teams from the Power Five conferences, including at least one conference champ, will be left out.\n\nRead more:Notre Dame is on pace to create a new kind of college football chaos and is the best evidence yet that an 8-team playoff is needed\n\nThe simple answers won't work or would take too long\n\nThe most straightforward solution is to expand the playoff to eight teams with one spot reserved for the top GoF team if they meet specific criteria (e.g., must be ranked in the top 12). But with ESPN locked into a 4-team playoff contract through 2025, it appears we are still eight years away from any hope of that happening.\n\nThe other answer that might seem simple on the surface is to challenge the top Power Five schools to more head-to-head matchups in the regular season and increase schedule strengths. The knock against UCF is that their schedule makes it difficult to determine how good they are.\n\nUnfortunately, that is likely to go largely ignored.\n\nNick Saban has no interest in scheduling games against Group of Five teams. Sean Gardner/Reuters Most of the top Power Five schools have no interest in risking a blemish to their record against a team outside the top conferences, preferring, instead, non-conference matchups against fellow Power Five teams or cupcakes.\n\nAlabama head coach Nick Saban took it a step further, saying he wished Power 5 schools only scheduled games against other Power 5 schools.\n\n\"If it was totally up to me, I'd say you've got to play all 12 games in the top 5 (conferences),\" Saban said in 2014.\n\nBut there is another way.\n\nDivorce the Power 5 schools\n\nIf the Group of Five merged with some or all of the FCS schools it could elevate the status of both groups. Matthew Holst/Getty Images\n\nChallenging the big schools to more head-to-head contests might help 3-4 GoF schools, but it won't do much for the rest. To elevate all 60, they need to split from the Power Five conferences.\n\nThe big schools have floated the idea of the Power 5 conferences breaking off into a \"fourth division\" of college football as a way to provide more money to players. It would also give the GoF 60 a shot at winning championships again.\n\nIf the Group of Five were to leave the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), they could form a separate division of college football and compete for a new championship. But the more enticing scenario might be to merge with all or some of the 125 Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) schools.\n\nBy merging with the FCS schools, there could be as many 186 schools competing for a title in a division that already has a 24-team playoff.\n\nIt wouldn't be as popular as the Power 5 playoff, but it would be college football's version of March Madness. Tie it with some of the popular bowls that are not included in the playoff and fans would get into it.\n\nMore importantly, the NCAA could stop pretending schools like UCF have a shot at the playoff, and the GoF 60 would have a shot at a legitimate championship."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "John Haltiwanger", "title": "North Korea to deport US citizen it says the CIA manipulated as it claims new 'high-tech tactical weapon'", "description": "North Korea on Friday said it was deporting a US citizen who entered the country illegally in October.

Locking pliers, colloquially referred to as \"vise grips,\" are also adjustable to a degree but feature the additional ability to lock into place so you can attach them to something and then let them go without the pliers falling off.\n\nThere are further sub-types within these categories that feature different nose and grip designs, but once you've got a basic idea of what you need, narrowing down the right pliers for you isn't so hard.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nSamsung unveiled its latest next-generation mobile system-on-chip (SoC), dubbed the Exynos 9820, that's expected to be embedded in the upcoming Galaxy S10. The impending chip is the company's first to house a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) to handle smartphones' AI functions on the device.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe Exynos 9820 will perform AI tasks seven times faster than the previous generation SoC, the Exynos 9810, while also lowering power consumption and improving performance of AI-based functions like image recognition, translation, and speech transcription. In addition, the chip will instantly adjust camera settings for a photo based on surroundings and help power AR and VR applications.\n\nThe move is important for Samsung as AI becomes central to the smartphone experience. Here's why:\n\nThe ability to run AI algorithms on the device, as opposed to the cloud, will be paramount to supporting the technology's advanced capabilities. AI applications require massive data loads that the cloud alone can't successfully process due to its need for a solid connection and its time-consuming nature for even the smallest tasks. While running AI algorithms on the device mollifies this issue, the cloud can complement the on-device processing by helping to support the massive data processing that results from a majority of AI interface algorithms that run on the device.\n\nIt will help Samsung compete with other smartphone vendors that have beat the company to the punch. Huawei introduced the Kirin 970 SoC in September 2017 and unveiled the next generation Kirin 980 in August 2018, which power Huawei's Mate 10 and Mate 20 smartphones, respectively. Both chips have dedicated AI processing units that help accelerate AI tasks on their respective devices. Meanwhile, Apple entered the space in September 2017 with its A11 Bionic chip, which houses a neural engine dedicated to handling specific machine learning algorithms and is housed in the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X. The company followed up the A11 with the A12 in September 2018, which included an updated neural engine that improved speeds of AI tasks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Scott Davis", "title": "Aaron Rodgers didn't know who he was throwing to on his incredible, 54-yard touchdown pass", "description": "Aaron Rodgers threw a beautiful, 54-yard touchdown pass to fourth-string tight end Robert Tonyan Jr. on Thursday.

Now I live here.\n\nI'm a lifelong East Coaster. Having spent much of that in Northern Jersey, I speak quickly and in short sentences. I am mostly always in a hurry. I'm cranky and jaded and unimpressed.\n\nHow then, as a mid-career, family-planning 30-something did I find myself in Idaho?\n\nI'm still processing that myself.\n\nFor my wife and I, living just outside of Manhattan suited us for a long time. Indeed, I can't say I ever seriously considered anything else. Life was good. We ate well, enjoyed ourselves, made friends and contacts, developed personally and professionally. We had dinner parties and went to shows \u2014 comedy, Broadway, et al. We traveled a lot \u2014 the kind of travel that puts your life and your own place in the world into perspective.\n\nBut years of city life were taking their toll, leaving us tired and frustrated. We began staying home more often, sequestering ourselves from crowds and incidental expenses. Every thought of leaving the house caused agitation. What fresh nightmares will the traffic gods unleash? A $12 beer? Wait, did we park in a Monday spot?\n\nIn short, too many people, with no respite in sight. Amazon's HQ2 is coming to NYC, with all the familiar side effects \u2014 more people, more traffic, higher cost of living.\n\nCost of living was already a major consideration when we bought our two-bedroom Hoboken apartment in 2012. Overnight, it seemed, we couldn't afford our own town anymore. When we committed to sell the same apartment seven years later, the new owners paid just under a million. A million dollars for 1,000 square feet and street parking.\n\nAfter several years looking for affordability within a familiar tri-state top ten list (Westchester, Maplewood, Red Bank, Stamford) and other locales (Maine; Rhode Island; Catskill, NY), nothing left us confident or inspired.\n\nMy wife travels for business, with her largest client in Boise, Idaho. After two years of Boise comings and goings, she finally said over dinner, \"I love it there. I want you to see it.\"\n\nBoise, for all I knew, might have been a waffle house adjacent to a potato farm. I could not have been more wrong.\n\nThe traffic is nonexistent, the air is clean, and the city is uncrowded\n\nIt's been less than a year since that dinner, and we've been in Boise for a few months. My first impressions? The people are nice. Fall weather is glorious. What passes for \"traffic\" in Idaho is ... adorable. The air is clean. The streets are clean. The city is uncrowded, but active.\n\nOutside of the city, the only real noise is the sound of construction \u2014 growing pains from a housing market booming with buyers like us: tired of the expense, the pretense, and the headaches of big city life. Bloomberg recently reported that 29% of those perusing Boise real-estate listings on Realtor.com are Californians, where homes cost five times more than those in Idaho's capital.\n\nRead more: Forget Portland and Seattle \u2014 people priced out of expensive California cities are buying homes in Idaho for 'Monopoly money'\n\nThey call it the Treasure Valley, and it's easy to see why. Boise is green \u2014 one of its many contradictions. A desert full of trees, supported by the wide and slow-moving Boise River. The river is enveloped by Greenbelt park, the pulse of the city's activity. And Boise is very active \u2014 from skiing to jogging to biking to kayaking, there's a sport for all seasons.\n\nBoise is a shockingly satisfying place for foodies: farmers' markets on Saturdays, olive hummus, elk steak, Idaho red wine, specialty coffee, and surprisingly great restaurants.\n\nThe business community is also surprisingly (to me, at least) robust. Boise is open for business, with a buzz of free enterprise and opportunity: new shops, new restaurants, lots of new-ness. Big tech has a presence here \u2014 Micron and HP among others \u2014 supported by a prominent startup ecosystem. With faster population growth than other any state in the country in 2017, according to the US Census Bureau, there's an optimism here that Idaho's ascendance is just beginning.\n\nBut I still experience culture shock every day\n\nOne thing I was unprepared for? Guns. Literally the first piece of mail that came to our new address was a gun advertisement. They are everywhere. You can bring a loaded pistol into Walmart, and no one bats an eye \u2014 that is, no one expect one frightened East Coast couple.\n\nAnd then there's the politics. \"Aren't you in Trump country?\" friends inquire. The answer is yes and no. Like most cities, Boise is solidly blue: eco-friendly, progressive, understanding of people's differences. But I'd be lying to say that there isn't a bit of culture shock every day \u2014 some small reminder that we live in a deeply red state.\n\nOur four-bedroom home in the foothills sits on a small plot of land on a tree-lined street and doesn't require two six-figure salaries to support it. All in, it cost us a little over half of what we sold our apartment for, and barely one-tenth of what we might have paid for anything remotely comparable in Hoboken.\n\nBoise is a proper city, with everything city people are accustomed to \u2014 just a bit less of it. A place largely free of suburban sprawl, surrounded by protected wilderness. A city, unlike most others, where 12 miles north you're in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI find myself speaking a little slower these days and being a little less cranky. Boise is still unfamiliar to me. I don't know the street names. I don't know our neighbors. But what is familiar is a feeling I had growing up in a small New England town: Work doesn't consume you, commutes don't kill you, and status doesn't define you."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Nicky Lineaweaver", "title": "UnitedHealthcare has added Apple Watch to its wellness plan (UNH, AAPL)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" Digital Health Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Notably, he couched his response with the preface, \"I would not ever rule something out.\"\n\nThat's a pretty big surprise, given the overwhelming success of Nintendo's two miniature \"Classic Edition\" consoles \u2014 the NES Classic Edition and the Super NES Classic Edition. Both consoles re-create the look of the original game consoles, albeit in a smaller size, and pack in a bunch of classic games.\n\nThe NES Classic Edition (left) and Super NES Classic Edition (right).

Since that quarter, Walmart's US e-commerce growth has increased each quarter and is now up to 43% YoY, so it's heading in the right direction.\n\nThe holiday season offers Walmart the opportunity to cement its e-commerce turnaround, and it's made moves to try to do just that.\n\nIt's acquired new brands and increased its product selection. The retailer recently acquired women's plus-sized apparel brand Eloquii and intimates e-tailer Bare Necessities, and added new brands to its marketplace, with Lord & Taylor and Moosejaw on Walmart.com and Bonobos and Nike on Jet.com. It's also built out its online selection of toys. All of these additions make Walmart.com a more attractive online shopping destination, giving it a better chance of winning online sales from shoppers during the holidays.\n\nWalmart added free two-day shipping for millions of third-party products on its marketplace. Free shipping is a big draw for online shoppers, and making it available for more products brings Walmart closer to competing with Amazon, Target, and other retailers that have stepped up their shipping offerings for the holidays in particular."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meghan Morris", "title": "Wall Street's most grueling exam is moving online to offer more testing dates and faster results", "description": "The CFA Institute is moving its increasingly popular Level I exams online.

The test, currently offered in June and December, would also be administered more often. To be clear, test-takers would still need to head to physical locations for the exam, but the paper test would be replaced with an online one.\n\nTest-takers could see different types of questions through online exams than the paper tests allow. For example, an online format offers more options to incorporate spreadsheets into questions, Anne O'Brien, the CFA Institute's head of communications, said in an interview.\n\nThe CFA Institute is still finding vendors for online exam administration, so the changes are a few years away, O'Brien said.\n\nA record 227,031 candidates registered to take the Level I, II, or III test in June, up 20% from last year. Tests were administered in 286 centers around the world.\n\nElectronic exams offered more often could help the CFA Institute use a wider variety of venues \u2014 and students would see results faster, O'Brien said.\n\nWe're happy to offer you, a valued Business Insider reader, access to our premium investing and company coverage for a month. Just email guestpass@bi-prime.com with \"Investing\" as the subject line.\n\n\"It's becoming increasingly challenging to find and staff physical venues in some of our markets to accommodate the sheer volume of candidates we have,\" O'Brien said.\n\nBecoming a CFA charterholder is a huge leg up for anyone hoping to build a career in money management. It's also less expensive than an MBA \u2014 a CFA costs about $2,500 in total, while an MBA can easily run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nSince the Level I exam, which is six hours long and features 240 multiple-choice questions, is offered only twice a year, venues must accommodate sometimes thousands of students. In New York, for example, test-takers head to the Javits Center, a convention center spanning 1.8 million square feet. Next year, the CFA Institute will administer the Level I exam over two days in Beijing to accomodate the increasing number of test-takers.\n\nThe Level I exam focuses on investment tools and business foundations, while Level II and III tests dive deeper into analysis and portfolio management. It takes most candidates four years to pass all three levels of the test.\n\nLess than 20% of people who start the CFA program make it through all three levels and complete the other requirements to become a charterholder.\n\nThe first CFA exam was administered in 1963 to 284 candidates in the US, Canada, and London, according to the CFA Institute's website. There are now more than 154,000 CFA charterholders globally.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the Level I exam will be administered in Beijing over two days in 2019, not in 2018.\n\nSee also:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "California's biggest utility provider spikes after regulator eases fears of bankruptcy following deadly wildfire (PCG)", "description": "California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire broke out last Thursday.

But the most important thing I picked up was an easy-to-learn tactic anyone could use.\n\nHeld at a nondescript warehouse in suburban Maryland, the training was led by Global Journalist Security, an organization founded in 2011 to help people going to dangerous places acquire what it calls the \"physical, digital, and emotional aspects of self-protection.\"\n\nIt was founded by Frank Smyth, a veteran journalist who has covered conflicts in El Salvador, Colombia, Rwanda, and Iraq, where he was held in captivity for nearly three weeks in 1991.\n\nI had some vague idea of what I was getting myself into. I'm traveling to Egypt, Nigeria, and Ethiopia over the next couple of months, and fellow journalists had recommended the course as preparation for the worst-case scenarios: kidnappings, terrorist attacks, active-shooter situations, and war zones. How a three-day course in suburban Maryland could credibly do that was anybody's guess.\n\nTraining prepares people not to freeze or panic in worst-case scenarios\n\nThe chief trainers Paul Burton and Shane Bell, a former British Army sergeant and a former Australian Armed Forces elite commando respectively, are experts at putting people in distressed mindsets. The two have accompanied journalists and aid workers in the world's most dangerous places, been kidnapped, and negotiated kidnapping releases. They know what they're talking about.\n\nRead more: These photos show the brutal reality of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nOver the course of the training, Bell, Burton, and the rest of the GJS team thrust attendees \u2014 yours truly, included \u2014 into simulations designed to trigger your adrenaline.\n\n\"You want to give people skills to stay in the moment and not freeze or go into panic mode,\" Smyth told Columbia Journalism Review in 2013. \"Some people will forget to yell, 'Hey, she's being dragged away \u2014 we have to help her!' [The training] plants seeds, things to remember.\"\n\nI had to save a fellow aid worker from an \"arterial puncture wound\" that was squirting a fountain of (very real-looking) \"blood\" from a gaping \"flesh wound.\" Hooded actors interrupted PowerPoint presentations firing blanks into the class as we scrambled to find cover and escape. There was a kidnapping during which I was told to \"slither like the American snake that I am.\" And finally we were put through a final course across fields and hiking trails designed to mimic a war zone with grenades thrown, artillery shelling, landmines, and snipers.\n\nMy hand after saving someone with a mock arterial puncture wound. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nMy 13-year-old self thought it was pretty wicked. My 28-year-old self was shook. By the end, I was praying I would never have to use any of it, particularly after I \"died\" in the first active-shooter scenario.\n\nBut that scenario came before I learned the most valuable skill Burton, Bell, and company imparted upon us: tactical breathing.\n\nCombat troops, police officers, and first responders are trained in tactical breathing\n\nTactical, or combat, breathing is a technique taught by the military, the police, and first-responders. And there's increasing scientific evidence to back up the practice.\n\nThe idea behind it is simple: When you enter high-stress situations, your sympathetic nervous system throws your body into overdrive. Adrenaline kicks in, your body starts to shake, and your mind races to solve the problem.\n\nIt doesn't just happen in war zones. If you hate public speaking, it's likely to happen before you get onstage. If you're nervous about an important exam, it may kick in as the timer starts.\n\nWhat Burton and Bell hammered home is that you can't prevent this response. It's instinctual. Your brain's three options are fight, flight, or freeze. And while you may know enough about yourself to know how you'll react when you have to make the big speech, you probably have no idea what your reaction will be during an active-shooter situation or in a war zone.\n\nUsually, in that state, you aren't thinking logically, if you are thinking at all. Flubbing the speech may not be a big deal, but if you enter that state in a war zone, it could get you killed.\n\nTactical breathing overrides that stress response by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, slowing down your heart rate and calming you down so you can make a rational decision.\n\nIt works like this: Breathe in for four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, and exhale for four seconds. Repeat as necessary until your heart rate slows and your mind calms. Yes, it is very similar to yogic meditation breathing.\n\nOnce your mind calms, you can make a rational decision about whether it is best to keep hiding or whether you need to run, rather than flailing in panic.\n\nIt's sad to say, but with 307 mass shootings in the US alone this year, that's information anyone could use. Not just war correspondents."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Paige Leskin", "title": "The 50 most high-tech cities in the world in 2018", "description": "Silicon Valley may be home to huge tech companies like Google and Facebook, but the San Francisco metro area isn't the most innovative city in the world, according to annual rankings compiled by data firm 2thinknow.

All you have to do is upload your address book. You can even order customized postage for your full-service cards. Want a stamp of your cute little kid in elf ears? Done. Or maybe a traditional Christmas tree or snowy scene? No problem.\n\nMinted is one of the only sites on our list that offers real three-dimensional letterpress printing.

Mm.\n\nMy name is Michelle. I ate nothing but Blue Apron for a week. And, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nI'm sure most of you know what Blue Apron is, but for those of you who don't, it's a weekly meal kit service that provides fresh ingredients to your door so that you can cook your own meal. I chose three recipes a week, that feeds two people each. So, that means I'll be eating six Blue Apron meals. And, all of that cost me 60 bucks.\n\nSo, a little background about my cooking skills... I do not know how to cook. My usual dinners throughout the week include eating out with friends, buying dinner from Chinatown, or eating my mom's home-cooked meals. I did set myself some goals for the week when I first started: be able to cook the meal within the estimated time, follow all the instructions on the recipe, and I would love to be able to cook something that will blow me away.\n\nAnd, so here's how it went.\n\nDay one, I had a few hiccups with my spicy shrimp pasta recipe. The recipe told me that the first thing that I should do is boil the water. But, I didn't do that. (I can see why they said to do it in the beginning because my water is still boiling). I didn't put enough chili sauce because I thought it'd be too spicy. I wasn't able to save enough water from the pasta. I kinda burnt the broccoli. I forgot to add the correct cheese. (There are two different cheese).\n\nAnd instead of cooking within the estimated time, I ended up taking a lot longer. 51 minutes to make this today. All these mistakes made my pasta taste mediocre. Like, would I be proud to invite my friends, family over and cook this for them? Maybe not.\n\nDay two pretty much consisted of me eating my leftovers from the day before. I ended up not being able to finish the whole thing because it was really, really bland. I ate all the shrimp though.\n\nDay three, hump day, I didn't wanna cook at all. But... It's supposed to take only 15 to 25 minutes, so hopefully I can just bang it out.\n\nNope, I was not able to \"bang it out.\"\n\nIt took me way too long to chop the tomatoes, I handled raw meat for the first time. (Oh, the texture, and it's so cold). I showed off my flipping technique. (It's all physics, alright? Here we go). And I ended up taking about 40 minutes to make my recipe. Expectation. Reality.\n\nMy overall reaction of the quesadilla, though? Not bad. Not bad. Mm, that's not bad either. Mmm! Not bad. Oh, I'm drooling. The texture of the quesadilla was on point! It was so soft and crunchy at the same time.\n\nThat was good, but I'm still hungry. So, I am walking to find some food because I'm still hungry. I think I'm gonna get my classic roast pork with rice. Shout out to Big Wong for coming through with my dinner tonight.\n\nAnd, let's just say day four was filled with a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nHey guys, so it's day four of my Blue Apron challenge, and I have my leftover quesadillas here. I was so excited to eat it because it was so good the day before, but... Nope, does not taste good. I should've just ate this all yesterday. Like, the meat is kinda stale. I can't taste the cheese anymore. The texture of the quesadilla isn't as like crunchy and soft.\n\n[Sad Music]\n\nDefinitely didn't have a proper dinner tonight. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't wanna cook anymore. But, I am not a quitter. So I will mentally prepare myself.\n\nI could not wait for day five to come.\n\nHappy Friday, it is my last recipe for Blue Apron and today I am cooking an Asian-style meatloaf. It's supposed to take 50 minutes, but I have a feeling with my track record that it's gonna take two hours.\n\nAll I remember was a lot of peeling. (That does not look like a good potato). And chopping. And some spilling. And raw meat again. No, no, no. And, yeah, I even whipped out my measuring tape.\n\nBut, overall I think the meal turned out okay. An hour and 20 minutes later. The sauce makes it taste better.\n\nAnd, day six was just... Where do I begin?\n\nI put the leftovers in the fridge, right? And I was about to take it out, but when I opened my Tupperware, it just stank, and it was like, really watery, and I was really, really disgusted. And I just, like, immediately threw it out.\n\nBut I ended up, instead of eating that, I ended up buying some wonton noodle soup. It cost me $6.50 and it was from Wonton Noodle Garden. I remember that day being super cold, so that meal just hit the spot.\n\nMy final thoughts?\n\nBlue Apron definitely made cooking easier by providing all the ingredients right in front of you, and easy-to-follow recipes. But, it's probably not something that I will continue because the portion sizes run small. The recipes also didn't make good leftover meals. There was a lot of waste involved. And it doesn't eliminate the fact that cooking is still hard. There's still a lot of prep work, multitasking, patience, and dishes involved.\n\nAnd for someone who lives in the city, Blue Apron is probably not the best option for me because I have so many affordable and convenient options all around me. I had to say no to friends when they wanted to eat dinner with me. I was really tired after work and didn't feel like cooking. And on some nights I didn't wanna eat the recipe that I was cooking because I was craving something else.\n\nBut Blue Apron might be good for someone who doesn't mind having pre-planned dinners ahead of time. It also might be good for someone who wants to get into cooking, and has the time, energy, and patience to cook their own meals for $60 a week. And, if that's you, major props."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Shana Lebowitz", "title": "The dean of Duke Fuqua looks specifically for candidates with 'triple threat capabilities' that don't come naturally to everyone", "description": "Bill Boulding is the dean of Duke University Fuqua School of Business.

Boulding said, \"If you're going to be working with other people, you have to be able to be sensitive to their emotions, their emotional state, and how they're feeling. You have to be able to regulate your own emotions and be able to connect with one another in order to rally together and accomplish something extraordinary together.\"\n\nDQ is a less widely used term, but it's no less important a concept at Fuqua. It shows that \"you're interested in other people; you're interested in their success; you're interested in bringing out their best,\" Boulding said. \"Without decency, people won't trust you.

Character is about your values, and your ability to make ethical decisions.\n\nUltimately, Boulding and his team at Fuqua are selective about who they admit because they're realistic about who can become a triple-threat leader.\n\n\"We don't think that just anybody can become a 'leader of consequence,'\" Boulding said, referring to a term that a former Fuqua dean used to describe \"someone who is able to effectively perform as a leader and as a team player; they are brilliant and also human; they are analytical and a globalist.\"\n\n\"You need to have the raw material in place, in terms of the IQ, EQ, and DQ,\" Boulding said. \"Then we can take those capabilities and turn your inclinations into real instincts.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Callum Burroughs", "title": "A hedge fund run by one of the world's most famous oil traders is the latest major victim of surging market volatility", "description": "Andurand Commodities Fund lost 20.9% in October after predicting prices would rise.

But to suggest that we weren't interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew, or that we tried to prevent investigations, is simply untrue. The allegations saying I personally stood in the way are also just plain wrong. This was an investigation of a foreign actor trying to interfere in our election. Nothing could be more important to me or to Facebook.\n\n\"As Mark and I both told Congress, leading up to Election Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia and reported what we found to law enforcement. These were known traditional cyberattacks like hacking and malware. It was not until after the election that we became aware of the widespread misinformation campaigns run by the IRA. Once we were, we began investing heavily in more people and better technology to protect our platform. While we will always have more work to do, I believe we've started to see some of that work pay off, as we saw in the recent US midterms and elections around the world where we have found and taken down further attempts at interference.\n\n\"I also want to address the issue that has been raised about a PR firm, Definers. We're no longer working with them but at the time, they were trying to show that some of the activity against us that appeared to be grassroots also had major organizations behind them. I did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing, but I should have. I have great respect for George Soros - and the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories against him are abhorrent.\n\n\"At Facebook, we are making the investments that we need to stamp out abuse in our system and ensure the good things people love about Facebook can keep happening.

We know from a variety of different sources that the vast majority of that increase in employment is coming at brand new firms.

We see some of these new firms failing, others of them failing to expand in a way they would have otherwise.\"\n\nCarpenter's warning about the negative impacts of the trade war are the latest in a chorus of warnings about the consequences of the president's policies. Earlier this week, for instance, the world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, argued that the trade war was already having a material impact on global trade.\n\nCarpenter did however, offer some reassurance.\n\n\"What we know from manufacturing, especially in the United States, is that you have very lean inventories, you have fragile but easy-to-repair supply chains,\" he said. \"And so when there's a hit, the swing in quantities is large, but fairly short-lived.\"\n\nUBS forecasts that annualized growth in the second quarter of 2019 will be about 2.7%."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Adam Payne, Adam Bienkov and Thomas Colson", "title": "LIVE: Theresa May grilled on her Brexit plans as Michael Gove considers quitting government", "description": "This is Business Insider's politics live-blog charting the latest developments as Theresa May's Brexit deal continues to dominate Westminster.

The weapon of choice: money and the major players from the US to China, Japan, and Australia will face off this weekend.\n\nThe Pacific's annual regional economic summit takes place in the heart of APEC's poorest member country, Papua New Guinea, which has itself become the keystone in an accelerating struggle for influence.\n\nXi will tour some of China's headline gifts and investments \u2014 including the multimillion dollar APEC house \u2014 ahead of the weekend's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill hoping for further commitments from China and its former colonial power and closest neighbor, Australia.\n\nAs Xi Jinping makes his maiden state visit as Chinese president Canberra will be watching closely.\n\nThe state of regional competition on Papua New Guinea at the time of APEC is best characterized by an anecdote retold by Dr. Graeme Smith, a research fellow at the Australian National University's Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs.\n\nMeeting a military official on Manus Island, a former US staging base and, more recently, the site of an Australian immigration detention center, Smith says the official pointed out the impressive runways now overgrown by vegetation.\n\nRead more: The poorest nation in the Pacific will host its richest economic get-together, and it could descend into a dash for cash\n\nIf Australia is unwilling to invest, then we can always turn to our new friends, the official suggested.\n\nAustralia has it seems, awoken to the idea of the challenges presented by a Chinese base operating 60 minutes flight time to its major northern cities.\n\nConsequently, Canberra this month put its hand up to back the Manus project, part of what analysts see as a push to re-assert its dominance in the South Pacific as Beijing seeks a more prominent role.\n\n\"The Manus Island port was a big concern for us,\" a senior US diplomatic source told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"It was feasible Chinese military vessels could have used the port so we are very happy that Australia will fund the re-development.\"\n\nAustralia is reportedly ready to make the verbal agreement formal sometime over the weekend.\n\nAfter five years of relentless cuts to Australia's aid program, regional aid experts have cautiously welcomed the turnaround.\n\nBridi Rice, Director of Policy and Advocacy at the Australian Council of International Development said that the admission by the Prime Minister that \"too often\" we have taken our Pacific neighbours for granted is right on the money.\n\n\"The announcement of plans to deepen Australia's ties is welcome,\" Rice said.\n\n\"But for Australia to continue to build influence as a trusted development partner and foster confidence, stability, and sustainability in the Asia-Pacific, the Australian development cooperation program must have the development interests of our partners at its heart.\"\n\nRice, the Australian Government's former senior anti-money laundering adviser to the Papua New Guinea government said however, that the development challenges of the region cannot be solved by money alone.\n\n\"A quick fix expenditure and political point scoring at the cost of long term development initiatives won't generate development outcomes or foreign policy wins for Australia,\" Rice told Business Insider.\n\nThis year's APEC was supposed to showcase Papua New Guinea's ascension onto the world stage.\n\nRead more: The South China Sea is fabled for its hidden energy reserves and China wants to block outsiders like the US from finding them\n\nPrime minister O'Neill said it would put New Guinea \"on the map.\"\n\nWhat it has highlighted so far is less about infrastructural achievement and more about what can slip through the cracks when the focus shifts from hard assistance to soft power.\n\nPapua New Guinea police prevent students from marching from University of Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby Thomson Reuters\n\n\"For Australia's development cooperation program to be a critical soft power tool requires more than just infrastructure allocations, it also requires tough discussions to be had around issues of corruption, governance, natural resource protection, civil society, human-rights and associated expenditure on the soft infrastructure that enables development.\"\n\nNew Guinea is one of only five countries experiencing the return of polio. It faces endemic problems including corruption, tribal and urban violence, preventable disease outbreaks, a flawed currency and an ailing economy.\n\nAccording to Rice, also a current La Trobe University research candidate on Australia's aid program in Papua New Guinea, inclusive infrastructure investment may be welcome, but other reactive expenditure on short-term public diplomacy is simply ineffective.\n\nSuch efforts in an attempt to increase Australia's profile and influence in the region come to nothing, when the have no long-term benefits.\"\n\n\"(New infrastructure investment) should not come at the cost of what we know works \u2014 that is \u2014 long-term relationships, deep cultural understanding, and development cooperation which works primarily in the interests of the countries where Australia works,\" Rice told Business Insider.\n\nSpeaking to an Australian parliamentary inquiry into the strategic effectiveness of Australia's aid program on Thursday, Rice proposed that Australia can \"walk and chew gum at the same time\" when it comes to establishing a development cooperation program driven by values, and given the same level of strategic priority as defense within Australia's foreign policy architecture.\n\n\"My friends and colleagues from Papua New Guinea are fighting for the future of their country,\" Rice said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "'Not enough room': Mexican border shelters are already overcrowded, but expect thousands more migrants to arrive - Business Insider", "description": "Business Insider 'Not enough room': Mexican border shelters are already overcrowded, but expect thousands more migrants to arrive Business Insider Shelters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana are already overflowing, and the arrival of the first few hundred\u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/r-not-enough-room-migrant-flows-strain-mexican-border-shelters-2018-11", "urlToImage": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5beddf17b73c281ce84711b8-1920-960.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T07:20:28Z", "content": "Migrants, part of a caravan of thousands traveling from Central America en route to the United States, rest in a provisional shelter in La Concha Thomson Reuters TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - The arrival in the Mexican border city of Tijuana of the first few hu\u2026 [+4273 chars]", "fulltext": "Migrants, part of a caravan of thousands traveling from Central America en route to the United States, rest in a provisional shelter in La Concha Thomson Reuters\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - The arrival in the Mexican border city of Tijuana of the first few hundred travelers from migrant caravans is stretching to the limit shelters already overflowing with other people, and sparking signs of friction among the population.\n\nLugging heavy bundles and small children, an unprecedented caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants set off for the United States in mid-October, many of them fleeing violence and poverty at home. Two other copycat groups of mainly El Salvadorans followed behind.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has declared the caravans an unwelcome \"invasion,\" and threatened to close down the Mexico-U.S. border to keep them out, ordering some 7,000 troops to reinforce the frontier, including in Tijuana with barbed wire.\n\nIt has not stopped people trying to reach the border, including those from the caravans, others traveling from Central America independently, and Mexicans fleeing violence in cartel-plagued states.\n\nJose Maria Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter, said he had been warning authorities since the Honduran caravan set out that migrant refuges were already operating at capacity in the border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali.\n\n\"People are still arriving, but we're not prepared to receive them,\" Garcia told Reuters. He said he believes the incoming caravans would be the largest number of migrants to arrive in the city in such a short time in recent memory.\n\nREUTERS/Jorge Duenes\n\nThe buildup in Tijuana will be a test of tougher asylum rules introduced by Trump, which some experts believe will push more people to try to cross illegally. Few of the 20 migrants interviewed by Reuters were aware of the new rules.\n\nTijuana has a history of absorbing visitors, including Chinese immigrants in the 19th century, a large American population and Haitians who settled in the city south of San Diego in 2016 after failing to cross the U.S. border.\n\nAs many as 1,000 people who broke away from the first caravan have reached Tijuana in the last few days, with a similar number expected later this week. Thousands more could soon follow as the main body of the caravans arrive.\n\nAlmost 3,000 people - many of them Mexicans - are now waiting in migrant shelters to request asylum alongside hundreds of Central Americans, said Cesar Palencia, head of the Tijuana city government's migrant outreach team.\n\nU.S. border officials process about 75 to 100 asylum claims a day, so it could be a month before new arrivals are seen, said Pedro Rios, of the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that works with migrants.\n\nOf the 14 migrant shelters on the 2,000-mile (3,200 km)Mexico-U.S. border, 10 are totally overcrowded, Palencia said. Dozens of arrivals from the caravan camped on the beach on Tuesday night.\n\n\"People have received us kindly, but they say there's not enough room for everyone, so we decided to spend the night on the beach,\" said a Honduran woman in Tijuana as she washed her face in a public bathroom, asking to remain anonymous.\n\n\"It was a terrible night for me and my children.\"\n\nThe bulk of the group that formed after the Honduran caravan began entering Mexico over three weeks ago is now moving up the Pacific northwest coast through the state of Sinaloa, made up of between 4,000 and 5,000 people, authorities say.\n\nFrictions\n\nThe Mexican government has urged the migrants to register for asylum in Mexico, or risk deportation. The incoming government of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to provide jobs and visas to the Central Americans.\n\nThat message has not been popular with all Mexicans, many of whom fear for their own futures.\n\n\"We also need help,\" said Olga Cruz from the western state of Michoacan, who had come to Tijuana to seek asylum in the United States with her three children.\n\n\"Not a day goes by (in Michoacan) without somebody being killed, and I don't want my children growing up like this,\" she said. \"But if the government only focuses on helping (Central Americans) they leave nothing for us,\" she added.\n\nOn Monday, a group of about 80 mainly LGBT people who split from the migrant caravan moved into a building in a wealthy area of \u200b\u200bTijuana. Residents shouted at them to leave and demanded that local authorities take steps to eject them.\n\n(Additional reporting by Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Editing by Dave Graham and Bill Berkrot)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christian Edwards", "title": "The 10 most important things in the world right now", "description": "Hello!

In March, Palantir admitted that at least one employee engaged with \"people associated with Cambridge Analytica\" between 2013 and 2014 on a \"personal capacity.\" According to The New York Times, Palantir employee Alfredas Chmieliauskas worked with Cambridge Analytica on obtaining Facebook data that would eventually be used to create psychographic profiles of voters.

His initial amazement, he said, gradually turned to fear that such a system could lead to abuses of privacy by Venezuela's government. \"They were looking to have citizen control.\"\n\nThe following year, when he raised concerns with Venezuelan officials, Daquin told Reuters, he was detained, beaten and extorted by intelligence agents. They knocked several teeth out with a handgun and accused him of treasonous behavior, Daquin said, prompting him to flee the country.\n\nGovernment spokespeople had no comment on Daquin's account.\n\nThe project languished.\n\n\"China is in the business of exporting its authoritarianism,\" US Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters in an email.

The card is increasingly linked by the government to subsidized food, health, and other social programs most Venezuelans rely on to survive.\n\nAnd ZTE, whose role in the fatherland project is detailed here for the first time, is at the heart of the program.\n\nAs part of a $70 million government effort to bolster \"national security,\" Venezuela last year hired ZTE to build a fatherland database and create a mobile payment system for use with the card, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.\n\nA team of ZTE employees is now embedded in a special unit within Cantv, the Venezuelan state telecommunications company that manages the database, according to four current and former Cantv employees.\n\nThe fatherland card is troubling some citizens and human-rights groups who believe it is a tool for Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, to monitor the populace and allocate scarce resources to his loyalists.\n\n\"It's blackmail,\" Hector Navarro, one of the founders of the ruling Socialist Party and a former minister under Chavez, said of the fatherland program. \"Venezuelans with the cards now have more rights than those without.\"\n\nIn a phone interview, Su Qingfeng, the head of ZTE's Venezuela unit, confirmed ZTE sold Caracas servers for the database and is developing the mobile payment application. The company, he said, violated no Chinese or local laws and has no role in how Venezuela collects or uses cardholder data.\n\n\"We don't support the government,\" he said. \"We are just developing our market.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping inspects an honour guard with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (R) at a welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing September 22, 2013.

Maduro has been sanctioned by the United States and is criticized by governments from France to Canada as increasingly autocratic.\n\nIn that, critics say, Maduro has an ally. The fatherland card, they argue, illustrates how China, through state-linked companies like ZTE, exports technological know-how that can help like-minded governments track, reward, and punish citizens.\n\nThe database, according to employees of the card system and screenshots of user data reviewed by Reuters, stores such details as birthdays, family information, employment and income, property owned, medical history, state benefits received, presence on social media, membership of a political party, and whether a person voted.\n\nSo far, the government's disclosure of ZTE's involvement in the fatherland project has been limited to a passing reference in a February 2017 press release that credited the company with helping to \"fortify\" the underlying database.\n\nVenezuela's government didn't respond to requests for comment for this article. Nadia Perez, a spokeswoman for Cantv, the state-run telecoms firm, declined to comment and Manuel Fernandez, the company's president, didn't respond to emails or text messages from Reuters.\n\nChina's Justice Ministry and its embassy in Caracas didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlthough ZTE is publicly traded, a Chinese state company is its largest shareholder and the government is a key client. ZTE has run afoul of Washington before for dealings with authoritarian governments.\n\nThe company this year paid $1 billion to settle with the US Commerce Department, one of various penalties after ZTE shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea, violating US sanctions and export laws. The Commerce action was sparked by a 2012 Reuters report that ZTE sold Iran a surveillance system, which included US components, to spy on telecommunications by its citizens.\n\nLegal experts in the United States said it is unclear whether ZTE and other companies that supply the fatherland system are violating US sanctions on Venezuelan leaders by providing tools that critics believe strengthen the government's grip on power.\n\nFernandez, the Cantv president, is one of the targets of those sanctions because of the telecom company's censorship of the internet in Venezuela, according to a US Treasury Department statement.\n\nBut the prohibitions thus far are meant primarily to thwart business with Maduro and other top officials themselves, not regular commerce in Venezuela.\n\nPeople walk past an office building of Venezuela's national telecommunications company CANTV in Barinas, Venezuela September 24, 2018. Picture taken September 24, 2018. Carlos Eduardo Ramirez/Reuters\n\nStill, US lawmakers and other critics of Maduro's rule are concerned about ZTE's role in Venezuela.\n\n\"China is in the business of exporting its authoritarianism,\" US Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters in an email. \"The Maduro regime's increasing reliance on ZTE in Venezuela is just the latest example of the threat that Chinese state-directed firms pose to US national security interests.\"\n\nTo understand how the fatherland card works and how it came to be, Reuters reviewed confidential contracts and internal government documents related to its development. Reporters also interviewed dozens of current and former employees of ZTE, Venezuela's government and Cantv, or Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, as the company is formally known.\n\nThey confirmed details of the project and the outlines of Daquin's account of its origins.\n\n'An attempt to control me'\n\nMaduro for the past year has urged citizens to sign up for the new card, calling it essential to \"build the new Venezuela.\" As many as 18 million people, over half the population, already have, according to government figures.\n\n\"With this card, we are going to do everything from now on,\" Maduro said on state television last December.\n\nTo encourage its adoption, the government has granted cash prizes to cardholders for performing civic duties, like rallying voters.\n\nIt has also given one-time payouts, such as awarding moms enrolled in the card a Mother's Day bonus of about $2. The payment, last May, was nearly a monthly minimum wage \u2014 enough to buy a carton of eggs, given the current pace of inflation.\n\nMaduro is also taking steps to force the card's adoption. The government now says Venezuelans need it to receive public benefits including medicine, pensions, food baskets, and subsidized fuel.\n\nIn August, retirees protested outside social security offices and complained the fatherland rule limits access to hard-won pensions.\n\nChina's ZTE Corp logo is seen at its offices in Caracas, Venezuela October 4, 2018.

Reuters was unable to contact the doctor.\n\nUsing the servers purchased from ZTE, the government is creating a database some citizens fear is identifying Venezuelans who support the government and those who don't.\n\nSome of the information, such as health data, is gathered with card usage. Some is obtained when citizens enroll. Cardholders and local human rights groups told Reuters that administrators ask questions about income, political activities, and social media profiles before issuing the card.\n\nCivil servants are facing particular pressure to enroll, according to more than a dozen state workers.\n\nWhen scanning their cards during a presidential election last May, employees at several government offices were told by bosses to message photos of themselves at polls back to managers, they said. A Justice Ministry document reviewed by Reuters featured a list of state employees who didn't vote.\n\nAfter Chavez became president in 1999, he sought to empower \"invisible\" Venezuelans who couldn't access basic services. In the following years, more citizens received documentation, but the cards were fragile and easily forged, according to a 2007 Justice Ministry report.\n\nFormer Venezuelan army paratrooper Hugo Chavez waves to supporters from the door of the Congress building moments after being sworn-in as the country's new president, in Caracas, Venezuela February 2, 1999. Kimberly White/Reuters\n\nThe report, reviewed by Reuters, recommended a new, microchip-enabled card that would be harder to counterfeit. No such effort got underway.\n\nThat December, after nearly a decade of soaring popularity, Chavez suffered his first electoral defeat, losing a referendum to scrap term limits. Oil prices plummeted shortly thereafter, hammering the economy.\n\nChavez worked to appease his working-class base, including throngs still lacking identity credentials. He sent Daquin, the top information security advisor at the Justice Ministry, to China.\n\nThe technology Daquin and colleagues learned about in Shenzhen underpinned what would become China's \"Social Credit System.\"\n\nThe still-evolving system, part of which uses \"smart citizen cards\" developed by ZTE, grades citizens based on behavior including financial solvency and political activity.\n\nGood behavior can earn citizens discounts on utilities or loans. Bad marks can get them banned from public transport or their kids blocked from top schools.\n\nZTE executives showed the Venezuelans smart cards embedded with radio-frequency identification, or RFID, a technology that enables monitors through radio waves to track location and data.\n\nOther cards used so-called Quick Response, or QR, codes, the matrix barcodes now commonly used to store and process information.\n\nAfter the trip, Venezuela turned to Cuba, its closest ally, and asked for help creating its own version of RFID cards. \"The new goal was Big Data,\" Daquin said.\n\nIn June 2008, Venezuela agreed to pay a Cuban state company $172 million to develop six million of the cards, according to a copy of the contract. Cuban government officials didn't respond to questions about the agreement.\n\nBy 2009, Daquin grew uneasy about the potential for abuses of citizens' privacy.\n\nThe technology Daquin and colleagues learned about in Shenzhen underpinned what would become China's \"Social Credit System.\" Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nHe expressed those concerns to officials including Vladimir Padrino, a general at the time and now Venezuela's defense minister. The Defense Ministry didn't respond to phone calls, emails or a letter presented by Reuters for comment.\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 12, at his local Caracas bakery, six armed officials in uniforms of Venezuela's national intelligence agency awaited Daquin, he told Reuters.\n\nThey showed him photos of his daughter and forced him to drive east toward the town of Guatire. Off a back road, Daquin said, they beat him with pistols, forced a handgun into his mouth and dislodged several teeth, still missing.\n\n\"Why are you betraying the revolution?\" one asked.\n\nThey demanded $100,000 for his release, Daquin said.\n\nDaquin, who says he had been saving for years to buy property, went home, pulled cash from a safe and delivered it to the men. That evening, he booked a flight for himself, his wife and their three children to the United States, where he has lived since, working as an information security consultant.\n\nHis brother, Guy, who also lives in the United States, confirmed Daquin's account. Documentation reviewed by Reuters corroborates his role at the ministry, and people familiar with Daquin's work confirmed his involvement in the card project.\n\nAfter Daquin fled, the Cuban contract went nowhere, according to another former advisor.\n\nIn March 2013, Chavez died. Maduro, his heir as Socialist Party candidate, was elected president the next month. The lingering oil crash dragged Venezuela into recession.\n\n'We'll find out'\n\nWith hunger increasing, the government in 2016 launched a program to distribute subsidized food packages. It hired Soltein SA de CV, a company based in Mexico, to design an online platform to track them, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The platform was the beginning of the database now used for the fatherland system.\n\nSoltein's directors, according to LinkedIn profiles, are mostly former Cuban state employees. A person who answered a telephone listed for Soltein denied the firm worked on the fatherland system.\n\n\"The new goal was Big Data,\" Daquin said. Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nA woman at the company's registered address in the resort city of Cancun told Reuters she had never heard of Soltein.\n\nThe system worked. Nearly 90% of the country's residents now receive the food packages, according to a study published in February by Andres Bello Catholic University and two other universities.\n\nNow more satisfied with its ability to track handouts, the government sought to know more about the recipients, according to people involved in the project. So it turned back to ZTE.\n\nThe Chinese company, now in Venezuela for about a decade, has over 100 employees working in two floors of a Caracas skyscraper. It first worked with Cantv, the telecommunications company, to enable television programming online.\n\nLike many state enterprises in Venezuela, Cantv has grown starved for investment. ZTE became a key partner, taking on many projects that once would have fallen to Cantv itself, people familiar with both companies said.\n\nZTE is helping the government build six emergency response centers monitoring Venezuela's major cities, according to a 2015 press release.\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 12, at his local Caracas bakery, six armed officials in uniforms of Venezuela's national intelligence agency awaited Daquin, he told Reuters.They showed him photos of his daughter and forced him to drive east toward the town of Guatire. Off a back road, Daquin said, they beat him with pistols, forced a handgun into his mouth and dislodged several teeth, still missing. Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nIn 2016, ZTE began centralizing video surveillance for the government around the country, according to current and former employees.\n\nIn its final push for the fatherland cards, the government no longer considered RFID, according to people familiar with the effort. The location-tracking technology was too costly.\n\nInstead, it asked ZTE for help with QR codes, the black-and-white squares smartphone users can scan to get directed to web sites. ZTE developed the codes, at a cost of less than $3 per account, and the government printed the cards, linking them to the Soltein database, these people said.\n\nIn a phone call with Reuters in September, Su, the head of ZTE's Venezuela business, confirmed the company's card deal with Cantv. He declined to answer follow-up questions.\n\nMaduro introduced the cards in December 2016. In a televised address, he held one up, thanked China for lending unspecified support and said \"everybody must get one.\"\n\nThe ID system, still running on the Soltein platform, hadn't yet migrated to ZTE servers. Disaster soon struck. In May 2017, hackers broke into the fatherland database.\n\nThe hack was carried out by anonymous anti-Maduro activists known as TeamHDP. The group's leader, Twitter handle @YoSoyJustincito, said the hack was \"extremely simple\" and motivated by TeamHDP's mission to expose Maduro secrets.\n\nThe hacker, who spoke to Reuters by text message, declined to be identified and said he is no longer in Venezuela. A Cantv manager who later helped migrate the database to ZTE servers confirmed details of the breach.\n\n\"Why are you betraying the revolution?\" Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nDuring the hack, TeamHDP took screenshots of user data and deleted the accounts of government officials, including Maduro. The president later appeared on television scanning his card and receiving an error message: \"This person doesn't exist.\"\n\nScreenshots of the information embedded in various card accounts, shared by TeamHDP with Reuters, included phone numbers, emails, home addresses, participation at Socialist Party events, and even whether a person owns a pet. People familiar with the database said the screenshots appear authentic.\n\nShortly after the hack, Maduro signed a $70 million contract with Cantv and a state bank for \"national security\" projects. These included development of a \"centralized fatherland database\" and a mobile app to process payments, such as the discounted cost of a subsidized food box, associated with the card.\n\n\"Imperialist and unpatriotic factions have tried to harm the nation's security,\" the contract reads.\n\nIt says an undisclosed portion of the funding would come from the Venezuela China Joint Fund, a bilateral financing program. A related contract, also reviewed by Reuters, assigns the database and payment app projects to ZTE. The document doesn't disclose how much of the $70 million would go to the Chinese company.\n\nZTE declined to comment on financial details of its business in Venezuela. Neither the Venezuelan nor the Chinese government responded to Reuters queries about the contracts.\n\nIn July 2017, Soltein transferred ownership of fatherland data to Cantv, project documents show. A team of a dozen ZTE developers began bolstering the database's capacity and security, current and former Cantv employees said.\n\nAmong other measures, ZTE installed data storage units built by US-based Dell Technologies Inc, according to one ZTE document. Dell spokeswoman Lauren Lee said ZTE is a client in China but that Dell doesn't sell equipment to ZTE in Venezuela. She said Dell reviewed its transactions in Venezuela and wasn't aware of any sale to Cantv, either.\n\n\"Dell is committed to compliance with all applicable laws where we do business,\" Lee said in an email. \"We expect our customers, partners, and suppliers to follow these same laws.\"\n\nIn May, Venezuela held elections that were widely discredited by foreign governments after Maduro banned several opposition parties.\n\nAhead of the vote, ruling party officials urged voters to be \"grateful\" for government largesse dispensed via the fatherland cards. They set up \"red point\" kiosks near voting booths, where voters could scan their cards and register, Maduro himself promised, for a \"fatherland prize.\"\n\nThose who scanned their cards later received a text message thanking them for supporting Maduro, according to several cardholders and one text message reviewed by Reuters. The prizes for voting, however, were never issued, cardholders and people familiar with the system said.\n\nCurrent and former Cantv employees say the database registers if, but not how, a person voted. Still, some voters were led to believe the government would know. The belief is having a chilling effect.\n\nOne organizer of a food handout committee in the west-central city of Barinas said government managers had instructed her and colleagues to tell recipients their votes could be tracked. \"We'll find out if you voted for or against,\" she said she told them.\n\nState workers say they are a target.\n\nAn internal Cantv presentation from last year said the system can feed information from the database to ministries to help \"generate statistics and take decisions.\" After the vote, government offices including Banco Bicentenario del Pueblo, a state bank, sent Cantv lists with employees' names to determine whether they had voted, according to the manager who helped set up the servers.\n\nBanco Bicentenario didn't respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Economy Ministry, which the bank reports to, didn't respond to requests, either.\n\nWith personal data now so available, some citizens fear they can lose more than just their jobs, said Mariela Magallanes, an opposition lawmaker who headed a commission that last year investigated how the fatherland card was being linked to the subsidized food program.\n\nThe government, the commission said in a report, is depriving some citizens of the food boxes because they don't possess the card. \"The government knows exactly who is most vulnerable to pressure,\" she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Adam Jourdan in Shanghai, Ben Blanchard in Beijing, Eric Auchard in London, Sarah Marsh in Havana, Ivan Alonso in Cancun, Christine Murray in Mexico City, Francisco Aguilar in Barinas, and Andreina Aponte in Caracas; Editing by Paulo Prada."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "East Coast snowstorm wreaks chaos, commuters warned to avoid Port Authority Bus Terminal", "description": "Wong Maye-E/AP The first snowstorm of the season to hit the New York City area brought several inches of snow, slowing Thursday's evening commute to a crawl.

I think, unfortunately, when you're building something of this scale, oftentimes, putting in place the solutions can take a long time,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And I don't think that me or anyone else could come in and snap our fingers and have these issues resolved in a quarter or half a year. This is not the first time that we've had to deal with big issues for the company.\"\n\nIn other words: Fixing Facebook takes time, and he's guided the company through past upheavals before \u2014 including its shift from desktop to mobile.\n\nHe added: \"This stuff is painful. I certainly don't want to be \u2014 don't love that we're in a position where we aren't delivering the quality that we want to be delivering every day. But to some degree, you have to know that you're on the path that you're doing the right things and then allow for some time for the teams to actually execute and get the stuff working the way that we all know that it needs to be and to the standard that people expect.\"\n\nDo you work at Facebook?

The New York Times investigation found that Facebook was trying to discredit critics with smears that play into anti-Semitic conspiracy tropes, and that its leadership pushed to play down public disclosures about Russian election meddling on its social network.\n\nIt comes after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which tens of millions of users' data was misappropriated by a shady political research firm. And a hack that saw around 30 million users' sensitive data stolen. And Russia's use of the social network to spread fake news and propaganda, sowing dissent in a campaign that started during the 2016 US election and continues to this day. And allegations that the company provided misleading information about video measurements for over year, with major impacts for the advertising and media industry. And the Myanmar humanitarian crisis, where Facebook's role spreading hate speech helped facilitate genocide. The list goes on and on.\n\nIf Zuckerberg doesn't want to go, then there's little anyone can do about it. Because of Facebook's unconventional stock structure, the founder and CEO holds the overwhelming majority of the company's voting power \u2014 leaving shareholders powerless to kick him out, no matter what.\n\nThe only person who can make Zuck budge is Zuck, and he's made it clear that he's not going anywhere.\n\nHere's the full text of Mark Zuckerberg's response, via the official transcript:\n\nWell, I think we're doing the right things to fix the issues. I think, unfortunately, when you're building something of this scale, oftentimes, putting in place the solutions can take a long time. And I don't think that me or anyone else could come in and snap our fingers and have these issues resolved in a quarter or half a year. This is not the first time that we've had to deal with big issues for the company.\n\nI mean, certainly, when we -- the issues are different here, more around content and security type issues -- but when we had to pivot and build out the whole new technical platform on mobile, that was a similar kind of existential set of issues that we really had to deal with well. But it took a few years to really get right, and get to a good place.\n\nThis stuff is painful. I certainly don't want to be -- don't love that we're in a position where we aren't delivering the quality that we want to be delivering every day. But to some degree, you have to know that you're on the path that you're doing the right things and then allow for some time for the teams to actually execute and get the stuff working the way that we all know that it needs to be and to the standard that people expect.\n\nI'm very committed to this, I understand that this is a big part of what will be - - this is just so important for the future of the internet and a lot of these big issues that society is facing. And I am just fully committed to getting this right."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sonam Sheth", "title": "In a 'self-defeating and self-incriminating' slip-up, Trump just admitted he installed Matthew Whitaker to kill the Russia probe", "description": "President Donald Trump indicated Wednesday that he replaced former Attorney General Jeff Sessions with former US attorney Matthew Whitaker because he wants Whitaker to hamper the Russia investigation.

I heard he got a very good decision, I haven't seen it.\"\n\nHe added that he \"heard it was a very strong opinion,\" referring to the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel's 20-page memo justifying Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general until the Senate confirms a permanent replacement.\n\nReiterating that Whitaker is \"somebody that's very respected\" \u2014 a claim that stands in contrast to many DOJ and FBI officials' views of their new boss \u2014 Trump said he \"knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions.\"\n\nThe president then appeared to allude to the fact that he tapped Whitaker primarily to constrain the Russia investigation.\n\nRead more: Paul Manafort is reportedly hitting the brakes on cooperating with Mueller\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, this is an investigation that should have never been brought,\" Trump told The Daily Caller. \"It should have never been had ... It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nHe then tacked on: \"And you know, it's very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, [the special counsel Robert Mueller] is not Senate confirmed.\"\n\nThe admission is reminiscent of when Trump told NBC's Lester Holt last year that he ousted then FBI director James Comey because of the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump's statement to Holt now makes up one of the central threads of Mueller's investigation into whether the president sought to obstruct justice in the inquiry, and legal experts told INSIDER his admission to The Daily Caller could add another piece to Mueller's probe.\n\n\"What is so unusual about Trump is that he publicly forecasts his motivation in a way that is self-defeating and self-incriminating,\" Elie Honig, a former prosecutor from the Southern District of New York who specialized in organized-crime cases, told INSIDER.\n\nJeffrey Cramer, a longtime former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the DOJ, echoed that assessment.\n\n\"The president's knee-jerk pivot to talking about the Russia investigation when asked about Whitaker's qualification is what poker players call a 'tell,'\" Cramer told INSIDER.\n\nRead more: Here's a full timeline of acting AG Matthew Whitaker's controversial past\n\nThe most difficult thing for investigators to prove in an obstruction-of-justice case is corrupt intent on the part of the defendant.\n\n\"Sometimes you get lucky and get emails or wiretapped phone calls ... where the subject might secretly or privately admit intent,\" Honig said. \"Other times the prosecutor simply must argue intent to the jury based on circumstantial evidence. With Trump, however, we have a subject who openly and publicly and unapologetically announces why he takes certain steps, even when those reasons might give rise to criminal liability.\"\n\nRobert Mueller. Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nTrump lashes out as Mueller's quiet period comes to an end\n\nWhitaker has a long history of making controversial remarks about the Mueller investigation and has publicly mused about gutting the probe. Though he submitted to a DOJ ethics inquiry into whether he should recuse himself, Whitaker told Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday that he would not be stepping back from the investigation.\n\n\"He says he will be following regular order,\" Graham told The Washington Post.\n\nTrump has made conflicting remarks about his history with Whitaker. Before telling The Daily Caller he knows Whitaker as it pertains to Sessions, he told reporters last week that he did not know the acting attorney general in any capacity. But last month, the president told Fox & Friends Whitaker was \"a great guy,\" adding, \"I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\nMeanwhile, after being uncharacteristically subdued leading up to the November midterms, Trump took to Twitter Thursday, just hours after his Daily Caller interview, to lay into Mueller, accusing the special counsel of \"screaming and shouting at people\" and \"horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want.\"\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,\" Trump tweeted. \"They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts ... A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nTrump's unusually specific claims that the special counsel was \"screaming\" and \"horribly threatening\" people to talk came as he and his lawyers were preparing to send over their answers to a set of written questions from Mueller about potential collusion with Russia.\n\nThe tweetstorm also came after the far-right conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, an associate of longtime GOP strategist Roger Stone, indicated he expects to be indicted soon.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Mueller's office asked a federal court in Washington, DC, for an extension on the sentencing of former Trump campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates until January, a sign that Gates still has a significant amount of information for prosecutors.\n\nThat Trump's admission about Whitaker to The Daily Caller and his tweetstorm came after this series of developments on the Russia front could indicate that the president is growing increasingly worried about what Mueller has.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump's lawyers have repeatedly warned him not to criticize Mueller and the Russia probe on Twitter or in the media, though Trump frequently ignores their advice. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lead defense lawyer, has tried to mitigate the damage from his public comments by claiming one cannot obstruct justice in public.\n\nBut Honig said that argument can only go so far.\n\n\"In fact, people do sometimes commit crimes openly and flagrantly,\" he said, \"particularly if they believe they will not be held accountable or are beyond the reach of the law.\"\n\nMore on the Russia investigation:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "David Choi", "title": "North Korea claims to have 'successfully' tested a new 'high-tech tactical weapon'", "description": "North Korea's propaganda outlet claimed on Friday that its country successfully carried out a test of a new \"high-tech tactical weapon\" that met \"all superior and powerful designing indicators.\" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was said to have visited a test \u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-new-tactical-weapon-test-kim-jong-un-2018-11", "urlToImage": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bedf89e38150728764d1185-1334-667.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:31:33Z", "content": "North Korea's propaganda outlet claimed on Friday that its country successfully carried out tests of a new \"high-tech tactical weapon\" that met \"all superior and powerful designing indicators.\" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was said to have visited a test s\u2026 [+2074 chars]", "fulltext": "North Korea's state-run outlet said on Friday that its country successfully carried out tests of a new \"high-tech tactical weapon\" that met \"all superior and powerful designing indicators.\"\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a test site to inspect the weapon, according to a Korean Central News Agency statement first reported by South Korean news organization Yonhap News.\n\n\"The state-of-the-art weapon that has been long developed under the leadership of our party's dynamic leadership has a meaning of completely safeguarding our territory and significantly improving the combat power of our people's army,\" KCNA said.\n\nThe weapons test is the first reported by North Korea since Kim and the President Donald Trump met during a joint summit in Singapore this summer.\n\nNorth Korea's media reportedly did not mention any specifics about the weapon itself, but did state it had been in development since his father, Kim Jong Il, was in power. High-ranking officials were also said to have attended the event, include Jung Cheon Park, an artillery commissioner.\n\nSigns of an underground nuclear test, such as seismic activity, were not reported, according to North Korea monitoring organization NK News.\n\nRead more: Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meet for the first time in historic Singapore summit\n\nThe report of the weapons test comes shortly after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was supposed to have met with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, in New York earlier in November. The talks were scrapped abruptly by the North Koreans, according to the State Department. The government agency says the discussions are ongoing.\n\nWord of the weapons test comes amid the reaffirmation of a potential second summit between Trump and Kim. On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump plans to meet Kim next year, the second such meeting after the two met in Singapore in June.\n\n\"The plans are ongoing,\" Pence said. \"We believe that the summit will likely occur after the first of the year, but the when and the where of that is still being worked out.\"\n\nPence added that the meeting would not be predicated on the US' previous demand that North Korea disclose a full list of nuclear arms, but he stressed that the leaders must \"come away with a plan for identifying all of the weapons in question.\""}]
