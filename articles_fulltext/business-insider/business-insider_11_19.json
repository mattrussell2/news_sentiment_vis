These savings entice shoppers \u2014 most of whom are uncommonly home from work \u2014 to dust off the pie crumbs, leave their warm houses, and snag a flat-screen TV they may otherwise be unable or unwilling to afford.

Karl Schultz said Thursday aboard the cutter James, which was offloading nearly 38,000 pounds of cocaine seized in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe pursuit of traffickers on the high seas, working with other US agencies and international partners, was part of what Schultz described as a \"push-out-the-border strategy\" to target the smuggling process at the point when the loads were the largest and most vulnerable.\n\nUS Coast Guardsmen board a narco sub as part of a drug seizure in early September 2016.

It maximizes the impact. When these loads land in Mexico, in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, they get distributed into very small loads, very hard to detect, and there's associated violence,\" he added.\n\nRead also: The Coast Guard's 'push-out-the-border strategy' is fighting drugs in the Pacific \u2014 and it just brought home $500 million in cocaine\n\nBut the Coast Guard can see much more than it can catch.\n\nIn the eastern Pacific Ocean, where about 85% of the cocaine smuggling between South America and the US takes place, \"We have visibility on about 85% of that activity,\" Schultz said. \"Because of the capacity \u2014 the number of ships, the number of aircraft \u2014 [we act on] about 25% to 30% of that,\" he added.\n\nA suspected smuggler, who jumped from his burning vessel, is pulled aboard an interceptor boat from the USS Zephyr by members of the US Coast Guard and Navy in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean on April 7, 2018.

Charles Ray told senators that the service has \"good intelligence on between 80% and 90% of these movements,\" referring to trafficking in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean.\n\nBut \"we only have the capacity to get after about 30% of those\" shipments, added Ray, who is now the Coast Guard's vice commandant.\n\nThe eastern Pacific Ocean from the west coast of South America to the Galapagos Islands and up to waters off western Mexico and the southwest US is an area about the size of the continental US, Ray said.\n\n\"On any given day we'll have between six to 10 Coast Guard cutters down here,\" he added. \"If you imagine placing that on [an area the size of] the United States ... it's a capacity challenge.\"\n\nAdam Isacson/US Southern Command\n\nSchultz's predecessor, now-retired Adm. Paul Zukunft, noted a similar gap.\n\nThe Coast Guard provides the \"biggest bang for the buck,\" Zukunft told The New York Times in summer 2017. \"But our resources are limited.\"\n\n\"As a result, we can't catch all the drug smuggling we know about,\" Zukunft added. \"Just last year we had intelligence on nearly 580 possible shipments but couldn't go intercept them because we didn't have the ships or planes to go after them.\"\n\nNow read: The Coast Guard is catching more drug-running subs, but most 'very stealthy' narco subs are probably going undetected\n\nSchultz acknowledged that with more resources the Coast Guard could stop more, but said the service was getting the most out of its assets and its partners \u2014 including the Defense and Homeland Security departments and other countries in the region.\n\n\"We have DoD support, we have partner-nation contributions ... so it's that team sport, but there is a conversation about capacity,\" Schultz said. \"More Coast Guard capability, more enablers like long-range surveillance airplanes and ... we'd take more drugs off the water.\"\n\n\"What I'm proud about is we're putting every ounce of energy we've got into this fight.\"\n\nA 'resurgence'\n\nThe Coast Guard cutter James interdicts a low-profile vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean, October 22, 2018. US Coast Guard\n\nBooming cocaine production in Colombia has kept a steady flow of drugs heading north. Smugglers use a variety of vessels, from simple outboard boats to commercial fishing vessels. The more frequent appearance of low-profile vessels, often called narco subs, points to traffickers' increasing sophistication.\n\nThe Coast Guard has said it caught a record six narco subs in fiscal year 2016, which ended in September 2016. In September 2017, the service said it had seen a \"resurgence\" of such vessels, catching seven of them since June that year.\n\n\"We're seeing more of these low-profile vessels; 40-plus feet long ... it rides on the surface, multiple outboard engines, moves 18, 22 knots ... and they can carry large loads of contraband,\" Schultz told Business Insider earlier this year.\n\nNarco subs can cost $1 million to $2 million but can carry multiton loads of cocaine worth tens of millions of dollars in the US.\n\nMike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, estimated Colombian traffickers were building 100 narco subs a year and said the DEA believed at least 30% to 40% of drugs coming to the US were moving on those vessels, but authorities were likely only intercepting 5% of them.\n\nA Coast Guard Cutter Stratton boarding team investigates a self-propelled semi-submersible interdicted in international waters off the coast of Central America, July 19, 2015. US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 2nd Class LaNola Stone\n\nThe Coast Guard's own estimate indicates that it can block only a sliver of the narcotics coming to the US by sea.\n\nAsked what was needed to address the flow of narcotics, Ray in late 2017 pointed to the offshore-patrol-cutter program, which the Coast Guard has said will bridge the gap between national-security cutters like the James, which patrol open ocean, and fast-response cutters, which patrol closer to shore.\n\nThe first offshore-patrol cutter isn't scheduled to be delivered until 2021.\n\nRead more: Here's how drugs are getting smuggled from South America to the US\n\nCoast Guard officials have touted the capabilities of national-security cutters, like the James, which were introduced in 2008 and of which six are in service.\n\nBut the other cutters that seized drugs offloaded by the James on Thursday were, on average, 41 years old, \"and are increasingly more difficult to maintain and more costly to operate\" Claire Grady, the Homeland Security Department's chief of management, said on Thursday.\n\n\"For the Coast Guard to remain always ready to combat transnational crime and conduct its 10 other statutory missions,\" Grady added, \"it's imperative to recapitalize its aging fleet.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Julie Bort", "title": "Uber insiders describe questionable decisions before its self-driving car killed a pedestrian", "description": "On March 18 one of Uber's self-driving cars killed a pedestrian, the first pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car.

Her job was to watch the car drive itself, and to take control of it if it encountered any issues. She kept taking her eyes off the road, but not to enter data into an iPad app, as her job required. She was streaming an episode of \"The Voice\" on Hulu on her phone.

There was a third party that deserves some blame, they say: the car itself, and a list of questionable decisions made by the people who built it.\n\nUber's car had actually spotted Herzberg six seconds before it hit her, and, one second before impact, it knew it needed to brake hard, the NTSB reported.\n\nBut it didn't. It couldn't.\n\nIts creators had forbidden the car from slamming on the brakes in an emergency maneuver, even if it detected \"a squishy thing\" \u2014 Uber's term for a human or an animal, sources told Business Insider. And the NTSB report said Uber had deliberately disabled self-driving braking.\n\nThe car's creators had also disabled the Volvo's own emergency-braking factory settings, the report found and insiders confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nRead more: Uber lost nearly $1 billion last quarter as the ride-hailing giant's growth slows\n\nAccording to emails reviewed by Business Insider, they had even tinkered with the car's ability to swerve.\n\nMuch has been written about the death of Herzberg, most of it focused on the failings of the driver. But until now not much has been revealed about why engineers and senior leaders turned off the car's ability to stop itself.\n\nInsiders told us that it was a result of chaos inside the organization and may have been motivated, at least in part, to please the boss.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with seven current and former employees of Uber's self-driving-car unit employed during the time of the accident and in the months succeeding it. We viewed internal emails, meeting notes, and other documents relating to the autonomous-car program and the incident.\n\nWe learned that these insiders allege that, despite many warnings about the car's safety, the senior leadership team had a pressing concern in the months before the accident: impressing Uber's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi with a demo ride that gave him a pleasant \"ride experience.\"\n\nThese employees and documents paint a picture of:\n\nLeadership that feared Khosrowshahi was contemplating canceling the project, ending their very high-paying jobs, so they wanted to show him progress.\n\nEngineers making dangerous trade-offs with safety as they were told to create a smooth riding experience.\n\nIncentives and priorities that pressured teams to move fast, claim progress, and please a new CEO.\n\nA series of warning signals that were either ignored or not taken seriously enough.\n\nVast dysfunction in Uber's Advanced Technologies Group, with rampant infighting so that no one seemed to know what others were doing.\n\nAfter the accident on March 18, Uber grounded the fleet. Although the NTSB's final report has not yet been released (it's expected in April, sources tell us), the company is already making plans to put its cars back on the public roads, according to documents viewed by Business Insider. Uber is trying to catch up to competitors like Google's Waymo and GM, who never halted their road tests.\n\n'Could have killed a toddler'\n\nTo some Uber insiders, Herzberg's death was the tragic but unsurprising consequence of a self-driving car that should not have been driving on the open road at night, and perhaps not at all.\n\nUber's self-driving Volvo SUV. Gene J. Puskar / AP\n\nUber's Advanced Technologies Group, the unit building self-driving vehicles, is spending $600 million a year, sources familiar with the matter tell Business Insider, although others have said the budget has been closer to $1 billion. And it remains woefully behind the autonomous-car market leaders in every measurable way, although Uber tells us that the company has \"every confidence in the work\" the team is doing to get back on track.\n\nAt the time of the accident, engineers knew the car's driverless software was immature and having trouble recognizing or predicting the paths of a wide variety of objects, including pedestrians, in various circumstances, according to all the employees we talked to.\n\nFor instance, the car was poorly equipped for \"near-range sensing,\" so it wasn't always detecting objects that were within a couple of meters of it, two people confirmed.\n\n\"This could have killed a toddler in a parking lot. That was our scenario. That's the accident that didn't happen, but could have,\" one software developer said.\n\nEvery week, software team leaders were briefed on hundreds of problems, ranging from minor to serious, people told us, and the issues weren't always easy to fix.\n\nFor example, the tree branches. For weeks on end, during a regular \"triage\" meeting where issues were prioritized by vice president of software Jon Thomason, tree branches kept coming up, one former engineer told us. Tree branches create shadows in the road that the car sometimes thought were physical obstacles, multiple people told us.\n\nJon Thomason, the vice president of software at Uber's ATG unit. Jon Thomason/LinkedIn\n\nUber's software \"would classify them as objects that are actually moving, and the cars would do something stupid, like stop or call for remote assistance,\" one engineer explained. \"Or the software might crash and get out of autonomy mode. This was a common issue that we were trying to fix.\"\n\nThomason grew irate at one of these meetings, another engineer recalls, and demanded the problem be fixed. \"This is unacceptable! We are above this! We shouldn't be getting stuck on tree branches, so go figure it out,\" Thomason said, according to the engineer.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson denies that the car stops for tree branch shadows. This spokesperson said the car stops for actual tree branches in the road.\n\nMeanwhile, another employee also said that piles of leaves could confuse the car. A third employee told us of other efforts to teach the car to recognize foliage.\n\nEmployees also said the car was not always able to predict the path of a pedestrian. And according to an email reviewed by Business Insider, the car's software didn't always know what to do when something partially blocked the lane it was driving in.\n\nOn top of all this, a number of engineers at Uber said they believed the cars were not being thoroughly tested in safer settings. They wanted better simulation software, used more frequently.\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nThe company started to address that concern before the accident when it hired a respected simulation engineer in February. Recently, Uber has publicly vowed to do more simulation testing when it is allowed to send its cars back on the open road again.\n\nBut before Herzberg's accident, \"We just didn't invest in it. We had s---. Our off-line testing, now called simulation, was almost nonexistent, utter garbage,\" as one described it.\n\nBesides simulation, another way to test a self-driving car is on a track.\n\nBut employees we spoke with described Uber's track testing efforts as disorganized with each project team doing it their own way and no one overseeing testing as a whole.\n\nThis kind of holistic oversight is another area that Uber said it is addressing.\n\nYet even now, months after the tragedy, these employees say that rigorous, holistic safety testing remains weak. They say that the safety team has been mostly working on a \"taxonomy\" \u2014 in other words, a list of safety-related terms to use \u2014 and not on making sure the car performs reliably in every setting. Uber tells us that the safety team has been working on both the taxonomy and the tests itself.\n\nDara's ride\n\nAs employees worked, they were acutely aware of division leadership's plans to host a very important passenger: Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi.\n\nKhosrowshahi had taken over as Uber CEO in the summer of 2017, following a tumultuous year in which the company was battered by a string of scandals involving everything from sexual-harassment allegations to reports of unsavory business practices. The self-driving-car group wasn't immune, with Anthony Levandowski, its leader and star engineer, ousted in April 2017, amid accusations of intellectual-property theft.\n\nThe unit's current leader, Eric Meyhofer, took Levandowski's place just five months before Khosrowshahi was hired.\n\nDespite Uber's massive investment in self-driving cars, its program was considered to be far behind the competition. News reports suggested that Khosrowshahi should just shut it down.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Thomson Reuters\n\nNone of this was lost on Meyhofer and the senior team, who wanted to impress their new CEO with a show of progress, sources and documents said.\n\nPlans were made to take Khosrowshahi on a demo ride sometime around April and to have a big year-end public demonstration. ATG needed to \"sizzle,\" Meyhofer liked to say, people told us. Internally, people began talking about \"Dara's ride\" and \"Dara's run.\"\n\nThe stakes were high. If ATG died it could end the leadership team's high-paying jobs. Senior engineers were making over $400,000 and directors were paid in the $1 million range between salary, bonus, and stock options, multiple employees said.\n\nLeadership also had their reputation at stake. They did not want to be forever be known as the ones who led Uber's much publicized project to its death, people close to Meyhofer explained.\n\nInternally, unit leaders geared up to pull off the \"sizzle.\"\n\n'Bad experiences'\n\nAs the world's largest ride-hailing company, Uber understood the need to give customers a good experience. If passengers were going to accept self-driving cars, the ride could not be the jarring experience that had made a BuzzFeed reporter carsick during a demonstration.\n\nSo, in November, a month after Khosrowshahi became their new boss, Eric Hanson, a member of the product team, sent out a \"product requirement document\" that spelled out a new goal for ATG, according to an email viewed by Business Insider. (Hanson has since become the director of the product group.)\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nThe document asked engineers to think of \"rider-experience metrics\" and prescribed only one \"bad experience\" per ride for the big year-end demonstration.\n\nGiven how immature the car's autonomous software was at the time, \"that's an awfully high bar to meet,\" one software developer said.\n\nSome engineers who had been focused on fixing safety-related issues were aghast. Engineers can \"tune\" a self-driving car to drive smoother easily enough, but with immature software that meant not allowing the car to respond to everything it saw, real or not, sources explained. And that could be risky.\n\n\"If you put a person inside the vehicle and the chances of that person dying is 12%, you should not be discussing anything about user experience,\" one frustrated engineer hypothesized. \"The priority should not be about a user experience but about safety.\"\n\nTwo days after the product team distributed the document discussing \"rider-experience metrics\" and limiting \"bad experiences\" to one per ride, another email went out. This one was from several ATG engineers. It said they were turning off the car's ability to make emergency decisions on its own like slamming on the brakes or swerving hard.\n\nTheir rationale was safety.\n\n\"These emergency actions have real-world risk if the VO [vehicle operator or safety driver] does not take over in time and other drivers are not attentive, so it is better to suppress plans with emergency actions in online operation,\" the email read.\n\nIn other words, such quick moves can startle other drivers on the road and if there was a real threat, the safety driver would have already taken over, they reasoned. So they resolved to limit the car's actions and rely wholly on the safety driver's alertness.\n\nThe subtext was clear: The car's software wasn't good enough to make emergency decisions. And, one employee pointed out to us, by restricting the car to gentler responses, it might also produce a smoother ride.\n\nA few weeks later, they gave the car back more of its ability to swerve but did not return its ability to brake hard.\n\nShayanne Gal/Skye Gould/Business Insider\n\nFinal warning\n\nThe final warning sign came just a couple of days before the tragedy.\n\nOne of the lead safety drivers sent an email to Meyhofer laying out a long list of grievances about the mismanagement and working conditions of the safety-driver program.\n\n\"The drivers felt they were not being utilized well. That they were being asked to drive around in circles but that their feedback was not changing anything,\" said one former engineer of Uber's self-driving-car unit who was familiar with the driver program.\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nDrivers complained about long hours and not enough communication on what they should be testing and watching for. But the big complaint was the decision a few months earlier to start using one driver instead of two. That choice instantly gave ATG access to more drivers, so the company could log more mileage without having to hire double the drivers.\n\nThe second driver used to be responsible for logging the car's issues on an iPad app and dealing with the car's requests to identify objects on the road.\n\nEric Risberg / AP\n\nNow one person had to do everything, employees told us.\n\nThis not only eliminated the safety and redundancy of having two drivers, it required the active driver to do the logging and tagging, not keeping their eyes on the road, which some inside the company believed was not safe.\n\nIt was like distracted driving, \"like watching their cellphone 10 to 15% of the time,\" said one software engineer.\n\nIf Meyhofer took the angry email from that safety driver seriously \u2014 and multiple people told us he'd been reacting with frustration to people he viewed as naysayers \u2014 he didn't have a chance to act on it before the tragedy that benched the cars.\n\nUber now has said the self-driving-car unit plans to return to the two-driver system when it sends its cars on the road again.\n\nA 'toxic culture'\n\nSome employees believe that ATG's leaders were pushing for a \"ride experience\" to make Khosrowshahi believe the car was further along than it was during that planned demo ride.\n\nBut others say mistakes were less conscious than that.\n\nOne engineer who worked closely with Meyhofer said the real problem was that under his leadership there was \"poor communication, with a bunch of teams duplicating effort,\" adding: \"One group doesn't know what the other is doing.\"\n\nThis engineer said one team would not know the other had disabled a feature, or that a feature didn't pass on the track test, or that drivers were saying a car performed badly.\n\n\"They only know their piece. You get this domino effect. All these things create an unsafe system,\" this person said.\n\nEric Meyhofer, head of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group. Uber\n\nEveryone we talked to also described the unit as a \"toxic culture\" under Meyhofer.\n\nThey talked of impossible workloads, backstabbing teammates, and poor management.\n\nAccording to documents viewed by Business Insider, leadership was aware of this reputation, with Thomason confessing to other leaders in a September meeting, \"We repeatedly hear that ATG is not a fun place to work\" and said such feedback was \"baffling\" to him.\n\nWhile some people disliked Meyhofer and thought that he could be insecure to the point of vindictiveness if he was challenged, others described him as a nice guy with good intentions who was in over his head.\n\n\"He is a hardware guy. He runs a tight hardware ship,\" one engineer and former employee who worked closely with him told us. But the brain of a self-driving car is software, this person said.\n\nThis person said that meant Meyhofer lacked \"the understanding and know-how of the software space.\"\n\n\"Imagine a leader that can't weigh two options and decide the best course of action,\" described this engineer.\n\nEveryone we spoke with agreed that part of the problem is that Uber's self-driving-car unit was staffed by teams in two very different locations with two very different engineering cultures.\n\nThere was a team in Pittsburgh, anchored by folks from Carnegie Mellon's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), of which Meyhofer was an alum, and there were the San Francisco teams.\n\nThe San Francisco people complained that the NREC folks were a bunch of academics with no real-world, product-building experience, who retained their high-paying jobs by virtue of being Meyhofer's cronies. The NREC team saw the San Francisco engineers as whiny and ungrateful, people described.\n\nOn top of the infighting, there was a bonus structure that rewarded some employees for speedily hitting milestones \u2014 careful testing or not \u2014 multiple sources described.\n\n\"At ATG, the attitude is I will do whatever it takes, and I will get this huge bonus,\" one former engineer said. \"I swear that everything that drives bad behaviors was the bonus structure.\"\n\nIn its safety report, Uber said some of the ways ATG was measuring the progress of its program before the accident created \"perverse incentives.\"\n\nSpecifically, ATG, like everyone in the self-driving-car industry, believed that the more miles a car drove itself without help from a human, the smarter it was. But the whole industry now realized this is an overly simplistic way to measure how well a car drives. If management is too focused on that metric, employees may feel pressured not to take control of the car, even when they should.\n\nUber has since vowed to find other ways to measure improvement and tells us that milestone-based bonuses were limited to just a few people and have recently been eliminated.\n\nInternally, some remain frustrated with the self-driving unit.\n\nUber's ATG offices in Pittsburgh. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio\n\n\"Within ATG, we refused to take responsibility. They blamed it on the homeless lady, the Latina with a criminal record driving the car, even though we all knew Perception was broken,\" one software developer said, referring to the software that allows the car to interpret the data its sensors collect. \"But our car hit a person. No one inside ATG said, 'We did something wrong and we should change our behavior.'\"\n\nThe employees we talked to note that most of the same leadership team remains in place under Meyhofer, and some of them, like Hanson, have even been promoted. They allege that the unit's underlying culture hasn't really changed.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson said the company has reviewed its safety procedures, made many changes already, and is promising to make many more. It described them all in a series of documents the company published this month, as it ramps up to hit the road again soon.\n\nUber's has been using Volvo SUVs to test its self-driving technology. REUTERS/Natalie Behring\n\n\"Right now the entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in self-driving mode,\" the spokesperson told us. \"We have every confidence in the work they are doing to get us there. We recently took an important step forward with the release of our Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment.\n\n\"Our team remains committed to implementing key safety improvements, and we intend to resume on-the-road self-driving testing only when these improvements have been implemented and we have received authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\"\n\nThe Uber CEO's big ride-along never happened because of the March accident \u2014 at least not on any public roads. But that may change.\n\nMeyhofer and most of his closest lieutenants remain in charge of ATG and want to get their self-driving cars on the road again as soon as possible, before the end of the year, maybe even later this month, employees say.\n\nIn a September meeting of Meyhofer's senior leadership, the team was told: \"We need to demonstrate something very publicly by 2019,\" according to documents seen by Business Insider."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Bob Bryan", "title": "The US and China are giving off bad signals ahead of a crucial meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping", "description": "President Donald Trump is talking up the possibility of progress towards ending the trade war with China.

This lead to a furious, but ultimately fruitless, round of negotiations before the first set of tariffs were imposed in July.\n\nIn total, the US has applied tariffs to $250 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the US, while the Chinese have hit $110 billion worth of US goods with duties.\n\nThe divisions between the US and China were again on display when the 21 APEC member countries were unable to agree on an official communique from the meeting. While the statement is largely ceremonial, it highlights the acrimonious relationship between the two largest APEC economies.\n\nAccording to reports, China wanted to include language in the official remarks that rejected protectionism and unilateralism \u2014 echoing Beijing's accusations about the US. On the other hand, the US wanted to include language that critiqued China's trade practices.\n\nBack home, the Trump administration's fight with China is also taking another step foward\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Commerce began taking public comment on new rules that would give the administration the ability to restrict exports of certain critical technologies on the basis of national security \u2014 which could allow the US to stop exports of some technology to China.\n\nUnder the recently-passed Export Control Reform Act, the Trump administration can limit the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" to adversarial countries.\n\nUnder previous administrations, export controls were typically limited to technology with direct military capabilities. More general rules restricting exports that could theoretically have military applications would be a significant broadening of those restrictions.\n\nGiven this new power, the Trump administration wants to prevent exports related to 14 high-tech sectors, such as biotechnology, robotics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe new rule is also part of a broader campaign by various parts of the Trump administration to use non-tariff measures to put pressure on Chinese economic interests. For instance, the Department of Justice has increased the number of Chinese firms being charge with economic espionage and created a task force to combat illegal Chinese economic practices."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mary Hanbury", "title": "Victoria's Secret has a new CEO for its lingerie business (LB)", "description": "Victoria's Secret has a new CEO to run its lingerie business.

So puff paint I've become obsessed with because it's just such an underrated acrylic paint.\n\nMy first piece was an old flip phone. It all started pre-smartphone era. I knew that this paint was for children and therefore non-toxic and probably wouldn't do any damage to the technology.\n\nIt just grew from there.\n\nI felt the need to represent for puff paint and become a full-time puff paint artist.\n\nWhen I'm about to start a piece, I first start thinking about the broad strokes, or in this case the broad puffs. And really look at the shape of the object and what it wants to be, more so than what I want it to be.\n\nSo with the boar's head I really started seeing a conical seashell.\n\nMy process is very much like layering a cake.\n\nThe paint looks exactly the same wet or dry, so there can be a lot of tragic accidents.\n\nAll of my work is full coverage.\n\nThis one took maybe 300 hours. And usually I'm building up to at least three layers, but it can get up to 10 layers. And so that's really where the timing comes in.\n\nMy partner is a director and an editor, and she shoots all the time, and so she would get these really expensive cameras. And I remember when she first asked me to cover one of her cameras, and I was really excited, because it just is such a sacrilegious idea. This was the very first camera, it was the Sprinkle 7D. I just wanted to see what would happen if you could make a camera look like an ice cream sundae.\n\nI have covered everything from cameras, to shoes, to bras, to deer, boars, alligator heads. I've even covered cigarette packs, phone cases, book bags. I've done a lot, a lot of clothes.\n\nI think my favorite piece would have to be this candy bear.\n\nOne of the most surprising collaborations I've done was with Miley Cyrus. I did a mini line of really outrageous wearable art for her, and a pair of Neapolitan ice cream coated pasties ended up on her breasts on the cover of Plastik Magazine.\n\nI grew up with a family of game hunters. The Sundae Stag was a piece that my great-grandfather shot, and it ended up in a basement with its nose chewed off by a family dog. And I thought how sad it was that these animals are killed, stuffed, and then they're trophies, but at the same time, there's millions of trophies that all look exactly the same. There's a weird thing that I guess I feel, that their spirit should be eternalized and decorated for the after-after-afterlife.\n\nThe other art that I create is hand-painted wallpaper. It's coming from my interior design background. It's something that I always, always wanted to create for homes and hotels, and I hope to keep painting them for the rest of the year. That's sort of my goal is traveling by way of painting hand-painted wallpapers.

While many have touted the tech giant's move to New York City and the Washington, DC metro as a way to boost economic development, others are concerned about the impact of thousands of new residents and two massive headquarters.\n\nAs Amazon begins its slow takeover of Long Island City, Queens, and National Landing (the site of three urban districts in Northern Virginia), the company will introduce around 25,000 new employees to each area over the course of ten years.\n\nRead more: New Yorkers are making lots of doomsday predictions about Amazon's HQ2. Here are all the things that could make it a disaster.\n\nIn neighborhoods that are already experiencing rising rents and crowded public transit, this could give way to further issues of congestion and affordability.\n\nIt could also have serious repercussions for homelessness in both New York and DC.\n\nA Zillow senior economist recently found that Amazon's HQ2 could introduce 830 new homeless residents to New York City and 14 homeless residents to DC on an annual basis.\n\nThat's a small number compared to the existing crises, but it could represent a long-term challenge for both cities, which already struggle to accommodate their homeless populations.\n\nNew York City currently has around 77,000 homeless residents, the most of any city in the United States. But DC has a greater number of homeless residents relative to its population size. With around 7,500 homeless residents, DC outranks every other city in terms of its overall share.\n\nThe addition of more than a dozen homeless residents per year could put pressure on individual neighborhoods. As of earlier this year, Arlington County \u2014 home to two of the three National Landing districts \u2014 had a reported 221 homeless residents. The addition of 14 people would represent a more than 6% increase in the county's homeless population.\n\nThough it's possible that the Amazon effect will be less dramatic, the company's impact in Seattle \u2014 the site of its current headquarters \u2014 could presage what's to come.\n\nIn the last ten years, the number of Amazon employees in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood has risen to more than 45,000. Since 2014, the city has seen its homeless count increase each year by 9%.\n\nAmazon's response to the crisis has been somewhat unsteady. In 2016, Jeff Bezos donated $1 million to Mary's Place, a homeless shelter near the current Seattle headquarters. But the company also opposed a tax on large companies in Seattle that would have set aside $47 million per year for affordable housing projects and homeless services.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether HQ2 might cause an uptick in homelessness in Long Island City or Northern Virginia. In June, the company said repealing the Seattle homeless tax was \"the right decision for the region's economic prosperity.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb", "title": "A dedicated group of 'Fallout 76' players crashed the game's server with a trio of nuclear explosions", "description": "Released on November 14th, \"Fallout 76\" is the latest game in the series of post-apocalyptic first-person shooters.

He found it to be a fundamentally flawed concept, and his movement was designed to help decrease its hold over society.\n\nHoulahan's reply was basically, \"Dude, what the f--- are you talking about?\"\n\n\"And then I had realized what I had said \u2014 like wow, that is a pretty big thing to just lay on somebody on New Year's Day without any warning!\" Coen Gilbert told Business Insider, laughing.\n\nThis idea would mature into the notion of B Corporations, where the B stands for \"benefit.\" Companies going through the B Corp process would be overseen by the company B Lab.\n\nAfter months of discussion and planning, Houlahan decided that after they sold AND1 to American Sporting Goods in May 2005, his friend's ambitious idea would be worth pursuing. They brought on Andrew Kassoy, a Wall Street connection, and launched B Lab the next year.\n\nToday, there are 2,655 Certified B Corporations across 60 countries, and they include Danone North America, Patagonia, and Amalgamated Bank. Companies can also apply to be legally recognized as \"benefit corporations\" in 34 states and Washington, DC, as well as in Italy, with other countries considering legislation.\n\nCoen Gilbert doesn't see his movement as a charitable act, but a participant in a major shift in how businesses are run.\n\n\"As we go forward in the 21st century, people will look back and say, 'I can't believe they tried to run an economy where the only interest that mattered was the interest of shareholders,'\" he said.\n\nA personal journey\n\nWhen Coen Gilbert's friend Seth Berger, a lifelong basketball fan, told him in the early '90s that his solution to avoiding a traditional finance path after business school would be by starting a specialized basketball-apparel brand, it seemed like a fun idea.\n\nCoen Gilbert had enough of a financial cushion that if the project failed miserably, he'd be able to work his way back onto Wall Street. Instead, the brand, AND1, reached an audience, inked NBA deals, and most famously became linked with the top performers in amateur streetball competitions.\n\nBy 1999, Coen Gilbert had reached a level of financial success where, though still focused on AND1, he began considering options for what could come next. A turning point came in the fall of 2001. He went through the stress of knowing that his sister worked in downtown Manhattan during the 9/11 attacks, and he learned she was pulled to safety from debris by a first responder. Four days after that, their dad died from lung cancer. And then two weeks later, one of his AND1 team members died in a car accident on his way to work.\n\nThe sadness he felt made him think about his own mortality, and \"that triggered a pretty intense period of reflection on what's the highest and best use of my life,\" he said.\n\nThere are more than 2,600 Certified B Corporations around the world. B Lab/Facebook\n\nHe spent the next few years reading books and attending conferences about using business for social good. He studied the careers of entrepreneurs in this space, like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry's, Tom Chappell of Tom's of Maine, and Judy Wicks of White Dog Cafe. He became involved with the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies and the Social Venture Network.\n\nCoen Gilbert brought charitable initiatives to AND1 but realized he wanted something on a larger scale. After he and Houlahan left AND1 in 2005, they sought a partnership with Newman's Own, the food company that uses all its profits for charitable purposes, but nothing came of it.\n\nCoen Gilbert decided his vision should go beyond charity, but he also abandoned an idea for an investment fund. Then he and his business partners fully developed the idea of a B Corporation.\n\n\"You can't start asking other people to do stuff unless you want to do stuff yourself,\" Coen Gilbert said. \"And that was one of the dominant and most inspiring attributes of all the entrepreneurs and investors we'd been meeting, is they weren't screaming, yelling about an unjust system \u2014 they were actually working and investing in building companies that were making real differences in the lives of their workers, their communities, and future generations through their environmental practices. And they weren't waiting for anybody's permission; they were just going out and doing it.\"\n\nMaking it a movement\n\nThe B Lab founders worked their network and certified a freshman class of 19 B Corps in 2007.\n\nB Lab analysts grade each company on its benefits across five areas and refresh the assessment every three years. Companies that pass requirements pay an annual fee. After a few years of recruiting companies, Coen Gilbert wanted to further help companies with a social mission retain it after selling or going public, and he believed the next step would be through a legal certification.\n\nHe met with Leslie Christian, who was then the CEO and president of Portfolio 21 and focused on socially responsible investing. She agreed with Coen Gilbert that the reign of shareholder primacy, rooted in economic theory most popularly expressed by free-market economists like Milton Friedman in the 1970s and then entrenched in judicial precedent throughout the 1980s, was not only harmful to other stakeholders but bad for the long-term health of a business. Coen Gilbert and his team consulted with her corporate attorney and then other lawyers around the country.\n\nPatagonia is a high-performing B Corporation. B Lab\n\nIn 2010, a Delaware corporate lawyer helped B Lab with a proposal for a \"benefit corporation\" legal status. (The B Corp certification is an independent label.) It turned out that giving companies the chance to register as benefit corporations had bipartisan support, and Maryland became the first state to ratify legislation.\n\nToday, a company can register as a benefit corporation in 34 states and Washington, DC. Italy was the first country outside the US to adopt this policy, and Colombia is also considering it.\n\nThe more than 2,600 Certified B Corps range from smaller private companies like Kickstarter to corporations like the food giant Danone's North American subsidiary. Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber has said he is so pleased with what the certification has done for that business that he is aiming to have all of Danone achieve it by 2030.\n\nHe told Business Insider that the certification had received tremendous employee support and won over skeptical investors, adding that Danone's plan helped it renegotiate a \u20ac2 billion syndicated banking loan with 12 major banks at a lower cost.\n\n\"So this is basically recognizing the fact the credit rating of Danone is better as a B Corp than not being a B Corp,\" he said.\n\nThe fight against shareholder primacy\n\nWhen Coen Gilbert began growing the idea for what became B Lab, the giant corporations that were buying the small, socially responsible companies like Ben & Jerry's seemed like the bad guys. But now corporations like Danone and Unilever are genuinely pursuing the initiatives that 20 years ago were only for dreamers.\n\nToday, you also have someone like Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, saying in a letter to CEOs that \"to prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\"\n\nFink said at a New York Times conference in November that he believes that so-called ESG metrics \u2014 environmental, social, and governance \u2014 will be used by every investor within five years to judge a company's performance.\n\nAnd on the policy side, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts this year introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which directly cites benefit-corporation legislation as the norm for the entire country and would give it more teeth for enforcement.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren cites benefit corporations in her Accountable Capitalism Act. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nFor Coen Gilbert, B Lab will help ensure this trend reaches its conclusion, because he is convinced that shareholder primacy is a lesser way of doing business, even for the shareholders themselves.\n\n\"We actually created a system that was counter to human nature, and we're in the middle of a mid\u00adcourse correction,\" he said.\n\nHe said B Corps and people fighting for the same values \"are bending that arc of history or that lever of economics so it bends more towards justice and inclusion and equity and the creation of a more shared and durable prosperity.\"\n\n\"I think that is a conscious human choice,\" Coen Gilbert said. \"And I think it's a cool thing to observe and to be a part of.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christopher Woody", "title": "Argentina releases first images of the submarine San Juan \u2014 lost a year ago at 3,000 feet deep with all its crew", "description": "A little over a year after losing contact with the submarine ARA San Juan, the Argentina navy said the wreckage of the sub had been found at the bottom of the southern Atlantic Ocean, where it sank with all 44 of its crew members.

In his last nine games, James is averaging 29.7 points per game on 53.6% shooting, 50.9% from three, with 6 rebounds and 6 assists per game.\n\nJames has improved as a shooter during his career, and his accuracy from beyond the three-point line has made him a more dangerous and versatile player. This year, James looks even more willing to let it fly from well beyond the line, as if he studied Stephen Curry in the offseason. James hasn't admitted to such, but it's not a stretch to think he might have viewed the way Curry bends the floor.\n\nCurry's ability to launch from anywhere inside of half court has changed the NBA. Teams now practice shooting from well beyond the arc, with teams like the Houston Rockets emphasizing to their players to take a few steps behind the line to create more spacing.\n\nAfter starting hot from three-point range last season, James said he changed his form in the offseason and worked on his shot. Perhaps he was back in the lab this summer.\n\nFor the season, James is shooting 39% from three-point range, the second-best mark of his career. According to the NBA's stats site, James has taken 68 field-goal attempts from between 25-29 feet and six attempts from 30-34 feet. He's hit 39% of his attempts from beyond 25 feet, which is any noncorner three-pointer. James is also taking more attempts from three than ever before, with 30% of his overall shots coming from long range, up from 25% in the last two seasons.\n\nIn other words, James is launching from deep more than ever before and hitting them at a nearly career-best clip.\n\nAnother noteworthy addition to James' game is that he's taking more pull-up shots than before. According to the NBA's stats site, 42.8% of James' shots this year have been pull-up jumpers. That's up from 36% last year and 34% the year before. He's averaging a whopping 3.8 pull-up three-pointers per game and hitting 43% of them. That is Stephen Curry-esque!\n\nThis development is about more than James expanding his game, however.\n\nFirst, if James can sustain this type of shooting, it changes the Lakers' offense. Much was made about the Lakers' roster and the lack of shooting around James. That hasn't changed, though fears of a cramped floor have slowly dissipated as the season has gone on. The Lakers are shooting 36.1% from three, 11th best in the league. Last season, that mark would have placed them at 15th in the league, smack-dab in the middle.\n\nBefore the season, James was said to be eyeing a move to the low post, which would help mitigate the Lakers' spacing issues and also allow him to do less dribbling and play-making from the perimeter.\n\nRead more: LeBron James is reportedly already eyeing a role change with the Lakers that would emulate past NBA greats\n\nBut James isn't posting up more \u2014 in fact, he's averaging two fewer post-ups per game this year. Instead, he's stretched his game farther from the basket. In doing so, he creates more space for his teammates and gives the Lakers' offense an added dose of efficiency.\n\nIt's also an interesting development in James' overall career arc. James will turn 34 in December. No matter how superhuman he may seem on the court, his burst and quickness will start to fade as he gets older. James has already developed into a good-enough shooter to make defenses pay for sagging off on him.\n\nOne source familiar with James told Business Insider that teams incorrectly defend James when they give him space to brace for his drives to the hoop. James' first step has slowed down already, this source said, so teams should play him on him, taking away both the drive and his jumper.\n\nInstead, teams continue to give James space, and now he's making them pay with his jumper.\n\nPerhaps this is a sign of what's to come in James' future. He's no longer the highest flyer in the league, but he can still attack the basket with gusto. If James' jumper continues to develop and becomes more accurate as he gets older, he could stretch his prime for longer than anyone expected."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Julie Bort", "title": "Inside Uber before its self-driving car killed a pedestrian: Sources describe infighting, 'perverse' incentives, and questionable decisions", "description": "On March 18 one of Uber's self-driving cars killed a pedestrian, the first pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car.

A few seconds later, one of Uber's self-driving Volvo SUVs ran into her at 39 mph and killed her.\n\nInside the car, Rafaela Vasquez was working alone, as all Uber's safety drivers did at the time. Her job was to watch the car drive itself, and to take control of it if it encountered any issues. She kept taking her eyes off the road, but not to enter data into an iPad app, as her job required. She was streaming an episode of \"The Voice\" on Hulu on her phone. She looked up again just as the car hit Herzberg, grabbed the wheel, and gasped.\n\nThese are the details of the March 18 incident, according to the preliminary National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report, police reports, and a video of the incident released by police.\n\nThe incident shocked people inside Uber's Advanced Technologies Group, the company's 1,100-person self-driving unit. Employees shared their horror in chat rooms and in the halls, several employees told Business Insider.\n\nAutonomous cars are promoted as being safer than humans, able to see and react with the speed of a computer. But one of their cars had been involved in the first self-driving fatality of a pedestrian.\n\nWhen employees learned that Herzberg was a jaywalking homeless woman and that her blood tested positive for meth and pot, many seized on those details to explain away the tragedy, several employees told us. (Uber has since settled a lawsuit from her daughter and husband.)\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators examine a self-driving Uber vehicle involved in a fatal accident in Tempe, Arizona, March 20, 2018. National Transportation Safety Board/Handout via REUTERS\n\nWhen employees discovered Vasquez was watching Hulu and was a felon before Uber hired her, they vilified her.\n\n\"People were blaming everything on her,\" one employee said.\n\nBut insiders tell us that Vasquez and Herzberg were not the only factors in this death. There was a third party that deserves some blame, they say: the car itself, and a list of questionable decisions made by the people who built it.\n\nUber's car had actually spotted Herzberg six seconds before it hit her, and, one second before impact, it knew it needed to brake hard, the NTSB reported.\n\nBut it didn't. It couldn't.\n\nIts creators had forbidden the car from slamming on the brakes in an emergency maneuver, even if it detected \"a squishy thing\" \u2014 Uber's term for a human or an animal, sources told Business Insider. And the NTSB report said Uber had deliberately disabled self-driving braking.\n\nThe car's creators had also disabled the Volvo's own emergency-braking factory settings, the report found and insiders confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nRead more: Uber lost nearly $1 billion last quarter as the ride-hailing giant's growth slows\n\nAccording to emails reviewed by Business Insider, they had even tinkered with the car's ability to swerve.\n\nMuch has been written about the death of Herzberg, most of it focused on the failings of the driver. But until now not much has been revealed about why engineers and senior leaders turned off the car's ability to stop itself.\n\nInsiders told us that it was a result of chaos inside the organization and may have been motivated, at least in part, to please the boss.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with seven current and former employees of Uber's self-driving-car unit employed during the time of the accident and in the months succeeding it. We viewed internal emails, meeting notes, and other documents relating to the autonomous-car program and the incident.\n\nWe learned that these insiders allege that, despite many warnings about the car's safety, the senior leadership team had a pressing concern in the months before the accident: impressing Uber's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi with a demo ride that gave him a pleasant \"ride experience.\"\n\nThese employees and documents paint a picture of:\n\nLeadership that feared Khosrowshahi was contemplating canceling the project, ending their very high-paying jobs, so they wanted to show him progress.\n\nEngineers making dangerous trade-offs with safety as they were told to create a smooth riding experience.\n\nIncentives and priorities that pressured teams to move fast, claim progress, and please a new CEO.\n\nA series of warning signals that were either ignored or not taken seriously enough.\n\nVast dysfunction in Uber's Advanced Technologies Group, with rampant infighting so that no one seemed to know what others were doing.\n\nAfter the accident on March 18, Uber grounded the fleet. Although the NTSB's final report has not yet been released (it's expected in April, sources tell us), the company is already making plans to put its cars back on the public roads, according to documents viewed by Business Insider. Uber is trying to catch up to competitors like Google's Waymo and GM, who never halted their road tests.\n\n'Could have killed a toddler'\n\nTo some Uber insiders, Herzberg's death was the tragic but unsurprising consequence of a self-driving car that should not have been driving on the open road at night, and perhaps not at all.\n\nUber's self-driving Volvo SUV. Gene J. Puskar / AP\n\nUber's Advanced Technologies Group, the unit building self-driving vehicles, is spending $600 million a year, sources familiar with the matter tell Business Insider, although others have said the budget has been closer to $1 billion. And it remains woefully behind the autonomous-car market leaders in every measurable way, although Uber tells us that the company has \"every confidence in the work\" the team is doing to get back on track.\n\nAt the time of the accident, engineers knew the car's driverless software was immature and having trouble recognizing or predicting the paths of a wide variety of objects, including pedestrians, in various circumstances, according to all the employees we talked to.\n\nFor instance, the car was poorly equipped for \"near-range sensing,\" so it wasn't always detecting objects that were within a couple of meters of it, two people confirmed.\n\n\"This could have killed a toddler in a parking lot. That was our scenario. That's the accident that didn't happen, but could have,\" one software developer said.\n\nEvery week, software team leaders were briefed on hundreds of problems, ranging from minor to serious, people told us, and the issues weren't always easy to fix.\n\nFor example, the tree branches. For weeks on end, during a regular \"triage\" meeting where issues were prioritized by vice president of software Jon Thomason, tree branches kept coming up, one former engineer told us. Tree branches create shadows in the road that the car sometimes thought were physical obstacles, multiple people told us.\n\nJon Thomason, the vice president of software at Uber's ATG unit. Jon Thomason/LinkedIn\n\nUber's software \"would classify them as objects that are actually moving, and the cars would do something stupid, like stop or call for remote assistance,\" one engineer explained. \"Or the software might crash and get out of autonomy mode. This was a common issue that we were trying to fix.\"\n\nThomason grew irate at one of these meetings, another engineer recalls, and demanded the problem be fixed. \"This is unacceptable! We are above this! We shouldn't be getting stuck on tree branches, so go figure it out,\" Thomason said, according to the engineer.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson denies that the car stops for tree branch shadows. This spokesperson said the car stops for actual tree branches in the road.\n\nMeanwhile, another employee also said that piles of leaves could confuse the car. A third employee told us of other efforts to teach the car to recognize foliage.\n\nEmployees also said the car was not always able to predict the path of a pedestrian. And according to an email reviewed by Business Insider, the car's software didn't always know what to do when something partially blocked the lane it was driving in.\n\nOn top of all this, a number of engineers at Uber said they believed the cars were not being thoroughly tested in safer settings. They wanted better simulation software, used more frequently.\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nThe company started to address that concern before the accident when it hired a respected simulation engineer in February. Recently, Uber has publicly vowed to do more simulation testing when it is allowed to send its cars back on the open road again.\n\nBut before Herzberg's accident, \"We just didn't invest in it. We had s---. Our off-line testing, now called simulation, was almost nonexistent, utter garbage,\" as one described it.\n\nBesides simulation, another way to test a self-driving car is on a track.\n\nBut employees we spoke with described Uber's track testing efforts as disorganized with each project team doing it their own way and no one overseeing testing as a whole.\n\nThis kind of holistic oversight is another area that Uber said it is addressing.\n\nYet even now, months after the tragedy, these employees say that rigorous, holistic safety testing remains weak. They say that the safety team has been mostly working on a \"taxonomy\" \u2014 in other words, a list of safety-related terms to use \u2014 and not on making sure the car performs reliably in every setting. Uber tells us that the safety team has been working on both the taxonomy and the tests itself.\n\nDara's ride\n\nAs employees worked, they were acutely aware of division leadership's plans to host a very important passenger: Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi.\n\nKhosrowshahi had taken over as Uber CEO in the summer of 2017, following a tumultuous year in which the company was battered by a string of scandals involving everything from sexual-harassment allegations to reports of unsavory business practices. The self-driving-car group wasn't immune, with Anthony Levandowski, its leader and star engineer, ousted in April 2017, amid accusations of intellectual-property theft.\n\nThe unit's current leader, Eric Meyhofer, took Levandowski's place just five months before Khosrowshahi was hired.\n\nDespite Uber's massive investment in self-driving cars, its program was considered to be far behind the competition. News reports suggested that Khosrowshahi should just shut it down.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Thomson Reuters\n\nNone of this was lost on Meyhofer and the senior team, who wanted to impress their new CEO with a show of progress, sources and documents said.\n\nPlans were made to take Khosrowshahi on a demo ride sometime around April and to have a big year-end public demonstration. ATG needed to \"sizzle,\" Meyhofer liked to say, people told us. Internally, people began talking about \"Dara's ride\" and \"Dara's run.\"\n\nThe stakes were high. If ATG died it could end the leadership team's high-paying jobs. Senior engineers were making over $400,000 and directors were paid in the $1 million range between salary, bonus, and stock options, multiple employees said.\n\nLeadership also had their reputation at stake. They did not want to be forever be known as the ones who led Uber's much publicized project to its death, people close to Meyhofer explained.\n\nInternally, unit leaders geared up to pull off the \"sizzle.\"\n\n'Bad experiences'\n\nAs the world's largest ride-hailing company, Uber understood the need to give customers a good experience. If passengers were going to accept self-driving cars, the ride could not be the jarring experience that had made a BuzzFeed reporter carsick during a demonstration.\n\nSo, in November, a month after Khosrowshahi became their new boss, Eric Hanson, a member of the product team, sent out a \"product requirement document\" that spelled out a new goal for ATG, according to an email viewed by Business Insider. (Hanson has since become the director of the product group.)\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nThe document asked engineers to think of \"rider-experience metrics\" and prescribed only one \"bad experience\" per ride for the big year-end demonstration.\n\nGiven how immature the car's autonomous software was at the time, \"that's an awfully high bar to meet,\" one software developer said.\n\nSome engineers who had been focused on fixing safety-related issues were aghast. Engineers can \"tune\" a self-driving car to drive smoother easily enough, but with immature software that meant not allowing the car to respond to everything it saw, real or not, sources explained. And that could be risky.\n\n\"If you put a person inside the vehicle and the chances of that person dying is 12%, you should not be discussing anything about user experience,\" one frustrated engineer hypothesized. \"The priority should not be about a user experience but about safety.\"\n\nTwo days after the product team distributed the document discussing \"rider-experience metrics\" and limiting \"bad experiences\" to one per ride, another email went out. This one was from several ATG engineers. It said they were turning off the car's ability to make emergency decisions on its own like slamming on the brakes or swerving hard.\n\nTheir rationale was safety.\n\n\"These emergency actions have real-world risk if the VO [vehicle operator or safety driver] does not take over in time and other drivers are not attentive, so it is better to suppress plans with emergency actions in online operation,\" the email read.\n\nIn other words, such quick moves can startle other drivers on the road and if there was a real threat, the safety driver would have already taken over, they reasoned. So they resolved to limit the car's actions and rely wholly on the safety driver's alertness.\n\nThe subtext was clear: The car's software wasn't good enough to make emergency decisions. And, one employee pointed out to us, by restricting the car to gentler responses, it might also produce a smoother ride.\n\nA few weeks later, they gave the car back more of its ability to swerve but did not return its ability to brake hard.\n\nShayanne Gal/Skye Gould/Business Insider\n\nFinal warning\n\nThe final warning sign came just a couple of days before the tragedy.\n\nOne of the lead safety drivers sent an email to Meyhofer laying out a long list of grievances about the mismanagement and working conditions of the safety-driver program.\n\n\"The drivers felt they were not being utilized well. That they were being asked to drive around in circles but that their feedback was not changing anything,\" said one former engineer of Uber's self-driving-car unit who was familiar with the driver program.\n\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\n\nDrivers complained about long hours and not enough communication on what they should be testing and watching for. But the big complaint was the decision a few months earlier to start using one driver instead of two. That choice instantly gave ATG access to more drivers, so the company could log more mileage without having to hire double the drivers.\n\nThe second driver used to be responsible for logging the car's issues on an iPad app and dealing with the car's requests to identify objects on the road.\n\nEric Risberg / AP\n\nNow one person had to do everything, employees told us.\n\nThis not only eliminated the safety and redundancy of having two drivers, it required the active driver to do the logging and tagging, not keeping their eyes on the road, which some inside the company believed was not safe.\n\nIt was like distracted driving, \"like watching their cellphone 10 to 15% of the time,\" said one software engineer.\n\nIf Meyhofer took the angry email from that safety driver seriously \u2014 and multiple people told us he'd been reacting with frustration to people he viewed as naysayers \u2014 he didn't have a chance to act on it before the tragedy that benched the cars.\n\nUber now has said the self-driving-car unit plans to return to the two-driver system when it sends its cars on the road again.\n\nA 'toxic culture'\n\nSome employees believe that ATG's leaders were pushing for a \"ride experience\" to make Khosrowshahi believe the car was further along than it was during that planned demo ride.\n\nBut others say mistakes were less conscious than that.\n\nOne engineer who worked closely with Meyhofer said the real problem was that under his leadership there was \"poor communication, with a bunch of teams duplicating effort,\" adding: \"One group doesn't know what the other is doing.\"\n\nThis engineer said one team would not know the other had disabled a feature, or that a feature didn't pass on the track test, or that drivers were saying a car performed badly.\n\n\"They only know their piece. You get this domino effect. All these things create an unsafe system,\" this person said.\n\nEric Meyhofer, head of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group. Uber\n\nEveryone we talked to also described the unit as a \"toxic culture\" under Meyhofer.\n\nThey talked of impossible workloads, backstabbing teammates, and poor management.\n\nAccording to documents viewed by Business Insider, leadership was aware of this reputation, with Thomason confessing to other leaders in a September meeting, \"We repeatedly hear that ATG is not a fun place to work\" and said such feedback was \"baffling\" to him.\n\nWhile some people disliked Meyhofer and thought that he could be insecure to the point of vindictiveness if he was challenged, others described him as a nice guy with good intentions who was in over his head.\n\n\"He is a hardware guy. He runs a tight hardware ship,\" one engineer and former employee who worked closely with him told us. But the brain of a self-driving car is software, this person said.\n\nThis person said that meant Meyhofer lacked \"the understanding and know-how of the software space.\"\n\n\"Imagine a leader that can't weigh two options and decide the best course of action,\" described this engineer.\n\nEveryone we spoke with agreed that part of the problem is that Uber's self-driving-car unit was staffed by teams in two very different locations with two very different engineering cultures.\n\nThere was a team in Pittsburgh, anchored by folks from Carnegie Mellon's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), of which Meyhofer was an alum, and there were the San Francisco teams.\n\nThe San Francisco people complained that the NREC folks were a bunch of academics with no real-world, product-building experience, who retained their high-paying jobs by virtue of being Meyhofer's cronies. The NREC team saw the San Francisco engineers as whiny and ungrateful, people described.\n\nOn top of the infighting, there was a bonus structure that rewarded some employees for speedily hitting milestones \u2014 careful testing or not \u2014 multiple sources described.\n\n\"At ATG, the attitude is I will do whatever it takes, and I will get this huge bonus,\" one former engineer said. \"I swear that everything that drives bad behaviors was the bonus structure.\"\n\nIn its safety report, Uber said some of the ways ATG was measuring the progress of its program before the accident created \"perverse incentives.\"\n\nSpecifically, ATG, like everyone in the self-driving-car industry, believed that the more miles a car drove itself without help from a human, the smarter it was. But the whole industry now realized this is an overly simplistic way to measure how well a car drives. If management is too focused on that metric, employees may feel pressured not to take control of the car, even when they should.\n\nUber has since vowed to find other ways to measure improvement and tells us that milestone-based bonuses were limited to just a few people and have recently been eliminated.\n\nInternally, some remain frustrated with the self-driving unit.\n\nUber's ATG offices in Pittsburgh. Business Insider/Danielle Muoio\n\n\"Within ATG, we refused to take responsibility. They blamed it on the homeless lady, the Latina with a criminal record driving the car, even though we all knew Perception was broken,\" one software developer said, referring to the software that allows the car to interpret the data its sensors collect. \"But our car hit a person. No one inside ATG said, 'We did something wrong and we should change our behavior.'\"\n\nThe employees we talked to note that most of the same leadership team remains in place under Meyhofer, and some of them, like Hanson, have even been promoted. They allege that the unit's underlying culture hasn't really changed.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson said the company has reviewed its safety procedures, made many changes already, and is promising to make many more. It described them all in a series of documents the company published this month, as it ramps up to hit the road again soon.\n\nUber's has been using Volvo SUVs to test its self-driving technology. REUTERS/Natalie Behring\n\n\"Right now the entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in self-driving mode,\" the spokesperson told us. \"We have every confidence in the work they are doing to get us there. We recently took an important step forward with the release of our Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment.\n\n\"Our team remains committed to implementing key safety improvements, and we intend to resume on-the-road self-driving testing only when these improvements have been implemented and we have received authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\"\n\nThe Uber CEO's big ride-along never happened because of the March accident \u2014 at least not on any public roads. But that may change.\n\nMeyhofer and most of his closest lieutenants remain in charge of ATG and want to get their self-driving cars on the road again as soon as possible, before the end of the year, maybe even later this month, employees say.\n\nIn a September meeting of Meyhofer's senior leadership, the team was told: \"We need to demonstrate something very publicly by 2019,\" according to documents seen by Business Insider."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tanya Dua", "title": "Bank of America's CMO breaks down its new rebrand, including its biggest logo change in 20 years", "description": "Bank of America has kicked off a campaign to tout its new brand positioning and logo.

Microsoft employees also have special check-in lanes at the two airlines.\n\nHere's a look at the Delta check in:\n\nDelta's special check-ins for Amazon and Microsoft employees. Madeline Stone\n\nDavid Oppenheim, vice president of sales at Alaska Airlines, told The New York Times earlier this year that the lanes were intended to attract corporate travel managers, who look for \"special benefits for their corporate travelers that take some of the hassle out of flying.\"\n\nThe check-in lanes also speak to the power and influence that Microsoft and, especially, Amazon yield in Seattle. Amazon's growth in Seattle \u2014 as the company's size has expanded to more than 40,000 employees in the city \u2014 has transformed its culture and physical landscape.\n\n\"Amazon dominates Seattle, sprawling across downtown and upsetting locals with snarled traffic, soaring housing prices, never-ending construction, and accelerated gentrification,\" Business Insider's Harrison Jacobs reports. \"The city has seen an unprecedented economic surge, adding 220,000 jobs over the past decade.\"\n\nDespite the negatives, Seattle businesses have been eager to cater to Amazon employees. In addition to special airline check-ins, Jacobs reports that sex shop Fantasy Unlimited and strip club Little Darlings offer special deals for Amazonians.\n\nSex shop discounts are one benefit Amazon workers enjoy in Seattle. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nWith the announcement that Amazon's search for a second headquarters would end with new sites in Queens' Long Island City and the newly created area National Landing, Virginia, many are wondering how the e-commerce giant will exert its influence in the regions.\n\nMany people are already nervous. In New York, the news has sparked concerns regarding rent hikes, crowded subways, and crumbling infrastructure.\n\nBut, will it mean that LaGuardia Airport \u2014 located less than half an hour from Amazon's proposed office site in Long Island City \u2014 could begin roping off an area for Amazon workers?\n\nWith the TSA already keeping tabs on the impact of HQ2, the option definitely isn't off the table. Airlines' decision to create special check-in lanes for Amazon employees in Seattle shows the degree to which the company can take over a city, helping guarantee special treatment for workers. Representatives for Delta and Alaska Airlines did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment on whether similar check-in lanes could come to LaGuardia.\n\nWhile splitting Amazon's second headquarters may reduce the immense impact of HQ2, New York and Virginia have already offered tax incentives and other perks to win over Amazon. Soon, businesses may be doing the same to win over Amazon workers.\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tiana Attride", "title": "The 30 hottest countries on Earth", "description": "As winter sets in and temperatures begin to drop in the Northern Hemisphere, many people will start to dream about escaping from the cold.

Take the new iPad P\u2026 [+4529 chars]", "fulltext": "Apple is known for making expensive products, like iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe products themselves don't always start out costly, but one way Apple makes more money from them is by charging for added built-in storage.\n\nTake, for example, the new iPad Pro: The 11-inch tablet starts at $799 for 64 GB of storage, but if you want the maximum storage option \u2014 1 terabyte, or 1,000 GB \u2014 you'll have to pay $750 on top of that. You're basically paying for a second iPad.\n\nThe original iPad from eight years ago, by comparison, started at $499 for 16 GB of storage and could cost as much as $699 for 64 GB. These days, you're getting more storage than ever before \u2014 but it will cost you.\n\nApple's storage strategy isn't limited to iPads\n\nHere are the storage and pricing options for the iPhone XS. You have to pay $350, or one-third the price of the phone itself, to get half a terabyte of storage.\n\nApple\n\nAnd here's the storage and pricing for the new MacBook Air. You have to pay $1,200 more for max storage, but the computer costs $1,200 to begin with!\n\nApple\n\nAnd here's the storage and pricing for the new Mac Mini. You're paying $1,600 \u2014 or double the price of the Mac Mini, which starts at $800 \u2014 to reach max storage.\n\nApple\n\nYes, Apple's storage tiers have changed considerably over the years. For example, the maximum storage option for iPads in 2010, 64 GB, is now the starting storage option for the iPad Pro in 2018.\n\nThe math even sounds as if it favors Apple. In 2010, $200 gave your iPad only an extra 48 GB of storage. These days, you can spend $150 and get an extra 192 GB of built-in storage. That sounds pretty good!\n\nBut the historical context of Apple's storage pricing matters little in the end \u2014 customers will only care that Apple's built-in storage costs significantly more than what you'd find on the market in terms of external storage. Whereas Apple charges customers $750 to get a full terabyte of storage on their new iPad Pro, sites like Amazon and Best Buy list 2 TB external hard drives for as little as $80.\n\nThere are benefits to choosing Apple's built-in storage over external storage, of course. Built-in storage works faster and is generally safer to use, since improperly unplugging external storage drives can result in data loss or damage. But you'll find that many people are willing to sacrifice a little risk \u2014 and a little efficiency \u2014 if it means saving hundreds of dollars, especially when you're getting the same amount of storage at the end of the day for a fraction of the price.\n\nMy recommendation: As long as you're careful and patient, getting storage elsewhere can lead to some big cost savings.\n\nHow to get around Apple's limited storage\n\nIf you don't want to buy Apple's built-in storage, you can buy an external device, like a hard drive or a flash drive, that plugs into the USB port to give you more room for your files and documents. You can find tons of external storage options from Seagate, Toshiba, and SanDisk on Amazon, for instance.\n\nBut that's for Mac computers. Unfortunately, iOS devices like iPhones and iPads are incompatible with external storage. Even the new iPad Pro that launched this month doesn't work with external hard drives, despite the move to replace Lightning charging with USB-C.\n\nIf you want external storage that will work across your Mac computers and iOS devices, the best solution is cloud storage, which is pretty affordable.\n\nRead more: We compared Google Drive with Apple's iCloud and Dropbox to find the best cloud storage solution \u2014 and the winner is clear\n\nApple's iCloud and services like Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive are inexpensive or free, even if you need a ton of storage. iCloud is baked into iOS and makes it pretty easy to find and access your computer files \u2014 plus it's cheap, as you can get 50 GB of storage for just $0.99 a month.\n\nIn general, just consider how much storage you'll actually need before buying a new Apple device with a ton of built-in storage.\n\nYou may not need much. If you have an Apple device already, you can see how much storage you're currently using by visiting your System Preferences in iOS or the \"About this Mac\" page on your Mac computer. Then figure out how much more you need.\n\nSometimes the best solution is buying a big external hard drive with way more storage than you'll ever need and calling it a day. But you might also want to consider cloud storage, which costs a little bit each month but gives you access to your files from more hardware, whether it's made by Apple or not."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "California's biggest utility provider plunges after disclosing it suffered a 2nd outage as the deadly Camp Fire started (PCG)", "description": "California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire in its history broke out on November 8.

Long-term goals, he said, had yet to be established. The question echoed sentiments rippling throughout the nation: This mission seems to be ill suited to active-duty troops, who are barred from law enforcement in the US.\n\nThe encounter gained media attention as one of Mattis' usual attempts to justify unusual statements from his commander-in-chief, who had ordered the massive border deployment. Mattis' Pentagon was reportedly at odds with President Donald Trump, who called the migrant caravan an \"invasion,\" and other agencies.\n\nAt the White House's urging, the Department of Homeland Security requested that the Pentagon send armed US troops to the border to directly stop migrants, a request that Mattis personally rejected on the basis they were \"inappropriate and legally treacherous,\" according to the New York Times, which reported on these internal policy debates.\n\nThe border mission is hardly Mattis' first skirmish with his boss, who recently suggested that the revered retired Marine general is \"sort of a Democrat.\"\n\nLess than a year after taking office, Trump issued a series of tweets that reversed an Obama-era decision to allow transgender troops to serve openly in the US military.\n\nRead more: Trump tweets reveal plan to bar transgender people from serving in the military\n\nOn the heels of the announcement, and amid confusion across the country, Mattis tried to quell the controversy, saying his department would conduct a study to find the best path forward.\n\n\"In the interim, current policy with respect to currently serving members will remain in place,\" Mattis said in a statement. Some of the Pentagon's ban on service by transgender people has been overruled in federal court.\n\nThe former general also diverges from his commander in chief when it comes to support for NATO, which the president once called \"obsolete\" before reversing this stance as soon as three months later. Mattis has often stepped in to reassure the alliance that US support remains iron-clad.\n\nIn another instance, Mattis grabbed headlines when he stated the US military mission to Iraq was not an attempted oil-grab; this on the heels of an alarming statement from Trump to the CIA that \"maybe you'll get another chance\" to do so in Iraq, according to a Reuters report.\n\nThe defense secretary faced scrutiny when he seemingly reversed his stance regarding Space Force. His approach to the president's desire to launch a new military branch echoed that taken to head off the transgender ban: \"What I was against was rushing to do that before we could define the problem,\" he told reporters, denying he had reversed his position.\n\nMattis has had to defend his own positions from the president, whose comments have given rise to months of speculation that he was departing his post. When the president commented on Mattis' political affiliation in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Mattis again shrugged off the idea, telling the press he's never registered for either political party.\n\nRead more: Trump says Mattis is 'sort of a Democrat' and that the defense secretary 'may leave' the administration\n\nIn defending himself against his commander-in-chief's remarks, Mattis referred back to advice he's often given his own troops: \"We just continue doing our job,\" he told reporters.\n\nThat's exactly the stance he's taken throughout his tenure, trying to keep his troops and commanders focused on excecuting orders from the White House that have seemed unexpected and even erratic. So far, this seems to be his playbook for dealing with the president's orders: deflect the media, motivate the troops, and quietly wait for the next."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jennifer Still", "title": "7 hard truths about adulthood that my 20-year-old self would never have understood", "description": "The most powerful life lessons often come the hard way \u2014 through making mistakes.

He'd sold a miniseries on Emmett Till to HBO and was directing episodes of the Freeform series, \"Grown-ish.\" And it was on the set of that show a year ago he got the call: Sylvester Stallone wanted to meet about doing \"Creed II.\"\n\nCaple learned that Stallone had been sent a copy of \"The Land,\" Caple's debut feature about Cleveland stakeboarding teens with dreams of going pro, and was impressed. Caple also heard Coogler went out of his way to let Stallone, star Michael B. Jordan (who is also an executive producer on the movie), and the studio behind the movie (MGM), know that Caple was ready for the big time.\n\nThat part was a shock to Caple, since he had been hanging out with Coogler just days before the call and his friend didn't mention he was in the running.\n\n\"Ryan was on the Disney lot editing 'Black Panther' and I came in and looked at stuff, and we talked about sports and other things, but no mention of 'Creed,'\" Caple said. \"So after I got the call about 'Creed II,' I called Ryan and was like, 'You didn't tell me!' And he said he knew they were looking at directors, but he was excited for me.\"\n\nBut Caple was extremely nervous that because of his inexperience, he would be more susceptible to just going along with whatever Stallone, who also co-wrote the script for the sequel along with reprising his legendary role of Rocky Balboa, wanted to do.\n\n\"Creed II.\" MGM But Caple said those nerves quickly vanished when he got on the phone for the first time with Stallone.\n\n\"I thought I was going to talk to Rocky or Sylvester Stallone, but on the phone with me was a director and a writer,\" he said.\n\nStallone talked to Caple about the three-fight structure he came up with for the sequel that didn't just give a little homage to \"Rocky III,\" but also touched on \"Rocky IV,\" since the main plot point of \"Creed II\" would be Adonis Creed going up against the son of Ivan Drago, the man responsible for his father's death when they fought in \"Rocky IV.\"\n\nCaple loved what Stallone had come up with and instead of bracing for the point in the conversation when the legend told the newbie not to change a thing and just shoot what's on the page, Caple felt more like Stallone was pitching him to do the movie. That was especially true when Stallone told Caple what was needed to make the sequel as good as the first \"Creed.\"\n\n\"He said, 'I can't capture Adonis Creed's voice,'\" Caple recalled Stallone telling him. \"He said, 'With Rocky, I write all the dialogue, but you tell me where you want to go with the rest of the story and I'll do it.'\"\n\nCaple realized the trust Stallone put in Coogler to bring his beloved \"Rocky\" franchise to today's era of moviegoers in a believable way was now being passing to him \u2014 if he wanted it.\n\nCaple signed on.\n\nRead more: \"Creed II\" escapes the sequel slump with thrilling fight scenes and a gripping performance by Michael B. Jordan\n\nCaple said the script at first was just a straight revenge tale. Drago and his son, Viktor (Florian Munteanu), wanted payback for Ivan's loss to Rocky in \"Rocky IV,\" and Adonis wanted to avenge his father's death.\n\nIt was Caple's talks with Jordan that elevated the story with the parts that Stallone couldn't capture.\n\n\"When I listened to him I found parallels of Adonis and what he's going through in his own life,\" Caple said. \"Becoming the champ of the film world. I felt that was something we could play with.\"\n\nTheir talks led Jordan to open up about his own personal goals, and about running on the heels of the great black actors before him like Will Smith and Denzel Washington, while at the same time wanting to make his own mark. Caple felt that's also what Adonis is facing with the legacy of his father hanging over him.\n\nSo that became a theme in the movie. As Caple put it, \"rewriting last names.\"\n\nSteven Caple Jr. at the \"Creed II\" premiere. John Lamparski/Getty Now among the boxing matches and training montages that the \"Rocky\" fans crave, Caple felt he was bringing something fresh to the franchise that would give it some standalone qualities.\n\nIt also didn't hurt that throughout filming he would get little words of encouragement between takes from Stallone.\n\n\"We would be on set and Sly would say to me, 'You have something special,' I mean, talk about a boost of confidence!\" Caple said.\n\nAnd now the critics are beginning to give Caple a greater feeling that he pulled off a successful sequel, as the movie is sporting a healthy 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBut so far it's been the feedback of one person that has made Caple the happiest: Ryan Coogler.\n\n\"He had seen the movie while touring with 'Black Panther' and he called me and said, 'You did it,'\" Caple said while getting choked up.\n\nCaple also made a point of doing some shots in \"Creed II\" that mirrored similar ones his friend did in the first, like the point-of-view, behind-the-back shots that follow the characters.\n\n\"I wanted him to know I admire him as a filmmaker,\" Caple said. \"But him saying, 'This is yours,' that meant a lot.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Graham Rapier", "title": "Thanksgiving travel can be a nightmare \u2014 here's what time you should leave for the holiday to avoid traffic, according to Google data", "description": "Thanksgiving travel can be a headache \u2014 but the earlier you get on the road, the better, according to Google data.

The survey was sent out to all 2,170 crew members at Atlas Air, Southern Air, and ABX Air, via email.\n\nThese pilots don't work for Amazon directly.\n\nAmazon Air is a brand that operates through cargo airline subsidiaries of Atlas Air Worldwide and the Air Transport Services Group, including Atlas Air and ABX Air.\n\nAs part of the arrangement between these companies and the tech giant, pilots from these airlines operate Amazon Air's branded aircraft in order to make deliveries. Those airlines also cater to DHL, a division of the German logistics company Deutsche Post DHL. Southern Air, which is a subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide, flies exclusively for DHL.\n\n\"They have to start all over again at the carrier they go to,\" Captain Robert Kirchner told Business Insider. Ted S. Warren / AP Images\n\nSwitching airlines can set back a pilot's career\n\nThis isn't the first rumble from the pilots, though. There have been a number of strikes and protests. But the fact that so many pilots are considering quitting is still striking, according to Captain Robert Kirchner, Atlas pilot and executive council chairman of Teamsters Local 1224.\n\nThat's because the airline industry operates on a seniority-based system, he said.\n\n\"When a captain leaves here after 10 or 15 years, he or she is leaving 15 years behind,\" Kirchner told Business Insider. \"They have to start all over again at the carrier they go to.\"\n\nKirchner said even though a captain \"may be the most experienced person at the airline,\" they must start from the bottom when they join a new carrier. Moving around can therefore be detrimental to a pilot's career.\n\nKirchner said quitting an airline could amount to a \"big sacrifice\" and that he's seen captains with 18 years of experience walk away from Atlas.\n\n\"If you're a doctor or a business person, then you can go to another company and get your current job or higher,\" he said. \"In the airline industry, you can't do that. There's less pay, you don't get the schedules you want, you don't get the vacation you want, until you start getting higher up.\"\n\nThe survey indicated that morale is low among pilots at ABX Air, Atlas Air, and Southern Air. Michael Sohn / AP Images\n\nPilots are feeling 'disenfranchised'\n\nKirchner said Atlas' partnership with Amazon brought about an expansion that the airline couldn't keep up with. Amazon, which owns a 20% stake in Atlas and is one of its most important clients, could fix the problem by telling the airline to up its standards, according to Kirchner.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon Air told Business Insider that questions about the working environment at Atlas Air, Southern Air, and ABX Air could be directed to the airlines themselves, and said the company was pleased with the carriers' performance and ability to scale.\n\nBut Kirchner described an atmosphere of frustration and apathy among pilots.\n\n\"A lot of the pilots coming in here, because of that, feel disenfranchised and aren't committed to the business or to the company,\" Kirchner told Business Insider. \"They say, 'I'm only going to stay for a couple of years until I get my qualifications up. And then I'm going on to FedEx, UPS, United.'\"\n\nHe said Atlas currently has a \"tremendous turnover rate\" because the airline offers salaries and benefits that pilots say are beneath the industry standard. He said that 72% of Atlas pilots have been with the carrier for less than five years.\n\nWhen asked in the survey if they felt that morale was high among their fellow pilots, 86% of ABX pilots, 76% of Atlas pilots, and 51% of Southern pilots said they \"strongly disagreed.\"\n\n\"I've had crew members on my flights, and they'll just come out and tell me that they really don't care,\" Kirchner said. \"'I don't care about this company. I don't care if it survives. I don't care if Amazon's packages get to where they're supposed to go. I just don't care.' And that's a sad situation.\"\n\nA spokesperson at Atlas Air Worldwide said the company valued its pilots' right to express their opinions.\n\n\"The commentary from the pilot union, however, is part of an overall campaign to put public pressure on the company with respect to our next labor contract,\" the spokesperson said. \"The union's campaign has included the dissemination of false and/or misleading statements.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Air Transport Services Group said that the company appreciated its employees' professionalism and dedication.\n\n\"ATSG's airlines are currently at their target staffing levels, employing flight crews for all of the aircraft for which they are committed under commercial arrangements with their respective customers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"There's nothing like experienced employees,\" Kirchner said. Ted S. Warren / AP Images\n\nPilots worry about their airlines' ability to recruit and retain talent\n\nThe survey also found that 80% of the pilots strongly disagreed when asked if they were happy with their pay and benefits, while 91% said they felt their airline's pay and benefits didn't meet industry standards.\n\nKirchner said about 100 pilots quit Atlas in 2015. That number jumped to 198 in 2017. This year, Kirchner estimated that the number would approach 300.\n\n\"They tried to hire 379 pilots in 2018,\" he said. \"They only got 285 to show up to class, which is unheard-of in the industry.\"\n\nAt ABX, Atlas, and Southern, 81% to 87% of pilots reported that they strongly agreed that they were worried about their carrier \"being able to recruit and retain experienced pilots.\"\n\nIn the survey, 65% of respondents said they'd been asked to fly on their off-days in the past year. And Kirchner said Atlas pilots receive fewer vacations than pilots at their competitors when they begin working for the company.\n\n\"We've never seen this much flying on days off at the airline, which is further proof of how short they are in the pilot ranks,\" Kirchner said.\n\nKirchner said he didn't believe that the situation at Atlas Air or Air Transport Services would erode industry standards across the board. He singled out UPS and FedEx for providing their pilots with appropriate compensation and time off. And in the survey, 83% to 74% of respondents said they'd like to fly for FedEx or UPS.\n\n\"There's nothing like experienced employees,\" Kirchner said. \"Companies like Amazon and DHL need on-time, reliable service \u2014 and we're already seeing that deteriorate. As long as they keep turning a blind eye to this, the problem is going to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nHere's the full statement from Atlas Air Worldwide:\n\n\"We value the service of our pilots and appreciate their right to express their opinions. The commentary from the pilot union, however, is part of an overall campaign to put public pressure on the company with respect to our next labor contract. The union's campaign has included the dissemination of false and/or misleading statements. It also included an illegal slowdown that the union was ordered to stop a year ago by the U.S. federal court in Washington, D.C. That injunction remains in place today. As background, our business has grown substantially over the past several years, during which we have not only created hundreds of new pilot jobs but have also met our customer demands with highly reliable service. As our business continues to grow and develop, with opportunities to expand in existing and new markets, we continue to provide pilots opportunities for ongoing career growth and advancement. We will continue to address work rules, pay and time off with our pilots as we work through our contract negotiations. We remain committed to negotiating one competitive collective-bargaining agreement for all of our pilots in accordance with the terms of our existing labor agreements, which recognizes our pilots' valued contributions.\"\n\nHere's the full statement from the Air Transport Services Group:\n\n\"ATSG's airlines are currently at their target staffing levels, employing flight crews for all of the aircraft for which they are committed under commercial arrangements with their respective customers.\n\nWe appreciate the professionalism and dedication of all of our employees in providing the best possible service to our customers, and we make every effort, every day, to make that service even better.\"\n\nAre you a pilot working at Atlas Air, Southern, Air, ABX Air, or another airline that counts Amazon as a client?

Eleff wrote that his account was not the only account without a Tesla employee email address to have administrative access to the forums, potentially giving non-employees access to contact information for some owners.\n\n\"There are random people and ex-employees who can hijack Tesla's website and view the contact information of all of their customers,\" Eleff wrote. \"It seems crazy to me that a technologically advanced company like Tesla can have such a gaping security hole.\"\n\n\"The customer was inadvertently granted a higher level of permissions than he should have had to the Tesla forum, which is not connected to our vehicles, main website, or other digital channels,\" a Tesla representative said. \"We revoked the access as soon as it was reported, and made other changes to adjust privileges accordingly following a full audit. We have no reason to believe that there was any abuse of accounts or content on our forums, and we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again.\"\n\nThe representative added that some former Tesla employees had maintained administrative privileges on the forum after they had left the automaker, but Tesla did not find any evidence that any former employees had misused their administrative status. Tesla removed administrative access rights from the accounts of former employees and took measures to prevent former employees from keeping administrative access in the future, the representative added.\n\nHave a Tesla news tip?

It also follows Gavin Belson, the CEO of Google-esque mega-corp Hooli, who borrows attributes from real-life execs including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Oracle founder Larry Ellison.\n\nIn his blog entry, Gates says that he's one of the many tech execs who were consulted by the show's creators to ensure authenticity \u2014 creator Mike Judge and his production team have interviewed the likes of former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and investor Marc Andreessen, even embedding at a hardware startup to ensure that a running gag rang true.\n\nGates writes that all of that effort paid off, as the show is an accurate lampooning of the types of people and companies that he knows so well. He says that he identifies the most with Richard Hendricks, the founder of Pied Piper, \"who is a great programmer but has to learn some hard lessons about managing people.\"\n\n\"The show is a parody, so it exaggerates things, but like all great parodies it captures a lot of truths,\" writes Gates.\n\nRead more: The characters of HBO's 'Silicon Valley' are inspired by real people in the tech world \u2014 here they are\n\nSimilarly, Gates likes the way that the show depicts entrepreneurs and startups.\n\n\"Even a huge believer in technology like me has to laugh when some character talks about how they're going to change the world with an app that tells you whether what you're eating is a hot dog or not,\" he writes. That's a reference to an infamous \"Silicon Valley\" gag where a character makes a cutting-edge AI-powered app that can tell you, indeed, if something is a hot dog or not. The show's creators even released it as a real iPhone app.\n\nHe does have one bone to pick, though, with how the show depicts Hooli, the Goliath to Pied Piper's David, as bloated and inept.\n\n\"Although I'm obviously biased, my experience is that small companies can be just as inept, and the big ones have the resources to invest in deep research and take a long-term point of view that smaller ones can't afford,\" writes Gates.\n\nOf note is that while Gates may relate to the journey of Pied Piper, their stories are very different.\n\nThe fictional Pied Piper got off the ground after Hendricks and his friends quit Hooli to chase a novel new piece of technology; Gates and his late cofounder Paul Allen started Microsoft after moving to New Mexico to chase an opportunity with a then-revolutionary microcomputer. Gates and Allen definitely had their own problems, but they never had to fend off an angry ex-employer with an axe to grind.\n\nAlso of note is that not everybody in Silicon Valley seems to love the show as much as Gates. Astro Teller, best known as Google's moonshot boss, is said to have once huffed out of a meeting with the show's producers and tried to make a dramatic exit \u2014 on Rollerblades.\n\nYou can read Gates' full thoughts on HBO's \"Silicon Valley\" here."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meredith Guetig", "title": "IGNITION 2018: Hear from Match CEO Mandy Ginsberg on the $12 billion online dating market that she's tasked with defending from Facebook and Bumble", "description": "The online-dating market has been expanding exponentially in recent years, but it has yet to realize its full potential.

Philip Davidson, head of US Indo-Pacific Command, warned Saturday, according to Breaking Defense.\n\nThe deployment of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) is a part of a larger effort by the Chinese military to harden outposts and extend its anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities to limit military activity in the area while it attempts to project power at greater distances from the Chinese mainland.

If someone is crying, talking about a traumatic experience, or expressing their thoughts and feelings about a touchy subject, I would suggest listening and not changing topics at all,\" Jackson said.\n\nRegardless of the tactic you choose to employ to change the subject with tact, it's important to consider your own motives, Jackson said.\n\n\"Changing the subject just because you are bored is much different than avoiding a difficult conversation. If a person finds themselves always changing topics in conversations with people or have been told that they frequently change topics, then maybe there is an underlying issue,\" she said. \"Certain topics can be a trigger to some people and they may not even know it. It can be a subconscious reminder of some unresolved issues.\"\n\nOn the flip side, if you find others repeatedly changing the subject during a conversation, it's worth finding out why that's happening, too.\n\n\"I would say something like 'I see you keep changing the subject of our conversation, is there something about this that is making you feel uncomfortable?,'\" Jackson said. \"Although some may find it offensive, I think honesty is still the best policy.

Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven's Singi Down Jacket is that parka.\n\nHaving tested this jacket myself during an intense surprise snowstorm in New York City, I stand by the protective warm and durability of this jacket, and many other happy Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven fans agree with me.\n\nFj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven has been making outdoor gear that can handle the extreme cold and powerful snow of Scandinavia since it was founded in 1960. Skiiers, hikers, snowshoers, and adventurers of all types love the company's outwear because it is made to last.\n\nThe G-1000 canvas fabric on the outside of the Singi jacket is made from a blend of recycled polyester and organic cotton that's durable. You can wax it down for added water resistance or leave it bare for more breathability.\n\nThe jacket has a wealth of pockets, too, and they're roomy, so you can stuff your gloves, phone, sunglasses, and whatever else you need into them for safe keeping.\n\nTo keep you warm, Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven uses a mix of 80% goose down and 20% feathers for the 600 CUIN filling. Because the Swedish company is heavily focused on sustainability, the down is responsibly sourced. That means you don't have to worry about the maltreatment of the geese who gave their feathers and down for your warm.\n\nYou won't find real fur on this parka, either, which is a relief to animal lovers. Instead, the hood has a removable faux fur ruff that's of much higher quality than the scraggly looking faux fur you find on cheaper coats.\n\nEven though the build quality is exceptional, what really makes this winter coat shine is the attention to detail. Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven adds unique little touches to the design like its iconic fox design on the button snaps and arm patch. The leather zipper pulls are also imprinted with the little fox.\n\nThe shape of the jacket is surprisingly feminine, too, and it has drawcords so you can accentuate your waist and not look shapeless in the snowy weather. I love the extra details because they make the jacket stand out. The extra color options \u2014 like the deep reddish-purple garnet shade I chose \u2014 make a big difference, too.\n\nThe Singi jacket also happens to have the best hood I've ever found on a winter coat. It doesn't fall in my eyes, it stays in place, and it truly blocks out incoming snow and wind gusts. \u2014 Malarie Gokey\n\nPros: Sustainable down, rugged design, feminine fit, good color options, made to last, very warm, water resistant\n\nCons: Expensive"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "The Tesla of China spikes as short seller Andrew Left sees 'little resistance' for Nio to surge 60% (NIO)", "description": "Shares of Nio, seen as the Tesla of China, will rally to $12, Andrew Left's Citron Research said in a note on Monday.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nRent the Runway\n\nThe Rent the Runway pieces in your closet may only be temporary additions, but the rental market is clearly here to stay.\n\nAs it turns out, borrowing instead of buying designer clothes is a trend that shows no sign of going out of style. And as the pioneer in the space, Rent the Runway is continuing to introduce innovative new ways to bring more and more labels into the rental industry.\n\nThis month, the New York City-based platform is launching RTR Platform, a new way for brands to take part in the rental economy. Not only does that allow more designers to grab a piece of the ever-growing rental pie, but it also allows shoppers like you to pick from an ever-growing roster of tops, bottoms, dresses, jackets, accessories, and more.\n\nWith the introduction of RTR Platform, designers will be able to work directly with Rent the Runway in order to create a curated collection of pieces meant specifically for Runway customers.\n\nBefore the launch of Platform, COO Maureen Sullivan explained to Business Insider, the primary way the company secured inventory was by simply purchasing pieces directly from its 500+ designer brand partners. Now, Sullivan says, \"Our partnerships with designers, beyond just traditional wholesale relationships, are deeper partnerships; from creating capsule collections, to sharing insights on the designer's product in the rental ecosystem, to the designers creating exclusive inventory for RTR based on our data and insights, and our knowledge of what customers want to rent.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to succeeding in the retail industry, data is key. \"By partnering with the RTR Platform, [brands] can access invaluable data and insights around customer demand for their products in the rental ecosystem as well as item-level feedback on any product they put on the RTR Platform,\" Sullivan told us. This could ultimately have an effect on what brands ultimately decide to rent, and could even have an impact on their manufacturing processes and inventory assortments.\n\nWith RTR Platform, the curated capsule collections are brought directly into Rent the Runway, and the rental service becomes responsible for managing fulfillment, reverse logistics, cleaning, inventory care, and customer service. The revenues from any rentals are split between Rent the Runway and its designer partner, which ought to help designers generate an additional revenue stream separate from their traditional sales model.\n\n\"Rent the Runway has changed consumer behavior, with our subscribers now wearing rented clothing 120 days of the year,\" Sullivan said. \"We had brands coming to us asking how we could partner and help them enter the rental market. Currently, we have 39 brands signed on as part of Platform, with more being added every month.\"\n\nAs it stands, these 39 brands include J.Crew, Levi's, Club Monaco, Josie Natori, Prabal Gurang, Hunter, DL1961, Derek Lam, Jason Wu, Ralph Lauren, Rebecca Minkoff, L.K. Bennett and Marchesa. And by 2019, Rent the Runway expects that inventory from RTR Platform will account for nearly 25% of the company's total inventory.\n\nSo why the continued interest in renting?\n\nAs it turns out, customers tend to be a bit more adventurous with their rentals, displaying a willingness to try new things and perhaps deviate from the little black dress mold.\n\nAs Sullivan tells us, \"Only 20% of our rentals are in black, and more than half of our rentals are prints or embellished. Once a subscriber has unlocked the limitless closet in the cloud, she starts renting items outside her comfort zone. She tries things she wouldn't have bought because they weren't practical, and now she invests in good quality basics [instead of] spending her money on fast fashion.\"\n\nThis could be good news for young, innovative designers as well.\n\nWith RTR Platform, Rent the Runway is offering newer labels and lesser-known brands an opportunity to reach a larger audience \u2014 indeed, the company reports that 98% of subscription customers discover a brand for the first time through their rentals. \"In most cases, customers are not shopping by brand,\" Sullivan told us. \"As a result, emerging brands get as much exposure and attention as bigger brands. Our site is a source of discovery and exploration.\"\n\nAs the rental economy continues to grow, Rent the Runway may just have a few more tricks up its three-quarter length sleeve. Whether it's in the form of designer partnerships or a growing number of ways to rent rather than own, it seems as though Rent the Runway is ensuring its continued relevance in the fashion world."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alex Morrell and Skye Gould", "title": "Investment banks are waging a war for star talent in 2018.

This chart \u2014 which highlights senior hires and departures in 2018 \u2014 shows that Goldman and UBS have been the most active of the big banks, followed by Barclays.\n\nGoldman, the only bank to hire more senior bankers than it lost, according to our headhunter reports, has been particularly aggressive amid its pursuit of $500 million in additional investment-banking revenues by 2020. They've brought in at least 13 dealmaker managing directors in the US this year, many of them at the partner level, like ex-JPMorgan deal wizard Kurt Simon, who joined Goldman in August.\n\nSkye Gould/Business Insider\n\nKeep in mind that there are some limitations to these charts and data. First of all, they're not internal figures from the banks. Headhunters keep a great pulse on the most significant and notable moves, but it's possible that the bulge-bracket firms have made hires that slipped under their radar.\n\nAmid the turmoil at Bank of America, for instance, the firm has recently been pointing out that it has added nearly 50 managing directors globally in investment banking in 2017 and 2018, though it hasn't provided specificity beyond that overall figure.\n\nAnd on that note, our figures are only focused on the extraordinarily active year of 2018. But some banks may have gotten significant hiring out of the way in 2017. Citigroup, for example, hired more than 20 managing directors globally in its corporate and investment bank last year, including lifting a top consumer-retail team from Bank of America, which sparked a war for consumer investment bankers in early 2018.\n\nAlso, our figures are focused on senior moves, but not all managing directors are created equal. Losing a few underperforming managing directors and luring one true rainmaker would be a net win for most banks.\n\nThat's why Business Insider worked with senior headhunters to winnow that list of nearly 300 moves down to the 40 most significant.\n\nYou can check out that list here."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dave Mosher", "title": "NASA will dig for signs of alien life in Mars' Jezero Crater \u2014 the landing site for its 2020 rover", "description": "NASA has picked a landing site for its upcoming Mars 2020 rover.

Scott Rosenberg, an executive at Roku, expects the competition in that part of the market to only increase.\n\n\"I would say, broadly, consumers have so many more options now to watch longform, premium video in our living room, and so we all should expect that the traditional video distributors will feel compelled to compete more aggressively to keep consumer attention, and to compete at the price point that consumers are demanding,\" Rosenberg, the general manager of Roku's platform business, told Business Insider.\n\nRoku is commonly seen as the leading aggregator of OTT content, offering more than 5,000 channels for users who buy its set-top boxes. But new entrants to the aggregation business continue to emerge. Comcast, which doesn't have its own OTT service for US customers, is reportedly working on a set-top box for broadband customers that will aggregate OTT apps.\n\nThat offering would likely directly compete with Roku. While Rosenberg wouldn't comment specifically on Comcast's strategic decisions, he said he isn't surprised that traditional media distributors, like Comcast and AT&T, are starting to innovate with offerings similar to Roku to keep up with consumer demand.\n\n\"Consumers are asking for skinnier bundles and more varied bundles; they're asking for a better ad experience, they're asking for more apps, more content diversity, and OTT makes that possible. So I would fully expect that all of the traditional video distributors feel compelled to try and gravitate towards that user experience,\" he said.\n\nThe growing competition in this space is monitored by an industry that is curious to see what platform will win dominance. \"There's no shortage of people who have identified [aggregating OTT apps] as the next big thing,\" Alan Wolk, cofounder and lead analyst for TVREV, told Business Insider. \"Amazon and Apple want to do it. [Comcast] wants to do it.\"\n\nRoku's user base is its big strength, with 24 million active user accounts as of the end of the third quarter. Morgan Stanley analysts predict Roku will continue to pick up users over the next four years, but how much growth it can achieve is up for debate.\n\n\"Our bull case of over 50 million active accounts by [year end] 2022 would represent a doubling over the next four years, reaching >50% penetration of US broadband homes,\" the analysts wrote. \"Reaching these heights despite platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet's rising focus in TV hardware, software, and content, while incumbents like Comcast grow the OTT content distributed to its [approximately] 14 million X1 customers, will be challenging.\"\n\nRosenberg isn't overly concerned about the growing competition in this space. \"We've competed our whole lives here at Roku with big companies, inevitably companies much bigger than us,\" he said. \"We compete with Apple, Amazon, Google, we outperform all of them in unit sales and engagement with consumers in the TV market.\"\n\nAnd it's Roku's unique relationship in the industry that he thinks gives the company a boost.\n\nRosenberg said Roku is a \"relatively neutral entity in the ecosystem.\" He added, \"We're not typically vertically integrated into music or movie services, and as a result we have all the major music services, all the major movie services available in OTT, because we're a platform.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kate Taylor", "title": "These are the stores with the best Black Friday discounts", "description": "Black Friday means massive deals at retailers including Belk, JCPenney, and Kohl's.

That's because any sort of sell-off provided them with an opportunity to buy more exposure at a discounted price.\n\nIt was a strategy called \"buying the dip,\" and it worked swimmingly for years. That's largely because the market's underlying sentiment was overwhelmingly positive. Traders found comfort in knowing that, after the selling was complete, corporate fundamentals were strong.\n\nBut like all good things, it's come to an end. Now traders are left reassessing a newly uncertain investing landscape \u2014 one redefined by higher interest rates and slowing growth.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, the dip-buying extravaganza officially came to a screeching halt during the stock market's so-called Red October, which saw a wide range of sectors fail to recoup losses as quickly as they once had.\n\nThe firm points to the chart below to display this dynamic in action. It shows that buying the dip is at its most futile point since 2002.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThis all fits into Morgan Stanley's long-held view that stocks are mired in a \"rolling bear market\" \u2014 or a gradual wave of sharp selling that's infecting the market one segment at a time.\n\n\"Our view is that the market is sniffing out an earnings recession and a sharp deceleration in economic growth,\" Mike Wilson, the firm's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a recent note. \"The market is speaking loudly that bad news is coming.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley does note, however, that the rolling bear market it's been decrying for months is actually pretty close to being exhausted, at least from a valuation perspective. But Wilson warns that doesn't necessarily mean stock losses will suddenly subside.\n\n\"Now, we must wait for the earnings cuts which will dictate how much more downside is to come,\" he said.\n\nGiven this tricky environment \u2014 one that's challenging many established conventions \u2014 what's the most prudent next step for investors? Morgan Stanley says to forget buying the dip and try the opposite.\n\nTo Wilson, that means selling any rallies that transpire going forward and being careful about entering any new long positions.\n\nHe points out that while bull markets usually create traps in which strong-performing companies look poised for a reversal that never comes, bear markets feature the inverse \u2014 weak firms that appear spring-loaded for a rally that never transpires. That makes it even more important to make fully educated stock picks.\n\n\"Until we see buying the dip rewarded or earnings for next year reduced to a level that is achievable, we recommend trading like it's a bear market rather than a bull,\" Wilson said. \"If it looks like a bear and trades like a bear, then stop trading it like a bull.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Mara Leighton", "title": "Gymshark, the affordable workout gear company of gym-goers everywhere, just launched a huge Black Friday sale", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

While the company has promised improved site capacity, they were knocked offline for eight hours straight on Black Friday in 2017. So far this year, traffic problems have been solved with a few refreshes of the page.\n\nIts popularity on Black Friday is not surprising, especially when you consider Gymshark's affordability on an average day \u2014 let alone Black Friday. For staples like leggings, shoppers can pay as little as $35\u2014 or $15 during the Black Out sale. At other brands with comparably cult-like followings, the same shoppers might pay closer to $100.\n\nGymshark's iconic Flex Leggings are a steal at $38, but they're only $12 - $19 right now.

They're breathable, flexible, and no-nonsense \u2014 the high waistband is compressive and slimming and the seamless construction moves with you effortlessly. But they're also designed with a none-too-subtle hand to be extremely flattering and \"bum-contouring.\"\n\nThe company also does trends better than competitors. They charge less, and deliver more precisely. For example, the women's $46 Solace Bottoms (now only $14) are essentially high-waisted sweatpants, but they're designed to look like a slimming, body-contouring casual pant rather than your grandmother's shapeless parachute pants. There are concealed pockets, a fitted leg, a seam in the back that prevents unflattering bagging, and they cut off high enough to hit the part of the waist that is pretty much universally flattering.\n\nIf you want to get something for Black Friday, you should probably act fast.\n\nLooking for more deals?

To access public markets, and generate the currency needed to pursue acquisitions, these companies mostly go public on the CSE by merging with companies that are already publicly traded.\n\nThese reverse mergers have fueled a mergers-and-acquisitions boom as cannabis companies wield their stock in the race to build out their footprints \u2014 and create a moat around their business for when the northern invaders come.\n\nRead more: Marijuana companies are using a 'backdoor' strategy to tap the public markets \u2014 and it's fueling an M&A boom\n\nIn the other bucket are the big Canadian growers, such as Tilray and Canopy Growth. Cannabis is federally legal in Canada, so these companies are able to list on major stock exchanges such the Toronto Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq, giving them access to lots of liquidity.\n\nBrendan Kennedy, third from right in front, the CEO and founder of the British Columbia-based Tilray Inc., a major Canadian marijuana grower, celebrating his company's initial public offering on July 19 in New York. AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews\n\nBoth Canadian and US cannabis companies are raring to go once the US market opens\n\nUS cannabis companies operate in \"open defiance of federal law,\" creating an unsustainable long-term situation, said John Vardaman, a former Department of Justice attorney who's now the general counsel at Hypur, a fintech startup that serves the cannabis industry.\n\nFor that reason, Vardaman expects Congress to pass the bipartisan States Act, which would protect cannabis businesses from federal interference.\n\nAnd if the States Act passes, Canadian licensed producers signaled they would be ready to pounce.\n\nCam Battley, the chief corporate officer of Aurora, a Canadian LP, said his firm was ready to move into the US once federal laws change.\n\n\"You're seeing the American system really move quickly now,\" Battley said on the company's earnings call last week, referring to Michigan legalizing cannabis and states across the populous Northeast weighing cannabis legislation. \"My lips are wet, my mouth is watering to get a piece of that.\"\n\n\"Companies such as ours would deploy massive amounts of capital in one single location or two single locations in one or two states and quickly move that product from state to state,\" Brendan Kennedy, the CEO of Tilray, the largest cannabis company in the world by market cap, said on the firm's earnings call last week.\n\nThis, Kennedy said, would give Canadian companies like Tilray a distinct advantage over US companies because they're already publicly traded on major US exchanges, with deep balance sheets and access to a network of institutional investors.\n\nMeanwhile, US cannabis companies aren't able to ship product between states \u2014 even if both states have legalized cannabis. This ends up creating 33 individual state markets, making it difficult and expensive to streamline operations if cannabis becomes federally legal.\n\nThat puts US cannabis firms at a \"distinct disadvantage,\" Kennedy said.\n\nUS cannabis companies aren't backing down, however.\n\nAsked whether he was worried about competition from the Canadian players, Acreage Holdings' CEO, Kevin Murphy, said his newly public company had a \"balance sheet to match any balance sheet.\"\n\nWhile Murphy said all cannabis companies would benefit from changing legislation, he said he was \"angling to be in first place.\"\n\n\"And second place for us is the first loser,\" Murphy said.\n\nRead more:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Rachel Premack", "title": "The top 25 states where rich people give away the least money", "description": "Some rich Americans are more generous than others. 2016 tax returns indicate that the average person making more than $500,000 in the United States donated just under $74,000.

If you earn more than that (from self-employment or, if you also have a job, from the combination of your job and your business), then the 12.4% part of the tax that pays for Social Security stops for the year,\" Lisa Greene-Lewis, certified public accountant and tax expert at Turbo Tax, told Business Insider.\n\nThis deduction is available on Form 1040, so it doesn't need to be itemized.\n\nSelf-employed workers get other tax benefits that employed workers don't \u2014 like baggage fees if they are 100% related to business travel, Carla Wainwright, CPA and director in MAI Capital Management's tax department in Cleveland, Ohio, told Business Insider.\n\nAccording to Greene-Lewis, car registration on your personal vehicle is also deductible as an itemized deduction. If you bought a new car for your business in 2018, you may be able to deduct more than $40,000 of its depreciation in the first four years, she said.\n\nPost-college education expenses\n\nThe Lifetime Learning Credit allows taxpayers to deduct up to $2,000 a year, based on 20% off of the first $10,000 spent on education after high school, like a vocational or community-college class. It can be claimed for any post-secondary class you take; you don't have to be working toward a degree, Greene-Lewis said.\n\n\"In order to qualify for the Lifetime Learning Credit, you must have made tuition and fee payments to a post-secondary school (after high school) during the year,\" she added.\n\nHowever, this phases out as your income level increases.\n\nMedical expenses\n\nAccording to Investopedia, you can write off several healthcare and medical expenses if they're out-of-pocket and cost more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income \u2014 however, this limit will increase to 10% for 2019 returns.\n\n\"The tax law defines medical expenses as the costs for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease and for treatments affecting any part or function of the body,\" wrote Barbara Weltman for Investopedia.\n\nThis includes newborn costs, service animals, rehab treatment programs, organ transplants, attending a medical conference, adaptive equipment, diabetes-related costs, and more. Cosmetic-type surgeries and treatments aren't deductible.\n\nLast spring's state tax\n\nIf you owed taxes when filing your 2017 state tax return, Turbo Tax advises including that amount with your state tax itemized deduction on your 2018 return.\n\n\"If you paid state income tax when you filed your taxes and itemize your tax deductions this may still be tax deductible, but keep in mind when you itemize property, state income tax and sales tax is capped at $10,000 under the new tax law,\" Greene-Lewis said.\n\nEarly withdrawal penalty\n\nFind yourself in a tight bind this year and needed to withdraw money early from a retirement account or investment like an IRA or a certificate of deposit? You may be able to write off the penalty you paid come tax time.\n\n\"This applies to pension withdrawals before [age] 59 1/2, [but] there are exceptions \u2014 unreimbursed medical expenses, health insurance, [and] college costs, among others,\" Wainwright said.\n\nSelling your home\n\nIf you sold your home, you can write off up to $250,000 worth of profit \u2014 or $500,000 if married and filing jointly \u2014 under the new tax law, according to Greene-Lewis. If your profit exceeds either limit, the excess is reported as a capital gain on Schedule D.\n\nHowever, mortgage debt incurred prior to December 15, 2017, is eligible for interest deduction up to $1 million of acquisition debt (the old limit prior to the tax reform), according to Wainwright.\n\nGreene-Lewis said you must meet three tests to treat the gain from your home sale as tax-free:\n\n1. Ownership \u2014 you must have owned your home for two of the five years before the sale.\n\n2. Use \u2014 you must have lived in the home for two of the five years prior to the sale.\n\n3. Timing \u2014 you haven't excluded the gain on the sale of another home within two years prior to the sale.\n\nMortgage-loan interest\n\nIf you have a mortgage, you can also deduct loan interest up to $750,000, or $375,000 if married and filing separately, according to Greene-Lewis.\n\n\"The tax deduction for interest paid on home-equity loans and lines of credit used to buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer's home secured by their home loan is still tax deductible, but interest paid on the same loan used for personal living expenses like paying off credit card debt is no longer tax deductible,\" Greene-Lewis said.\n\nGambling losses\n\nYou can include gambling losses as miscellaneous tax deductions as an itemized tax deduction.\n\n\"If your losses exceed your winnings, the amount you deduct cannot exceed the total amount of your winnings,\" Greene-Lewis said.\n\nAlimony and legal fees\n\nYou can take a tax deduction for alimony payments, even if you don't itemize your deductions, as long as your divorce agreement was finalized before 2019, according to Greene-Lewis. Starting January 1, 2019, those paying alimony will no longer be able to deduct it.\n\nHowever, the IRS won't consider the payments as true alimony unless they're made in cash and required by a divorce agreement. Your ex-spouse must also pay income tax on the deducted amounts, Greene-Lewis said.\n\nYou can also write off legal fees paid to secure alimony for pre-2019 divorce agreements.\n\nState sales tax\n\nAccording to Turbo Tax, you can choose between deducting state income tax and sales taxes from federal income tax.\n\n\"In a state that doesn't have its own income tax, this can be a big money saver,\" it stated. \"Even if you paid state taxes, the sales tax break might be a better deal if you made a big purchase like an engagement ring or a car.\"\n\nHowever, you have to itemize for the deduction, which is capped at $10,000. The IRS has tables indicating how much a taxpayer can deduct in sales tax, but they have some exceptions.\n\n\"If you purchased a vehicle, boat or airplane, you get to add the state sales tax you paid to the amount shown in IRS tables for your state, to the extent the sales tax rate you paid doesn't exceed the state's general sales tax rate,\" stated Turbo Tax. \"The same goes for home building materials you purchased.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tyler Lauletta", "title": "Malcolm Jenkins flipped off his former coach Sean Payton after the Saints scored a touchdown on 4th down late in blowout win", "description": "The New Orleans Saints trounced the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.

The Saints were already leading by 31 points but faced a fourth down with six yards to go at the Eagles 37-yard line.

Sandberg admitted that she \"should have\" known that the firm was hired and the nature of the work they were conducting.\n\nFacebook cut ties with Definers less than 24 hours after The Times' story broke.\n\nThe Journal reported that many communication people on teams under Sandberg's watch were angry over Sandberg's comments, given how closely Sandberg managed Facebook's media strategy, even involving herself in wording changes.\n\nWith shares sitting at their lowest level in more than a year amid negative headlines, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, a longtime Facebook bear, said he expects more headwinds related to advertiser concerns about morality at Facebook.\n\n\"With Facebook, we expect more and more negative press to follow in months ahead on this specific matter,\" said Wieser in a note distributed on Sunday.\n\n\"Risks from immoral behavior at a corporate level are greater because they create the possibility that a brand could be tarnished by association with the media owner in the future and because it reduces the trust that must exist between different parties in order to manage commercial relationships.\"\n\nHe has a \"sell\" rating and a $125 price target \u2014 7% below where shares are currently trading.\n\nFacebook shares have been under pressure this year.

Shares erased all of their previous losses and rallied to a record high of $218.62 in July.\n\nThat was before its second-quarter earnings sent shares tanking by 20%. In a rare miss, the social-media company failed to hit Wall Street's expectations on sales, profits, and active users, and management warned investors revenue growth will slow down in the coming quarters.

The video went viral, having been viewed more than 6.5 million times as of early Monday.\n\nChipotle said in a statement Friday that the manager who refused to serve Ali and his friends had been fired.\n\n\"Regarding what happened at the St. Paul restaurant, the manager thought these gentlemen were the same customers from Tuesday night who weren't able to pay for their meal,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Regardless, this is not how we treat our customers and as a result, the manager has been terminated and the restaurant is being retrained to ensure something like this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nOver the weekend, however, many people came to the fired manager's defense.\n\nCritics of Chipotle's decision found tweets of Ali's (some of which are years old) that seemed to indicate he had a history of dining and dashing, a theft in which customers order and receive food without paying. The tweets, which Ali has since deleted, include one that says \"Dine and dash is forever interesting.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Chipotle said it planned to investigate further and might rehire the manager.

Incidents such as the arrest of two black men in a Starbucks and three black teens being accused of shoplifting by Nordstrom workers have drawn wide attention to the issue.\n\nA viral video showed the Philadelphia police arresting two black men inside a Starbucks as witnesses protested that the men \"didn't do anything.\" Twitter/@missydepino\n\nRead more: People are shining a spotlight on companies' racial discrimination after Starbucks arrests \u2014 here are 6 incidents that show how common the problem actually is\n\nStill, the Chipotle incident illustrates another side of the problem facing businesses.

These policies are meant to maintain employee safety as well as to prevent racial profiling of customers.\n\nBut they often mean employees see people they suspect of shoplifting allowed to carry on uninterrupted.\n\n\"It's so normal, it's ridiculous,\" a bra specialist who says she spots shoplifters daily at her job in a Victoria's Secret store in South Florida recently told Business Insider's Mary Hanbury.\n\n\"When I first got to this mall, I was like, 'Oh my God, this is crazy,'\" she said. \"And now I am like, 'Oh, OK, it's Monday.'\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meredith Cash", "title": "Wild high school football championship game features 3 TDs in final 40 seconds and a Hail Mary game-winner", "description": "Sunday night's Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) championship game proved to be one of the most exciting high school football games in recent history.

For him, being defensive means positioning yourself in risky corners of the market where you're getting paid for taking the chance.\n\nIn his view, US companies with high growth potential no longer offer such an opportunity. Investors have been willing to overpay for such stocks, notably in technology, but have recently started taking notice of the risk that these companies may not live up to expectations.\n\nGoing forward, he expects that instead of generating the huge returns investors have enjoyed throughout this bull market, earnings growth is going to slow.\n\nRead more: Morningstar's $207 billion CIO breaks down why investors have 'significantly overpaid' for the biggest tech stocks \u2014 and explains what they should be doing with their money instead\n\nApart from shedding US growth stocks, Needham is turning more defensive by cutting his exposure to high-yield credit and maintaining a reserve of cash.\n\n\"We've been looking for places that offer attractive reward for risk, and given the aggregate market has been getting less and less attractive, have had to look more and more at smaller markets and sectors to find opportunities,\" Needham told Business Insider.\n\nHere are the two standout opportunities he's identified:\n\n1. European telecoms\n\nTelecommunication stocks are broadly viewed as a defensive market play because they offer steady dividends, even though their growth is slower.\n\nHowever, they're also seen as capital-intensive and fraught with uncertainty about regulatory action. In the US, for example, the telecom sector was the market's biggest loser year-to-date before it was folded into the communications-services sector.\n\nThat's why investors have chosen to instead pile into companies with more spectacular growth \u2014 until recently.\n\nLooking into the European market, Needham found the fundamentals of the sector to be reasonable. Companies had increased their pricing power, and their competitive behavior in some of the core markets was fairer. In his view, this made the sector an attractive contrarian pick.\n\nHe also noted a key opportunity that exists in the rest of Europe and that UK telecoms companies already have: bundled packages that offer landline, mobile, broadband internet, and cable TV. When customers receive all of these services from the same company, they're less likely to switch providers, thereby creating a stickier base that creates more value over time.\n\nMorningstar's latest regulatory disclosures show that the firm owns Telef\u00f3nica, a Spanish telco, and BT in the UK.\n\n2. Russian stocks\n\nThe oil-dependent Russian market has been rocked by the US investigation into interference with the 2016 election and economic sanctions following the country's invasion of Crimea. That's why Needham was quick to acknowledge that the range of returns investors could earn by investing in Russia is \"undoubtedly wide.\"\n\n\"There are concerns around Russia, around the government's role and things like that,\" Needham said, \"But some of the cheapest companies in the world maybe can be found in the Russian stock market.\"\n\nBesides valuations, he noted that some listed companies in Russia have \"some of the best assets in the world,\" including companies that supply huge amounts of the gas that powers Europe.\n\nFor many such companies, Needham has invested through an active manager or by buying a broad market portfolio."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dakin Campbell", "title": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 big bet on the future of Wall Street had a rocky start.

One is the cost of healthcare. The second is the need for our members to have better access to care \u2014 and access to appropriate care, meaning that they get the care at the right place at the right time. The third is the need to improve quality of care.\n\nBII: What's led BCBS to focus on VBC?\n\nMS: It's from our history, deep into the local communities \u2014 we're in every zip code across America. Because of our close relationship with providers, BCBS companies have been moving into VBC for many years. That's important because it takes time with the data and the technology to begin to see the changes. There are markets where we're now seeing really powerful results from aligning incentives and working closely with hospitals and physicians.\n\nBII: How are providers responding to the shift toward VBC?\n\nMS: They appreciate it \u2014 we've learned this from talking to BCBS companies about providers' reactions in local markets. Value-based arrangements allow providers to step back and look at their referral rates and prescription rates. Are they in line with the doctors down the hall? Or doctors more broadly in that market? That type of comparative information is hard to get on a day-to-day basis. I think that's something they really appreciate and that's where our partnerships are mutually beneficial.\n\nBII: Have you changed your business structures to prepare for the adoption of new technologies?\n\nMS: Absolutely. Our local BCBS companies and our national association have hired additional data scientists because of the requirements for supporting an analytically-driven business. That's a big shift. We've also made sure we have the talent within the organization to integrate pharmacy into medical spend.\n\nBII: What's the future of VBC look like?\n\nMS: Consider that time is one of the major factors in seeing VBC reach its goals of cost savings and quality. Right now, you have a few models that have come to maturation, and many that are only in the development phase. I think that'll change \u2014 you'll have many models that will have emerged.\n\nBII: What's stopping the industry from realizing that future?\n\nMS: It's time, but not time as in having the days pass. What's happening in those days is changes in practice. Getting the right cadence to the data and information that's shared. Understanding which practices are optimal for a given physician practice. I don't think there are many systemic barriers [to VBC becoming more widespread] \u2014 part of the friction is simply that what we're trying to do is change health systems. When I say health systems I mean the entire system of healthcare \u2014 changing how that interacts to develop one that's more integrated.\n\nThat's a significant transformation.\n\nWant to read the full case study, along with the rest of our Digital Health coverage?"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Greg Magana", "title": "Amazon, Walmart, and Target are leading the toy race this holiday season (AMZN, WMT, TGT)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Google\n\nNothing says celebrating the holidays quite like celebrating consumerism, and here to help you do just that is Google.\n\nThe tech giant is offering a number of deals on some of its most popular pieces of hardware, so after the turkey (and your family) has been stuffed and all the pie has been eaten, you can move on to the real star of the show \u2014 the shopping.\n\nBeginning November 21, Google-owned Nest will be offering steep discounts on its entire range of products, including its smart cameras, smart doorbells, and of course, its original learning thermostat.\n\nAnd then, beginning November 22, Google will be putting its Home line on sale, with savings on the Google Home Hub, the Google Home Mini, the original Google Home, as well as its Chromecasts.\n\nWe'll also be highlighting Black Friday and Cyber Monday tech deals from Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Microsoft, Target, Walmart, and more stores. Check back here for the latest Black Friday deals.\n\nNest\n\nNest has come a long way since it was naught but an independent startup making smart thermostats. After being acquired by Google in 2014, the company has been busy at work producing a larger lineup of smart home products, and now, you can buy both indoor and outdoor cameras, a smart doorbell, a smoke and carbon dioxide alarm, and of course, a clever little thermostat from the brand.\n\nFrom November 21 to November 28, all of Nest's offerings will be on sale from not only the Google Store, but also The Home Depot, Best Buy, Lowes, Target and Walmart. The Nest Cam Indoor will be discounted $70 to just $129, while the Nest Cam Outdoor will be $50 off for $149.\n\nThen, there's the Nest Learning Thermostat, which will be $70 less than usual at $179, and the cheaper, newer Nest Thermostat E will be discounted by $30 to $139. The Nest Hello, the company's smart doorbell, will be $50 off for $179. Finally, the smoke and carbon monoxide detector, fondly known as the Nest Protect, will be $99, $20 off its list price.\n\nWe've been big fans of Nest products at Business Insider for years, and both their smart thermostat and their home security system frequently top our list of best options for your home. With prices discounted for Black Friday, this is probably the best time for you to take the plunge.\n\nStarting November 21:\n\nGoogle Home\n\nThe Google Home Mini will be just $25 this Black Friday. Best Buy\n\nIf you're looking for another way to make your home smarter, you may consider introducing a smart assistant to the mix.\n\nGoogle Assistant can be found inside a number of the company's smart speakers, all of which are on sale between November 22 and November 26. The Google Home Hub, the newest of the connected devices, is getting a pretty significant 33% discount, down to just $99 at the Google Store, Best Buy, Target and Walmart. Alternatively, all four of these retailers will also be selling the Google Home Mini for half off \u2014 just $25. Another great deal can be found in the form of the original Google Home, which will be heavily discounted to $79, also available from the Google Store,Best Buy, Target and Walmart.\n\nWith the purchase of a Google Home, you'll also receive an extended three-month trial of the new YouTube Music Premium service, which would otherwise set you back $10 a month.\n\nIf you're looking for additional entertainment, you could check out the Chromecast, which allows you to stream movies, shows, and more straight to your television for just $25. The souped-up version, the Chromecast Ultra, will be $20 off for just $49. The Ultra, unlike the standard Chromecast, provides fast 4K Ultra HD, and HDR content, for the true movie buffs in your life.\n\nOn the other hand, Google also has audiophiles covered with its Chromecast Audio, which will be nearly 60% off for just $15. This device, however, will be available only from the Google Store, Best Buy and Walmart.\n\nFinally, Google is offering a few bundled deals, like the Google Smart Light Starter Kit. This package comes complete with a Google Home Mini and GE's C-Life lightbulb, which promises to save the planet and your wallet with its energy efficiency. This bundle will set you back $31, down from $55. Alternatively, you could opt for purchase the Google Home Mini and Chromecast as a set for $45, which is admittedly a slightly less impressive deal (if you were to buy the two separately, you'd pay only $5 more). Still, a deal is a deal, and it's clear that Google is offering more than enough to go around this holiday season.\n\nStarting November 22:\n\nLooking for more deals?

Roughly 1.5 million children in the US are allergic to peanuts, an allergy that can often be so severe that even the smallest amount can set off an extreme reaction.\n\nIt's something companies are working to treat, by re-training the body's immune system not to overreact to peanut protein. That involves re-introducing it to the body, increasing the amount of protein over time.\n\nOne company just published some very promising results of a pill designed to lessen the severity of peanut allergies. But there are some big caveats to be aware of.\n\nThe company, Aimmune, found that of the roughly 500 kids with peanut allergies between the ages of 4-17 who were part of the trial, 67% of those who received the treatment were able to tolerate 600 milligrams of peanut protein \u2014 that's about two peanuts \u2014 after about a year of treatment. That's a much better results than in kids who got the placebo.\n\nThe drug is made of peanut protein, and the goal is to desensitize people with the allergy. The hope is to lessen the responses to an allergen, so instead of really intense reactions, you can take an accidental bite of a cookie or muffin, without needing to go to the hospital.\n\nBecause the drugs are essentially made out of peanuts, the journey to that tolerability can be tough. Lots of the kids in the trial experienced side effects. Aimmune's shares were down as much as 7% as of Monday morning.\n\nIn some cases, the reactions were severe enough to require an emergency injection.\n\nIn the group that received the drug, 52 of 372 people required an injection of epinephrine, the emergency medication found in devices like the EpiPen. And 43 participants who were receiving the drug withdrew from the trial because of side effects, while three participants in the placebo group did.\n\nRead more: The strange history of the EpiPen, the device developed by the military that turned into a billion-dollar business and now faces generic competition between Mylan and Teva\n\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay said in a note Monday that fears over the tolerability of the drug because of the epinephrine usage were \"largely overblown.\" For the most part, he wrote, epinephrine was given in mild to moderate reactions, with the exception of one given for severe anaphylaxis.\n\n\"We're optimistic given nearly all instances were for mild to moderate allergic reactions and not associated with anaphylaxis,\" MacKay wrote.\n\nAimmune plans to file with the Food and Drug Administration for a potential approval by the end of the year.\n\nEfforts to find new ways to treat extreme allergies like those to peanuts have been gaining traction in recent years. On November 12, Nestle Health Science made a $98 million investment in Aimmune, its third in the company. In total, the food giant has invested $273 million.\n\nAnd Aimmune faces competition from DBV Technologies, a company that failed a key trial for its peanut allergy patch in 2017 but still planned to go to the FDA for approval. It submitted its data to the FDA for a potential approval in October.\n\nRethinking food allergies\n\nWith these advancements in what we know about allergies and how to treat them, you might be asking: Could we one day cure allergies? The short answer is no, not exactly.\n\nThere are a lot of efforts going on to figure out whether the allergy can be prevented by exposing children to peanut proteins at a young age.\n\nOne major study from the UK found that by eating a peanut-containing snack, infants who were at high risk for developing a peanut allergy were able to prevent developing the allergy. In a study of 600 high risk children, only 3% of those who were exposed to the snack developed a peanut allergy, compared to 17% of those in the group that avoided peanuts.\n\nBut, of course, that still leaves 3%.\n\n\"As we learn more and more about that, and we begin to intervene earlier and earlier, are we going to cure allergy? Probably not, but perhaps in some of those kids but I would doubt in all of them,\" Aimmune's chief medical officer Dr. Dan Adelman, an allergist and immunologist, told Business Insider in January.\n\n\"There's always going to be room for a therapeutic intervention for those who still go on to develop allergy.\"\n\nInstead, former Aimmune CEO Stephen Dilly in January envisioned a future in which people living with allergies have what's known as \"functional cures.\" That is, they're able to live with the condition impacting their day to day lives too heavily. It might still mean avoiding peanuts or other allergens, but it might mean that the fear of accidentally coming in contact with it doesn't mean a trip to the emergency room.\n\nOr, for foods that are harder to avoid like milk and eggs \u2014 which can negatively impact on a person's overall nutritional health \u2014 it might mean getting to the point where people are able to reintroduce them into their diets.\n\nIt's what Aimmune's doing with its treatments.\n\n\"Can we get to that kind of level? That looks attractive,\" Dilly said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Steven John", "title": "The best travel strollers you can buy", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

In fact, if anything you need to trust your travel stroller even more than its workaday counterpart, because all the rest of your baby hardware might be across the city, state, or even back across an ocean.\n\nAfter experiencing a stroller all but fail on my family while we were in Europe on a vacation, I can tell you personally how important it is to have a great travel stroller. Thus I've put together this list of five options, each of which boasts its own specific merits and any of which will likely serve your on-the-go gang just fine.\n\nWhen choosing the best travel stroller for your baby or toddler, consider the child's size and age, the amount of weight you feel comfortable carrying when the stroller is folded, and the places you'll visit and the ways you'll get there. While all of the strollers on this list fold up easily, roll along smoothly, and enjoy excellent safety ratings, not all are suitable for the same uses and the same ages. But hey, that's why we feature options, right?\n\nHere are the best travel strollers you can buy:\n\nRead on in the slides below to check out our top picks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Ma", "title": "China sparks outrage for sentencing an author who wrote about gay love to 10 years \u2014 longer than some rapists get", "description": "A Chinese court sentenced an author to ten years in jail for publishing a book that \"obscenely and in detail\" described gay sex, state media reported.

The cars were simple, affordable, and utterly underwhelming.\n\nOver the next quarter century, Kia and its corporate cousin Hyundai have not only steadily improved their product offerings but also worked to chip away at any negative misconceptions the buying public may have held about Korean cars.\n\nThese days, Kia makes good cars and SUVs and stands behind them with a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. It's no longer a risk to own its vehicles; it's proved it can satisfy and delight American customers.\n\nBut the Stinger takes things to a whole new level, and that's why we've named it our 2018 Car of the Year.\n\nThis is easily the best car Kia has ever made, but more than that it's among the best cars of its type that we've driven. The comparison that jumped immediately to mind was the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio, a 505-horsepower beast that was a finalist for Business Insider's 2017 Car of the Year.\n\nObviously, the Stinger GT2 that we tested, at 365 horsepower, gives up a lot of ponies to the Giulia Quadrifoglio. But it has a similar light, sporty, vigorous feel, and arguably the horsepower is just right while the Giulia Quadrifoglio's is excessive. Plus, the Giulia Quad is almost $80,000, and you have to spend that much to get the twin-turbo V6 because the non-Quads give you only a 280-horsepower four-cylinder, at prices that compare to the Stinger GTs' (the Stinger can also be had with a smaller four-banger).\n\nSticker-wise, you might stack the Stinger GT2 up against the Audi S4, and the specs are similar. But the S4, while a nice ride, lacks the flair and panache of the Stinger. Yes, you could buy the S4 and be happy. But we'd rather buy the Stinger and be thrilled. (We also thought about the Stinger going up against the Acura TLX A-Spec, a previous Business Insider Car of the Year contender, but the Acura just doesn't have that juicy Stinger twin-turbo V6 going for it.)\n\nIt's an endlessly fun car, a literal joy to drive. It fires up with a pleasing snarl (OK, an augmented one, but still) and growls cheerfully when pushed. It's flat-out fast. The zero-to-60 time is supposed to be 4.7 seconds, but we thought it was notably quicker than that. And you have to watch yourself at cruising velocities, as the Stinger taps out the legal speed limit in a hurry but with such poise and relative quiet that one can easily overlook the speedometer.\n\nAs it turned out, the weather in the Bay Area while Matt DeBord was driving varied between lovely and rainy, so he had the chance to vindicate the AWD system. We wouldn't pay the extra thousands for it, but it performed capably. Generally speaking, torque vectoring favors the rear wheels and sends grab to the front only if you need it.\n\nSome reviewers have complained that the Stinger suffers from body roll, which is when the car leans while turning. But we didn't notice much of that. Nor could we wring much turbo lag out of the engine.\n\nWe found the paddle shifters to be a bit ticky-tacky, so we mostly skipped them. As a result, in Sport mode while letting the eight-speed auto shift gears, some firm downshifts could be felt \u2014 that may bother some drivers, but we consider it in the spirit of what Sport mode should be all about.\n\nThe brakes are nice, beefy Brembos, and they keep the Stinger in check. We gave them a workout on the twisting roads around Deer Creek and the mean streets of the island of Manhattan. But where we genuinely enjoyed the Stinger the most was on the highway: It's supposed to be a gran turismo, a touring car, designed to recall a time when well-heeled European couples saddled up their elegant GTs and set their sights on beachfront enclaves. The Stinger is a car that craves a weekend trip to someplace nice.\n\nSome reviewers have also complained that the interior isn't really all that luxurious. It isn't. So what? Do you want to rub the leather all day or drive the car? We looked forward to savoring the Stinger's beauty \u2014 and having it envelop us when we slipped inside.\n\nIt was lovely. The audio system sounds great. The seats are fine, heated and cooled (so was the steering wheel). We can live without race-car bolstering and open-grain wood trim.\n\nMatt declared that he would buy this car tomorrow without hesitation if he were in the market for a sporty four-door. Ben shared that sentiment. We'd skip the AWD to get the price down closer to $40,000 and laugh at all the Audis and BMWs because our car would be just so, so, so much hipper.\n\nA brilliant risk for Kia, and one that should be brilliantly rewarded."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kif Leswing", "title": "Tim Cook's daily routine starts by getting up at 4 a.m. and reading user comments for an hour (AAPL)", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook gets up every morning before 4 a.m. and reads comments from Apple users for an hour.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here.\n\nA growth in the demand for low-cost investment services in the UK is driving new investor uptake in fintech robo-advisors, according to Boring Money research. Through Q3 2018, 800,000 new DIY investment accounts \u2014 where customers decide on investment choices without the help of financial advisors \u2014 were opened in the UK.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nOf those new account openings, a third were with one of the UK's leading fintech robo-advisor operators, including Nutmeg and Moneyfarm, compared with 11% a year ago. The total number of DIY investment accounts, inclusive of customers of robo and traditional platforms, rose to 4.8 million in the same period \u2014 a 22% uptick.\n\nBut fintechs are some distance away from disrupting incumbents. While fintechs have posted impressive customer acquisition numbers, incumbent fund supermarkets have grown their market shares across the last 12 months. In the last three years, 20% of new non-advised customers opened accounts with incumbent fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, which dominates the UK's online DIY investment market with a 42% share.\n\nTogether with Interactive Investor, which acquired Alliance Trust Savings to grow its own market share to 13%, the two incumbents control over half of the UK's DIY investment market. Such is the gulf between fintechs and incumbents in the space: Hargreaves' \u00a394 billion ($120 billion) in assets under management is 31 times larger than the combined assets of all UK robo-advisors, per The Financial Times. This suggests that despite the early success of fintech robo-advisors, the story is not as triumphant as it might seem, according to Holly Mackay, founder and CEO of Boring Money.\n\nFintechs need to convince customers to increase deposits if they truly expect to disrupt incumbents.Startups in the space have gained traction by slashing investment fees and charges commanded by incumbents, allowing them to attract those with smaller investment capital \u2014 Nutmeg, which has 60,000 customers, doubled its account numbers between 2016 and 2017, for example.\n\nHowever, on average customers of these startups tend to have considerably smaller portfolio sizes, \u00a310,485 ($13,440), compared with the DIY market average of \u00a347,000 ($60,249). So, the likes of Nutmeg and Moneyfarm have opened up the investment market to those previously underserved. If fintechs wish to capitalize on their growing investor numbers and disrupt incumbents in earnest, it's vital they persuade customers to grow amounts invested \u2014 by attracting their pension assets, for instance.\n\nSeparately, incumbents like Fidelity, the third biggest DIY investment platform in the UK, would be wise to consider partnering with fintechs, for example. Such partnerships could help fintechs thrive while helping the likes of Fidelity narrow the gap on market leaders."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Lauren Johnson", "title": "Direct-to-consumer brands are demanding accountability from the ad industry, and it could finally shake up how agencies and TV networks work", "description": "From specialized agencies to new TV programs, the ad industry is courting direct-to-consumer brands.

Or 'are we going to see some big brands go away and these are the replacements?'\"\n\nHowever, DTC brands do not have deep pockets for marketing, meaning that winning business from the group of brands won't necessarily turn around sluggish ad markets and returns.\n\n\"There's no question that these are not companies that will spend seven figures for creative, which is table stakes for so much of the large agencies. It will not make substantial media budget commitments, which is table stakes for the large holding company media agencies \u2014 the budgets grow with sales,\" Morgan said.\n\nThe TV industry needs to get shaken up to bring in small advertisers\n\nAcross the board, DTC brands are becoming less reliant on Facebook and digital platforms and are eyeing traditional media like TV, out-of-home, and print. But purchasing and measuring a TV spot is expensive and dominated by media buyers with deep expertise and lots of money.\n\nLast week, NBCUniversal and ad agency Giant Spoon partnered to launch a program designed specifically to make that process a little bit easier.\n\nNBC's \"This Is Us\" NBC\n\nWorking together, NBCUniversal and Giant Spoon will offer DTC brands joint resources for media strategy and planning resources for TV and digital video.

Morgan said that when DTC brands started coming to Simulmedia a few years ago, without an agency or the big budgets that were required to buy national TV ads, the firm would tell them to come back once they were bigger, but quickly realized that it was a bigger trend across several DTC brands.\n\n\"We thought 'they'll just grow up and graduate to working like we had with the Home Depot or a Walmart,'\" Morgan said. \"Then it really hit home a year and a half ago that it was going to take a fundamentally different product and approach.\"\n\nIn one example, DTC brands wanted to see daily reports of the performance of their ads when Simulmedia was used to doling out weekly reports for other clients, he said.\n\nAnd while other big brands work to fine-tune their targeting, DTC brands experimenting with TV ads do not necessarily want their spots to be targeted. Instead, they wanted ads to widely air so that they could then analyze which spots were performing the best.\n\n\"They wanted campaigns that would start very broadly early so that they could learn \u2014 it ultimately starts really cheap because if you're doing a lot of targeting, it's going to be more expensive because you're limiting the delivery,\" Morgan said.\n\nPublishers are also feeling the heat\n\nFor years, publishers have pitched labor-intensive and pricey native ads with the goal of mimicking either editorial content or high-quality work produced by big agencies. But because both direct-to-consumer brands and are focused on sales, publishers have begun to retool their native advertising businesses to include more data and results.\n\n\"So much of advertising is moving to the bottom of the [sales] funnel now,\" said Ian Schafer, a former agency exec who founded ad agency Deep Focus. \"With the explosion of direct-to-consumer brands, [their] ad spend has gone towards customer acquisition.\"\n\nAn ad for Casper Casper\n\nIt could be tough to get the ad industry to change how it works\n\nWhether or not big advertising partners can win over DTC brands remains to be seen, but it will be intriguing to see how ad partners choose to set up plans for working with DTC brands.\n\nUnlike how many agencies and publishers operate, DTC brands rarely have put out requests for proposals (or RFPs) because it requires them to earmark a certain amount of ad spend for the future, said JB Osborne, CEO and cofounder of Red Antler, a Brooklyn-based agency that specializes in working with startups and direct-to-consumer brands.\n\n\"If you're planning out your budget and marketing and media spend a year ahead and you're committing to what you're going to do, that doesn't put you in a position to be thinking in real time,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alan Dawson", "title": "LeBron James rammed home 51 points for the LA Lakers to punish his former team Miami Heat", "description": "LeBron James played the game of his season as he tallied 51 points in a dominant win on Sunday.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nHP told me that they want the computer back when I'm done testing it. And, I'm going to be sad to see it go. Best Buy\n\nI'm a simple man. When it comes to computers, I don't want to have to shop for the best monitor, tower, and components separately. I want a single unit that has all of the best in one package, and I don't mind paying a little bit more for this convenience. I've used all-in-one (AIO) computers throughout my work-from-home career.\n\nWhen my AIO was starting to slow down after five years of service and reinstalling the operating system didn't fix things, I reached out to HP to see if they would let me test their HP Envy 34\" Curved AIO.\n\nHere are my experiences with it.\n\nMy first experiences with the HP Envy 34\" Curved\n\nOne of the most impressive features of the HP Envy Curved is the 34\" UWQHD LED screen. Since screens are always measured on the diagonal, it's worth noting that the dimensions are 13-1/8\" tall by 31-1/2\" wide. The resolution is 3440 x 1440 (21:9 aspect ratio).\n\nHere are a few of the other important specifications you should know:\n\nThe operating system is Windows 10\n\nThe graphics are AMD Radeon RX 460 driven by 4GB GDDR5 SDRAM\n\nThere is a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) and 1TB of hard drive storage\n\n16GB RAM\n\n7th generation Intel Core i7-7700T quad-core processor\n\n4 USB 3.0 ports\n\nHDMI in and out ports\n\nSD card slot\n\nHeadphone jack\n\nEthernet port\n\nIf I didn't list a spec you were looking for, you can find more info on the Best Buy product page.\n\nIf none of the above makes much sense to you, just know that this machine has all of the makings of a workhorse. The graphics are enough for most tasks, save heavy gaming. You will have a hard time filling up all of that storage, and if you do, you probably know about the cloud or external hard drives. And, the 16GB RAM and quad-core processor are ideal for chronic multitaskers.\n\nSetup time was relatively fast. After 18 minutes of unboxing, logging in, installing updates, saying I didn't want to sign up for any newsletters or special offers, and choosing other preferences, I was ready to put that massive screen and computing power to work.\n\nRead more: The best all-in-one PCs you can buy\n\nEssentially, the big curved screen is like having two monitors. Best Buy\n\nHow the HP Envy Curved performed\n\nThe hardest feature to get used to was the size of the screen.\n\nIt tilts and has an attractive curve, but it was a bit much to take in. Once I realized that I didn't need to sit so close to it, the display became a bit more manageable. Essentially, it is like having two monitors. As a writer, I like to be able to see what I am working on while also viewing a few windows of research materials. The 34\" screen helped immensely with this and saved me from jumping from one tab to another, which could potentially lure me into a social media wormhole.\n\nThe camera can be pushed down into the monitor if you are concerned about hackers gaining access and seeing what you are up to. However, you still need to pop the camera back up if you want to log in using face recognition.\n\nSpeaking of the face recognition, initially, I had it analyze my face when I had a substantial beard. After I shaved, it no longer recognized me. To be fair, my friends have the same problem. If the PC doesn't recognize your face, you can still log in with a PIN.\n\nThe sound is delivered from front-firing quad speakers in the soundbar at the front of the computer's base. The Danish high-end electronics firm Bang & Olufsen is the brains behind the audio. The base is outfitted with touch controls that allow you to play, pause, and adjust the volume of your media without touching the keyboard or mouse. As a sloppy person with a cluttered desk, I accidentally hit the controls on several occasions so I disabled it. However, it did function flawlessly up until I gave it the ax.\n\nOverall, the audio quality is impressive.\n\nThe bass isn't earth-shattering due to the size of the speakers, but the sound on all levels is incredibly clear. I got a reading of 99 decibels approximately 12\" from the speakers when blasting some tunes. So, it should be sufficient for rocking out or getting wrapped up in action movies.\n\nOne morning, I tried to play some background music while working, but the HP Envy told me that I didn't have speakers. It didn't recognize their existence. So, I clicked on the little blue and white question mark icon in the lower right to launch HP Support Assistant. I was instantly messaging with Prachi, a support representative, who let me know that the root of the problem was a Windows 10 update that had some configuration and compatibility issues with the Realtek sound card. I gave him control of my computer, and after reinstalling the sound driver, I was able to play Brian Eno.\n\nThis was my only experience with the HP customer support, and I was impressed that they were able to fix my problem in under 10 minutes with minimal effort on my part.\n\nLastly, I tested the HP Envy 34 using the UL PCMark 10 test, which is considered the industry standard for PC performance for Windows 10 machines.\n\nJames Brains/Business Insider\n\nOverall, it scored 4,631, which is better than most PCs, very good for AIOs, but not as good as the high-octane gaming consoles or graphics-editing computers. However, it did score quite high for productivity (7,145) and essentials (8,374), such as app start-up, video conferencing, and web browsing. Visit the PCMark website to learn more about this benchmark test.\n\nRead more: This $250 home security system has made living in a high-crime area less stressful for my family\n\nSome concerns about the computer\n\nI really didn't like the wireless keyboard and mouse that came with the HP Envy Curved. There seemed to be some disconnect between how the keyboard communicated with the computer because it would occasionally register several keystrokes when I only pressed the key once. This was endlessly frustrating so I ditched the keyboard pretty early on in the testing. I used the mouse throughout the testing, but quite often, it would register right clicks as left clicks, even when I clicked as far to the right as possible.\n\nI was annoyed by the number of emails and offers that followed the onboarding process. Also, there are a lot of unnecessary programs that come on the computer, which are easy enough to remove but annoying. If you spend $2,000 on a computer, you shouldn't have to deal with having additional sales pitches or items thrust upon you. Then again, maybe some buyers look for these \"perks.\"\n\nAll of the USB 3.0 ports are located in the back of the computer's base. This can be a pain to access at times, especially if you have your PC against a wall.\n\nMy last concern is that there is no CD/DVD drive. Many of us still have these discs and would like to listen/watch them on our fancy computer. A disc drive would also have saved me a couple of minutes setting up my printer. Instead, I had to download the drivers online.\n\nThe hardest feature to get used to was the size of the screen. Best Buy\n\nBottom line\n\nHP told me that they want the computer back when I'm done testing it. And, I'm going to be sad to see it go.\n\nThis is an awesome machine. A good test of whether I would recommend a product is if I would replace it if it were to disappear tomorrow. Since I don't have the income to spend more than $1,000 on an AIO, I probably would not. But, if I came into a little extra money, this would be at the top of my list of items to buy. It is worth the price tag, and I'd be hard-pressed to find a PC that more closely meets my needs.\n\nThat said, I strongly recommend the HP Envy 34\" Curved All-In-One if you are looking for a computer that can handle excessive multitasking, stream crystal clear video, perform actions faster than you can click a mouse, and you have a generous budget."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "David Anderson and Shira Polan", "title": "There's a shady market for breast milk in the US where parents risk buying contaminated milk", "description": "Breast milk is a huge commodity for parents who cannot breastfeed.

It has over 200 milk banks nationwide, the highest of any country. But here's the weird part, while the US has over one and a half times the population of Brazil, it only has 24 milk banks, which distribute less than six million ounces of breast milk a year. And that's a serious problem, since intensive care units alone demand over 63 million ounces annually, so parents of healthy babies need to find another way to feed their kids and will turn to other, more obscure sources.\n\nOf course, many parents have a built-in supply of breast milk, free of charge. But not everyone can breastfeed. This might be because they don't produce enough on their own, their work schedule leaves little time for breastfeeding, or they simply don't have breasts in the first place. In fact, only an estimated 26% on North Americans exclusively breastfed. So if you're short on breast milk, many parents will head to groups like Human Milk 4 Human Babies, which connects milk donors with milk seekers. In this case, helping over 20,000 community members in 52 countries. But there's still not enough milk to go around.\n\nThat's where online marketplaces come in. On ad classified sites, like Only The Breast, and Breast Feeding Moms Unite, people sell their milk for around two dollars an ounce. That's a bargain compared to over four dollars that milk banks will charge. But this is a case of you get what you pay for, because the milk you might receive, may not be 100% human. In a 2015 study, for example, researches ordered milk from an anonymous online market.\n\nThey tested the contents of each sample and discovered that one in every 10 samples was contaminated with cow's milk, and by a significant amount too. The contaminated samples contained about 10% cow's milk. That's a lot more than a few drops. Moreover, a 2013 report found that 74% of milk from online markets contained harmful bacteria, which probably came from poor collection, storage, or shipping.\n\nAll this begs the question, why go through the hassle and risk, when you can easily grab some baby formula at your local grocery? Well, formula just doesn't cut it. Human breast milk is jam-packed with brain developing nutrients, disease-fighting antibodies that jump-start the immune system, and helpful bacteria that rev up the babies own gut flora. But baby formula has no antibodies or bacteria and that can make a huge difference.\n\nResearches calculated that over 800,000 formula-fed infants who die each year worldwide, could have been saved by breastfeeding. So parents are caught between a rock and a hard place. Formula or mystery milk?

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen the novice home chef hears the term sous vide, they often assume it's some fancy cooking technique that they could never possibly grasp. Think again. Despite the bourgeois-sounding name, which means \"under vacuum,\" sous vide cooking makes delicious gourmet meals incredibly simple as long as you have plenty of time.\n\nSous vide cooking is basically a more delicious alternative to using a traditional slow cooker. At its most basic, you pop the ingredients into a plastic bag, remove as much air as possible, seal it up, and cook the food in a water bath at a consistent temperature for several hours.\n\nGramercy Kitchen Company was started by a small family looking for a healthier, more delicious alternative to your typical slow cooker as they tried to make dinner day in and day out while working 9-to-5 jobs. They sent me their immersion circulator for free to test out. Below are my experiences with it.\n\nMy first experiences with the Gramercy Kitchen Co. Immersion Circulator\n\nAmazon\n\nWhat struck me first about the Gramercy Kitchen Co. Immersion Circulator is its large size. It's about 2-3/8\" in diameter and 14\" long. The circulator comes with a black velvet storage bag, which piques the interest of everyone who sees it hanging in my kitchen: \"What's in the velvet bag?\"\n\nWithout reading the directions, I was able to have the device up and running in about five minutes. The buttons and dial are just that intuitive. First, you press the temperature button to scroll to the temp you want. Next, scroll to the time you want, up to 99 hours. Then, press the play button. Voila!\n\nThanks to the adjustable clamp, you can use the Gramercy Kitchen immersion circulator in just about any container you want. And, it heats up to 15 liters of water at a time. For maximum affordability and efficiency, I used an Igloo Island Breeze Cooler and drilled a hole in the top that was just big enough to fit the sous vide cooker through. YouTube is full of great tutorials on how to do this.\n\nRead more: The best sous vide machines you can buy\n\nHow the Gramercy Kitchen Co. Immersion Circulator performed\n\nWhat I like most about sous vide cooking is that I can take a cheap cut of meat and turn it into filet mignon\u2026 or, at least, a worthy substitute. I started with a top round beef roast cooked at 132 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours. Afterward, I put the vacuum-sealed bag of meat in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Then, I heated some olive oil in a cast iron skillet until it was piping hot \u2014 turn your fans on and open the windows \u2014 and seared the roast for a minute or so on each side. The results were tender and juicy.\n\nI had similar tender experiences with chicken, salmon, lamb, pork chops, and pulled pork. I also used the sous vide for reheating frozen leftovers I had vacuum sealed. It did a lot better job than the oven, microwave, or stove because you didn't lose moisture in the reheating process. I'm still trying to master vegetables. I tried asparagus and carrots with underwhelming results.\n\nBefore I get into the quasi-scientific testing, one other family favorite with the sous vide was making caramel, or dulce de leche. I vacuum sealed an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk and heated it at 185 degrees Fahrenheit for 12 hours. Carefully open the can, and it's full of delicious caramel.\n\nThe Gramercy Kitchen Co. Immersion Circulator has a temperature range of 104 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit. I found that it stayed within a few degrees of the target temperature, which is more than the claimed \"+/-0.1 degrees Celsius,\" but close enough for most cooking jobs.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Wirecutter created a benchmark test for sous vide cookers that I decided to steal.\n\nI timed how long it takes this circulator to get 6 quarts of water from 69 degrees Fahrenheit to 135. It was about 21 minutes, which is not bad. I used a kitchen thermometer probe to take secondary temp readings, and I found that the readings on my thermometer were almost exactly the same as what the immersion circulator was showing. So, we can assume it's accurate.\n\nThis sous vide machine runs quietly. The ambient noise in my house is about 41 decibels, and the sound of the unit was 49 decibels when measured from 12\" away. This is similar to what you find with the more popular models.\n\nSince some meals can take a day or more, it's important for an immersion circulator to start right back up after losing power. I inadvertently tested this in my kitchen, where running multiple appliances on a single outlet will trip the circuit breaker. When the power failed, the Gramercy Kitchen Co. unit picked up right where it left off once I reset the breaker.\n\nRead more: 30 appliances and tools that we swear by in the kitchen, from a $6 fish spatula to a $340 Dutch oven\n\nSome concerns about the sous vide machine\n\nMany of the most popular sous vide models these days feature Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity. The Gramercy Kitchen Co. cooker does not have either. It's not a \"smart\" device. There is no app. The connectivity would be nice for monitoring my meal from afar, but I really didn't miss it. Gramercy does this on purpose because they want to keep the device as simple as possible.\n\nThe device allows you to set the temperature in intervals of 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit, which is odd. If you want to heat the water to 135 degrees, you can choose between 134.6 and 135.5 degrees. You can't set it to anything between those two. If you switch to Celsius, the interval is 0.5 degrees, which makes a lot more sense. Unfortunately, most of the recipes I saw were in Fahrenheit. This wasn't a major problem, just a minor annoyance.\n\nAs with any sous vide, it's hard to tell if the food is ready or not. You're basically going strictly by time and past experience. Ideally, you could pop a true wireless meat thermometer into the vacuum-sealed bag with your food and take readings as you go, but that technology isn't quite there yet.\n\nBottom line\n\nOverall, I really enjoy using the Gramercy Kitchen Co. Sous Vide Immersion Circulator. It's accurate, reliable, quiet, and simple to use and clean. Though some of the more popular models have wireless connectivity and smart apps, they usually cost as much as $200, and the extra features can be a bit overwhelming for a first-time user. Therefore, I recommend the Gramercy cooker as a good beginner immersion circulator for any home chef interested in trying sous vide."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Thomas Colson", "title": "Theresa May admits the Brexit transition period could last until 2022", "description": "Theresa May says the UK will end the Brexit transition period before the next general election in May 2022.

Facing an uphill battle to win the support of Tory MPs and a sceptical public, she has already addressed Cabinet, faced a grueling session in parliament, and conducted several interviews.\n\nThe most immediate threat to her leadership comes in the form of a potential leadership challenge. All eyes are on Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, who must call a vote of no-confidence in the prime minister if he receives 48 letters.

The firm would give away valuable intellectual property as part of a technology strategy meant to position it, once again, at the nexus of global trading flows.\n\nIt was at the heart of Goldman's strategy to become the Google of Wall Street. No longer would a client need to pick up the phone or use instant messaging to get what they wanted. Their computers could hook up with Goldman's.\n\nBut inside Goldman Sachs, the outlook was less rosy. Engineers were stretched thin. Colleagues weren't selling it to clients as they should, worried about rushing out a half-baked product or sharing contacts with other areas of the bank, according to current and former executives. Some openly chafed against giving away the firm's secret sauce. And most worryingly, customers weren't embracing it to execute trades.\n\nFacing internal tension and external indifference, the project's future seemed to hang in the balance.\n\nA little more than 18 months later, the mood around Marquee has shifted. Goldman's top brass made a decision last year to plow more resources into the effort. They restructured the platform's underlying technology into a robust library of fully documented application-programming interfaces, or APIs, and snippets of code that make it easier for developers, both internal and external, to build new products on top of Goldman's tech. Clients can now execute trades, examine portfolios, and design bespoke products via browser, desktop application or API.\n\nThis story charts the growing pains of Marquee and explains how Goldman thinks it can one day serve as the pipes underpinning dozens of Wall Street startups or external-trading platforms. Business Insider also got the first look at the project's latest incarnation, a rebooted approach that takes it from a collection of roughly three dozen applications into something much larger and more ambitious.\n\n\"It was really a labor of love to get this going, and even once we started, it took a while to get momentum,\" said Adam Korn, the partner who's spearheading the project, in an interview at his glass-walled office on the edge of the equities trading floor.\n\n\"But now, it's really transforming the entire way that we deliver goods and services to clients.\"\n\nWall Street emulates Silicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley has been designing platforms for years. Amazon sells products and allows third-party marketers to harness its customer base. Facebook offers a host of services all embedded within a single site.\n\nWall Street has been slower to react. For decades, sell-side trading desks arranged themselves in product silos organized around asset classes, like stocks or corporate bonds. As clients moved away from that model, lenders struggled with legacy technologies, a lack of investment dollars for upgrading technology, and a thicket of regulations that made data security and retrieval even more complex.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nOnce lenders adapted to new regulations and settled legal and regulatory matters stemming from the crisis, they began to put money into technology improvements.\n\nNow, conversations with senior managers across Wall Street inevitably wind their way back to talk of platforms. Goldman has its formula. Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan's investment-banking unit, has talked openly about his ambitions for building that bank's platform and, according to CNBC, already signed up hundreds of clients to use the firm's internal systems to analyze portfolios. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has been selling access to its risk-management system, Aladdin, for years.\n\nMonetizing new regulations\n\nMore than 25 years ago, Goldman developed one of Wall Street's first firmwide securities-pricing and risk-management systems, known as SecDB. Executives guarded the technology closely, viewing it as a competitive advantage. Only in 2010, after President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \u2014 which landed a broadside against proprietary trading and opaque derivatives, two of Goldman's profit centers \u2014 did the current strategy begin to take shape.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving that year, Marty Chavez, now cohead of the securities division and then head of the division's desk side quants, turned to Korn and asked him to engage in some brainstorming.\n\n\"The challenge that he posed to me at the time was 'in a completely unconstrained world, how can we turn this into a competitive advantage for the business?'\" Korn said.\n\nKorn (l, with tie) and Marty Chavez (r, with headphones) pose with a group of engineers on Goldman's trading floor. Twitter.com/GoldmanSachs In Korn, Chavez found an exec who had grown up around technology his whole life. Korn's father developed a Unix programming language at Bell Labs, and his father and brothers now work at Google. Korn and Chavez have both founded startups, and the two men have been known to go head-to-head in coding competitions. As they batted around ideas, according to Korn, they realized that the new legislation would force product standardization and boost electronic trading.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs was an early backer of Uber, Dropbox and Spotify \u2014 here's what its CFO says the bank looks for in a startup investment\n\nFor the two technology-obsessed execs, that meant harnessing the power of APIs. The tools, which allow Uber to connect to Google maps or any number of startups to work with Amazon Web Services, are a collection of protocols and standards that dictate how software elements should interact with each other.\n\nThey looked for places where they could automate the hundreds of daily human-to-human interactions taking place between Goldman's trading desks. One early focus was credit-exchange-traded funds, where the corporate bond desk and the equities desk were consulting on pricing and execution. Another was selling structured notes to retail advisers, a largely manual process where advisers would go back and forth with Goldman's traders over various aspects of the notes.\n\n'A Constant Battle'\n\nGoldman's engineers began to work with existing teams to come up with solutions specific to their clients. They found themselves looking to Amazon as a model. In 2002, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously sent a memo telling employees they'd be fired unless they learned to communicate between departments using API-like functions. The memo has gained a cult following in Silicon Valley and for good reason: The linkages became the foundation for a cloud-storage business that positions Amazon to get an early look at startups using its service and then collect more revenue as they scale. Korn even tried to persuade Chavez to send something similar, believing that kind of structure was needed to build the most effective platform.\n\nGoldman engineers have looked to Jeff Bezos' Amazon as a model. Drew Angerer / Getty Images\n\nBut the last thing Goldman needed was to alienate the securities division's rank-and-file employees. Traders and salespeople were initially suspicious of the engineers' intentions, according to interviews with four former employees. One remembers a screaming match in which a securities division employee told a Marquee engineer that tech was a cost center and beholden to the business side. Some technologists, like Google product manager Oren Mor, joined from Silicon Valley only to leave after a few months, discouraged by the slow pace of change.\n\n\"The thing about this project that makes it hard is it's an internal disruption project,\" one former employee explained. \"It was a constant battle.\"\n\nAfter several years, Goldman succeeded in building out a collection of about 35 standalone applications, such as the structured-notes platform known as Simon, which the company is in the process of spinning off (and in which it will keep an equity stake), or Strategy Studio, a platform allowing clients to build and analyze custom portfolios.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs is on a hiring spree for the tech team at the heart of its new strategy\n\nWhile those worked for individual desks and succeeded mostly in pacifying egos, Goldman soon realized that it wasn't getting the platform effects it wanted. Clients used one or two apps, but didn't use the rest.\n\nSalespeople were happy to sell clients on the benefits of their desk's application, but saw little reason to promote someone else's. Many of the apps ran on duplicate technology, approaching similar challenges from a variety of angles. And in many cases, the apps didn't talk to each other.\n\nSo, about a year ago, Goldman's top brass agreed to plow more resources into the effort. Despite the early troubles, Korn's team had built enough building blocks to persuade senior managers less prone to getting excited about software code or APIs to support the work.\n\nFirmer Footing\n\nEngineers scattered across the division coalesced into a larger Marquee team. Korn finagled space on the sixth floor of the bank's 200 West St. headquarters in downtown New York City, and the company began the hard work of deconstructing the dozens of apps into their common components: basic services like asset definitions, authentication, pricing and data feeds. The firm finally decided to dictate that there would be only one API for each function, taking a firm stance, but one less threatening than Bezos'.\n\nTechnologists now listen to music and sip energy drinks from a refrigerator reserved for Marquee employees, under freshly painted columns of blue and white that are inscribed with the project's name. A massive screen in one corner facilitates product demonstrations \u2014 and video games: On a recent Thursday in October, a Mario Kart cartridge sat in a Nintendo 64 console.\n\nAfter months of work, Marquee now fields more than 100 million API calls each month, about 5 million of which come from outside Goldman's four walls. Marquee now has roughly 12,000 monthly active users, split evenly between internal and external clients. And the number of users is beginning to increase, according to Korn.\n\nThe company has begun selling access to its APIs, though mostly it's provided through bigger bundled services. Simon will pay Goldman a fee to access APIs through Marquee. Clients can already use the platform to execute simple foreign exchange trades and are in talks to use more complex products like basket swaps \u2014 derivatives linked to various hand-picked exposures, such as industry verticals or investment factors, according to Korn.\n\nKorn. Goldman Sachs Confident that the big-technology challenges have been addressed, Korn has turned to distribution. Clients can use Marquee with direct connections via APIs or through a browser or a desktop application in partnership with OpenFin, an operating system that can distribute apps or enable interoperability, much like Android or iOS. It's working with third-party vendors, like data aggregators or tech companies such as Symphony, the chat-based communication service, to pipe Goldman content right onto a user's chosen dashboard. A password-protected website now includes specific tabs for the developer community or clients seeking data sources.\n\nInternally, engineers from other divisions like investment banking are beginning to create new functionality on the foundation that Korn and his team have built. And there's hope that greater numbers of external developers will soon see the value of plugging their startups into the guts of Marquee.\n\nThere's still a lot of risk. Buy-side clients may veer away from using APIs or hesitate to embrace them as fully as Goldman expects; competitors may close the gap quickly; Goldman may struggle to convince clients it has the necessary data security and privacy protections to keep customer data safe and away from the prying eyes of its traders.\n\n\"It's not entirely clear to me that people are comfortable using a dealer,\" said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous Research. \"That's a barrier to acceptance.\"\n\nKorn is undeterred. The bank is close to creating a dedicated Marquee sales group to help sell the platform, foster adoption, and create new revenue sources, according to a person with knowledge of the group. It's likely to be led by sales and trading exec Anne Marie Darling and will help Goldman figure out the revenue model and help scale the business.\n\n\"If you build a platform that's not only used to make ourselves internally more productive, but actually becomes its own standalone source of revenue,\" Korn said, \"that's a pretty powerful way of generating higher returns.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "feedback@businessinsider.com (Christian de Looper), Christian de Looper", "title": "The Microsoft Surface Go is one of the best work-focused tablets \u2014 and it's currently $50 off for Black Friday", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Combined with a $99 keyboard, it's a teeny-tiny, affordable little Windows 10 laptop. Microsoft\n\nGone are the days when Microsoft was a software company and that's it.\n\nThese days, the company releases excellent hardware on a yearly basis, and that hardware has been well-reviewed and much-loved. This year, Microsoft took the wraps off of three new mobile computers \u2014 including the Surface Laptop 2, Surface Pro 6, and the new Surface Go. We've already taken a look at the previous two devices, so now it's time to take a look at the Surface Go.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Go is the smallest and least powerful of the three new devices, but it's also the cheapest \u2014 making it one of the better choices for a portable computer in its price-range. Notably, it's far cheaper than the new iPad Pro, yet it still runs a desktop-class operating system, Windows 10, albeit with less processing power.\n\nIs the Microsoft Surface Go the way to go for those looking for a relatively powerful device they can take on the road with them?\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt first glance, the Microsoft Surface Go looks like a Microsoft device. That's to say, it carries many of the same characteristics as other Surface devices, like the infinitely adjustable kickstand on the back, plus if you opt for the keyboard accessory ($100), it boasts the same Alcantara feel around the keyboard, which is looks and feels great.\n\nWhen it comes to ports, however, things are a little different. You will find the same type of magnetic charging port as other Microsoft devices, which is pretty nice, although we do wish Microsoft would just go for the more universal USB-C port. Speaking of USB-C, there's one on the right side of the device \u2014 essentially meaning that it has more modern ports than the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop. Above that, there's a headphone jack \u2014 thankfully.\n\nThe overall design of the Surface Go isn't bad, but in an age of slimming bezels, it does look slightly dated, especially when you use it in tablet mode. The keyboard, however, helps make it look a little better, plus the design doesn't really have an effect on the power under the hood. The device itself is only available in one color, but you can buy the keyboard in a few different colors, which is nice. We got the matching gray one, and quite liked it.\n\nThe display on the device is pretty nice, but it won't blow any minds like the display on the Surface Pro or Surface Laptop might.\n\nIt has an aspect ratio of 3:2 and a resolution of 1,800 x 1,200. That's noticeably less than the new 10-inch iPad's display, which comes in at 2,048 x 1,536. That's not to say the display is bad \u2014 it's not. Just don't expect to get the best 10-inch tablet display out there.\n\nRead more: The best tablets you can buy\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWhile this is a Windows 10 device, it runs Windows 10 S rather than Windows 10 Home.\n\nThat means there are a few limitations to it \u2014 including that you can only run apps downloaded from the Microsoft Store app. For many, that won't be such a big deal \u2014 especially those who really only need the device for web-browsing, typing in Microsoft Word, and so on. For others, however, that may be a deal breaker. Thankfully, you can switch the device to Windows 10 Home \u2014 though if you decide to do that, keep in mind that things like battery life and overall performance may suffer a little.\n\nUnder the hood, the Surface Go isn't bad, but don't expect a powerhouse.\n\nThe base model comes with a dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Pentium Gold 4415Y processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You can upgrade it from there, however, all the way up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There's also options for either Wi-Fi-only, or LTE connectivity too.\n\nIn use, we found the Surface Go to be quite a nice device. For basic use, it seemed quick and easy to use. Of course, it's important to go into using the device with tempered expectations \u2014 it's not a powerhouse like the new iPad, so don't expect to much more than basic working, a few basic games, and so on. Word processing was easy with Microsoft's suite of Office 365 apps, and you'll find it easy to keep several tabs open in your web browser \u2014 which will need to be Edge unless you make the switch to Windows 10 Home.\n\nRead more: Microsoft has revealed its Black Friday deals for the Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, and Xbox One\n\nThe Surface Go also has a few accessories, though you'll need to buy them separately.\n\nWe found that all of the accessories worked very well with the device \u2014 the Alcantara keyboard, for starters, felt quite nice. The keys were a little small, but they're about as big as they possibly could be on a tablet this size, and they offered a good amount of travel and a nice, clicky feel.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pen also worked quite well with the device. If you're a serious artist looking for a digital device to take your art to a new level, we recommend the more expensive Surface Pro or the iPad Pro, but the Surface Go is still more than capable for some things. The Surface Pen in general is a great device \u2014 it offers 4,096 levels of sensitivity, tilt support, and more, making it one of the better options for a stylus on a tablet. Ultimately, many consider the Apple Pencil to be a better option \u2014 but for the Apple Pencil you also have to buy a much more expensive device.\n\nUltimately, the Microsoft Surface Go is one of the best work-focused portable tablets out there.\n\nIt's a solid option for those who type a lot, though you will have to pay extra for the Alcantara keyboard. It's a great way to get a desktop-class operating system in a portable and inexpensive device \u2014 though keep in mind that you will need to upgrade to Windows 10 Home if you want to download third-party apps from the web. If, however, you need processing power, then we recommend instead opting for the slightly more expensive Surface Pro, or considering buying an iPad."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Trump's sanctions are crushing Iran's job market and potentially destabilizing the regime", "description": "Susan Walsh/AP Reuters interviews with dozens of business owners across Iran show hundreds of companies have suspended production and thousands of workers are being laid off because of a hostile business climate mainly caused by new U.S. sanctions.

Official projections indicate unrest could flare up again as sanctions make the economic crisis worse.\n\nFour days before Parliament fired him as labor minister in August for failing to do enough to protect the jobs market from sanctions, Ali Rabiei said Iran would lose 1 million jobs by the end of the year as a direct result of the US measures.\n\nUnemployment is already running at 12.1%, with 3 million Iranians unable to find jobs.\n\nA parliamentary report in September warned that rising unemployment could threaten the stability of the Islamic Republic.\n\n\"If we believe that the country's economic situation was the main driver for the recent protests, and that an inflation rate of 10% and an unemployment rate of 12% caused the protests, we cannot imagine the intensity of reactions caused by the sharp rise of inflation rate and unemployment,\" the report said.\n\nThe report added that if Iran's economic growth remains below 5% in the coming years, unemployment could hit 26%.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran's economy will contract by 1.5% this year and by 3.6% in 2019 because of dwindling oil revenue.\n\nProducers struggling\n\nRaheb Homavandi/Reuters\n\nIran's vice president has warned that under sanctions Iran faces two main dangers: unemployment and a reduction in purchasing power.\n\n\"Job creation should be the top priority,\" Eshaq Jahangiri said, according to state media, adding, \"We should not allow productive firms to fall into stagnation because of sanctions.\"\n\nBut business owners told Reuters that the government's sometimes contradictory monetary policies \u2014 alongside fluctuations in the foreign-exchange market, price increases for raw materials, and high-interest loans from banks \u2014 have made it impossible for them to stay in business.\n\nMany have not been able to pay wages for months or have had to shed significant numbers of workers.\n\nA manager at the Jolfakaran Aras Company, one of the biggest textile factories in Iran, told Reuters that the firm was considering halting its operations and that hundreds of workers might lose their jobs.\n\n\"Around 200 workers were laid off in August, and the situation has become worse since,\" said the manager, asking not to be named. \"There is a high possibility that the factory will shut down.\"\n\nAhmad Roosta, the CEO of Takplast Nour, was hopeful that a drought in Iran would provide a boost for his newly launched factory, which produces plastic pipes used in agriculture.\n\n\"I will wait one or two months, but I will have to shut down if the situation remains the same,\" Roosta told Reuters, adding, \"The farmers, who are the main consumers of our products, cannot afford them.\"\n\nThe sanctions have affected the Iranian car industry, which had experienced a boom after sanctions were lifted two years ago and it signed big contracts with French and German firms.\n\nThe French carmaker PSA Group suspended its joint venture in Iran in June to avoid US sanctions, and the German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business.\n\nMaziar Beiglou, a board member of the Iran Auto Parts Makers Association, said in August that more than 300 auto-parts makers had been forced to stop production, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in the sector.\n\nA representative for Iran's Tire Producers Association blamed the government's \"changing monetary policies over the last six months\" for problems in the sector.\n\n\"Fortunately, tire factories have not slowed down, but the production growth that we had planned for was not achieved,\" Mostafa Tanha said in a phone interview from Tehran.\n\nYouth unemployment\n\nAn anti-US mural in Tehran, Iran. Thomson Reuters\n\nWashington says economic pressures on Tehran are directed at the government and its malign proxies in the region, not at the Iranian people. But Iran's young people, bearing the brunt of unemployment, stand to lose the most.\n\nMaryam, a public-relations manager in a food-import company, lost her job last month.\n\n\"The prices went so high that we lost many customers,\" Maryam said, adding, \" In the end, the CEO decided to lay off people and started with our department.\"\n\nShe said the company had stopped importing, and people who still worked there were worried that it might shut down after selling off its inventory.\n\nYouth unemployment is already 25% in a country where 60% of the population of 80 million is under 30.\n\nThe unemployment rate among young people with higher education in some parts of the country is above 50%, according to official data.\n\nArmin, 29, has a mechanical-engineering degree but lost his job in the housebuilding industry when the sector was hit by a recession following the fall of the rial.\n\n\"The property market is slowing because high prices have made houses unaffordable,\" he told Reuters from the city of Rasht in northern Iran, adding, \"It is getting worse day by day.\"\n\nNima, a legal adviser for startups and computer firms, believes sanctions have already affected many companies in the sector that depended on an export-oriented model and hoped to expand in the region.\n\nHe said even the gaming industry in Iran had felt the sanctions pinch: \"The situation has become so severe that many of these teams decided to suspend development of their games and are waiting to see what will happen next. Without access to international markets, they see very little chance of making a profit.\"\n\nSaeed Laylaz, a Tehran-based economist, was more sanguine. He said that youth unemployment was a product of Iran's demographics and government policies and that sanctions were only adding to an existing problem.\n\n\"The sanctions, the uncertainty in the market, and Rouhani's zigzag policies have put pressures on the economy and the job market, but I predict that the market will find a balance soon,\" Laylaz told Reuters, referring to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n\"We will defeat this round of sanctions as we have done in the past,\" said Laylaz, who met Rouhani last month with other economists to offer advice on economic policies."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alex Lockie", "title": "Trump explains how he'll handle Jim Acosta now that his press pass is back", "description": "President Donald Trump explained how he'll deal with Jim Acosta, the CNN's correspondent he barred from the White House after numerous confrontations, saying he has a simple solution.

Article 11 was amended so that hyperlinks to articles with an \"individual word\" description would not be penalised, and journalists would be entitled to remuneration by their publishers if their articles are used by news aggregators. The legislation faces a final vote in early 2019.\n\nRead more: The EU has backed tough new laws to enforce copyright online\n\nGingras said the future of Google News in Europe will depend on whether the EU is willing to change the language around Article 11. \"We can't make a decision until we see the final language,\" he said.\n\nGingras added that while it is \"not desirable to shut down services,\" Google is concerned by the proposals as they stand at the moment.\n\nGoogle VP of News, Richard Gingras. Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York\n\nHe also pointed out that this would not be the first time Google has shuttered its news service.\n\nIn 2014, the Spanish government introduced similar legislation forcing aggregation sites to pay for links to news articles, and Google responded by shutting down its news service in Spain, where it is still inactive. Gringas told the Guardian this led to a fall in traffic to Spanish news websites.\n\n\"We would not like to see that happen in Europe,\" Gingras told The Guardian. \"Right now what we want to do is work with stakeholders.\"\n\nHe emphasised that Google News is not a massively profitable part of the company's business, but is a valuable social tool for users.\n\n\"There's no advertising in Google News. It is not a revenue-generating product to Google. We think it's valuable as a service to society. We are proud to have it as part of the stable of properties that people have,\" Gringas said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Google has pushed back against the EU's new copyright legislation. Along with Article 11 the EU introduced Article 13, which would require companies like Reddit, Facebook, and Google-owned YouTube to monitor and remove copyright infringement on their platforms.\n\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki pushed back against Article 13 in a Financial Times op-ed last week, saying EU residents were at risk of being \"cut off\" from videos on the site.\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokeswoman said it was too early to speculate on how the EU laws will impact Google News. She said:\n\n\"As Richard Gingras explained in his interview with The Guardian, there are several versions of the European copyright directive that are being discussed, and it's too early to speculate about how the final version of the directive would impact our products. We welcome the chance to work with policymakers and the industry to find a solution that benefits journalists and publishers \u2014 big and small, old and new.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Germany bars 18 Saudi nationals from 26 Schengen countries in response to Khashoggi killing", "description": "Osman Orsal/Reuters Germany\u2019s foreign minister says Berlin has banned 18 Saudi nationals from entering Europe\u2019s border-free Schengen zone because they are believed to be connected to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

As a result, traditional media companies will continue to see their most important revenue stream erode. To compete in the shifting media landscape, traditional media companies' business strategies must satisfy two goals: extract as much revenue from pay-TV as possible before the opportunity to do so fizzles out, and taper reliance on pay-TV-related revenue along the way.\n\nIn this report, Business Insider Intelligence will look at how big media companies are refining their strategies to meet the aforementioned goals and mitigate the impacts of cord-cutting that are detrimental to their business. We also discuss current consumer behavior trends that are simultaneously driving the growth of streaming platforms (like Netflix) and decline of linear TV, as well as actionable insights on how companies can respond.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nAs consumers flee linear TV, they're spending more time on digital video services with ad-free and ad-lite viewing experiences.\n\nMedia companies are responding by becoming less reliant on pay-TV revenue by launching their own streaming services.\n\nTraditional networks are also increasingly seeking M&A opportunities to gain the resources, talent, and technologies necessary to compete with streaming giants.\n\nMore media companies are beginning to experiment with airing fewer commercials per hour to enhance the linear TV viewership experience."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Ma", "title": "Interpol reportedly to elect a Russian president after China mysteriously disappeared its old one", "description": "Interpol will elect a new president this Wednesday.

Baker, group leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, and numerous other members have publicly revealed their no-confidence letters. However, other members have told Business Insider that they are reluctant to challenge May at such a crucial point in the Brexit process.\n\n\"I have not submitted a letter and am very unlikely to do so before March 30th, 2019,\" one told BI.\n\nConservative MPs who dislike May's Brexit deal returned to their constituencies over the weekend to deliberate over whether to submit letters.

Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove, Penny Mordant, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling want the political declaration on the future relationship to include sufficient detail on the future trade deal and the conditions in which the UK can leave the controversial backstop.\n\n\"There are things, particularly in the political decleration, which could give certainty to how we leave the backstop... Things like that are worth staying on for,\" an ally of Leadsom told BI.\n\nThe aforementioned Cabinet ministers have played down reports of a secret plot to change the Brexit deal. Fox has defended May in an opinion piece for The Telegraph. Last week the pro-Brexit trade secretary warned rebel Conservatives: \"We aren't elected to do what we want. We are elected to do what's in the national interest.\"\n\nThe decision of the five ministers to stay in Cabinet rather than resign like Dominic Raab and Esther McVey did on Thursday was a boost for the prime minister.
