He said the program that began in 2013 could only continue if they got full pay and were allowed to bring their families from Cuba.\n\nBolsonaro, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, was elected last month by Brazilians fed up with rising crime and rampant corruption that reached new highs during almost a decade and a half of leftist governments with close ties to Cuba.\n\nThe Cubans practiced mostly in poor and remote areas of Brazil where Brazilian doctors do not want to work. The government is now scrambling to replace them in 8,332 positions left vacant by the Cubans' returns.\n\nCuba has a respected health service and generates major export earnings by sending more than 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries.\n\nIn many Brazilian towns and the outskirts of cities that relied on the Cuban doctors, usually crowded waiting rooms at public health posts were empty this week and notices said appointments had been canceled until further notice.\n\nAdrielly Rodrigues, a pregnant 22-year-old, was turned away on Wednesday when she went for a pre-natal scan in Santa Maria, a town near the capital Brasilia.\n\n\"We are so worried because we do not have the money to pay for a private doctor and she is five months pregnant and still needs to be monitored and have tests,\" said her mother, Adriana Rodrigues.\n\nShe said Adrielly's doctor was a good one but \"she is gone now.\"\n\nA national lobby of mayors, the FNP, and the municipal health authorities council Conasems said in a statement that 29 million Brazilians could be left without basic healthcare. They urged the government to make it possible for the Cubans to stay.\n\nThe Health Ministry plans next week to waive a requirement that Cubans validate their medical diploma in Brazil so that they can continue working directly contracted by the Brazilian government and not through the Pan-American Health Organization.\n\nIt is not clear how many Cubans will want to break with their communist-run government's doctors-for-export program, which is present in about 60 countries, especially if they have children in Cuba since it would be tantamount to defecting.\n\nBolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, said last week he would grant asylum to any Cuban national who asks for it, further escalating tensions with Havana.\n\nBrazil hopes to fill the medical vacuum with local hires. In just two days since registration opened, 6,394 doctors have applied to fill the 8,332 empty posts, a ministry spokesman said, but the credentials of those applicants must be confirmed.\n\nOne Cuban who will be staying in Brazil is Richel Collazo, who is so liked in the small town of Chapada in southern Brazil that the mayor has offered him the job of municipal health secretary.\n\n\"My town needs doctors and he has been key to our medical care,\" Mayor Carlos Catto said by telephone.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Bill Trott)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dave Smith", "title": "Apple's Black Friday deals have already gone live in Australia \u2014 here's a sneak peek at all the discounts (AAPL)", "description": "Earlier this week, Apple announced a four-day \u201cshopping event\u201d that would kick off on Friday, November 23.

The fact is, it doesn't need to.\n\nApple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, and people buy its products regardless of the time of year. Many consider the iPhone and the Apple Watch, for example, as best-in-class products and will buy them year-round, even with no discount applied.\n\nSo, it's OK to be disappointed about Apple not having more significant sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

The class action lawsuit would seek an as yet unspecified sum on behalf of others in the same situation, according to court papers presented at Jerusalem District Court.\n\n\"The company's decision is in effect directed solely against Israeli citizens living in the settlements, the petitioner claims, and this is severe, especially outrageous discrimination,\" Rabinovich's lawyers said in a statement.\n\n\"(It is) part of the long war being conducted by organisations (of which a clear majority are anti-Semitic) against the State of Israel in its entirety, and against Israelis living in settlements in particular.\"\n\nPalestinians who want to establish an independent state taking in the West Bank have welcomed Airbnb's move. Most world powers view Israel's construction of settlements on occupied Palestinian land as a violation of international law, and Palestinians say it is wrong for companies to profit from them.\n\n\"Airbnb took a decision in the right direction to stop dealings with Israeli settlements, consistent with international legitimacy,\" Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior official with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization, told Reuters.\n\nRepresentatives of Airbnb were not immediately available for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, Chris Lehane, Airbnb's global head of policy and communications, said: \"Israel is a special place and our over 22,000 hosts are special people who have welcomed hundreds of thousands of guests to Israel.\n\n\"We understand that this is a hard and complicated issue and we appreciate everyone's perspective.\"\n\nAirbnb's delisting applies only to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self rule under Israeli military occupation. It does not apply to Israel itself, or East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, territories Israel has annexed without international recognition. Israel withdrew settlers from another Palestinian territory, the Gaza Strip, more than a decade ago.\n\nIsrael strongly objects to international boycotts, including boycotts of the settlements, which it views as discriminatory.\n\nA 2017 Israeli law empowers courts to award cash compensation to claimants who prove they have been denied goods or services because of where they live.\n\n(Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Peter Graff)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Benjamin Zhang", "title": "We drove a $65,000 Audi Q7 and a $60,000 Volvo XC90 to find out which one is a better luxury SUV \u2014 here's the verdict", "description": "The Audi Q7 and the Volvo XC90 are two of the best luxury crossover SUVs in the world.

It was the first new model to arrive in showrooms following the Swedish automaker's acquisition by China's Geely Group.\n\nWe loved the second generation XC90 so much that we gave it our 2015 Car of the Year award over some stiff competition like the BMW 7-Series and the Lamborghini Huracan.

A modestly-priced car might not seem like the most logical choice for this sort of event, but on a 2017 list of the cars best suited for autocross, the automotive publication Road & Track included affordable vehicles like the Ford Fiesta and Honda Civic alongside the Porsche Cayman and Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nLike the Fiesta, the Bolt is light and compact, which helps with agility and tight turns. And its 266 pound-feet of torque tops competitors like the Nissan Leaf (236 pound-feet) and the BMW i3 (184 pound-feet). While it won't provide blistering acceleration (it takes 6.2 seconds to go from 0-60 mph) or race car-level handling, the Bolt can navigate tight turns and frequent changes in speed without spinning out of control.\n\nThe Bolt was also the first fully-electric vehicle I'd driven. First released in late 2016, the Bolt is General Motors' mass-market electric car, beating Tesla's mass-market vehicle, the Model 3, to market by a year.

If we continue along the current course, the economic risks will increase, with potential effects for growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world.\"\n\nThe WTO was doing all it could to help de-escalate the situation, he added, but solutions would need political will and leadership from the G20, whose leaders will meet in Argentina next week.\n\nThe monthly number of trade restrictions averaged eight during the period covered by the report, up from six per month in the previous report, which covered mid-October 2017 to mid-May 2018, the WTO statement said.\n\n\"The proliferation of trade-restrictive actions and the uncertainty created by such actions could place economic recovery in jeopardy. Further escalation would carry potentially large risks for global trade, with knock-on effects for economic growth, jobs and consumer prices around the world,\" it said.\n\nTARIFF HIKES\n\nThree-quarters of the latest trade restrictions were tariff hikes, many of them retaliation to steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in March.\n\nBut the WTO did not count measures that had been announced and not yet implemented, and one G20 country had asked for its tariff retaliation to be omitted from the monitoring report, which was done for \"transparency\" purposes, the WTO said.\n\nG20 countries had also implemented a monthly average of almost seven trade-liberalising measures, such as reducing import tariffs and export duties, in line with the trend since 2012.\n\nThe trade covered by the liberalising measures was worth $216 billion, about two and a half times more than in the previous report. Two-thirds of that value was attributable to China reducing more than 1,400 tariffs on vehicles, components and other products.\n\nA further $541 billion of trade, 4 percent of G20 countries' imports, was covered by expansion of the WTO's Information Technology Agreement, a liberalising measure that was excluded from the report's headline numbers.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Miles; editing by Stephanie Nebehay, Larry King)"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Laura McCamy", "title": "I got 'mugged' 35 times in a self-defense class \u2014 and it changed the way I see the world", "description": "The full-force fighting self-defense class I took was life-changing.

The male instructor wore a padded suit and a large padded helmet. When he had the helmet off, he was our teacher. When he put on the helmet, he became an aggressive, threatening \"mugger.\"\n\nThe padded suit and helmet allowed us to fight back against the assailant with full force, without injuring our teacher or ourselves.\n\nEach time a woman did a fight in class, the rest of us cheered her on from the sidelines, shouting, \"Eyes! Throat! Groin!\" to help her remember the moves we had been taught. If I am ever attacked, those voices will be in my head, cheering me on.\n\nAfter winning the fight (and the women always won), we assessed the situation, then shouted, \"911!\" and fled to safety.\n\nThe fights took place on gym mats, but they weren't gentle. A friend who took the class before I did broke her leg during a fight. (When her leg healed, she went right back and finished the course.) By the time my five-week class was over, I had been mugged 35 times. I was exhausted.\n\nI was also elated. I had learned to disable a larger, stronger attacker. I'm sad that I live in a world where I need to know how to do this, but I'm glad I do.\n\nPutting my training to use\n\nOn the first day of class, we learned verbal self-defense. It's OK to lie to someone to get away from being attacked (yes, I had to be taught this). I practiced loudly saying, \"I don't know this man,\" so bystanders would know it wasn't a lovers' quarrel.\n\nA couple of years after my self-defense class experience, I got a chance to use that verbal self-defense training, while I was selling jewelry I made as a street vendor in downtown San Francisco. A man approached me, seeming normal at first, but quickly flipped into a crazy, angry tirade.\n\nI couldn't walk away from my table. I tried to politely get rid of him. I tried to ignore him. Finally, I stood up to him.\n\nI didn't want to fight, but I finally decided I would rather risk a physical altercation than take any more verbal abuse. For the first time in my life, I got to draw the line.\n\nI walked in front of my little table and told the man this was harassment and that he needed to leave. I raised my voice and held my hand up near my neck, the way I had been taught, ready to poke his eye if he tried to hurt me.\n\nHe didn't leave, but he backed up. I confronted him three more times, until he stood in the middle of the sidewalk ranting at no one in particular. I had stood my ground and won.\n\nI wouldn't have had the words or the courage to stand up for myself without the skills I learned during my class. What could have been a traumatic incident became a success story.\n\nA different way to move in the world\n\nThe last day of each course is a graduation, when friends and family can come and cheer on those who have completed the course. Women who have taken the class before are invited into the circle during the graduation, and they can do a \"mugging\" if they want to. Ten years later, when I attended a graduation, I decided to take part \u2014 I needed to see if I still remembered what I had learned a decade before.\n\nOne of the people in the audience that day was the friend who had taken the class with me. She observed that I was better at the self-defense moves than I had been during our class.\n\nI realized that, in the decade since I first took the self-defense course, I began to truly inhabit my body for the first time. I was more centered, grounded, and confident, because I was no longer scared.\n\nI still don't want to be mugged or attacked \u2014 I know exactly how much it hurts. But, if it ever happens, I will be able to defend myself.\n\nAs they said in my class, it's not the size of the woman in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the woman. I know the size of the fight in me and that has given me the courage to be more fully myself."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Libby Kane", "title": "My best travel trick for high tourist season is a no-brainer, and I'm always shocked when people don't do it", "description": "The best trick I've found to save time on a trip seems blindingly obvious: Buy your tickets for tourist attractions online, before you go.

Since we just had the seven days, I made a list beforehand of the things we wanted to see, and quickly checked which offered tickets for sale ahead of time. Every time we showed up at an attraction, we'd get right in, saving ourselves the agony of slow-moving lines.\n\nThis happened again and again: at the Rodin Museum, at Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, at Monet's gardens in Giverny (yes, we did the tourist rounds). And I'm not saying it was a case of tickets-or-we-turn-around; we stumbled across plenty of places we didn't know we'd be visiting until we got there, like the magical Jardins de Br\u00e9cy.\n\nFriends and coworkers tell me they prefer to travel off the cuff, booking flights, trips and hotels last-minute, and deciding what they'll do once they arrive. I can't relate, but sure: Theoretically, an impulsive adventure holds some appeal. Sometimes the tickets are timed, anchoring you to a specific place at a given time, and maybe not everyone wants to travel with a detailed itinerary spreadsheet (although where do you keep your confirmation numbers!?) or a suitcase pocket full of print-outs.\n\nBut frankly, if I had to loiter in a ticket line every day of my vacation, I'd bail.

He said the holidays are one of three occasions in which you should avoid gift-giving.\n\n\"I don't send one gift from a business perspective between Thanksgiving and Christmas, or Thanksgiving and year-end, because i feel like it's the noisiest and most-cluttered time of the year,\" Ruhlin said on the podcast \"Success Insider\" in 2016. \"So we do our gifting the other 11 months out of the year.\"\n\nThe idea, he explained to Business Insider, is that your clients will be so overwhelmed with token gifts during the holiday season that yours will have little chance of standing out.

On St. Patrick's Day, send one that says, 'We're lucky to have you as a partner!'\" Ruhlin wrote in \"Giftology.\"\n\n\"There are a million and one national holidays to choose from. For instance, send a pizza along with a high-end pizza stone and slicer on National Pizza Day. It can be so easy if you are willing to open your eyes to the possibilities.\"\n\nHe added: \"By doing this, we cut into any sense of entitlement because the gift never becomes an expectation. It's always a surprise, and it always makes an impact.\"\n\nBetter yet, don't even wait for a holiday to send your client a gift. Ruhlin recommends surprising clients with thoughtful gifts and random times of the year.\n\n\"Take that bottle of really good wine that you were going to give at Christmas time, and send it in the middle of the winter tundra of February instead,\" Ruhlin wrote in \"Giftology.\" \"I guarantee the response will likely be, 'That was the best gift! It was the only thing I got in the mail that wasn't a bill this week!'\"\n\nGifting on these unorthodox occasions will help you stand out from the crowd, Ruhlin said, and signal to your client that you're treating them genuinely, and not because you have to.

If it weren't for the Via logo, they'd blend right in to the fabric of other ride-hail vehicles, personal cars, and taxis.\n\nBut under the surface, Via is hoping it can increase its market share above the tiny fraction it currently holds by convincing people that a shared ride is better for everyone.\n\nThe company, which draws inspiration from shared taxis in Israel called sheruts, has raised $387 million in four rounds of venture-capital funding and is active in three US cities as well as several others in Europe through a partnership with Mercedes-Benz.\n\nCEO Daniel Ramot has plans well beyond passengers ordering cars to get from one place to another: He wants to invent what he describes as an \"operating system\" for public transportation, one that would radically change our notion of a public bus and \u2014 eventually \u2014 eliminate the need for personal vehicles.\n\nToday, Via operates the entire public bus network in Arlington, Texas \u2014 replacing the traditional vehicles with on-demand shared vans. Its software enables other cities to do much the same with their public transit agencies.\n\nBusiness Insider caught up with Ramot to talk about what got the company to this point, how he views its mammoth competitors like Uber and Lyft, and what's next for Via:\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nGraham Rapier: Obviously Uber and Lyft are two of your largest competitors. What differentiates Via from other companies in the ride-hailing space?\n\nDaniel Ramot: We see ourselves as being in a different category from Uber and Lyft, and I don't just say this as a way to address the question of competition. It's been the way that we've thought about Via from the very beginning.\n\nWe were really focused from the very beginning on creating technology and a service that is all about better public transportation. Essentially, we think of Via as a dynamic, on-demand bus solution, and that's really the way that we started to think about the company from day one.\n\nUber and Lyft, at least in my sense, have come at it from \"how do we make a better taxi?\" Now they're adding other types of mobility, but the focus for them has not been around creating better public transportation or bus experience.\n\nI think that that sort of then translates into maybe at least a couple of different elements:\n\nDaimler One is that the technology we've developed is really geared towards creating a mass-transit solution where we're trying to optimize the utilization of every seat. It's really about thinking about things in that way, to reduce by using larger vehicles and driving the efficiency of the system as sort of the core goal.\n\nThe other is the way that we've historically approached working with cities and public transportation agencies; our goal has always been to be closely aligned with them and much more collaborative. The DNA of the company is very, very different.\n\nRapier: A lot of your focus seems to be on improving public transportation \u2014 why that and not just another ride-hailing service?\n\nRamot: When we founded the company six years ago, we were thinking about \"How do you make public transit better?\" and looking around it was clear that public transportation was a space that just had very little technology in it \u2014 we used to call it insulated from technology.\n\nWe were inspired by this van-based system in Israel called sheruts, where taxi vans simply run fixed routes like buses, but smaller and faster, and you can flag them down anywhere along the route. We had the idea of taking that system and, through technology, allowing those vehicles to be routed dynamically in response to demand.\n\nAs we started to think about that solution, Oren, my cofounder, and I had this sense that this was going to be the future of public transportation. We really believed that, at some point down the road, there will certainly still be buses for high-capacity routes, and maybe only during peak hours, but not all times. It was clear to us that many of the areas that we currently serve with buses could be far better served with these more agile, dynamic, data-driven, on-demand solutions.\n\nOver time, we've come to think that it's actually potentially much bigger than that. Not only can this help us replace underperforming bus routes or complement bus systems, but eventually, if you get the system to be good enough, you hit a certain combination of convenience and cost that could start to replace the private car \u2014 which is, in that sense, the holy grail.\n\nHow do we get people out of their cars? It's very hard to do with a bus \u2014 it hasn't worked for dozens of years. Subways work very well, but they're extremely expensive to dig, and most cities don't have the density or size to really support them.\n\nRapier: But isn't the beauty of a (well-planned) bus system that you know when and where it will show up, with at least some regularity, and where it's going to go?\n\nRamot: I think the psychology of it is probably complex. I don't mean to oversimplify it, but I'm not convinced that what you just described isn't just what we've gotten used to. If you actually take a step back, it isn't that normal to show up at a bus stop and just wait there, not knowing where the bus is, when it will come, and whether it will be too full or you can find a seat. I think it's just something that, due to lack of information and technology, we've become accustomed to. It makes a lot more sense if you can open your phone and say \"I want to get from point A to point B\" and within seconds the app says \"OK, walk 100 meters to this corner, and your vehicle is three minutes away\" \u2014 makes a lot more sense.\n\nRapier: What about people without phones, like kids, the elderly, or those who can't afford it?\n\nRamot: Usually the cities we work with, whether it's directly with the municipality like in Arlington or a public transit agency, they are definitely concerned about that. When we're running a consumer service, our customers are people who have phones \u2014 we would love to get the people who don't have phones too, but it's OK, from our perspective, that we don't provide service if you don't have a phone with an app on it. But for a city like Arlington that would not be OK.\n\nVia We have a call center that you can call in, as well as several other ideas that we haven't necessarily implemented. For example, you have at the bus stations or strategic locations a tablet that you can walk up to and simply order your ride from there. We could also have a web interface so you can go online and book a ride there.\n\nRapier: How did the arrangement with Arlington, Texas, come about? How did you convince an entire city \u2014 the seventh largest in the state \u2014 to let you run the entire public transit system?\n\nRamot: We basically spent the first years the company building the technology. Once we became convinced the technology was really working, we starting going to transit conferences, speaking about what we're doing and getting to know folks in the business \u2014 especially on the municipal and transit agency side. We ended up getting connected with the folks at Arlington and talking to them about what a solution could be for their city and how we would envision it.\n\nThose talks led to an RFP (request for proposal) for an innovative on-demand public transportation service. There were actually quite a few companies that responded and we ended up being selected through that procurement process.\n\nRapier: What's the breakdown of your public transit versus consumer businesses? Are they equal, or is one much bigger than the other? Which is your biggest focus right now?\n\nRamot: Our consumer offerings in New York, Chicago, Washington, DC, and some European cities through a partnership with Mercedes-Benz is still the biggest part of our business today and continued to grow very quickly.\n\nThe part of the business where we are partnering with cities \u2014 either like the one in Arlington or simply providing the software to a transit agency \u2014 is rapidly growing. I suspect that within not too long will become an equally large and important part of the business.\n\nBut if we take a step back, the way that we see what we're doing is not as two separate businesses but one solution. We like to think of this as an operating system for on-demand shuttles. It's an extremely efficient format that we'd like to deploy all over the world. The question then becomes what is the best way for us to enter all of these cities. Sometimes we decide that it makes sense to launch our own service as we did in New York and London. Other times it may be better for us to partner with a city or agency.\n\nRapier: Let's talk about the directly operated services. Subscription plans are hot right now, with Uber and Lyft both announcing them in the same week, but you've had Via Pass for years. How's the response been to that?\n\nRamot: Our subscription service is quite unique in that we're the only one where you simply pay up front and then get unlimited (up to four) rides per day, much like a MetroCard in New York. (Editor's note: A 30-day pass for New York's subway and buses is $121; a Via pass is $255 a month.)\n\nThe service doesn't have dramatic price fluctuations that you might see on other platforms. To us, if you're going to take one, two, or four rides today, we know about how much they're going to cost.\n\nVia Additionally, a lot of our businesses is commuters \u2014 they were the foundation of the service and a big part of what we've always done.\n\nRapier: What about the algorithm \u2014 how is the routing different than that of say Lyft Line or Uber Pool?\n\nRamot: The system we've developed is all about getting as many people as possible in the vehicle while guaranteeing a route that makes sense and not being taken out of your way. Still, hopefully, we're able to find a number of other passengers whose routes overlap and can all ride together with minimal disruption.\n\nThis has always been key, but we realized early on that for this to even have a remote chance of working we're going to have to ask people to walk a little bit. If we try to pick you up exactly where you are and drop you off exactly where you need to go, that imposes pretty strong constraints on the route of the vehicle and can force large detours.\n\nWe very quickly realized this and then developed sophisticated technology around figuring out what we call \"virtual bus stops\" and the best way to route vehicles. These really complicate the computations \u2014 it's no longer just the shortest route between your origin and destination but a cloud of possible pickup points.\n\nShared rides have always been our focus, and we didn't offer private rides until about a year ago. Still, about 95% of our requests are for shared rides. The vast majority of people obviously think about it as a shared service. I can talk a lot and tell you why it's different, but I think that number speaks for itself.\n\nRapier: What about for drivers? Is your pay scale or driver app any different?\n\nRamot: There are a few key differences around the driving experiences and pay. Drivers on the Via platform are very used to following the Via app. They're provided with a route at all times, including when they're empty. A big part of the efficiency is that we know exactly where they are and where they're going to be, so we can balance out where all the empty seats are throughout the city.\n\nIf you imagine having all the vehicle take the fastest route, which might be Park Avenue for example. It's very beneficial for us to have some vehicles go down Lexington, some go down 2nd, and so forth so that we're always matching available seats and where they will be 10 minutes from now.\n\nThis driver guidance helps contribute to our significantly higher utilization rate than other platforms, which then also translates into higher earnings per hour. If you look at the most recent TLC report, the median Via drivers were making 50% more than drivers on Uber and Lyft.\n\nIt's not necessarily that Via drivers when they have a passenger in the car are making more money than Uber drivers that have a passenger in the car \u2014 I think it really is about utilization. When you think about your experience on these other platforms, their focus is on providing you a ride that's within three to four minutes away. That's it. It's a great experience, no question, on the consumer side. But it means there have to be a lot of empty vehicles driving around waiting for you to open the app and book a ride.\n\nOur wait times are a bit longer, six minutes on average, but that all comes with trying to not have too many drivers on the road and having the efficiency as high as possible.\n\nRapier: Will you be IPO-ing soon like Uber and Lyft?\n\nRamot: It's definitely a direction we're thinking about. We're trying to build a company that has a product that's deployed in every city throughout the world. If we're able to achieve that, then that's certainly a company worthy of an IPO.\n\nRapier: What about scooters? They seem to be all the rage now \u2014 are you planning to go beyond cars?\n\nRamot: Over the last 10 years, we've seen technology come into the transportation space \u2014 with the introduction of ride-hailing and shared rides \u2014 that has been super interesting. Now, what we pioneered in New York is being adopted by other ride-hailing companies around the world like Uber Pool and even Didi Chuxing and Grab have shared services now.\n\nTechnology can increasingly create new modes of transportation that didn't exist, and I think in the case of scooters \u2014 their combination of hardware, software, and batteries \u2014 has enabled this new mode of micro-mobility. Just like ride-sharing, this will change the urban mobility landscape in a really positive way. People have different needs, and having a diversity of modes to choose from is very important. We're pretty excited about the space.\n\nWe're definitely looking to add scooters to our repertoire, specifically with what we're offering to cities. A lot of our partner cities have expressed interest."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Troy Wolverton", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg is on the hot seat at Facebook \u2014 but ousting her alone wouldn't solve its problems (FB)", "description": "Sheryl Sandberg is on the hot seat at Facebook \u2014 but ousting her alone wouldn't solve its problems.

This allows companies to continue importing from China while dodging tariffs.\n\nHere's the key paragraph from Donovan (emphasis ours):\n\n\"A US company importing electrical switches from China now has to pay the new trade tax. A US company importing something that uses Chinese electrical switches from a Canadian subsidiary does not have to pay the new trade tax.\n\n\"If US companies move a stage of their manufacturing overseas (to a country other than China), the trade tax is avoided. The US is, in reality, importing as many Chinese electrical switches as ever it did. It is just now they come packaged up as something else, and that package is made somewhere other than China.\"\n\nThis means of skirting round tariffs is most effective, Donovan says, in multinational companies based in the US, as these firms, by their very nature have offices and manufacturing plants around the world. For these companies, moving small parts of production to different factories is a fairly simple process.\n\nIt is however, hard to detect, meaning that such moves are unlikely to show up in official data.\n\n\"In many cases, however, it is not the whole production process that is changing location, just one part of it,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Around 40% of all global trade is done by multinational companies. These companies by definition have factories in more than one country. It is not easy to spot this in the data.\"\n\nRead more: Crops are rotting in fields as Trump's trade war bites US farmers\n\nThat means there is no real concrete evidence to support Donovan's theory, but there are very clear hints that it is happening.\n\n\"Exports of Chinese electrical switches to Canada increased substantially after the US taxes, as US imports fell,\" he said. \"Other products saw similar surges in Canadian demand. The patterns of trade after the July trade taxes are certainly suggestive.\"\n\nSo far, the US and China have traded tit-for-tat tariffs on goods totalling $360 billion, with the US acting as the aggressor, and Trump threatening numerous times to place tariffs on all US imports from China, worth about $500 billion."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Callum Burroughs", "title": "Carlos Ghosn fired as Nissan chairman following arrest", "description": "Carlos Ghosn has been removed as Chairman of Nissan.

Unlike the withdrawal deal, it won't be legally binding but it will act as an important statement of intent from both sides.\n\nHowever, some issues which the political declaration covers are proving to be more difficult to resolve than negotiators had anticipated, with reports on Wednesday afternoon that a planned EU summit for Sunday could be cancelled due to a lack of progress on issues connected to the UK's future relationship.\n\nThat could spell disaster for Theresa May. She had hoped to wrap up all details of the deal so that EU leaders could sign off her deal at the planned summit on Sunday. Here are the key issues which are holding back talks.\n\n1. Gibraltar\n\nThe Rock of Gibraltar stands behind La Linea de la Concepcion city on April 4, 2017 in Spain. Tensions have risen over Brexit negotiations for the Rock of Gibraltar. Getty / Pablo Blazquez Dominguez\n\nThe tiny territory of Gibraltar poses an outsized problem for Brexit negotiators. The rocky outpost on the southern tip of Spain has been a British territory for three centuries, and its service-based economy relies heavily on the free flow of workers across the border from Spain, which account for around half its workforce.\n\nGibraltar is a self-governing territory with 34,000 residents, most of whom are British citizens and 97% of whom voted to remain in the European Union in 2016. Equally, Gibraltar is physically connected to Spain and mainland Europe and has close links with Spain, which frequently challenges the UK's legal claim to the territory.\n\nThe UK would be happy enough not to discuss the future of detail in too much detail in the political declaration. But Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit deal without a clarification of the text on the status of Gibraltar.\n\n\"As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,\" said S\u00e1nchez on Tuesday.\n\nArticle 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the UK and EU will \"negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship\" during the transition period from March next year. But Spain wants much more clarity than that and insists it should be able to negotiate the future of Gibraltar bilaterally with the UK.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson this week re-stated the EU's pledge that no Brexit agreement between the UK and EU could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of Spain and the UK. It's a big issue which needs to be resolved quickly.\n\n2. Fishing\n\nFishing boats protest Getty\n\nFishing is a highly contested area between the UK and EU. Britain wants the political declaration to declare that Britain is an \"independent coastal state\" which will negotiate EU access to its waters on an annual basis.\n\nHowever, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium want the language to state that continuing current arrangements for fishing access will be a precondition of a full UK-EU trade deal across all sectors. Quota shares of fish are currently allocated according to a formula, to the anger of British fisherman who say that fishing vessels from elsewhere in the EU have too much access to British waters.\n\n3. Future trade The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier looks on at the start of the EU Commission's weekly college meeting in Brussels, Belgium, November 21, 2018 Reuters / Francois Walschaerts\n\nAbove all, Theresa May sees the political declaration as an essential tool in the bid to sell her Brexit deal to sceptical Tory MPs.\n\nTo that end, she wants to include some particularly ambitious language on the future trade relationship. That provision could, she calculates, persuade her colleagues that the controversial \"backstop\" plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland will never be needed.\n\nBut countries including Germany, France and other close trading partners of the UK oppose any language which will raise false hopes that the UK could negotiate single market membership for goods, the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe EU has repeatedly rejected such proposals as seeking to \"cherry pick\" elements of the single market as part of May's so-called Chequers plan for leaving the EU. They will resist any attempt by May to leave the door open for this to go ahead in future talks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "title": "10 things in tech you need to know today", "description": "Good morning!

Adesso per\u00f2 il laboratorio del mercato sembra indicare che Apple si trovi al limite del price premium di cui gode rispetto all\u2019iPhone. In base alla nostra esperienza nella categoria dei telefoni cellulari, quando le aziende produttrici di articoli tecnologici di consumo perdono il loro potere di pricing tendono a perdere o margini o quote di mercato, oppure entrambe le cose.\u201d\n\nPer gli analisti \u00e8 possibile che gli investitori stiano attribuendo un valore eccessivo all\u2019ecosistema di Apple \u2014 studiato per fare in modo che gli utenti acquistino nuovi prodotti dell\u2019azienda quando quelli che possiedono diventano troppo vecchi \u2014 perch\u00e9 sono focalizzati sugli Stati Uniti.\n\n\u201cNoi non pensiamo che il resto del mondo sia altrettanto legato all\u2019ecosistema dei prodotti Apple, ragion per cui i costi di switch al di fuori degli Stati Uniti tendono a essere inferiori\u201d hanno scritto.\n\nLa nota di questo marted\u00ec \u00e8 l\u2019ultima prova del timore degli analisti che i volumi di vendita dell\u2019iPhone inizino a ridursi a breve. Molti pensano che sia stato proprio questo timore a far decidere ad Apple di non comunicare pi\u00f9 il numero di unit\u00e0 vendute, che per gli analisti era un indicatore chiave. La societ\u00e0 ha dichiarato che preferisce focalizzarsi sul proprio passaggio al ruolo di azienda di servizi, con ricavi ricorrenti garantiti.\n\nSecondo gli analisti il fatturato di Apple nel Q4 si fermer\u00e0 nella fascia pi\u00f9 bassa della forbice prevista dalla societ\u00e0, e Goldman Sachs ha ridotto il target price per il titolo a 182 dollari per azione.

He joined the Navy in 1938.\n\nIn his later years, as he became well known as the attack's oldest military survivor, he'd be approached at memorial services and other events and asked for his autograph or to pose for pictures.

It included tense negotiations, Trump's initial desire to answer questions, the prospect of a subpoena, and a host of tactics put forth by Trump's lawyers.\n\nThose strategies included saying that all of the documents Trump's lawyers provided to Mueller's office were enough to make a formal sit-down with Trump unnecessary. The lawyers have also argued that questioning Trump about his time in the White House would infringe on \"his executive powers.\"\n\nAttorneys for the president also engaged in a one-sided public war against Mueller. That was another tactic the Associated Press said was meant to drag out the Trump-Mueller meeting negotiations for as long as possible, while also attacking Mueller, an exercise that was led by Rudy Giuliani, who joined Trump's team in April.\n\nAccording to the AP, an interview was scheduled for January 27, 2018. Chief of staff John Kelly got as far as working on logistics to get Trump to Camp David before the plan was scrapped by Trump's lawyers, after they learned the scope of Mueller's questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the newswire service reported that written answers to Mueller's questions about the 2016 campaign \u2014 not potential obstruction of justice \u2014 were submitted to the special counsel's office. This compromise was reached in September \"when Mueller's team said it would accept written answers on Russian election interference and collusion,\" the AP reports.\n\nIt's unclear if Mueller will submit more questions to be answered. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from INSIDER on Wednesday night."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Cork Gaines", "title": "The Cavaliers gave LeBron James a touching video tribute in his first game back in Cleveland since joining the Lakers", "description": "LeBron James played in his first game back in Cleveland since signing as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers.
