Former CIA director Mike Pompeo also characterized WikiLeaks as a \"non-state hostile intelligence service.\"\n\nThe Journal reported that prosecutors are weighing whether to publicly charge Assange, like they did with the Russian nationals who have so far been indicted as part of the Russia probe, to force the Ecuadorean embassy to turn him over to the US.\n\nThe last indictment Mueller's office issued was against the 12 Russian military intelligence officers in July. The special counsel's office has been quiet over the last month or so, likely adhering to DOJ guidelines that bar prosecutors from taking any overt action that could influence the outcome of an election like the recent November midterms.\n\nBut Washington is currently buzzing with anticipation that Mueller will drop something big soon, whether it's in the form of an indictment or a report in his ongoing obstruction investigation against the president.\n\nIn recent days, speculation has mounted that he will charge certain individuals in connection with WikiLeaks' activities during the election, including the longtime GOP strategist Roger Stone and the far-right conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi.\n\nAssange's lawyer told The Journal they hadn't heard anything about a potential DOJ case against the WikiLeaks founder.\n\n\"We have heard nothing from authorities suggesting that a criminal case against Mr. Assange is imminent,\" the attorney Barry Pollack said. \"Prosecuting someone for publishing truthful information would set a terrible and dangerous precedent.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Brian Pascus", "title": "The first winter storm of the season has hit the east coast of the US and its wreaked havoc on airports with hundreds of flights canceled", "description": "Hundreds of flights have been either canceled or delayed on Thursday as Winter Storm Avery, the first of the season, bears down on the East Coast.

Those who will retain their contracts have been given a recent mandate to push more aggressively to sell nonsatellite products.\n\nDirecTV dealers are part of a fleet of third-party laborers who sell DirecTV products and services including satellite, broadband, and phone services.\n\nFull-service dealers, those who manage technical installation and sales, are now expected to sell a minimum of four cellphones a week, where no previous directive on mobility sales existed, according to dealers who spoke with Business Insider.

We certainly hope it's our own fiber, but it could be on anybody's broadband. And they get the full-service premium package that we would normally deliver off satellite or over our IP-based U-verse service.\"\n\nThe service would enable AT&T to cut installation costs and require fewer dealers to install satellite services. It would also mean that AT&T could retain the customer relationship in place by transferring satellite customers to an over-the-top option.\n\nFor its part, AT&T says it has no plans to discontinue satellite service.\n\n\"Our video strategy involves offering our customers choices in how they want to receive their video service, including via satellite, our wireline service, or streaming over home broadband, regardless of their provider,\" a representative for AT&T told Business Insider.\n\nThe comments from Stephens come a few weeks after AT&T lost 346,000 traditional video subscribers in the third quarter of 2018, faring worse than Wall Street analysts had projected.\n\nIf you have any thoughts or information on DirecTV, AT&T, or the future of cable and satellite TV, contact ajackson@businessinsider.com."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Michelle Mark", "title": "Trump's support of a major sentencing reform bill sparks rare moment of bipartisan hope \u2014 but advocates warn the bill has a long way to go", "description": "President Donald Trump celebrated a rare moment of bipartisan unity on Wednesday when he announced his support for the First Step Act, a major sentencing reform bill.

The Rockets are built on James Harden and Chris Paul's penetration and emphasize shots at the rim, three-pointers, and foul shots. Anthony thrives in the post and midrange and is known for stopping the ball. Additionally, Anthony, never known as a prolific defender, didn't seem prepared to help a team that finished in the top 10 in defense last year.\n\nIn 10 games this year, Anthony averaged 29 minutes, 13 points, and 5 rebounds per game, shooting just 40% from the field and 32% from three.\n\nIn 294 minutes with Anthony on the floor this season, the Rockets have been outscored by 63 points. They've been outscored by nine points per 100 possessions with Anthony on the floor.\n\nThe Rockets' problems have gone beyond Anthony, however.

I've seen Zuckerberg talk about 'We'll do this,' 'We'll make this open,' 'We'll give you a little bit more options.' I haven't seen them do one real thing.\"\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWozniak added that Facebook should be clearer with its advertising policies.\n\n\"If you're going to be on targeted advertising lists,\" he said, Facebook should \"give you an option to pay your way out of it, or at least say, 'I'm on these lists' \u2014 tell you what lists you're on, which categories do they put you in out of the thousands of categories, and you can check or uncheck them, or you can say, 'I don't want to be on any targeted list at all.' And they should not keep that sort of data just from every little post.\"\n\nWozniak had a slightly more far-fetched idea that he acknowledged the company would likely never adopt: that Facebook should open itself up to competition by allowing users to export their data \u2014 including timelines, friends, and posts \u2014 and move it to another social-media site.\n\n\"I get sick of all executives when I hear ... diverting around any real answers and issues, and even any real promises and real action that would help people,\" Wozniak said. \"I'm always for the end consumer \u2014 the little guy over the big, strong, powerful, wealthy company or person.\"\n\nRead more: Mark Zuckerberg made his executives use Android phones after Tim Cook slammed Facebook's approach to privacy\n\nWozniak has spoken publicly about Facebook in the past, most recently when he announced in April that he planned to quit Facebook because he didn't think the company respected user privacy or data.\n\n\"Users provide every detail of their life to Facebook and ... Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this,\" Wozniak said in an email to USA Today at the time. \"The profits are all based on the user's info, but the users get none of the profits back.\"\n\nHe added: \"Apple makes its money off of good products, not off of you. As they say, with Facebook, you are the product.\"\n\nWozniak isn't the only person related to Apple who has taken shots at Facebook while playing up Apple's strengths in privacy. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been voicing a similar argument since 2014, and he recently asserted in an interview that he would never be in the situation Facebook and Zuckerberg are in now."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tanza Loudenback", "title": "People are outraged Kim and Kanye reportedly hired private firefighters to protect their $60 million mansion from the California wildfires \u2014 but it's not that uncommon", "description": "The Woolsey fire has burned nearly 100,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

Thousands of people in mobile-home parks and tony gated communities alike have been displaced. Many have lost their homes completely.\n\nCalifornia government officials have estimated that more than 1 million homes throughout the state are located in \"high-risk\" fire areas. That's a lot of property to protect when a fast-moving wildfire is approaching, and county fire departments and volunteers often can't manage the job alone.\n\nSo, when the Woolsey fire approached celebrity power couple Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West's $60 million Hidden Hills property last week, TMZ reported that they called on a \"private team of firefighters\" to help. Their mansion was ultimately saved from destruction, as were their neighbors' homes.\n\nTo be clear, the Wests don't have a team of firefighters on speed dial akin to a Kardashian \"glam squad.\" The benefit likely comes from their insurance company, to which they pay a premium \u2014 and probably a steep one at that, considering they're located in a \"very high fire hazard severity zone\" as deemed by Cal Fire.\n\nRead more: Wildfires in California have destroyed thousands of homes, and the devastating pattern is making fire insurance more expensive and complicated than ever\n\nWildfire Defense Systems is one of America's largest groups of private firefighters. The Montana-based company is contracted with several insurers, including multinational-insurance-company Chubb, which dispatches its employees to 21 states to supplement the efforts of first responders during a wildfire. They also perform preventive measures in high-risk areas, like clearing flammable debris and spraying flame retardant around a property.\n\nSome insurance companies employ their own firefighting or fire mitigation groups. American International Group's (AIG) \"Wildfire Protection Unit\" serves policyholders in the Private Client Group, Stephen Poux, the insurance company's global head of risk management and loss prevention, told NBC News.\n\nThese policyholders make up 42% of the Forbes 400 rich list, Poux added, and they pay anywhere from \"several thousand dollars to several tens-of-thousands\" to insure their homes against fires and gain access to at-home consultations from fire specialists throughout the year and ongoing monitoring during a wildfire. While they may visit a home during a wildfire to spray flame retardant and clear brush, they don't \"actively fight fires,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nA helicopter drops water on a brush fire behind a home during the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California. AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu\n\nIn tweet replies to TMZ's story, many people express outrage, calling private firefighters a privilege for rich people. Some supporters of the Wests say they'd do it too, if they had the money.\n\nRobert Raymond in the Huffington Post argues that while it's nice people are able to protect their homes, the high cost of coverage for these services is problematic. \"The real injustice in this story is structural inequality,\" he wrote.\n\nRaymond continued: \"Wealth shouldn't mean the difference between a home that burns down and a home that doesn't. A society where wealth allows one neighborhood to be saved, while a poorer neighborhood goes up in flames because the people there weren't able to purchase the same resources, is inherently unjust.\"\n\nRead more: 10 photos show the grim reality for evacuees of California's wildfires\n\nBut David Torgerson, the president of Wildfire Defense Systems, said their services aren't only available to the affluent. In fact, he told The Atlantic, nine in 10 homes they protect are of \"average value\" and not covered through insurance companies specific to wealthy homeowners.\n\n\"We serve nearly a dozen [insurance companies],\" Torgerson said. \"If anybody wants to have this supplemental response capability during a fire, they need to pick an insurance company that has it.\" He added that with the growing threat of climate change, private firefighting services are more necessary than ever.\n\nA Sonoma County couple who spoke to NBC News credits the supplemental efforts of Wildfire Defense Systems for saving their home during the wine country wildfire last fall \u2014 the most destructive in California history.\n\nThe couple said they didn't know they had fire protection under their policy until Chubb contacted them to offer an update on their home. Some of their neighbors weren't so lucky. Unlike publicly funded firefighters, Torgerson said, \"We're only allowed to access the properties that we're given permission to access by policyholders.\"\n\nSome critics also express concern over whether private firefighters contracted by insurance companies are properly trained and adherent to plans and regulations set in place by public fire stations."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Antonio Villas-Boas", "title": "A $580 phone from a small smartphone maker that competes against Apple and Samsung phones has been selling out at around 50% of T-Mobile stores nationwide", "description": "Two weeks after launching, the OnePlus 6T smartphone has been selling out in about half of the T-Mobile stores nationwide due to high demand.

For many T-Mobile customers, especially those who don't read tech news, the OnePlus 6T could be the first OnePlus phone they lay eyes on.\n\nWhile it's not clear how many OnePlus 6T smartphones the company has sold so far, it's an impressive feat for a phone and phone maker that relatively few in the US know about, at least when you compare the OnePlus' popularity to Apple and Samsung phones. The company previously said that it sold 86% more OnePlus 6Ts during the first day of sales than it did with the previous model, the OnePlus 6, on its first day of sales.\n\nWith that in mind, OnePlus 6T sales seem poised to surpass those of the previous OnePlus 6. The company reported earlier this year that it had sold one million of the previous OnePlus 6 phones in the month after launch. That's significantly less than the number of phones Apple and Samsung will sell in a month, but it was nonetheless an important milestone for a small company like OnePlus.\n\nOnePlus has grown in popularity in the US despite the fact that its previous smartphones have not been sold in carrier stores, where most Americans buy their smartphones.

Despite the previous unavailability of OnePlus devices at carrier stores, OnePlus fans would often line up outside of OnePlus popup stores to buy the new model.\n\nWhen the OnePlus 6T were first made available at T-Mobile, the T-Mobile flagship store in Times Square in New York City saw a longer line than it did for the new iPhones."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tiana Attride", "title": "14 of the smallest animals on Earth", "description": "Humans are so small compared to some animals; next to creatures like elephants and whales, we seem minuscule.

There are longstanding efforts on the right and among anti-Semitic groups to paint Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who survived the Holocaust before making his fortune, as the shadowy figure behind all sorts of wild conspiracies. Most recently, he's been accused of being the behind-the-scenes funder of the caravan of migrants that has been slowly making its way to the southern US border.\n\nYou can draw a straight line to such conspiracy theories about Soros from the centuries-old anti-Semitic tropes about rich Jewish financiers running the world and secretly undermining the people and government of the countries in which they live.\n\nRead this: Mark Zuckerberg's spectacular failure of leadership shows why some Facebook investors are desperate to fire him\n\nThose vile conspiracies are not simply discussion points among the misguided or misinformed in random internet chat rooms. They've taken hold among racists and bigots \u2014 including on Facebook \u2014 and have had real-world consequences.\n\nSoros himself has been the target of multiple death threats, Patrick Gaspard, the president of the financier's Open Society Foundations, said in a letter to Sandberg on Wednesday. Indeed, Soros was among the liberal critics of President Trump who were sent pipe bombs last month. Those bombs were allegedly sent by Cesar Sayoc, who was reportedly obsessed with Soros and Soros-related conspiracy theories.\n\nSimilarly, the alleged gunman who killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last month was also reportedly roused by conspiracy theories involving Soros.\n\nZuck passed the buck\n\nBut the conspiracy theories involving Soros date back to times long before the caravan started heading northward or the pipe bombs started being mailed out to him and others. When Definers started peddling its own Soros conspiracy theory this summer on Facebook's behalf, the broader anti-Semitic trope had long been established. A company that had any ethical compass at all wouldn't have gone there \u2014 and wouldn't have authorized its public relations firm to do so.\n\nSoros has long been the central figure in conspiracy theories. Sean Gallup/Getty Facebook announced Thursday that it had cancelled its contract with Definers. On a conference call with journalists later in the day, Zuckerberg said he hadn't known about the relationship with the PR firm until he read about it in The Times' report and ended it soon after. He also seemed to imply that Sandberg likewise hadn't known about the relationship with Definers.\n\nIt's hard to know what to make of Zuckerberg's assertion that he hadn't known about Definers. But either way it looks bad. Either he was oblivious to a major public-relations effort that had obvious implications for the company's reputation and perception, or he's someone who oversaw an anti-Semitic smear campaign and is now lying about it.\n\nIt's even harder to believe that Sandberg didn't know about and approve of the effort. She oversees Facebook's business, and its PR group directly reports to her. Indeed, The Times reported that she oversaw the company's broader effort to hit back at its critics.\n\nAt some point, though, it doesn't matter whether they knew about the Soros smear. They head the company. The buck is supposed to stop with them.\n\nWhere's the repudiation or the sense of shame?\n\nAnd regardless of their prior knowledge, there's something even more appalling about Facebook and Zuckerberg's response to The Time's report \u2014 they didn't repudiate the Soros smear.\n\nSheryl Sandberg. Paul Morigi/ Getty Images On the call, Zuckerberg said he has \"tremendous respect\" for the financier, although he disagrees with him about his stance on Facebook. The company hadn't intended to attack \"an individual,\" he said, but to call attention to the fact that anti-Facebook groups weren't simply grassroots efforts and were getting funding from him.\n\nBut not once did Zuckerberg acknowledge the anti-Semitic overtones of that effort or the fact that variations of that same smear have had deadly consequences.\n\nFacebook has been heavily criticized for much of the last two years over everything from security and privacy violations to the spread of misinformation. If you had any questions about whether the company's leadership has the moral and ethical chops to contend with these society-rattling problems, Zuckerberg's refusal to repudiate the Soros smear was all the answer you needed.\n\nNow read:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Uma Sharma and Ali Newhard", "title": "What happens when you procrastinate too much", "description": "Procrastination feels great to us because we aren't always fans of working, but it's not so great for our brains.

It's easy: Procrastinating feels great. But it's not so great for your brain since it pits two of your brain's heavy hitters, your limbic system, and your prefrontal cortex into a literal head-to-head match.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video.\n\nMost of us have procrastinated at some point in our lives. But about one in every five of us are compulsive about it. Putting off tasks and chores nearly every chance they get.\n\nThey're called chronic procrastinators. And it turns out, this behavior does a lot more damage than you might think.\n\nWe get it, doing work is hard.\n\nBut when you choose to watch TV over doing laundry or washing the dishes you've just launched an all-out battle in your brain.\n\nOn one side is your prefrontal cortex. That's the part of your brain that sets long-term goals and regulates self-control. It's telling you that those dishes aren't going to clean themselves.\n\nOn the opposing side is your limbic system. It deals with pleasure, arousal, and reward.\n\nAnd it's telling you that washing dishes is no fun, and you'll have a better time doing something else. So, procrastination essentially puts your brain in its happy place.\n\nIt feels good. That's why you do it. But just because it feels good doesn't necessarily mean it's good for you.\n\nFor example, several studies have found that undergraduate college students who procrastinated had a lower GPA in the latter half of the semester compared to non-procrastinators.\n\nThey were also more likely to get sick, based on their healthcare visits.\n\nMoreover, other studies have found that procrastinators report higher levels of guilt and anxiety when they choose to procrastinate in the first place.\n\nAnd if you keep it up, researchers have found that chronic procrastination is linked to: low self-confidence, Low energy, And depression.\n\nOverall, your quality of life will probably be worse, than if you just listened to your prefrontal cortex. And you may think that you just have a different workflow or that you perform better under pressure.\n\nBut, sorry to say, there are no studies to support any benefits of chronic procrastination. Bottom line: it's unhealthy. But not all hope is lost.\n\nIn fact, researchers have conducted dozens of scientific studies in search for ways to help procrastinators. What they've found time and again is that how you think about tasks can make a huge difference in how likely you are to procrastinate on them.\n\nTasks like saving for retirement, for example, can be abstract: There's no immediate deadline, so you can always start tomorrow. And it's this mentality that can lead you to procrastinate.\n\nInstead, make your tasks more concrete in your mind.\n\nFor example, a study in 2011 discovered that people given an illustration of how they might look at retirement age were more likely to say they would save money for retirement, than people without an illustration.\n\nThe image was something tangible. And, therefore, painted a more concrete picture of their inevitable future.\n\nWhatever the task, do your health a favor and do the work. You might just enjoy that TV show even more once you get to it."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb", "title": "Sony might skip the world's biggest video game event next year, despite the fact that the PlayStation 4 is the most popular console on the market (SNE)", "description": "According to a report from Variety, Sony's PlayStation branch has declined to attend E3, the video game industry's largest annual conference, next year.

Random events are statistically independent if the outcome of one doesn't affect the outcome of another. A basic example of independent events would be a pair of coin flips: If I flip one coin and get heads, that has absolutely no bearing on whether or not I will get heads or tails when flipping the second coin.\n\nLottery drawings like Powerball are explicitly designed so that drawings are independent of each other. In a Powerball drawing, 69 numbered white balls are placed in a cage, and 26 red \"powerballs\" are placed in a second cage. Five white balls are drawn at random from the first cage, and one ball is drawn from the 26 red balls. Match the numbers on all six balls, and you win the jackpot prize.\n\nRead more: Buying enough lottery tickets to cover every possible combination sounds like a surefire way to win \u2014 but there are 3 major problems with that plan\n\nSuch a setup, properly executed, will ensure that drawings are independent of each other. We are starting each drawing the same way, with having two cages full of balls, shaking up those collections of balls, and pulling out the same number of balls from the cages. There is no way any meaningful information could be carried over from one drawing to the next.\n\nGiven the independence of drawings, there is no reason any fixed set of numbers would be more likely from one drawing to the next. It would be entirely possible for Bailey's lucky numbers to come up again next week, or to not come up again for years. Since drawings are independent, there is no difference between playing the same numbers in multiple drawings and choosing completely different sets each week.\n\nOne reason that this property of the lottery might be surprising to some is that many probabilistic events in everyday life are not statistically independent, making the lottery seem a bit weird at first glance. Day-to-day weather patterns are not independent from each other\u2014 if it was sunny today, there's a good chance it will be sunny tomorrow, and if the high temperature today was 35 degrees Fahrenheit, it's unlikely that tomorrow's high will be 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSimilarly, stock price movements are often correlated with each other. Bad news for one company could drive up the stock price of a competitor, or troubling economic developments could lead to investors broadly selling off lots of stocks over the course of several days.\n\nDespite many things not showing statistical independence, games like Powerball are intentionally and explicitly designed in such a way that drawings are independent from each other. Because of that independence, it does not matter whether you use the same numbers every week or not."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Lulu Chang", "title": "Microsoft has revealed its Black Friday deals for the Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, and Xbox One", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

According to research firm Diar, bitcoin miners amassed $4.7 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2018. But with crypto prices falling and an increase in computing power competing for mining rewards, profitability has dropped.\n\nMining, in general, is a process of solving complicated math problems to get compensated by new coins, like bitcoin or ether. Machines run 24/7 to execute a protocol to resolve those math problems. The first computer, or a group of computers, that solve the problem can receive slices of the currencies in return. In the midst of the cryptocurrency craze, sophisticated investors set up machines at home to mine those digital assets and sell them, in addition to trading cryptos on exchanges.\n\nWhether you can make money depends on the efficiency of the mining rig, the cost of electricity, and the price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn bitcoin mining, the industry has been rapidly evolved, with miners using gears equipped with specially designed mining chips, called ASIC, short for application-specific integrated circuit.\n\nBut even with those advanced kits, it would still be hard for miners to be profitable at scale, according to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Tai, who is also a board member of BitFury, which produces mining hardware.\n\n\"You have to be able to source electricity at scale and at prices of less than 10 cents,\" he said.\n\nAccording to a report by advisory firm Fundstrat, the breakeven price for bitcoin mining is $7,300, assuming that miners are using the powerful bitcoin miner Antminer S9 ASIC and paying an electricity cost of $0.06.\n\n\"What's at the heart of the crypto mining industry is a hash rate battle and a low energy consumption battle,\" said Martin Leblanc, founder and CEO of Nuvoo, a Canadian cryptocurrency mining company.\n\nSee also:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Remi Rosmarin", "title": "17 of the best deals you can get now at Cole Haan \u2014 plus all the details of its Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

SkyBridge's flagship fund, $4.9 billion Series G, returned minus 0.2% net of fees in October, according to the firm. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Total Return Index was down 6.8% and the HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index returned minus 2.7%.\n\nHedge funds overall saw their worst month since May 2010, leading JPMorgan to predict $5 billion to $10 billion of outflows per quarter in 2019. Series G concentrates its bets on a few hedge funds, with 70% of the capital going to 10 managers.\n\nScaramucci was adamant that he has no plans to relinquish his business. In late 2016, he announced a sale to HNA, a Chinese conglomerate that has struggled to receive approval for multiple deals from the US government committee that approves transactions to foreign buyers. The SkyBridge sale, reportedly valued at $180 million, was officially scuttled in April.\n\nWould Scaramucci consider a minority stake sale now?\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" he said. \"I'm 100% committed to the firm. I've got re-religion on the business. Remember, this was my business. I started it from scratch.\"\n\nHe has \"no interest\" in working in DC again or in selling a piece of the firm after recent experience. Instead, he's focusing on bringing SALT back to Las Vegas in the spring and to its first Middle East location, yet to be announced, for fall 2019. Scaramucci is also busy readying a fund to invest in opportunity zones, which he thinks could raise up to $3 billion.\n\nRead more: Anthony Scaramucci is looking to raise as much as $3 billion for a new fund that invests in low-income neighborhoods\n\n\"I'm very, very bullish on my firm, and I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

Norway's Torstein Horgmo became the first person to ever land a triple cork in 2013, eight years after the first men's double cork.\n\nFor that reason, Gasser was pretty nervous about attempting the jump. After she landed, she held her hand up to the camera to show how much she was shaking.\n\n\"I tried it once before on the airbag at Kreischberg, but it didn't feel very good and I was about to take that goal off my list,\" Gasser told Red Bull's Thomas Wernhart. \"It's a trick with consequences, and you really have to put everything on the line if you want to succeed. You can easily overrotate on the third flip which makes landing safely impossible.\"\n\nGasser is no stranger to taking risks to make history. She burst onto the snowboarding scene back in 2015 by becoming the first woman to land a cab double underflip in competition. Gasser also won the gold medal in the Olympic debut of the women's Big Air category at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nBut this first may very well have been the biggest of her career, and to make an already incredible feat even more surreal, the four-time X Games medalist pulled off the stunt on her first try.\n\n\"Everything felt so natural and after a few warm-up jumps I started to step it up a bit,\" Gasser told Red Bull. \"My first few double corks on the huge kicker felt really good. So after a while, I decided to just go for the triple. The take-off was in perfect condition, I had a lot of pop and felt in control in the air - so I just decided to go for it!

Kanaman was an \"altruistic donor,\" meaning he was willing to donate a kidney without knowing the potential recipient.\n\nThe university hospital told Jordan she was also a better match for a person on the transplant list whom she didn't know, Lauro Zuniga.\n\nJordan agreed to give her kidney to Zuniga if Kanaman donated his to Hosman, starting the kidney donation chain.\n\nZuniga's mom, Carolina Perez, wasn't a match for her son. But when Jordan agreed to give her kidney to Zuniga, Perez then found out she could give one of her kidneys to a stranger on the university hospital's list, Matt Lewis.\n\nDonation chains are rare because they require extensive planning by hospitals, starting from when a donor wants to give to a person that they aren't a good match with. The hospital then can find the donor a recipient that they match with but don't know, sparking conversations to find donor-recipient matches that make the best fit.\n\nSix surgeries were conducted at the two hospitals on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30.

When colleges 'encourage' you to schedule an 'optional' interview, they mean 'required'\n\nColleges want to see demonstrated interest because it indicates your likelihood to enroll there if admitted.\n\nThe reason they want to know your likelihood to attend is two-fold: 1) to make sure they enroll their target number of students; and 2) to protect their yield, that is, the percentage of admitted students who enroll.\n\nYield matters because it impacts a school's rankings. A school with a high yield will be seen as more desirable and be associated with greater prestige.\n\nIf you don't accept a college's interview offer, the admissions committee will doubt your willingness to go there, which would hurt their yield.\n\nTherefore, consider the admissions interview a requirement to show schools your willingness to attend.\n\n2. Clearly demonstrate your fit with the school\n\nConsider the following two students' responses while being interviewed for admission to Columbia:\n\nStudent 1: \"I love philosophy and want to study it in college.\"\n\nStudent 2: \"I'm so excited about the prospect of studying philosophy at Columbia because several professors specialize in metaphysics, my area of greatest interest.\"\n\nClearly, Student 2 has communicated how Columbia is the perfect academic \"fit.\" Moreover, based on these two responses, the interviewer will assume that Columbia professor will also be interested in teaching Student 2.\n\nDon't just consider what the school can offer you. Consider what the school wants to see in its student body as well.\n\nRelated: I've been helping kids get into top colleges for nearly 15 years, and parents always seem to ask me the wrong questions\n\n3. Mention aspects of your background not covered on your college application\n\nDo you wish you had additional room on your college application to discuss a critical aspect of your background?\n\nCollege interviews offer the perfect opportunity to do just that.\n\nAdmissions interviewers are advised to encourage students to share things about themselves they weren't able to \u2014 or didn't feel comfortable to \u2014 discuss on their application.\n\nThis is not a license to over share. However, you could bring up a personal difficulty that led to low grades during sophomore year or a hobby that occupies a significant amount of time. The interviewer will then report that information to the school for consideration.\n\n4. Enthusiastically discuss your interests\n\nCollege admissions committees love accepting students who are intellectually curious and who go deeper with anything than surface-level pursuits \u2014 whether academic or non-academic.\n\nTherefore, it's important to discuss how you spend your time on serious hobbies, such as building robots, hiking, or Middle Eastern history.\n\nFor example, a student who simply says they love to hike will not come off as impressive as a student who describes how they spent three weeks one summer hiking the Appalachian Trail with their mom, and how the experience brought them closer.\n\nRelated:A New York SAT tutor who charges $1,500 an hour shares his top pieces of advice for nailing the exam\n\n5. Come prepared with specific questions about the school\n\nAlumni interviewers love their school. Otherwise, they wouldn't volunteer their time to interview applicants for admissions.\n\nAt the end of each interview, your interviewer will ask whether you have any questions about the school.\n\nIf you don't have any questions, you will not demonstrate interest. Rather, you will seem disinterested.\n\nInstead, make sure to research the school's site thoroughly prior to your interview and come with specific questions that you were unable to find answers to online.\n\nEven if your interviewer doesn't know the answer, you'll show them you did your homework and are taking a serious interest in their school.\n\n6. Send a thank you note within 24 hours\n\nAdmissions interviewers are asked to submit a report about their experience meeting with you.\n\nSending a thank you note to your interviewer within 24 hours will not only demonstrate courtesy, but also leave one final positive impression before they submit their feedback.\n\nInclude in your note specific reasons why you appreciated their time and insights. For instance, did they provide information about campus life that strengthened your already strong interest to attend? Let them know.\n\nDr. Shirag Shemmassian is the founder of Shemmassian Academic Consulting and a college admissions expert who has helped hundreds of students get into top schools such as Harvard and Princeton. He is also a former Cornell admissions interviewer.\n\nGrowing up with Tourette Syndrome in a middle-class family, Dr. Shemmassian was often mocked by peers and teachers and discouraged from applying to elite colleges. So he taught himself everything he needed to know to graduate debt-free with his B.S. in Human Development from Cornell and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from UCLA.\n\nDr. Shemmassian has been featured on The Washington Post, US News, and NBC, as well as been invited to speak at Stanford, Yale, and UCLA.

So far, $360 billion worth of goods has now been subject to duties.\n\nBut after months of tough talk, multiple members of the Trump administration \u2014 even the president himself\u2014 have started to suggest a possible deal.\n\nThe most significant sign that the US and China may actually come to some agreement came late Wednesday, after reports surfaced that Beijing sent a letter to the Trump administration outlining possible concessions.\n\nThe letter comes as Chinese officials restarted trade discussions with their counterparts in Washington. Trump and Xi held a formal phone call on November 1 \u2014 the first substantial contact between the two leaders in weeks.\n\nAnd the internal dynamics within Trump's economic team also seem to favor progress on a deal.\n\nPeter Navarro.

But political and economic hits of late may point to the cause.\n\nThe GOP was thumped in US House of Representatives elections in what was seen, at least in part, as a repudiation of Trump. While some observers thought that the loss may light a fire under the president to push the trade war to the next level, it may have had the opposite effect.\n\nIt's unclear just how much of an effect the trade war had on key races \u2014 according to The Wall Street Journal, the GOP won 10 of 19 competitive House races with soybean production of over 2 million bushels \u2014 but exit polling showed that 29% of voters thought the tariffs hurt their local economy, while 37% said it had no impact.\n\nSome analysts also observed that the solid economy helped blunt at least some of the Democrats' \"blue wave,\" and any long-term economic damage from a drawn-out trade war could undermine Trump's strongest argument going into 2020.\n\nJim Young/Reuters\n\nSeveral worrying economic sings could also have pushed Trump toward a potential deal:\n\nA d\u00e9tente is not a done deal\n\nHowever, Michael Zezas, head of US public-policy research at Morgan Stanley, cautioned Thursday that further escalation of the trade conflict is still the most likely scenario coming out of the G20 meeting.\n\n\"To reiterate: The increasingly constructive tone is likely masking ongoing, fundamental disagreements beneath the surface,\" Zezas wrote. \"Hence, our base case remains that escalation of trade tensions will continue.\"\n\nTo Zezas' point, the Trump administration has been going after China \u2014 just not through tariffs \u2014 over the past few weeks. For example, the Department of Justice has brought charges against a slew of Chinese firms for alleged economic espionage over the past month and launched a task force to combat those practices.\n\nTrump's unpredictability in international settings also has the chance to throw a wrench into any good will. As noted by Chris Krueger, a strategist at Cowen Washington Research Group, Trump does not have the best track record when it comes to international meetings.\n\n\"It is somewhat surreal to state, but this meeting will be hugely influenced by Trump's mood and his previous performances at foreign multilateral summits (G7, NATO, Paris trip last week) have poor records of dealmaking (quite the opposite),\" Krueger said Thursday.\n\nThere is a lot of room for the trade war to get worse.\n\nTrump has threatened to hit the remaining $257 billion worth of Chinese goods not caught up in the conflict with tariffs \u2014 and the 10% tariff on the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods currently hit with restrictions is set to increase to 25% come January 1."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Julia Tell", "title": "10 scams you should watch out for this tax season, and how to avoid them", "description": "The IRS, other government agencies, and banks have been warning us about these emails for years, but they continue to be a problem.

Why? Because you don't have to go lay down on 15 beds while someone follows you around trying to sell you upgrades, there's usually no exorbitant delivery fee, and you get to try it out in your home without any pressure for 100 nights (as the new industry standard goes). So really, why not?\n\nThere are a lot of great direct-to-consumer mattress options to consider, and Leesa Sleep is one of them. We ranked Leesa's Sapira Mattress and Leesa Mattress as the best mattresses you can buy overall because they suit all sleeping styles. So did The Wirecutter.\n\nThey also happen to be running their Black Friday deal right now \u2014 making their already accessible prices even better. Right now, you can get a new Leesa mattress for up to $235 off its original price. You'll also receive the classic Leesa Pillow ($75) that took them a few years and hundreds of prototypes to make for free.\n\nLeesa's Black Friday deals:\n\nTake $160 off a Leesa mattress and get a free pillow ($75 originally) [use code \"BUSINESSINSIDER\" at checkout]\n\nTake $235 off a Sapira mattress and get a free pillow ($75 originally) [use code \"BUSINESSINSIDER\" at checkout]\n\nIf you need a new foundation, too, you can also get $75 off the Leesa Platform Bed (now $720 for queen size) and $100 off the company's adjustable base (now $945 for queen size). You can find a review for the adjustable base here.\n\nWe've reviewed both their newly updated classic Leesa mattress as well as their luxury Sapira option, but the break down is pretty simple.\n\nLeesa has done so well in a saturated direct-to-consumer mattress space thanks to its excellent customer service model and a universally comfortable mattress. The company claims its mattress can comfortably accommodate all body shapes and types of sleepers, and that because of its unique design, you don't have to choose between either plush or firm. In person, we liked them so much we ranked the Leesa mattresses best in our comprehensive Buying Guide, and we have similarly positive views of the Hybrid Pillow ($125) and Leesa blanket ($149), which reporter Lulu Chang called one of the most well-made, comfortable blankets she'd ever used after testing.\n\nIt's also a certified B Corp that has donated more than 30,000 mattresses to those in need and plants one tree for every mattress sold.\n\nSkip the awkward showroom, get your mattress delivered to your door, and spend 100 nights risk-free trying it out. No pressure. If you're looking for a new mattress, you might want to check out Leesa's options right now considering how heavily they're marked down.\n\nLooking for more deals?

And it also works with Amazon's Alexa, so when a user is about to leave the house \u2014 and soon when they're in the car as well, via the forthcoming Echo Auto \u2014 they can reserve a garage spot at their destination. This continues to build on the useful capabilities Amazon offers through Alexa, and the investment indicates that the e-commerce giant would welcome the growth of this sort of service, which already boasts 40 million customers.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, updated the capabilities of its Assistant to augment its routine integration and home-management tools.

To strengthen the community's relief efforts, our Chico store along with Walmart stores in the surrounding communities have provided continuous support with donations of food, water, personal care items, blankets, pillows, hygiene products and other necessities.\"\n\nWilson said that local stores have \"donated funds, supplies, and merchandise to local shelters, the American Red Cross, Butte County Sheriff, Hope Center and local churches among others.\"\n\nRead more: I t was a thriving town of 27,000, and now it's smoldering ash; here's how Paradise, California, became a fire trap\n\nOn November 12, actor James Woods asked Walmart to keep the bathrooms in the store open for evacuees via Twitter. The company replied that it would provide fire victims with portable bathrooms, blankets, sleeping bags, and water.\n\nBay Area news station Kron 4 reported that volunteers were converging on the parking lot as well, passing out free meals, clothing, and water, and managing donations.\n\n\"All of us here are in the same situation \u2014 whether you lost a trailer or a really nice home, we're all in the same place,\" fire evacuee Laura Whitaker told The Chico Enterprise-Record.\n\nOther evacuees in the camp told the local newspaper that Walmart had given them a $100 gift card.\n\nOn its Facebook page, Walmart's Chico location said that the company has created a foundation for Camp Fire victims. The company will reportedly donate $500,000 to the cause.\n\n\"Walmart has been a part of the Chico community for nearly 25 years and our hearts go out to everyone affected by this natural disaster,\" Wilson said in a statement to Business Insider. \"We know this is a difficult time and want our customers, associates and neighbors to be safe and have the support they need.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's inquiry about CBS Sacramento's report that the company asked fire victims to vacate the parking lot by 1 p.m. on Sunday, Wilson said that Walmart has not set any relocation deadlines for evacuees.\n\n\"We share the city and county's concern for the health, safety and well-being of all the wildfire evacuees,\" Wilson said. \"While we are happy to have been able to provide an immediate place of escape from the wildfire, we understand that our parking lots are not a viable long-term housing solution and are working closely with the American Red Cross, the County and local organizations to best preserve the health and safety of those impacted by the Camp Fire.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Shana Lebowitz and \u00c1ine Cain", "title": "17 signs you're intelligent \u2014 even if doesn't feel like it", "description": "Stupid people tend to overestimate their competence, while smart people tend to sell themselves short.

That's higher than the last figure the CDC released earlier this year, which suggested a 30% rise in suicides.\n\n\"Rates will likely continue to go up if we don't, as a society, really put more emphasis on comprehensive suicide prevention,\" CDC report author and suicide prevention researcher Deb Stone told Business Insider.\n\n\"Everybody can learn the warning signs for suicide and know how to respond,\" she added. \"It's not a weakness to need help.\"\n\nMen overall have some of the highest suicide rates, especially elderly men over the age of 75. But when the researchers broke suicide data down by profession, construction workers had the highest rates of suicide among men. The new numbers didn't take into account suicide rates among unemployed men or those working in the military, which makes it tough to know for sure which group of men is truly most at risk.\n\n\"There are some occupation groups that probably do have a culture ... where they have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps,\" Stone said. \"But it doesn't have to be that way.\"\n\nThere's also been a troublingly steep increase in suicides among men between the ages of 45 and 64, as well as a rise in so-called \"deaths of despair\" from drug, alcohol, and suicide among white, middle-aged men without a college degree.\n\nFor women, the data suggests that those with \"unpaid occupations\" \u2014 mainly students, stay-at-home-moms, incarcerated women, and those who are unemployed \u2014 had the highest number of female suicides in both 2012 and 2015 (the two years for which researchers compared suicide rates between professions). Other recent CDC data suggests that teen girls, who have traditionally accounted for a very small portion of suicides, are also taking their own lives at alarmingly high rates.\n\nInterestingly, the authors of the new report noted that teachers and librarians have some of the lowest suicide rates when professions are compared. (But that doesn't mean there's anything special about being a teacher or librarian that might lower the risk of suicide.)\n\n\"Suicide can happen to anybody,\" the CDC's Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters on a call earlier this year.\n\nSuicide is now the second leading cause of death for all Americans from 10 to 34 years old.\n\nRead More: Anthony Bourdain's death is part of a disturbing trend in the US that's getting much worse\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nNo one is immune\n\nAlthough some groups have higher suicide rates than others, the overall trend holds true for people across generations, races, income brackets, and professions. The authors of the new report point out that job insecurity, unemployment, and relationship problems can all play a role in suicide risk, but the factors that lead to an individual suicide are complicated.\n\nIn the US, another big factor may be that many people don't seek treatment for mental-health issues. Even though more than 50% of people in the US will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point, only half receive treatment. The problem is deadly: a 2015 report from the CDC suggested that more than one in 10 (13.2%) people who took their own lives had a history of psychiatric illness but were not receiving treatment at the time of their suicide. That lack of treatment can either be because the healthcare system makes it prohibitively expensive to seek care, or because mental-health services simply aren't available where people live.\n\nJohn Mann, a psychiatrist at Columbia University, studies the causes of depression and suicide. He previously told Business Insider that several factors had most likely contributed to America's rising suicide rates, but lack of access to good preventative care is a big part of the equation.\n\n\"We have a serious, national problem in terms of adequate recognition of psychiatric illnesses and their treatment,\" Mann said. \"That is the single most effective suicide-prevention method in Western nations.\"\n\nA 2014 study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that of all practicing medical providers in the US, therapists were the least likely to take insurance. In 2010, only 55% of psychiatrists accepted insurance plans, compared with 89% of other healthcare professionals, like cardiologists, dermatologists, and podiatrists.\n\nStigmas about seeing a therapist or going to counseling are an issue, too.\n\n\"We need to make more of an effort at getting people who aren't good at seeking help, like men, to go and get help,\" Mann said.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nMario Tama / Getty Images\n\nThe authors of the report wrote that \"because many adults spend a substantial amount of their time at work, the workplace is an important but underutilized location for suicide prevention.\"\n\nThe agency offers a 62-page manual called \"Preventing Suicide\" online, and it suggests that fostering more social connections at work and at home can help improve mental health and decrease depression rates.\n\n\"Connectedness and social capital together may protect against suicidal behaviors by decreasing isolation, encouraging adaptive coping behaviors, and by increasing belongingness, personal value, and worth, to help build resilience in the face of adversity,\" the authors of the manual wrote.\n\nAdditionally, asking your coworkers, family, and friends how they're doing and really listening to what they say in return is a small, simple first step. The National Council for Behavioral Health has published a Mental Health First Aid handbook that can serve as a how-to guide for talking about mental health.\n\nThe book advises people not to shy away from asking someone in their life about suicidal thoughts if they think that person may be at risk.\n\n\"Do not avoid using the word 'suicide,'\" the book says. \"It is important to ask the question without dread and without expressing a negative judgment.\"\n\nAsking \"are you having thoughts of suicide?\" or \"are you thinking about killing yourself?\" are both fine ways to start a conversation.\n\nIt's a myth that talking about suicide might somehow plant the idea in a person's mind (it won't) and telling someone you care and want to help is always a good idea. Mental-health trainers say one of the best things you can do for someone is express concern and willingness to help \u2014 then let them do most of the talking.\n\nReminding someone that suicidal thoughts are common and often associated with a treatable mental disorder can also be a way to support them. Ask that person to think about some things that may have helped them in the past, like a doctor, therapist, family member, or friend. Don't ever use guilt or threats to try to prevent a suicide.\n\n\"Help people,\" Schuchat said. \"Look for those warning signs in people you love and care for.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jeremy Berke", "title": "Big brand executives are rushing into the cannabis industry hoping to tap into a $194 billion industry", "description": "Executives from big retail brands and consumer packaged goods companies are pouring into the rapidly maturing cannabis industry.

The script made it to Stone in 2015 (she plays one of the cousins opposite Rachel Weisz), and she could immediately tell from the first read that the work had been put in.\n\n(L-R) Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone in \"The Favourite.\" Fox Searchlight \"Just to read it and say, 'Okay, it's great as it is,' is pretty infrequent,\" Stone told Business Insider. \"So it's incredible when you find it.\"\n\nStone even went a step further and gave this surprising revelation to compliment the work done by Lanthimos and McNamara:\n\n\"I would say 'The Favourite' is the first film that I've done in four years that I wasn't constantly calling, writing, fixing, begging, pleading, changing,\" she said. \"I'm usually very involved.\"\n\n\"The Favourite\" was shot in early 2017, and previous to that Stone had starred in the Cameron Crowe flop \"Aloha\" (2015), the acclaimed \"Battles of the Sexes\" (2017), and \"La La Land\" (2016), which she won a best actress Oscar for.\n\nStone said it felt great working on \"The Favourite\" and not having to worry about changing a single line of dialogue or piece of story structure.\n\n\"It feels amazing when the script is right and the director is right and you are like, 'Now I can go and have fun and trust the process,'\" she said. But for Lanthimos to get to that comfort level with Stone, he admitted he needed some convincing first.\n\nBack in 2015, before Stone had even begun shooting \"La La Land,\" Lanthimos had Stone audition for the role of the cousin, Abigail. It was less to gauge her acting skills, the director said, and more to see if the two were a good fit to work together and to make sure Stone could deliver a convincing English accent.\n\n(L-R) Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone. AP Though an audition was an unorthodox ask for someone at Stone's level of stardom, she said she didn't feel insulted having to come in to read because it gave her the same opportunity to make sure she could work with Lanthimos. And at the end of the day, Lanthimos got the confirmation he needed.\n\n\"We had a few sessions with a dialect coach and we went through a few scenes and I worked with her the way I work with all the actors during rehearsals,\" Lanthimos said. \"Then after hearing the dialect coach and English people I know saying, 'That is fine, you have nothing to worry about, just go ahead,' we were good. I just didn't want her to feel uncomfortable while we were making the movie, or make a fool of herself.\"\n\nStone is far from that in \"The Favourite.\" Playing the scheming Abigail, she delivers a layered performance that's filled with manipulation and dark comedy as her character cooks up ways to make Queen Anne forget about Sarah (Weisz). It's led to Stone once more gaining Oscar buzz for her performance.\n\nBut Stone being just an actress didn't last. Soon after wrapping on \"The Favourite,\" she was back to being an involved collaborator, this time alongside director Cary Fukunaga on the Netflix series she starred opposite Jonah Hill, \"Maniac.\" She admitted that her style comes off \"probably annoying\" sometimes, but it's the only way she sees the material going from good to great.\n\n\"It's exciting to work on things that aren't fully there yet and you get to help shape and be a part of it in that way,\" she said. \"But 'The Favourite,' it was completely unique.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Meredith Guetig", "title": "Ray Dalio predicted the financial crisis.

Today, it's teeming with new development, including bars, restaurants, luxury apartments, museums, and music venues.\n\nThere's just one problem: Many outside of Tulsa aren't aware of this revitalization.\n\nWhile smaller cities like Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; and Austin, Texas, are ballooning with talent, Tulsa has struggled to shirk its reputation as a flyover city.\n\nThe city is hoping to change that with Tulsa Remote, a new program that offers remote workers $10,000 \u2014 and a host of other benefits \u2014 to come live in Tulsa, a city with an economy that's becoming more variegated by the day.\n\nTo be considered for the program, applicants must be at least 18 years old and eligible to work in the US. They must also hold a full-time job outside of Tulsa County, and be able to move to the city within six months.\n\nIn exchange, they'll receive a $2,500 stipend to cover their relocation, followed by $500 a month over the course of a year. At the end of the year, they'll collect an additional $1,500 as an incentive for sticking around.\n\nRemote workers will gain access to a coworking space that bills itself as \"Tulsa's basecamp for entrepreneurs.\" Each month, they'll have the option to attend workshops hosted by Tulsa's Young Professionals, a local business group that's been inordinately successful at encouraging young workers to stick around after college.\n\nFor the first three months, workers will receive a 33% discount on a fully furnished apartment in the Brady Arts District, with utilities thrown in for free.\n\nIt's a tempting offer for what the program calls \"digital nomads\" \u2014 people from all industries with the freedom to work from anywhere. Though some of these workers could hail from the tech industry, others may be freelance writers or entrepreneurs looking to launch their small business.\n\nWhy people prefer Tulsa\n\nThe program is made possible by a large donation from the George Kaiser Family Foundation, a Tulsa-based philanthropy with $4 billion in assets. In recent years, the foundation has invested a fair share of these assets in revitalizing Tulsa's downtown arts district with new parks, museums, and residential units.\n\nNow it's turning toward workers.\n\n\"We are looking for people who are excited to join a community working to make Tulsa one of America's best cities,\" said Ken Levit, the foundation's executive director. \"We're really seeing Tulsa develop as a more vibrant and inclusive place.\"\n\nThe ideal candidate, he said, might be someone from middle America who chased their career in a large city and now has the flexibility to return to their roots. In Tulsa, he said, remote workers can achieve a better work-life balance while having a greater impact in their community.\n\n\"[Mayor G.T. Bynum] is leading very deliberate conversations with the corporate community on how our largest employers can help create a culture of innovation,\" said Kian Kamas, the chief of economic development at the mayor's office.\n\nWhile the program's remote workers will come to Tulsa with an existing job, their relocation could give the city access to new pools of talent, said Michael Basch, a consultant for the program.\n\nWhen Basch moved to Tulsa earlier this year, he had already lived in numerous cities around the world: London, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles \u2014 even Tel Aviv and Athens. What makes Tulsa unique, he said, are its community values.\n\n\"Most of my friends in New York and LA love it there, but I think many of them feel a lack of community and of being part of something,\" he said. \"You feel it when you're here [in Tulsa].\"\n\nAdd to that a low cost of living, affordable housing prices, easy parking, and little to no traffic, and Tulsa might just be a contender for some of the world's top talent.\n\nThe reality could be far off, but the city has already made some remarkable strides.\n\nAt the moment, its Oklahoma Innovation Initiative is spearheading the growth of a regional STEM alliance, which connects students to high-impact careers. The city has also outlined a plan for its economic development known as Vision 2025, which sets aside $885 million for community improvements.\n\nThis revival has prompted companies like Amazon and American Airlines to set up shop there as well. In June, Amazon announced its plan to build a $130 million fulfillment center near Tulsa International Airport.\n\nEveryone likes cash\n\nThe idea of investing in remote workers may seem counterintuitive, given the nature of their profession. But Basch said the program is scanning for applicants that aren't working from home all day.\n\n\"We want people to be at our events, integrating with the community,\" he said.\n\nThe idea of handing out $10,000, he said, was the result of multiple iterations. The program initially planned to provide free housing, but worried that some workers might be interested in purchasing their own homes. Next, they floated the idea of offering a gym membership and housing discount.\n\nIn the end, they decided to keep things simple. \"Different people have different priorities,\" said Basch. \"Everyone likes cash.\"\n\nWhile there's a small risk in the beginning that workers might take the initial money and run, the program hopes its vetting process and carefully structured handouts will attract only eager participants.\n\n\"We're not trying to police [people],\" said Basch. \"We want to make this work for them.\"\n\nSimilar programs have also been tried and tested in other communities. Twice a year, the city of Baltimore selects 30 people to receive a $5,000 incentive to buy a home there. And in New Haven, Connecticut, the city provides up to $10,000 of down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.\n\n\"People wouldn't normally consider Tulsa,\" said Basch, \"but with a little bit of incentive, maybe they'll try it on for size.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ryan Pickrell", "title": "China's most advanced stealth fighter may now be able to strike targets at greater distances than ever", "description": "China Central Television (CCTV), a state-run broadcaster, revealed recently that the aircraft has been equipped with a retractable refueling probe.

The J-20 has only taken part in combat training exercises. Furthermore, while the J-20 was expected to receive a new engine, the technology remains unreliable, the South China Morning Post recently reported.\n\nThe J-20 continues to rely on either Russian imports or inferior Chinese engines, which have, according to some observers, prevented China from achieving the kind of all-aspect stealth of which a true fifth-generation fighter should be capable. The J-20 has decent front-end stealth, but it is noticeably less stealthy at different angles.\n\nThe J-20 was rushed into production, but as China works some of the kinks out, it could potentially lead to the development of a much more lethal and effective aircraft."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jessica Tyler", "title": "See inside the futuristic lab where Dunkin' is testing self-serve cold-brew taps, pickup lockers, and AI ordering technology that could eventually come to stores across America (DNKN)", "description": "Dunkin' Donuts \u2014 which is now just Dunkin' \u2014 revealed its plans for the \"store of the future\" in early September, starting with a name change that rolled out to about 50 stores earlier this year.

Moss, a DC lawyer specializing in national security, told INSIDER. \"To this day, the specific crimes(s) for which Gulen would actually be prosecuted if returned to Turkey remains unclear.\"\n\nBut Moss said there was a \"political offense\" exception in the 1979 extradition treaty between the US and Turkey that \"Gulen's lawyers would almost certainly argue is applicable here and which they would argue justifies preventing the extradition.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, any extradition effort would hinge on the level of detail provided by the Turkish government regarding Gulen's purported criminal offenses and the particular nature of the crime(s) regarding which he is alleged to have committed,\" Moss added.\n\nGreg Siskind, an immigration lawyer in Memphis, said the language of the extradition treaty \"would certainly seem to open up a line of defense\" for Gulen given Erdogan's case against him appears to be \"politically motivated.\"\n\nKhashoggi's killing has put an uncomfortable spotlight on America's relationship with the Saudis and Turkey\n\nRiyadh's story on Khashoggi's slaying has shifted several times over the past month amid increased international pressure to bring his killers to justice.\n\nThough the Saudi government initially denied it had any role in the killing, the Saudi public prosecutor's office on Thursday said 11 people had been indicted in connection to Khashoggi's death and that the death penalty had been requested for five of them.\n\nThe public prosecutor added that 21 people had been detained overall. Riyadh said last month that it detained 18 people.\n\nThe White House's reported effort to extradite Gulen sheds light on US President Donald Trump's attempt to ease rising tensions with Turkey \u2014 which is said to be furious over the fact that Saudi officials killed Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in Turkey \u2014 while providing some cover to the crown prince, with whom Trump has touted a close alliance.\n\nTrump has also consistently emphasized America's strong strategic partnership with the Saudis, as well as the economic benefits of US arms sales to the kingdom.\n\nErdogan has called for Gulen's extradition for years, saying after the 2016 coup attempt that Turkey had never turned back any extradition request for \"terrorists\" by the US.\n\nA Turkish official told NBC News that the government did not link its concerns about the Khashoggi murder with Gulen's extradition case.\n\n\"We definitely see no connection between the two,\" the official said. \"We want to see action on the end of the United States in terms of the extradition of Gulen.

And that smart assistant comes in the form of Alexa.\n\nJust in time for the holidays, Amazon is offering one of the sleekest versions of Alexa yet \u2014 for a limited time, you'll be able to get her in the form of a special (RED) 2nd-generation Echo. And not only will Alexa look great in your kitchen, living room, or just about anywhere else, but you'll feel great about your purchase, too \u2014 $10 from every limited-edition Echo purchased will support (RED)'s efforts to fight AIDS through the Global Fund.\n\nOther than being the telltale crimson color that has become synonymous with (RED)'s mission over the last several years, this 2nd-generation Echo is identical to her siblings. As we noted when the 2nd-generation device was first launched last November, the newer Echo is a significant step up from the original version. It features not only a more elegant profile, but more importantly, better and richer sound. Plus, there's an auxiliary jack in the back where you can plug in your own additional speakers for surround sound.\n\nBy the looks of it, this particular special-edition Echo comes in the fabric-covered finish (which I prefer to the metallic option anyway). But if you're not a huge fan of the red hue, or want to dress up the Echo a bit more still, you could always purchase one of Amazon's extra multi-colored cases for a personal touch.\n\nSo what exactly does the Echo do? The smart speaker comes with Amazon's perennially popular smart assistant, Alexa, built right into the hardware. That means you can call on Alexa to play music, make calls, set alarms, ask questions, control connected devices, and just about anything else. Thanks to its seven microphones, beamforming technology, and noise cancellation, the Amazon Echo is quite adept at hearing your commands, even if you're using it to play music.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa to read out your schedule, check the weather, get a read on traffic, or manage to-do and shopping lists. And because Alexa is constantly being updated with new skills, she's forever getting smarter (just like you).\n\nAs with the rest of the 2nd-generation Echo line, the limited-edition (RED) iteration will set you back $99.99, and is now available for pre-order, a few weeks ahead of its official December 5 launch date.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that Amazon has revealed the 2nd-generation Echo will be discounted by $30.99 as a Black Friday deal. So you may want to wait until November 23 to purchase one for only $69."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ashley Collman", "title": "10 photos show the grim reality for evacuees of California's wildfires", "description": "Thousands have been displaced as wildfires have swept across California, burning up entire towns and melting cars.

The consensus No. 1 pick coming into the 2017 draft, the 76ers traded the No. 3 overall pick and their 2018 pick to the Boston Celtics to move up to No. 1 and take Fultz.\n\nWhen Fultz got into the league, however, his shot strangely disappeared as he struggled through a vague shoulder injury. The team sat him for most of the season as clips of him working out and shooting as if he was new to the game went viral. Fultz returned at the end of the season but played sparingly.\n\nThis year, the team has started Fultz to mixed results. At times, Fultz has shown the quickness, craftiness, and explosion that made him such a high prospect. Other times, he's looked out of sorts and has tanked the lineups he's played in with his inability to shoot and do much when he's off the ball. There's even some concern that his shot is regressing.\n\nRead more: One year after a strange saga where he was unable to shoot, Markelle Fultz looks like he's regressing again\n\nAlready his role has changed since Butler was acquired. Fultz moved to the bench to make room for Butler, with J.J. Redick re-assuming his place in the starting five. It may not be a bad move for Fultz, as he can handle the ball more off the bench and play against other second units, but it's clear that he's not getting an expanded role in the wake of the trade.\n\nIn a 111-106 loss to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, Butler's first game with the team, Fultz played 21 minutes off the bench, slightly less than the 24 minutes per game he's averaging on the season.\n\nHowever, some think that Fultz's future may be somewhere other than Philadelphia, altogether. Two league sources who spoke to Business Insider suggested the 76ers might not be done making moves, with one saying the team may shop Fultz. The same source said Fultz's value is in the negative right now because of his play this season.\n\nThe Sixers will need to make additional moves to fill out their roster after the trade. They need shooting and bench depth, and while they could wait to explore the buyout market, they may ultimately have to explore trades. Fultz, along with future draft picks, could be potential trade chips.\n\nMatt Rourke/AP The real questions concerning Fultz will start to emerge beyond this season. Embiid already started a five-year, $148 million contract extension. The Sixers will be able to pay Butler more than anyone else this summer when he becomes a free agent \u2014 a full max for Butler would be five years, $190 million. And Simmons is approaching rookie contract extension talks. If the Sixers ultimately max out Butler and Simmons, there won't be a lot of room for Fultz.\n\nIf Fultz improves quickly and becomes a true contributor to the rotation, it could be beneficial to the 76ers having such a player on their rookie deal.\n\nBut the Sixers aren't in a place to bring Fultz along slowly, particularly if they give max contracts to all three of their stars. It would be hard to justify paying Fultz the $9 million he's owed next season and $12 million in 2020-21 (if the Sixers pick up his contract option) if he's not contributing when they're already paying the luxury tax for their three stars.\n\nAs ESPN's Zach Lowe said on his podcast, \"The Lowe Post,\" there is a scenario where Fultz is bad, and the Sixers keep him through his rookie deal. The other option is he improves and gets paid by another team. Lowe said it's possible to imagine Fultz not being on the team in two years.\n\nAlmost nothing about Fultz's NBA experience has been typical. At 20 years old, given his odd beginning, it's much too early to write him off. But after the Sixers made a big win-now move to acquire Butler, there's also not much to suggest that they want to wait and see if he develops, when they're on a timeline with Butler, Embiid, and Simmons."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Eliza Relman", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is using Instagram stories to bring you behind the curtain of the Washington, DC establishment", "description": "Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is using Instagram to give her followers a look inside a typically closed-off Washington experience.

Middle East Monitor via Reuters\n\nSaudi officials: Our absolute monarch is absolutely innocent\n\nThe Saudi public prosecutor's office on Thursday said it indicted 11 suspects over Khashoggi's killing and requested the death penalty for five of them, who were charged with \"ordering and committing the crime.\"\n\nIt added that Saudi agents originally wanted to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia alive but killed him after \"negotiations\" for the journalist's return failed.\n\nRead more: Saudi prosecutor claims Crown Prince Mohammed innocent, seeks death for 5 others in Khashoggi killing\n\nA spokesman for the prosecutor added that Crown Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the killing, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nAdel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, echoed that claim, telling a separate press conference on Thursday: \"Absolutely, his royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue.\"\n\nHe added that \"sometimes people exceed their authority,\" suggesting that the people who killed Khashoggi acted without the crown prince's approval.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed functions as an absolute monarch in Saudi Arabia with control over courts and legislation.

The CIA had intercepted Saudi officials discussing a plan ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him there, she tweeted, citing a Washington Post article that published last month.\n\nIyad el-Baghdadi, the president of the Kawaakibi Foundation think tank, described Saudi Arabia's claims distancing the crown prince from the killing as \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"The very suggestion that a hand-picked team of Saudi killers could be put together, given resources, then a kill plan devised and implemented to kill the most prominent non-royal Saudi on the planet, all without MBS's knowledge = so ludicrous I don't even know where to start,\" he tweeted.\n\nRead more: How the Saudi government's story on Khashoggi has shifted over time\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in February. Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS\n\nWhy 'ludicrous' might be good enough\n\nThe kingdom most likely issued Thursday's indictments to give off an impression to the international community that it still cared about the case and to encourage international businesses to continue investing in Saudi Arabia, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and the Royal United Services Institute in London.\n\n\"The attention of the international community cannot be held forever by this case, and Riyadh is obviously trying to ensure that the perception accountability for Khashoggi's murder is being pursued,\" Hellyer told Business Insider.\n\n\"That's important to give cover to those in the international community \u2014 especially in the business community \u2014 to continue to engage on a financial level with Riyadh,\" he added.\n\nMultiple businesses have come under pressure to cut ties with the kingdom, but few have done so.\n\nSaudi Arabia has lucrative deals around the world, particularly in US tech and military. President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted a lucrative arms deal he negotiated with the kingdom last year, and he has refused to cancel those contracts over Khashoggi's killing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump with a chart highlighting arms sales to Saudi Arabia during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed in March.

It tried in 2005 with the B9 Tribeca. Unfortunately, the Tribeca's odd styling, diminutive size, and tepid performance prevented it from gaining traction in the market. Even a 2008 facelift and the addition of a more powerful engine couldn't save the Tribeca, which soldiered on for nearly a decade before Subaru pulled the plug on the SUV in 2014.\n\nRead More: One of these 15 finalists will become Business Insider's 2018 Car of the Year.\n\nFor 2019, Subaru is back with an all-new midsize SUV: the Ascent.

Botnets are created when fraudsters essentially infect armies of devices with sophisticated malware to impersonate internet users whom marketers pay their ad dollars to reach with online ads.\n\nThe connected-TV botnet specifically unmasked by DoubleVerify generated fraudulent ad impressions by spoofing real publisher URLs and sending false signals to ad servers telling them it's a connected-TV device, thereby making the impressions land on fraudulent sites instead of legitimate ones and fooling advertisers into believing that their ad was served on a connected-TV device.\n\nAccording to the company, approximately one-third of the fraud signals originated from gaming consoles, and the remaining two-thirds originated from smart TVs, as they are the most generic and thus easiest to pretend to be.\n\n\"Networks of ad servers have been acting like legitimate sources of advertising but diverting revenues over from content publishers for a while,\" DoubleVerify CEO Wayne Gattinella said. \"The news here is not the method, but the channel \u2014 which is connected-TV devices.\"\n\nAd fraud has started creeping into the connected-TV and OTT space\n\nThis ad-fraud scheme marks the first direct, scaled botnet attack that the company has identified in the environment, according to Roy Rosenfeld, head of DoubleVerify's Fraud Lab. Rosenfeld called it \"the first concentrated attack of this kind, that specifically targets the connected-TV ecosystem.\" DoubleVerify's Fraud Lab is dedicated to continually analyzing ad-fraud trends across devices.\n\nBut the discovery of intensifying fraud activity in the connected-TV space isn't surprising, Gattinella said, given the explosive growth of video at large, OTT streaming, and, specifically, the connected-TV space.\n\nHalf of all internet users access an online-video subscription service at least once a week, and almost as many (49%) access a network-TV app at least once a week, according to the Video Advertising Bureau. Plus, streaming makes up 11% of all TV-viewing hours for people between the ages of 18 and 49 \u2014 more than doubling since 2015.\n\n\"Fraud tends to follow the money, and money tends to follow the eyeballs,\" Gattinella said. He added that the volume of ads and opportunity for ad fraud have grown for connected-TV devices with user adoption.\n\nAd fraud remains a perennial problem in digital advertising\n\nTo be sure, ad fraud has been perennial problem in digital advertising, with advertisers expected to lose $51 million per day and a whopping $19 billion through the year on ad fraud in 2018, according to Juniper Research. But the connected-TV space, which includes outfits such as Hulu, Dish, and other premier players, marks a whole new front where advertisers and publishers now must look to combat ad fraud.\n\nDoubleVerify is not the only fraud-prevention company at the frontlines, either. Others, including Adobe, White Ops, and Pixalate, have warned against increasing fraud in the connected-TV environment, with almost 18% of programmatically sold connected-TV video ads in the third quarter of 2018 in the US being invalid, according to Pixalate, which this week received Media Rating Council accreditation for invalid-traffic detection in OTT advertising.\n\nOnce the scheme was identified, DoubleVerify extended coverage to its clients, including various demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms, shielding them from the attack.\n\n\"OTT environments pose some challenges that don't exist in other environments today,\" said Nick Frizzell, senior director of brand safety and inventory operations at SpotX, a supply-side platform and a DoubleVerify partner that remained unaffected by the attack. \"Due to the Wild West nature of the space, the doors are open for bad actors to capitalize if purchasing isn't done with some due diligence.\"\n\nWhile several initiatives to clean up digital advertising, such as the industry- and Google-backed ads.txt, have cropped up in recent years, the industry still has its work cut out for it.\n\nRead more: Google says its ads.txt initiative to clean up digital advertising is seeing strong adoption, but new data suggests otherwise\n\nAds.txt, for instance, doesn't work for streaming apps and smart TVs.

The \u2026 [+4628 chars]", "fulltext": "Joyce Chang has witnessed her fair share of financial crises during the nearly three decades she has worked in markets.\n\nChang, the global head of research at JPMorgan, isn't applying any of the old playbooks to the next one, which she says is inevitable.\n\nThe good news is that the next recession is not imminent, according to JPMorgan. The firm's internal probabilities place the odds of a recession in the US by 2020 at 50%.\n\nChang says the world will be a completely different place from what it was during some of the worst crises in recent history, and argues that many of these changes have already taken place.\n\nTo that end, she's outlined four \"paradigm shifts\" that investors should keep in mind when thinking about the triggers for the next financial crisis. They're discussed in detail below.\n\n\"All these things make it very difficult to say that past cycles are necessarily the best gauge for what will happen next,\" Chang told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.\n\n1. A shift in market liquidity, structure, and function\n\nChang describes this theme as the biggest change in financial markets.\n\nThe market caps of assets in global bonds and exchange-traded funds have ballooned since 2008. However, liquidity, which Chang described as market cap as a share of trading volume, has fallen by as much as 70% over the same period. This helps explain many of the flash crashes that have occurred in the interim and how they seem to be happening over shorter time frames.\n\nShe noted that the stock market's correction at the end of October was an example of the lack of market liquidity. It coincided with negative headlines on US-China trade, a spike in global bond yields, and fears about the end of this cycle.\n\nOlder examples include the Chinese yuan devaluation scare, the Brexit-related sell-off, and the Italian referendum earlier this year.\n\n\"This is my 29th year in the market,\" Chang said. \"You used to have time for a recommendation to play out, and the time compression has really moved as the market has become more electronic.\"\n\nThis paradigm shift further manifests itself in the high frequency with which investors need data. For example, JPMorgan constructed a trade war index based on over 7,000 earnings reports for an instant look at where the risks to stocks lie.\n\n\"When I started in research, it was before the internet, so things were actually physically mailed to people, Chang said. \"We would, for our top clients, actually FedEx it to them so they would get it more quickly.\"\n\nObviously, those days are long gone.\n\n2. The global political system is shifting away from multilateralism and towards a multipolar order\n\nSimply put, this means there's less cooperation among countries and more inward-looking policies that prioritize citizens. The UK's decision to forge its future outside the European Union is an example of this shift. But perhaps the poster child of this approach is President Donald Trump with his America-first agenda, which has been used to justify the trade disputes with China and other allies.\n\nWhere investors are concerned, Chang said such policies have raised the pass-through from geopolitical events to markets.\n\n\"The conventional wisdom that it's more noise than trend is true,\" Chang said. \"But if you look at causes of the recession, it often comes with an oil shock, which is triggered in part by geopolitical risk.\"\n\nShe also observed that more companies are discussing the impact geopolitics is having on their earnings.\n\nJPMorgan found that geopolitical events had a strong negative impact on US, emerging-market, and global equity indexes. Chang recommended shorting equities as one of the best hedges for geopolitical risk, as well as going long on the dollar and volatility.\n\nHowever, contrary to popular belief, gold is not an effective hedge, as political shocks tend to impact all commodities negatively. The Japanese yen also provided little protection against losses.\n\nUltimately, as geopolitical risks rise, investors will need to know the most effective hedges for their portfolios.\n\n3. The rise of populism\n\nFrom the US to Brazil and Mexico, antiestablishment candidates are coming out of the woodwork and winning presidential elections.\n\nIt's a trend that stems from the rise of income inequality following the Great Recession, Chang said. But the crisis is not the only thing that has worsened income inequality. The deregulation of financial markets and increases in technology have also created winners and losers and crushed the middle class.\n\nFor these reasons, populism is poised to become a feature of geopolitics rather than a bug, Chang said.\n\n4. A reshaping of the US-China relationship\n\nThe brewing trade war between the countries is just one of the issues that will matter to investors as the next crisis approaches.\n\nChina's ambitions to build infrastructure in other countries, its use of artificial intelligence, and its dispute over the South China Sea are some of the other possible triggers for geopolitical turmoil."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sponsor Post", "title": "How to have the ultimate vacation in Cancun, Cozumel, and Riviera Maya", "description": "When it comes to the recipe for a good vacation, Mexico delivers with crystal-white sand, incredibly delicious food, unique cultures, and plenty of sunshine across the country.

It's basically all your income \u2014 including any wages, dividends, alimony, retirement money, or other income \u2014 minus certain deductions. It is used to figure out how much of your income the government can tax.\n\nMAGI\n\nThere's also modified adjusted gross income, another measure of income that is slightly but crucially different from AGI. To calculate MAGI, you take your AGI and add back certain deductions, but only if they apply to you. The deductions can include student loan interest, tuition expenses, IRA contributions, and more.\n\nSSN\n\nSocial Security numbers are issued to all U.S. citizens, and some eligible U.S. residents, often as soon as they are born. The nine-digit number is used to track your income and report it to the Internal Revenue Service. You also use it for other purposes, like opening a bank account or applying for a mortgage.\n\nEIN\n\nAn employer identification number is kind of like a Social Security number for a business or organization. It's a nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to individuals, businesses, sole proprietors, non-profit organizations and other entities. The EIN identifies tax-paying entities that need to file business tax returns.\n\nEIC\n\nThe Earned Income Credit is a \"benefit for working people with low to moderate income,\" according to the IRS. It is also called the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). You might be eligible for this credit depending on factors like income, filing status, and whether you have any qualifying children.\n\nCTC\n\nParents may qualify for a Child Tax Credit for having child dependents under the age of 17. The credit may also apply for a grandchild, sibling, niece or nephew, adopted child,foster child, or any other family member who is under 17, has lived with you for more than half the tax year, and is claimed as a dependent on your tax return. Under the new tax plan, the credit has doubled to $2,000 per child, and much of it is refundable.\n\nFICA\n\nThose deductions taken out of each paycheck? Some of it is for the US federal payroll tax called the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. FICA \"helps fund Social Security and Medicare programs,\" which pay benefits to retirees, the disabled, and children, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nIRA\n\nAn individual retirement arrangement provides a way for you to save money for retirement while enjoying certain tax advantages. You set up an IRA through a bank or financial institution, and you may be able to deduct \"some or all of your contributions to a traditional IRA\" on your tax return, according to the IRS.

Here's why.\n\nMay's Brexit deal is dead\n\nTheresa May Neil Hall / Reuters; Yves Herman / Reuters; Samantha Lee / Business Insider\n\nThe events of the last 24 hours have made it clear that May simply doesn't have the numbers to get her Brexit deal through parliament. The chances of getting through any deal, when she only has a minority government and her own party is so bitterly divided on Brexit, were always going to be slim. What once looked like a Herculean but at least possible task now looks impossible.\n\nThe resignation of so many ministers and the near-universal opposition to her deal expressed by MPs from all sides in Parliament today means the deal is, as the Conservative MP Mark Francois told her in the Commons today, now \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nShe has lost the confidence of her party\n\nFrom left: Tory MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, and Iain Duncan-Smith Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the opposition to May in the Conservative party. There is no clear successor to May and most Tory MPs are not vehemently opposed to her leadership. If there were a vote of no confidence in her leadership, Downing Street also believes she would win it.\n\nHowever, such assumptions cannot be relied upon. While the average Conservative MP may not be eager for a new leader right now, they are not exactly queuing up to support her either. It was incredibly telling that May took questions for well over an hour in the Commons today before a single MP stood up to support her deal. And while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn survived a much bigger challenge from his MPs thanks to overwhelming support from his party membership, May has only lukewarm backing from Conservatives in parliament and the wider party.\n\nThis afternoon Conservative Brexiteers met in a parliamentary committee room to discuss how to topple May. Not all of the 35 or so Tory MPs present in the room supported the move to oust her. But when their de facto leader Jacob Rees-Mogg declared that he had submitted a letter of no confidence in her leadership, there was a loud approving banging of desks inside the room.\n\nHe later emerged to a huge media scrum which followed him to an awaiting press conference on the steps of parliament outside. Following his announcement, several more Conservative MPs revealed that they too have submitted their letters calling for May to go. Long-threatened but never delivered, the Brexiteer plan to oust May is now in full swing.\n\nIt's a question of when May is ousted, not if\n\nTheresa May Getty\n\nIt's not yet clear whether the ERG yet have the numbers to oust May. However, what is clear from today is that she will be unable to get her deal through parliament. And if May is defeated on her deal then she will surely have run out of road. No prime minister, however stubborn, could carry on after losing the support of her own Cabinet and parliament on such an important issue as this. Whatever the Fixed Term Parliaments Act states, May would be finished and the calls for a new prime minister, a general election or even potentially a second Brexit referendum would become overwhelming.\n\nEvents are changing rapidly, and by the time you read this, there may well have been several more resignations from May's Cabinet. At the time of writing, the precise nature and timing of her departure remains uncertain. But what is certain is that it is now only a question of when she is forced out, not if. The end of the road for May is now clear for all to see. The only question is how long it takes the prime minister and her party to realise it."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tyler Lauletta", "title": "The most dominant player in college basketball was secretly offered a scholarship to play football at LSU", "description": "Zion Williamson has taken the college basketball world by storm.

In advance of it, Juul Labs, which is the largest seller of e-cigs, said Tuesday that it is suspending sales of its flavored products in retail stores, including vape shops.\n\nGottlieb called on his experience as a doctor, cancer survivor, and father to make his case for the limitations, before going on to call electronic cigarette use in teens an \"epidemic.\"\n\n\"Today, I'm pursuing actions aimed at addressing the disturbing trend of youth nicotine use and continuing to advance the historic declines we've achieved in recent years in the rates of combustible cigarette use among kids,\" Gottlieb said. \"These actions are grounded in hard evidence. But they also are deeply personal.\"\n\nGottlieb pointed to data suggesting that kids who use e-cigarettes are likely to start using traditional, combustible cigarettes down the line.\n\nHere's the full statement\n\nAs a physician who cared for hospitalized cancer patients, I saw first-hand the devastation that smoking-related diseases had wrought on the lives of patients and their families, and dedicated myself to helping ease this suffering.\n\nAs a cancer survivor myself, I understand too well the uncertainty, grief and struggle that accompanies a cancer diagnosis.\n\nAnd as a father of three young children, I hear daily from parents and teachers worried about the epidemic use of electronic cigarettes and nicotine addiction among kids.\n\nWhen I pledged last year to reduce addiction to nicotine, I was driven by the fact that, in the U.S., tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease. Combustible cigarettes cause the overwhelming majority of tobacco-related disease. When used as intended, they are responsible for the death of half of all long-term users.\n\nToday, I'm pursuing actions aimed at addressing the disturbing trend of youth nicotine use and continuing to advance the historic declines we've achieved in recent years in the rates of combustible cigarette use among kids.\n\nThese actions are grounded in hard evidence. But they also are deeply personal.\n\nWhen I first announced our comprehensive tobacco framework plan in July 2017, I recognized my opportunity - an almost unprecedented opportunity - to use the tools that the FDA had been given in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to bring about meaningful, lasting change to dramatically alter this cycle of disease and death.\n\nI envisioned a world in which cigarettes lose their addictive potential through reduced nicotine levels. I envisioned a regulatory paradigm that focused on nicotine and evaluated the diverse nicotine delivery mechanisms along a continuum of risk. On one end, there are combustible tobacco products. At the other end, there are medicinal nicotine products sold as gums and patches. And there is an array of products in between.\n\nI saw the opportunity to advance new technologies like electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) as an alternative to cigarettes for adults who still seek access to satisfying levels of nicotine, without all the deadly effects of combustion.\n\nI believed then - and I continue to believe - that we must recognize the potential for innovative, less harmful products that can efficiently deliver satisfying levels of nicotine to adults who want them.\n\nBut as I said at that time, as I said at my confirmation hearing, as I said in my first remarks to the professional staff of the FDA three days after being confirmed as the FDA's Commissioner in May of 2017, and as I've said dozens of times in the months that followed: any policy accommodation to advance the innovations that could present an alternative to smoking - particularly as it relates to e-cigarettes - cannot, and will not, come at the expense of addicting a generation of children to nicotine through these same delivery vehicles. This simply will not happen. I will take whatever steps I must to prevent this.\n\nToday, I'm announcing proposals to help reverse these trends, with the unwavering support of HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who shares my deep commitment to protecting the health of our nation's children. Today, we advance our efforts to combat youth access and appeal with a policy framework that firmly and directly addresses the core of the epidemic - flavors.\n\nThe data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later. This is a large pool of future risk. The policies I'm outlining now strives to strike a careful public health balance between our imperative to enable the opportunities to transition to non-combustible products to be available for adults; and our solemn mandate to make nicotine products less accessible and less appealing to children.The data make unmistakably clear that, if we're to break the cycle of addiction to nicotine, preventing youth initiation on nicotine is a paramount imperative.\n\nAlmost all adult smokers started smoking when they were kids. Nearly 90 percent started smoking before the age of 18, and 95 percent by age 21. Only about 1 percent of cigarette smokers begin at age 26 or older. When I announced the FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation in July 2017, I made clear my concerns about kids' use of e-cigarettes, especially those products marketed with obviously kid-appealing flavors. At the time, however, the trends in youth use appeared to be changing in the right direction - reported e-cigarette use among high school students, which peaked at 16.0 percent in 2015, had decreased to 11.3 percent in 2016 and held steady in 2017. What I did not predict was that, in 2018, youth use of e-cigarettes and other ENDS products would become an epidemic.\n\nToday, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are publishing data from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). The data from this nationally representative survey, conducted of middle and high school students, show astonishing increases in kids' use of e-cigarettes and other ENDS, reversing years of favorable trends in our nation's fight to prevent youth addiction to tobacco products. These data shock my conscience: from 2017 to 2018, there was a 78 percent increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48 percent increase among middle school students. The total number of middle and high school students currently using e-cigarettes rose to 3.6 million \u2014 that's 1.5 million more students using these products than the previous year. Additionally, more than a quarter (27.7 percent) of high school current e-cigarette users are using the product regularly (on 20 or more days in the past month). More than two-thirds (67.8 percent) are using flavored e-cigarettes. Both these numbers have risen significantly since 2017.\n\nThese increases must stop. And the bottom line is this: I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes. We won't let this pool of kids, a pool of future potential smokers, of future disease and death, to continue to build. We'll take whatever action is necessary to stop these trends from continuing.\n\nOver the past months, the FDA has worked aggressively to address youth use of e-cigarettes.\n\nWe deployed a range of our regulatory tools.\n\nWe launched a multi-pronged Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan. We escalated enforcement against retailers who illegally sell ENDS products to minors. We partnered with the Federal Trade Commission to target e-liquid manufacturers whose products used misleading, kid-appealing imagery that mimicked juice boxes, lollipops and other foods. We worked with eBay to remove listings for these products on their websites. We launched innovative campaigns, including \"The Real Cost\" Youth E-Cigarette Prevention Campaign, to educate teens about the consequences of addiction to e-cigarettes.\n\nAnd I made clear - in speeches, in statements and in interviews - that we were closely watching what appeared to be disturbing trends. I repeatedly said that, although we continue to believe that non-combustible tobacco products may provide an important opportunity to migrate adult smokers away from more harmful forms of nicotine delivery, these opportunities couldn't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids to nicotine. I told the manufacturers of e-cigarettes that the youth use of their products was an existential threat to this innovation. In short, over the past year we weren't sitting still. And we weren't quiet about our concerns. And yet these deeply disturbing trends continued to build.\n\nIn September, after receiving the raw data from the NYTS survey, I took additional action. I called on manufacturers to step up, to take voluntary actions to prevent youth access to these products and to take meaningful steps to curb their youth appeal. Some manufacturers have already responded to these requests and pledged to take some meaningful voluntary steps to curb youth access and appeal to their products. I also said that the FDA would be re-evaluating our own policy approach and that all options would be considered. Given the startling and disturbing youth use rates in the 2018 NYTS data being released today, it's clear that we must do more - specifically, several policy changes to target what appear to be the central problems - youth appeal and youth access to flavored tobacco products.\n\nSome of these changes would involve revisiting the FDA's compliance policy, issued in 2017, which extended the dates by which manufacturers of deemed tobacco products that were on the market as of Aug. 8, 2016, were expected to submit premarket applications to the FDA for review (after receipt of an application, the FDA reviews the application and determines if the product meets the applicable statutory standard to be marketed). Under that policy of enforcement discretion, the premarket application compliance date for newly regulated combustible tobacco products, including certain cigars and pipe tobacco, was extended to August 2021. The premarket application compliance date for newly regulated non-combustible tobacco products was extended to August 2022. This applied to most ENDS or e-cigarettes.\n\nToday, I'm directing the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) to revisit this compliance policy as it applies to deemed ENDS products that are flavored, including all flavors other than tobacco, mint and menthol. The changes I seek would protect kids by having all flavored ENDS products (other than tobacco, mint and menthol flavors or non-flavored products) sold in age-restricted, in-person locations and, if sold online, under heightened practices for age verification.\n\nThese changes will not include mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS. This reflects a careful balancing of public health considerations. Among all ENDS users, data suggests that mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS are more popular with adults than with kids. One nationally representative survey showed that, among ENDS users aged 12-17 years old, 20 percent used mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS while, among adult ENDS users, 41 percent used mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS. Any approach to mint- and menthol-flavored ENDS must acknowledge the possibility that the availability of these flavors in ENDS may be important to adult smokers seeking to transition away from cigarettes. Moreover, I recognize that combustible cigarettes are still sold in menthol flavor, including in convenience stores. I don't want to create a situation where the combustible products have features that make them more attractive than the non-combustible products. Or a situation where those who currently use menthol-flavored cigarettes might find it less attractive to switch completely to an e-cigarette. This is a difficult compromise that I'm trying to strike, recognizing the public health risk posed by cigarettes still being available in menthol flavor.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes. I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes. The menthol serves to mask some of the unattractive features of smoking that might otherwise discourage a child from smoking. Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities. And as a matter of public health, they exacerbate troubling disparities in health related to race and socioeconomic status that are a major concern of mine. Although I'm not proposing revisions to the compliance policy for the mint- and menthol flavors in e-cigarettes at this time, we need to address the impact that menthol in cigarettes has on the public health.\n\nI'm also aware that there are potentially important distinctions even between mint- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products. I'm particularly concerned about mint-flavored products, based on evidence showing its relative popularity, compared to menthol, among kids. So, I want to be clear that, in light of these concerns, if evidence shows that kids' use of mint or menthol e-cigarettes isn't declining, I'll revisit this aspect of the current compliance policy.\n\nIn addition, I'm directing CTP to revisit the compliance policy for all flavored ENDS products (other than tobacco, mint and menthol flavors or non-flavored products) that are sold online without additional, heightened age-verification and other restrictions in place. As part of that effort, I'm directing CTP to publish additional information regarding best practices for online sales. My aim is to have these best practices available soon, so sites can quickly adopt them to help prevent youth access to these flavored products. Of course, no tobacco products, including non-flavored ENDS products or those with tobacco, mint and menthol flavors, should be sold to kids. For this reason we'll continue to enforce the law whenever we see online sales of these products to minors and will closely monitor online sales of mint and menthol ENDS products.\n\nIf youth trends don't move in the right direction, we will revisit all of these issues.\n\nI hope I'll soon see manufacturers of ENDS products preparing, with the FDA input as appropriate, premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) to demonstrate that their products meet the public health standard in the Tobacco Control Act. In the coming months, CTP plans to issue additional policies and procedures to further make sure that the process for reviewing these applications is efficient, science-based and transparent. We'll also explore how to create a process to accelerate the development and review of products with features that can make it far less likely that kids can access an e-cigarette.\n\nOther considerations of our policy framework would apply to traditional forms of combustible tobacco products.\n\nI noted that the popularity of menthol cigarettes with youth is especially troubling. In fact, youth smokers are more likely to use menthol cigarettes than any other age group. More than half (54 percent) of youth smokers ages 12-17 use menthol cigarettes, compared to less than one-third of smokers ages 35 and older. Prevalence of menthol use is even higher among African-American youth, with data showing that seven out of 10 African-American youth smokers select menthol cigarettes.\n\nAnd, unlike menthol-flavored ENDS, there's no evidence to suggest that menthol-flavored cigarettes may play a role in harm reduction for adult smokers.\n\nWe will advance a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would seek to ban menthol in combustible tobacco products, including cigarettes and cigars, informed by the comments on our Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM).\n\nFinally, to ensure that we're taking a comprehensive approach, we must evaluate our regulatory approach to flavored cigars. Flavors are added to cigars and other tobacco products for various reasons, such as reducing the harshness, bitterness and astringency of tobacco products during inhalation and to soothe irritation during use. Research shows that, compared to adults (25 or older) who smoke cigars, a higher proportion of youth who smoke cigars use flavored cigars.\n\nThese data also indicate that eliminating flavors from cigars would likely help prevent cigar initiation by young people. Accordingly, I am also outlining policy goals to address the presence of flavors in cigars - including those that were subject to the compliance policy for newly deemed products, and those that were \"grandfathered.\"\n\nSpecifically, I propose a policy through appropriate means to ban flavors in cigars.\n\nThe bottom line is that these efforts to address flavors and protect youth would dramatically impact the ability of American kids to access tobacco products that we know are both appealing and addicting. This policy framework reflects a re-doubling of the FDA's efforts to protect kids from all nicotine-containing products. They also reflect a very careful public health balance that we're trying to achieve. A balance between closing the on-ramp for kids to become addicted to nicotine through combustible and non-combustible products, while maintaining access to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery through ENDS for adult smokers seeking to transition away from combustible tobacco products.\n\nThis policy framework is an important step toward reversing the epidemic that is underway and that is confirmed by the data from the NYTS. I could take more aggressive steps. I could propose eliminating any application enforcement discretion to any currently marketed ENDS product, which would result in the removal of ALL such products from the marketplace. At this time, I am not proposing this route, as I don't want to foreclose opportunities for currently addicted adult smokers.\n\nBut make no mistake. If the policy changes that we have outlined don't reverse this epidemic, and if the manufacturers don't do their part to help advance this cause, I'll explore additional actions.\n\nWe've already seen some positive steps announced voluntarily by manufacturers. Responsible manufacturers certainly don't need to wait for the FDA to finalize these policies to act. They can stop certain marketing and sales practices \u2014 the ones we believe are part of the youth access and youth appeal problem \u2014 right now. We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored ENDS products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures.\n\nThe FDA continues to take aggressive action to protect the public health, especially among kids at risk of nicotine addiction and tobacco use. As part of our Comprehensive Plan, in addition to issuing the ANPRMs to hear the public's input on the role of flavors in tobacco products, and on cigars, we also issued an ANPRM on lowering nicotine in cigarettes. We have expedited the review of many of the comments, and spent hours, days and months taking close consideration of the questions raised and evidence presented by the public and various stakeholders.\n\nThis policy framework reflects the FDA's consideration of available data and information to get the most complete picture possible of the causes of the epidemic rise in youth use of ENDS.\n\nWe'll continue to base our actions on the best available science. And when it comes to protecting our youth, we'll continue to actively pursue a wide range of prevention and enforcement actions. We'll leave no stone unturned.\n\nThis is one of our highest priorities.\n\nThe tobacco marketplace has changed dramatically in the past year when it comes to youth use of ENDS. And the vision for public health achievements from reduced use of combustible products and reduced nicotine addiction is at risk.\n\nBut with implementation of the forceful and far-reaching actions that are outlined today, and with the commitment of tobacco manufacturers to take additional, voluntary actions to reduce youth access to their products, we can reverse these trends.\n\nAs I said after becoming Commissioner, I can think of no more impactful action the FDA could possibly take on my watch to help American families.\n\nRead the full release from the FDA for more details on the policy plan."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Shana Lebowitz", "title": "The biggest threat to success isn't failure \u2014 it's something much harder to beat", "description": "When you're bored with good habits you've been practicing for a while, it can be hard to stick with them.

That element of surprise is key for keeping us hooked (Clear cites the example of a gambler using a slot machine).\n\nA 'variable reward' system can help you stick with good but boring habits\n\nFor his part, Clear doesn't offer much of a solution to the problem of boredom except \"falling in love\" with it. He writes: \"There have been a lot of articles I haven't felt like writing, but I've never regretted publishing on schedule. \u2026 The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over.\"\n\nI wasn't quite satisfied with that suggestion, so I looked elsewhere and found out about a self-improvement system called \"Habit Judo,\" which was cited in The Guardian. (The Habit Judo website appears to no longer be in operation.)\n\nAs The Guardian's Oliver Burkeman explains it, every time you perform a certain behavior, you reward yourself with a random (computer-generated) score between one and 10. When you reach a certain number, you earn a prize of your choosing.

Storage capacity in the US is vast, but direct farm subsidies to farmers from the Trump administration designed to support the industry cover only about 10% of the price of soy.\n\nThe issue has been exacerbated by the fact that US farmers planted a 2018-2019 crop prior to the trade war's commencement, keeping production high and prices low.\n\nChina reduced its soybean imports from the US for the first time in 15 years in 2018. But, Rabobank says this could change if a trade deal is reached or if adverse weather hits production in South America.\n\nSimilarly, Rabobank's worst case outlines the possibility of China imposing a blanket ban on US soybeans or early crops out of South America, which could further damage US farmers.\n\n\"Consumers outside of China will benefit from low-priced US soybeans,\" Magdovitz said. \"Meanwhile, Chinese consumers will suffer from the trade war.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet at the G20 summit later this month, which could provide further clarity on trade-war concerns."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "California's biggest utility provider has seen half its market value wiped out since the wildfires started (PCG)", "description": "California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire broke out last Thursday.

It's a civil liberty.\" (Mr. Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple's.)\n\nThe enmity between the two technology executives goes back years but heated up earlier this year when Recode's Kara Swisher asked Cook a question about the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which private Facebook user data was stolen from 50 million users.\n\nShe asked if the Apple CEO was in Zuckerberg's place, \"What would you do?\"\n\nHe answered: \"What would I do? I wouldn't be in this situation.\"\n\nZuckerberg later hit back, calling Cook's criticism \"extremely glib.\"\n\nIn the statement, in which a Facebook representative writes \"there's been no need to employ anyone else to do this for us,\" the \"anyone else\" is referring to Definers Public Affairs, a firm of Republican political operatives that Facebook hired, which the Times report revealed had spread documents with political-style opposition research to reporters.\n\nHowever, the conflict between Cook and Zuckerberg first arose at least four years ago.\n\nRead more: Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook execs reportedly investigated if they could ban Trump after Zuck was 'appalled' by his call for a Muslim ban\n\nCook said in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2014 that \"when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product.\"\n\nThis apparently got under Zuckerberg's skin even back then, with a journalist from Time noticing the tension in a profile of the Facebook founder:\n\n\"But before that happens Zuckerberg also notes \u2014 and it was the only time I saw him display irritation \u2014 that Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote something similar in September in a statement spelling out Apple's privacy policy: 'When an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product.' The shot was probably meant for Google, but Facebook was definitely in the blast radius. 'A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers,' Zuckerberg says. 'I think it's the most ridiculous concept. What, you think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them? If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper!'\"\n\nIt's remarkable that this spat between publicly traded giants has spilled out of quips and interviews into a public Facebook crisis PR statement."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "\u00c1ine Cain", "title": "The CEO of Office Depot reveals how the company is planning to grow beyond its stores to compete in the next era of retail (ODP)", "description": "Office Depot CEO Gerry Smith told Business Insider that he believes the future of retail will require an omnichannel approach.

The office-supplies retailer was still reeling from the collapse of a planned merger with Staples, the departure of its previous CEO, Roland Smith, and a string of seven quarters plagued by declining sales, shuttered stores, and intense competition from Amazon.\n\nSmith told Business Insider that he and his team worked to pivot Office Depot to a more omnichannel approach, leveraging its 28.8 million-strong customer base through three distinct avenues: retail stores, online sales, and business-to-business options.\n\n\"I was very excited when I came onboard and realized, 'Wow, I've got an asset that very few people have,'\" Smith said.

Smith said that Office Depot's infrastructure allows it to compete against e-commerce rivals and even gain an edge when it comes to last-mile delivery.\n\n\"I was very excited when I came on board and realized, 'Wow, I've got an asset that very few people have,'\" Smith told Business Insider.\n\nRead more: CEO Gerry Smith is leading Office Depot through a major evolution.

Smith said the company plans to roll out more coworking stations in areas where there's a market for the service.\n\n\"My vision is that Office Depot doesn't provide just office products or just tech services with our CompuCom acquisition,\" Smith said. \"I want to go partner with people who can bring an array of products to companies, because we want to own that customer relationship, we want to give them a great experience, and, most importantly, we want them to grow.\"\n\nHe added that the Workonomy venture has given his business more insight into what customers really want.\n\n\"People want a community,\" he said. \"Smalls businesses want a community. They really want a one-stop shopping experience, and they want expertise and someone to talk to.\"\n\nThrough CompuCom and Workonomy, not to mention the company's in-store, online, and business-to-business channels, Smith said he believes Office Depot is setting itself up to serve customers as both an office-supplies retailer and a business-and-tech-services provider.\n\n\"We think that because of our unique omnichannel approach, we can be that company that provides that for people,\" he added. \"We talked to customers. They say, 'This is great, because I want to go be a chef. I want to go cook. I don't want to worry about accounting or my server going down or wondering how I generate my website or my logo.'

And throughout the facility, people who appeared to be police officers were walking around minding their own business.\n\nBut they were all actors.\n\nWhat used to be a prison is now a growing hub for film and TV productions and is owned by full-service, Brooklyn-based production company Broadway Stages, which bought the 67-acre property in 2017 for $7 million and a $20 million investment to be completed in five years, according to Broadway Stages spokespeople Warren Cohn and Samara Schaum.\n\nThe prison, which opened in 1976 and closed in 2011, has become a hot spot for popular movies like this year's Sandra Bullock-starring \"Ocean's 8\" and TV shows like Netflix's \"Daredevil\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\" NBC's \"The Black List\" was filming on Wednesday when I got a look at the place.\n\nThere was also a helicopter parked on the grounds for what must have been a painstaking shoot of an undisclosed project (but no permit is required since it's private property now).\n\nNetflix\n\nThe fourth episode from \"Daredevil\" season 3, named \"Blindsided,\" has made headlines recently for its nearly 11-minute one-take tracking shot inside a prison facility during a riot. The scene finds Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), the man known as the costumed-vigilante Daredevil, fighting his way through a group of prisoners to learn the name of a man a bad guy Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) paid to shank him.\n\nIt was all filmed at Arthur Kill. In an interview with Vulture, showrunner Erik Oleson detailed how the scene came to be, and that it was director Alex Garcia Lopez's idea to do the \"oner\" after he read the script. But Oleson didn't initially grasp the extent of Lopez's vision, and didn't foresee it being an over-10-minute take, which made executives skeptical.\n\n\"I had to call all the financial people and say, 'Guess what? We're gonna stop filming for a day but have the entire crew there to rehearse,'\" Oleson said. \"From television production, that's definitely caused some agita.\"\n\nAccording to Oleson, the take is actually one shot, with no CGI tricks. Cox did 80% of the scene himself, but a stunt double, Chris Brewster, was strategically swapped in at opportune moments, called a \"Texas switch.\"\n\nLopez and the crew captured the scene, which begins in an infirmary room at the prison and ends with Murdock finally escaping and getting in to a taxi, on the third uninterrupted take.\n\nNetflix\n\nSince Arthur Kill has been the shooting location for various productions, there are plenty of props around. But a lot of what's left from the former prison is still there, including writing carved in to walls that is authentic.\n\nAs more and more productions leave New York for lower-cost locations, such as Georgia, Broadway Stages hopes Arthur Kill will be a one-stop-shop for multiple shoots at once that could provide at least 1,500 jobs daily. Cohn or Schaum didn't divulge what Broadway Stages charges for a production to use the grounds, but film students, such as from New York University, can film there for an affordable price.\n\nBroadway Stages' five-year $20 million investment includes editing facilities, renovations to the pool for underwater filming, and five sound stages (there's currently one).\n\nBelow is a closer look at the prison:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Callum Burroughs", "title": "UK bank stocks are cratering after Brexit chaos rumbles Theresa May's government", "description": "Barclays, RBS, and Lloyds, some of the UK's largest lenders, crash more than 4.5% after Theresa May's Brexit plan failed to win over her party, and the market.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nIf you want a card that pays you back in valuable American Express Membership Rewards points with no annual fee, the Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express is a great choice. The card pays 2x per dollar on all purchases up to $50,000 per year and 1x point from there on. Even more, this card has benefits often reserved for just the elite tiers of travel rewards credit cards with high annual fees.\n\nWhile the rewards and benefits don't stand up to the $450-per-year Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express, the rewards and benefits are quite compelling for a card with no annual fee. Follow along to learn more about how this card works, what it costs, and if it makes sense for your business.\n\nRewards\n\nThe primary rewards from the Blue Business Plus are Membership Rewards points. Cardholders earn 2x points per dollar on every purchase up to $50,000 per year and 1x point for every dollar thereafter. If you hit the $50,000 per year mark, that's 100,000 Membership Rewards points per year.\n\nMembership Rewards points are worth about 2 cents each, so 100,000 points per year is worth about $2,000 toward free travel depending on how you book. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for travel directly through the American Express travel portal, or you can transfer to some partners at a 1:1 ratio for even better redemption value in some cases.\n\nPoints can also be redeemed for a statement credit (works like cash back) and some purchases, but the best value typically comes from using your points for travel rewards.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Blue Business Plus card comes with a suite of benefits most common for cards with a $100+ annual fee. Those include valuable travel and purchase protections that can come in handy in a wide range of scenarios.\n\nFor standard purchases, this card includes an automatic extended warranty where applicable and purchase protection for up to 120 days. I just used purchase protection to get reimbursed for an item I bought a few months ago that broke just after the return date. As long as you use the card, most new purchases are covered.\n\nWhen traveling, this card offers rental car insurance, baggage insurance, and travel accident insurance. It also has a free roadside assistance feature that works like AAA, but you are responsible for the costs of third-party services rendered.\n\nThe card also offers a range of discounts through AmEx Offers and useful features to manage employee cards and balances. Any small business should have its needs met with this card.\n\nRead more: The 8 best small business credit cards to open in 2018\n\nCosts and fees\n\nThis card charges no annual fee, but there are some costs depending on how you use the card. Those come in the form of interest (after a 0% introductory period), balance transfer and foreign transactions fees, and late or returned payment fees.\n\nNew cardholders get 15 months at 0% APR for purchases and balance transfers. After that, a variable rate APR of 13.24% to 21.24% applies based on your credit history and market interest rates. Just pay off your card in full every month before the due date to avoid interest costs. Late and returned payments trigger a higher 29.99% variable penalty APR.\n\nIf you currently carry a balance on another credit card, you may be able to take advantage of the 0% introductory period to pay off your debt for good. If you get a lower APR at American Express than your other cards charge, a balance transfer may make sense.\n\nBalance transfers cost 3% of the transaction value ($5 minimum) and foreign transactions charge a 2.7% fee. Late and returned payments cost up to $38 per occurrence.\n\nCan the Blue Business Plus save you green?\n\nWhile the Blue Business Plus doesn't offer a welcome bonus \u2014 unlike other American Express business cards like AmEx Business Platinum\u2014 the Blue Business Plus offers a very competitive 2x points per dollar easily worth as much as 4% cash back when you use your points well. The card has few downsides, particularly as it has no annual fee.

Sen.\u2026 [+4973 chars]", "fulltext": "Have you ever looked at a Heinz ketchup bottle and thought, \"Huh, what does that 57 mean?\"\n\nWell, it means nothing. Or almost nothing.\n\nThat's according to Emily Ruby, the curator of the Heinz exhibit at the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. Sen. Heinz was the great-grandson of the founder of the HJ Heinz company, Henry John Heinz.\n\nIn a recent interview with Business Insider's podcast, \"Household Name,\" Ruby said that legend has it a young Henry John Heinz was riding a train in New York City around the year 1896 when he saw an advertisement for \"21 varieties of shoes.\" He was looking for new ways to market his food business, and he liked the idea of pegging a number to his product.\n\nHe landed on the number 57 \u2014 even though his company had more than 60 products at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of theories for why he chose that number. Some say five was his lucky number and seven was his wife's favorite number. Some speculate on the religious connotations behind the number seven, while others think he just liked the way 57 looked or sounded.\n\nRuby said she's heard a lot of different ideas.\n\n\"I had a guy come up to me at a talk and say that he knew, because his grandfather was friends with Heinz, that it was because the streets in Pittsburgh at the time ended at 56 going up the river, the Allegheny River where he lived, so there's all kinds of theories out there,\" she said.\n\nBrian Butko, the Heinz History Center's director of publications, who also wrote an article about the 57 varieties, said that the mystique of the label has become more important than its actual meaning.\n\n\"The sound and look of it meant more to him than the actual number,\" Butko said. \"And that's the difference between a company that thinks they're bragging by saying, 'Oh we have 157 [varieties],' and an innovator who sees the value in the sound and look of something easily graspable.\"\n\nEven though the 57 was largely a made-up number, the Heinz company assigned 57 products to a list of the varieties, according to an ad from 1924. Classic Heinz tomato ketchup was listed at No. 48 on the list, with prepared mustard right behind it at 49. No. 1 on the list was baked beans with pork and tomato sauce, while No. 57 was tarragon vinegar.\n\nOther products on the list included varieties of preserves, jellies, pickles, gherkins, vinegars, soups, and pastas. The ad shows that the products originated in various countries around the world. Most of the products are still more popular abroad than in the United States.\n\nPaul Sakuma / AP Images \"In the [Heinz History Center] exhibit, some of the most popular products are the ones that we don't have here in the United States but are sold in Europe,\" Butko said.\n\nAnother popular product at the exhibit is horseradish, which was the first product Heinz ever made from his family's land in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. He was eight years old when he thought of an innovative way to market his product: putting it in a clear jar so that customers could see that he had the whitest and purest roots in his horseradish.\n\nHis first food company declared bankruptcy in 1875, but his nearly identical HJ Heinz company became successful just a few years later. His marketing strategy took off after he came up with the idea for his \"57 varieties\" slogan in the 1890s, even as the number of products the company offered stretched into the hundreds and thousands.\n\n\"[The slogan] wasn't just on the products, it was all on the advertising, on the bottling, and his salesmen would use that pitch, too,\" Ruby said.\n\nTo promote his 57 varieties, Heinz installed the first-ever electric sign on the site where the Flatiron Building now stands in New York. It was a 43-foot, six-story tall image of a pickle with \"57 varieties\" written underneath. He put ads with a large 57 all over the place, including on an Atlantic City pier. He also put massive cement 57s on hillsides close to railroad lines so that passengers would see them during their trip.\n\nAll of that effective advertising and branding led the 57 varieties to become ingrained in culture, and they have come to be a nickname for many different things. For example, a bingo caller might say \"57 varieties\" when they pull out the \"57\" bingo ball, \"57 varieties\" in draw poker is when 5 and 7 are wild cards, and a mutt might be called \"57 varieties\" or \"Heinz dogs.\"\n\nThe slogan has also appeared in popular culture, like in Jimmy Buffett's song \"Cheeseburgers in Paradise,\" and both the novel and film \"The Manchurian Candidate.\"\n\nIt also helps that the campaign was launched before there was an onslaught of advertising everywhere you turned.\n\n\"Now, we all run screaming from advertising that's everything from the floor of a supermarket to the ice of a hockey rink, electronic billboards,\" Butko said.\n\n\"But at the time, his advertising was innovative, so even if it was everywhere, it never pushed the point where people had too much of it. And then it's carried on into our modern, post-modern world, where things like that, they grow beyond their original meaning.\"\n\nTo learn more about Heinz's 57 varieties, subscribe to Business Insider's podcast, \"Household Name.\" You can find it in your podcast feed under the title \"The Waffle House Index.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Daniel Keyes", "title": "Easy returns will win retailers customer loyalty", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Returning gifts may be difficult because those consumers are new to the retailer or lacking key information since they weren't the ones who bought the products they're returning.\n\nRetailers should make the returns process as inexpensive and transparent as possible, and allow for in-store returns, to match consumers' preferences."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dave Smith", "title": "This 19-second video of a drone wielding a flamethrower will haunt your dreams", "description": "A video of a drone wielding a flame-thrower has been making the rounds on Twitter recently.

Such a move would also help to prevent the burgeoning network of crypto-based transactions from further becoming a haven for criminal activity, she noted.\n\nCBDCs would have serious ramifications for global financial systems. Although central bank-issued cryptos could increase transaction speeds, reduce costs, and improve the efficacy of financial markets, they also pose a significant threat to the existing banking system. Currently, central bank money is available to customers only in cash form. Electronic money, in customers' bank accounts, is provided by commercial financial institutions.\n\nCBDCs would extend central bank money to everyone electronically, circumventing intermediaries and calling into question the need for banking practices like deposit-taking as a result. Lagarde also pointed out that CBDCs are not without potential downsides themselves \u2014 particularly around issues of security and financial instability. Moreover \u2014 and perhaps the biggest risk \u2014 the material benefits of these instruments are still unclear, according to an IMF discussion paper published yesterday.\n\nStill, Lagarde's comments are the latest indication that the idea of CBDC is gaining momentum. The emergence of cryptos has beckoned a potentially existential challenge for central banks, questioning their monopoly status as issuers of official tender.\n\nIn response, some central banks \u2014 including those in China, Canada, and Sweden \u2014 are exploring their own means of issuing digital currencies directly to the public. For its part, the Bank of England released a working paper on the implication of using digital currencies for central and commercial bank balance sheets, but it denied any plans to issue its own CBDC.\n\nThese developments are evidence that, despite cryptos' significant price hit this year and the steady stream of negative news that continues to plague the space, the nascent asset class is no longer a niche fascination. IMF endorsement and central bank exploration will provide a much needed air of legitimacy to the space and likely spur further investment and adoption."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "JPMorgan is gaining ground after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $4 billion stake (JPM)", "description": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought a $4 billion stake in JPMorgan in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing released on Wednesday.

Maryland has the largest cyber workforce in the world, with more than 109,000 cyber-related engineering and data science professionals.\n\nMaryland is the home of Fort Meade, which houses the U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency and the Defense Information Systems Agency; all operating at the cutting edge of cybersecurity. It's also the home to CyberTown \u2013 Port Covington, MD which is set to be the largest cybersecurity and tech hub in the world given an announcement on October 18, 2018.\n\nAccording to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, \"Maryland is where cyber works. It's the home to the largest concentration of cyber engineering talent in the nation, and our colleges and universities graduate more than 7,000 computer and data science degree-holders each year. Baltimore's selection for this prestigious event is further proof. We are thrilled to host the inaugural Global Cyber Innovation Summit,\" Hogan added.\n\nRoland Cloutier, Chief Security Officer of ADP and Summit Advisory Board member stated, \"Our cyber adversaries are creative, sophisticated and relentless. The Summit provides a forum for my peers and me to share experiences, and discuss the future of cyber defense in a controlled and curated environment. Success in cyber is going to come down to collective defense in many areas. The Summit provides us a venue to move that discussion forward in a meaningful way,\" Cloutier added.\n\nCollective Defense is Essential to Effective Cyber Security\n\nIncreasingly, industry and government operate and billions of lives are lived in the digital cyber space. It is a domain with no geographic boundaries, no enforceable rules and near limitless potential for abuse. When things go wrong, they do so at the speed of light. The rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape and the increasing pace and magnitude of attacks requires a re-thinking of how cyber security operators ensure the security and integrity of their systems, networks and data. Operators see the need to come together to share experience, advance best practices, identify emerging threats and evaluate cutting edge innovation for their tool security boxes.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a national security imperative, one that directly effects the lives of individuals, the integrity of industry and the effectiveness of government. We cannot afford to play catch up with our adversaries. It's essential to anticipate the evolving threat landscape and convene our peer group to continually raise the bar for which we are responsible,\" said Tom Wilson, CISO of Southern Company and a member of the Summit Advisory Board.\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity Innovation Summit; Advisory Council and Steering Committee Specifics\n\nThe Summit will include a series of keynote presentations, panel discussions, fireside chats and briefings by cyber security practitioners and thought leaders operating at the very cutting edge of the industry.

Drinking more water than your kidneys can process can throw your blood sodium levels out of balance. That's called water intoxication. And in extreme cases, it can cause brain damage, comas, and even death.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear the word poison? Arsenic? Cyanide? How about water?\n\nLife couldn't exist without water. But in the right circumstance... Water can be as dangerous as any poison. Here's what happens when you drink too much water.\n\nYour kidneys filter out excess waste and water from your bloodstream. But they can only process 800-1,000 mL of water an hour. And if you somehow manage to drink more than that without throwing up, you can run into trouble. Because you're drinking faster than your kidneys can process it. So the excess ends up in your cells.\n\nNormally, your cells are surrounded by a carefully-balanced solution of sodium and water, which flows in and out through tiny holes in the cellular membrane, so it keeps the sodium concentration both in and out of the cell balanced.\n\nBut when you drink too much water, the sodium solution gets diluted. It's not salty enough. So some of that extra water rushes into the cell to restore balance and that causes it to swell up.\n\nDoctors call this water intoxication and it's a big problem. Now, most of your cells can handle the swelling to a degree since soft, flexible tissue like fat and muscle can stretch.\n\nBut for the cells in your brain, it's another story, because your skull isn't stretchy. It's bone. It's hard \u2014 like a rock.\n\nSo, as your brain swells, it builds up the pressure in your head.\n\nAt first, you might experience headaches, confusion, or drowsiness.\n\nBut as the pressure increases, you risk brain damage, coma, and even death. And it could all be over in less than ten hours.\n\nA 64-year-old woman, for example, died the same evening after drinking between 30-40 glasses of water. And a group of US Army trainees suffered vomiting and seizes after downing over 2 liters per hour after a tough day of training.\n\nBut it's marathon runners who need to be especially careful. A study found that 1 in 6 marathon runners develop at least mild water intoxication because the race stresses their body, including the kidneys. So, they don't excrete water as efficiently, which can cause water to back up into the blood more easily.\n\nPeople with certain kidney issues are also vulnerable since they can't properly process water and the problem isn't unique to water.\n\nFor example, the same thing can happen if you down too much beer at once. That's called potomania.\n\nThe good news is that there's an easy way to stay safe. The average healthy adult needs somewhere around 3-4 liters of water a day. And since this can come from food and other drinks too, drink when you're thirsty, and then stop."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dennis Green", "title": "Amazon is starting Black Friday a week early (AMZN)", "description": "Amazon announced on Thursday morning it will start its Black Friday deals on Friday, November 16.

From ancient Greece to \"Black Mirror,\" fiction tells us that there are drawbacks in summoning loved ones from the grave.\n\nBut one tech entrepreneur is working to turn these tales on their head. Marius Ursache wants to make digital copies of the dead.\n\nThe 41-year-old grew up in Romania where he studied to be a doctor. He set up his own web design company while at medical school and dipped his toe in fintech, but quit because he hated working with banks.\n\nHe started taking courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is where he got the inspiration for a grander venture: Eternime.\n\nEnter Eternime\n\nThe company was founded in 2014, and hopes to make people \"virtually immortal\" by creating a digital avatar of people after they die. Soon after founding Eternime, personal tragedy gave the project new meaning when Ursache lost his best friend in a car accident.\n\nHe repetitively watched footage of his friend's TEDx talk after his death. \"It made me remember how important that person was to my life and how lucky I was for having him in my life and learning so many things from him,\" he said. He hopes Eternime could have a similar effect.\n\nMarius Ursache, Eternime CEO and cofounder. Eternime\n\nAt the moment, Eternime takes the form of an app which collects data about you. It does this in two ways: Automatically harvesting heaps of smartphone data, and by asking you questions through a chatbot.\n\nThe goal is to collect enough data about you so that when the technology catches up, it will be able to create a chatbot \"avatar\" of you after you die, which your loved ones can then interact with.\n\n\"We collect geolocation, motion, activity, health app data, sleep data, photos, messages that users put in the app. We also collect Facebook data from external sources,\" Ursache told Business Insider. This is all done, of course, with your explicit permission.\n\nA prototype demo of Eternime was recently on display in London's Victoria and Albert Museum, showing its user interface and how it amasses data from its users' digital lives.\n\nUrsache has been funding the project with his cofounder and CTO Claudiu Baciu, who he met working at his first company. In the future, Ursache hopes to release Eternime as a free service with premium account options, but said he would never run ads.\n\n\"Even basic things like profiling would be a breach of privacy and confidence, so we're going to try to support basically the free plans through subscription fees from other users,\" he said.\n\nA promotional image of Eternime's chatbot which learns about you so it can make an \"avatar\" of you after death. Eternime\n\nThe beta test has more than 40,000 signups, according to Eternime's website, but is so far only in the hands of around 40 people. The test involves users chronicling their day-to-day lives. Business Insider spoke to one of Eternime's beta testers, Claudiu Jojatu, who has been using the app for about a year.\n\n\"For me it's very important, and I am using it every day as a personal journal. I input a lot of data on how was my day and how I felt that day. And then it's very cool that it synchronises with my Facebook account and with my pictures from the phone,\" Jojatu said.\n\nEternime feels like having a \"digital alter-ego,\" he added, and although the afterlife functionality of Eternime is a while off, Jojatu is relishing the prospect.\n\n\"Probably 99% of our memories get lost, and it's kind of awesome to know that you can actually leave something behind,\" he said.\n\nHow would you want to be remembered?\n\nThat same thought struck Eugenia Kuyda when her close friend Roman Mazurenko died in a car accident in 2015. He was just 32. Kuyda missed Roman so much, she created a chatbot of him.\n\n\"Roman was a close friend and a special one,\" Kuyda told Business Insider over email. \"I wanted to tell a story about him and tell him some things I hadn't been able to. I put together around 10,000 of his text messages and together with a brilliant AI engineer on our team, Artem, we made a bot that could replicate the way Roman used to speak.\"\n\nEugenia Kuyda (left) and her friend Roman. Eugenia Kuyda\n\nFrom Roman, Replika was born. Replika is an app in which you confide in an AI-powered chatbot that learns about you as you chat to it. The app has more than 200,000 monthly active users, and has raised $11 million from investors including Y Combinator and All Turtles, the incubator run by former Evernote CEO Phil Libin.\n\nUrsache recognizes the crossover with Eternime. \"I think in terms of approach and mindset and surprisingly even personal stories, Replika is our closest competitor that we have,\" he said.\n\nCreating Roman was a personal project and a memorial for a friend, but Kuyda points out that building chatbots like Roman's on a commercial scale poses a myriad technical and ethical challenges. For example: At what age do you wish to be immortalised?\n\n\"This is especially true for older people or people that have Alzheimer's and other diseases that change the way they act and talk a lot. Do you want to talk to your grandpa in his 20s? Or the grandpa you remember when you were a kid?\" she said.\n\nShe also pointed out that a chatbot might accidentally divulge information the deceased would not otherwise disclose to their loved ones. \"Think for example if you're building a bot for your best friend and she was gay and her brother doesn't know \u2014 will you program it to understand who the bot is talking to it? It's not an easy problem ethically and technically.\"\n\nUrsache recognised that this is a challenge Eternime will have to overcome, especially if family members feel uncomfortable with the idea a chatbot that could potentially say anything.\n\nThe dangers of being virtually immortal\n\nThere are many other moral quandaries to consider. Researcher Carl \u00d6hman, of the Oxford Internet Institute, explored the potential problems with \"re-creation services\" in a paper published in Nature, which named Eternime and Replika.\n\n\"The main problem as I see it is the updating of software,\" he told Business Insider. If you sign up to have your chatbot stored forever by a company, you won't be able to sign off on any software updates that might change the way that bot functions after you die.\n\nMicrosoft's Tay chatbot started churning out alarming comments on Twitter in 2016. Twitter\n\nHe also warned that algorithms have been known to act unpredictably. \"Just look at what happened to Microsoft's Twitter chatbot Tay \u2014 it turned into a racist, Holocaust-denying, bigot within a matter of hours. How can we guarantee this doesn't happen with chatbots claiming to portray a real person?\"\n\n\"The crucial thing is that consumers understand how the data is to be used after their death, this is difficult to guarantee when you use complex algorithms fed with many different data sources,\" \u00d6hman added.\n\nUrsache admits that the bots responding to stimuli poses an ethical conundrum. \"There's tonnes of things to think of ethically and technically and behaviorally,\" he said.\n\nProblems for the living\n\nAnother big question Eternime throws up is whether it's healthy for living people to interact with a digital alter-ego of their deceased loved ones.\n\nAnother tech entrepreneur looking to break into death care is concerned by this. Mark Alhermizi is the CEO of Everdays, a company which creates pop-up social networks when a person dies. These networks are used to notify people of that person's death, and thus far have been set up via funeral homes, although Everdays has recently launched a consumer app.\n\nEverdays generates a pop-up social network when someone dies. Everdays\n\nAlhermizi is optimistic about the potential tech has to improve the death care sector, but the thought of a legacy chatbot like Eternime's troubles him.\n\n\"The problem ethically allowing this to exist... is that you get stuck living a false reality,\" he told Business Insider. Alhermizi referred to the \"Black Mirror\" episode \"Be Right Back,\" in which a bereaved woman resurrects her partner using his data but it quickly turns sour.\n\nHe is not worried about the immediate future, because the tech isn't yet good enough to make an AI chatbot that convincingly imitates a person.\n\n\"But one day they will be good, and I think about what the consequences are for people using them. Forget about ethics, it's about them living in a false reality. Not just not moving on with grief, but not moving on with their lives,\" he added.\n\nUrsache said he collaborated with psychologists when designing Eternime, but admits there could be unforeseen consequences, like people isolating themselves because they become too involved with a chatbot.\n\n\"Black Mirror\" explored the idea of using tech to recreate the dead. Netflix\n\nFor the moment at least, he said Eternime is beneficial because people can use it to reflect. \"We had people from the beta programmes who said it's like having an imaginary friend and it's providing some comfort,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Ursache and Alhermizi think tech needs to move into death care in earnest. \"This is one area of human life that I don't think has been improved or touched by technology,\" said Ursache.\n\nBut researcher Carl \u00d6hman thinks regulation needs to be set up before \"digital afterlife services\" become commonplace. \"As a society, we should think twice before we leave the nature of our afterlives entirely to an unregulated market,\" he said.\n\nWe may be getting closer to making thousands of years of human storytelling about speaking to the the dead a reality, but it will not be without its dangers."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tanya Dua", "title": "Ad tech company Taboola wants to reach you while you're waiting for your ride, and it's part of a plan to take on Apple News", "description": "Israeli ad tech firm Taboola has formed a strategic partnership with ride-hailing app Via.

Now, it's looking to get its links in more places.\n\nThe Israeli firm, best known for delivering those ubiquitous sponsored posts across thousands of publishers' sites on the web, has formed a strategic partnership with ride-hailing app Via, through which it will deliver relevant news to riders directly through the Via app.\n\nTaboola News, a preinstalled smartphone widget, will integrate within the Via app, surfacing curated news and content to riders from Taboola's network of premium publishers through a personalized bar at the bottom of the app. A little more than 10 million people are using Taboola News globally, and more than 50 publishers are on it, according to Taboola founder and CEO Adam Singolda.\n\nPublishers, including HuffPost, USA Today, and Business Insider, pay Taboola to boost their links through its recommendation engine and refer readers to their websites. Taboola typically gets a cut of the ad revenue generated through these recommendations.\n\nTaboola has entered into a revenue-share agreement with Via as well, according to Singolda, who declined to give specifics.\n\nVia is smaller than both Lyft and Uber. Uber controls a lion's share of the ride-hailing market in the US with a 71% share, according to SimilarWeb data from April, which looks at app installs from Google Play. Lyft, in comparison, has 26.2% of the US market share, with others including Via and Juno making up the remainder.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of another recent partnership between Taboola and Chinese phone-maker Vivo, which is the world's fifth-largest smartphone manufacturer and reaches 100 million mobile users across Asia.\n\n\"There are a lot of environments where captive audiences spend a lot of time, like cars and airports, but they don't necessarily have much to do,\" Singolda told Business Insider. \"We want to take Taboola News to all those environments, with Via being our first step toward owning the car environment.\"\n\nFor Via, it's about enhancing its riders' journey, Via CEO and cofounder Daniel Ramot said. Both Taboola and Via have worked with venture-capital fund Pitango.\n\n\"At Via, we care deeply about providing a superior customer experience at every stage of the journey,\" said Ramot. \"We're excited that this partnership with Taboola will enable us to enhance riders' Via trip by enabling them to seamlessly access hyperrelevant content directly from their app.\"\n\nSingolda likened Taboola to a \"reverse search engine,\" which delivers personalized news and content to consumers, instead of them having to search for it themselves. The company wants to take its battle for users' attention to all fronts: whether it's their mobile-phone screens, ride-hailing apps like Via, or even car infotainment screens in the future, Singolda said.\n\nSince its launch, Taboola News has pitched itself as a publisher-friendly version of Apple News, which publishers have said doesn't allow them to fully monetize their audience. Unlike Apple News, Taboola News isn't housed in a stand-alone app. Plus, it sends readers directly to publishers' websites, allowing them to own their ad sales and relationships with readers.\n\n\"Taboola News allows us to reach new and engaged audiences with stories, videos, and other curated content that will drive readers to our various owned and operated websites, where we can build direct relationships,\" said Grant Whitmore, the executive vice president and general manager for Tribune Publishing Company's northeast region.\n\nZTE is the second-largest Chinese telecom-equipment maker after Huawei Technologies and has sold handset devices to US mobile carriers including AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. But with an 11% market share in the first quarter of 2018, it has a far smaller market share in the US than Apple, which has 38%, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nStill, Singolda said he wants to build \"an alternative to the walled gardens,\" referring to Facebook and Apple, which have faced criticism from advertisers and publishers for their closed systems.\n\n\"Taboola is the Robin Hood of the open web,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "title": "Facebook hits back at The New York Times, pointing out the inaccuracies in its blockbuster report on leadership missteps", "description": "An explosive New York Times report delved into how Facebook's leadership dealt with scandals over the past few years.

Facebook discouraged its security chief, Alex Stamos, from looking into Russian interference\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"The story asserts that we knew about Russian activity as early as the spring of 2016 but were slow to investigate it at every turn. This is not true...\n\n\"After the election, no one ever discouraged Alex Stamos from looking into Russian activity \u2014 as he himself acknowledged on Twitter. Indeed as The New York Times says, 'Mark and Sheryl [Sandberg] expanded Alex's work.'\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.\n\n\"Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.\n\n\"Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos's work, creating a group called Project P, for 'propaganda,' to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos's original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.\"\n\nThe Times also said that in September 2017, Sandberg yelled at Stamos during a meeting after he told board members that the company had not yet got the problem of Russian interference under control.\n\n\"Mr. Stamos's briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\n\n\"'You threw us under the bus!' she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\"\n\n2. Why Russia didn't get a mention in Facebook's 2017 White Paper\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"We did not name Russia in our April 2017 white paper \u2014 but instead cited a US Government report in a footnote about Russian activity \u2014 because we felt that the US Director of National Intelligence was best placed to determine the source.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"[Joel] Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected [to releasing a the findings publicly]. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.\n\n\"If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.\n\n\"Ms. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 who spent much of 2017 on a national 'listening tour,' feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota \u2014 did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was published that April, the word 'Russia' never appeared.\"\n\n3. Deciding against banning Donald Trump over his Muslim ban\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"We did decide that President Trump's comments on the Muslim ban, while abhorrent to many people, did not break our Community Standards for the same reasons The New York Times and many other organizations covered the news: Donald Trump was a candidate running for office. To suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.\"\n\nThe Times reported that the decision was delegated to three senior officials: Joel Kaplan, Elliot Schrage, and Monika Bickert.\n\n\"Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.\n\n'\"Don't poke the bear,' Mr. Kaplan warned.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.\n\n\"Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump's language had not violated Facebook's rules and that the candidate's views had public value. 'We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,' he said in an interview.\"\n\n4. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg were complacent about fighting fake news and misinformation\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"Mark and Sheryl have been deeply involved in the fight against false news and information operations on Facebook \u2014 as they have been consistently involved in all our efforts to prevent misuse of our services.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"As evidence accumulated that Facebook's power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.\"\n\n5. Facebook came out in favour of a bill targeting sex trafficking to score political points\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"Sheryl championed this legislation because she believed it was the right thing to do, and that tech companies need to be more open to content regulation where it can prevent real world harm. In fact, the company faced considerable criticism as a result.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\nFacebook hired PR firm, Definers Public Affairs, in October 2017. Definers recommended that Facebook, \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"\n\n\"Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites...Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.\"\n\n6. Facebook seeded negative press about Apple because Tim Cook criticised it over privacy\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"Tim Cook has consistently criticized our business model and Mark has been equally clear he disagrees. So there's been no need to employ anyone else to do this for us.\"\n\n\"The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook's behalf - or to spread misinformation,\" Facebook added.\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices....The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company's political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients' enemies...\n\n\"Mr. Miller [Tim Miller, head of Definers] acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers' work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook's criticism upset Facebook.\"\n\n7. Mark Zuckerberg insisted his executives use only Android phones due to Tim Cook's criticisms\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"We've long encouraged our employees and executives to use Android because it is the most popular operating system in the world.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"'Were not going to traffic in your personal life,' Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. 'Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.' (Mr. Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple's.)\"\n\n8. Facebook's PR tried to blame anti-Facebook groups on George Soros\n\nFacebook's statement:\n\n\"Definers did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of 'Freedom from Facebook,' an anti-Facebook organization. The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company. To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and untrue.\"\n\nWhat the Times wrote:\n\n\"Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement...\n\n\"Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros's family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros's son. (An official at Mr. Soros's Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)\"\n\nFacebook announced that it ended its contract with Definers on Wednesday night.\n\nA New York Times spokeswoman stood by the story in a statement to Business Insider. \"Our story is accurate and we stand by it.

It is already gathering support.\n\nErskine Bowles, the chair of Facebook's new Audit & Risk Oversight Committee. Getty\n\nFacebook has consistently brushed off these demands. It has said an independent chairman would create \"uncertainty, confusion, and inefficiency.\" This is despite this governance mechanism functioning pretty smoothly at other tech companies, including Apple, Twitter, and Microsoft.\n\nAnd there's one element of The Times' story that underlines the value of independent oversight. It features the board member Erskine Bowles, the chair of Facebook's audit committee, conducting a foul-mouthed grilling of management on how the company allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference.\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg were stunned into action.\n\nIt's not as if Zuckerberg is blind to Facebook's failings. He accepts that the buck stops with him. \"I designed the platform, so if someone's going to get fired for this, it should be me,\" he told Recode earlier this year.\n\nStepping down as chairman would allow him to acknowledge his failings, throw a bone to angry shareholders and Facebook critics, and yet still keep control of the $40 billion company he created in his Harvard dorm room.\n\nIt might also help achieve the ultimate aim of making Facebook a better, safer place for its 2 billion users."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Bill Bostock", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says people on Capitol Hill keep assuming she's an intern", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she keeps being mistaken for an intern during her first week on Capitol Hill.

And as if that underperformance hadn't been bad enough, traders appear to be braced for even more turmoil.\n\nAs this chart shows, the spread between the Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index, or VXN, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, and its S&P 500 counterpart, known as the VIX, is its widest since 2004.\n\nBusiness Insider/Joe Ciolli/Andy Kiersz, data from Bloomberg\n\nWhat that means is that traders are the most scared in 14 years of further turbulence in the tech sector, relative to price swings in the broader market.\n\nSince choppier trading means a higher likelihood of deep losses, and because volatility gauges move inversely to their underlying indexes roughly 80% of the time, it's a very negative signal for markets to be this rattled.\n\nIn case you aren't buying this argument, consider what happened the last time this volatility spread reached such rarefied air. As you can see in the above chart, this was the period right before the most recent financial crisis.\n\nA recent Bank of America survey of 225 fund managers with $641 billion in assets under management showed that investors were actually already starting to back away from tech stocks.

The firm finds that the most crowded trade for fund managers is owning the mega-cap consortium known as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) and BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent).\n\nWhen a trade is crowded like that, it can cause sharp drawdowns in shares on occasions when traders simultaneously stampede to the exits. It's a force that feeds upon itself. The further invested people get, the more it hurts when things go awry.

I have wanted to avoid the disagreeable nature of a formal Vote of No Confidence with all the ill will that this risks engendering.\n\nRegrettably, the draft Withdrawal Agreement presented to Parliament today has turned out to be worse than anticipated and fails to meet the promises given to the nation by the Prime Minister, either on her own account or on behalf of us all in the Conservative Party Manifesto.\n\nThat the Conservative and Unionist Party is proposing a Protocol which would create a different regulatory environment for an integral part of our country stands in contradistinction to our long-held principles. It is in opposition to the Prime Minister's clear statements that this was something that no Prime Minister would ever do and raises questions in relation to Scotland that are open to exploitation by the Scottish National Party.\n\nThe 2017 Election Manifesto said that the United Kingdom would leave the Customs Union. It did not qualify this statement by saying that we could stay in it via a backstop while Annex 2, Article 3 explicitly says that we would have no authority to set our own tariffs. It is also harder to leave this backstop than it is to leave the EU, there is no provision equivalent to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nThe Prime Minister also promised an implementation period which was the reason for paying \u00a339 billion. As was made clear by a House of Lords report in March 2017 there is no legal obligation to pay anything. This has now become an extended period of negotiation which is a different matter.\n\nThe situation as regards the European Court of Justice appears to have wandered from the clear statement that we are taking back control of our laws. Article 174 makes this clear as does Article 89 in conjunction with Article 4.\n\nIt is of considerable importance that politicians stick to their commitments or do not make such commitments in the first place. Regrettably, this is not the situation, therefore, in accordance with the relevant rules and procedures of the Conservative Party and the 1922 Committee this is a formal letter of No Confidence in the Leader of the Party, the Rt. Hon. Theresa May.\n\nI am copying this letter to the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip and although I understand that it is possible for the correspondence to remain confidential I shall be making it public."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Thomas Colson", "title": "Theresa May suffers more resignations as Esther McVey resigns over May's Brexit deal", "description": "LONDON \u2014 Ester McVey, the secretary of state for work and pensions, has resigned from her post in protest at May's Brexit plan.

While she claimed yesterday that she had won the support of Cabinet, at least 10 senior ministers were known to retain deep reservations over her draft exit plan.\n\nThere are growing suggestions that Conservative backbenchers will imminently move to force a no-confidence vote against her, and those MPs will be emboldened by the resignation of such a senior Brexit-supporting minister.\n\nJon Trickett MP, Labour's Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, responding to the resignation of the Brexit Secretary, said the government was \"falling apart before our eyes.\n\n\"This is the twentieth Minister to resign from Theresa May's Government in her two-year premiership,\" he said.\n\n\"Theresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her Cabinet - let alone Parliament and the people of our country.\"\n\nRaab's resignation was greeted with indignation by the EU. A senior EU source told BI that he was \"putting career before country,\" by standing down.\n\nBritain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab and European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier shake hands during a joint news conference in Brussels, Belgium July 26, 2018. Reuters / Yves Herman\n\nREAD: Dominic Raab's resignation letter in full\n\nDear Prime Minister,\n\nIt has been an honour to serve in your government as Justice Minister, Housing Minister, and Brexit Secretary.\n\nI regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign. I understand why you have chosen to pursue the deal with the Eu on the terms proposed, and I respect the different views held in good faith by all of our colleagues.\n\nFor my part, I cannot support the proposed deal for two reasons. First, I believe the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland proposes a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.\n\nSecond, I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement, where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit. The terms of the backstop amount to a hybrid of the EU Customs Union and Single Market obligations. No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement. That arrangement is now also taken as the starting point for the Future Economic Partnership. If we accept that, it will severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK.\n\nAbove all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election. This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.\n\nI appreciate that you disagree with my judgement on these issues. I have weighed very carefully the alternative courses of action which the government could take, on which I have previously advised. Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot.\n\nMy respect for you, and the fortitude you have shown in difficult times, remains undimmed."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christian Edwards, provided by<br><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><img src=\"//imgs.sfgate.com/graphics/partners/businessinsider/article_header.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>", "title": "Japan's cybersecurity minister admits: 'I don't use computers' - SFGate", "description": "Oli Scarff / Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nJapan's No. 2 cybersecurity official has let slip - in parliament - that he has never used a computer.\nYoshitaka Sakurada, 68, is the deputy chief of the government's cybersecurity strategy office and he is also the minister in c\u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/japan-cybersecurity-minister-admits-he-does-not-use-computers-2018-11?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=allverticals", "urlToImage": "https://www.sfgate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T08:50:00Z", "content": "Oli Scarff / Getty Images Japan's recently appointed cybersecurity and Olympics minister has told parliament he has never used a computer in his life, though it's his job to oversee cybersecurity for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

It's a bustling outfit out of China's Zhejiang province and the company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which owns Volvo.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, sales of Geely had tripled, to almost 1.25 million, making Geely the No. 2 car brand in China, behind the ubiquitous Volkswagen, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. (Pretty much every taxi in China is a Volkswagen, which can lay claim to 6% market share, The Journal reported, citing data from the auto intelligence company LMC Automotive.)\n\nBut sales of Geely cars fell in October \u2014 a 10% year-over-year decline \u2014 ending 46 consecutive months of year-over-year growth, according to The Journal.\n\nAs the holidays loom, the trade relationship between the US and China is still testy. The two countries have so far imposed tariffs covering roughly $360 billion worth of merchandise traded between them. And that has implications for each major industry and the players in it.\n\nGeely isn't the only auto company suffering \u2014 car sales in China have fallen for the past four months year over year and are on course for an annual decline for the first time in nearly three decades, according to The Journal.\n\nFollowing China's decadelong love affair with four wheels, big-name auto producers are in uncharted territory.\n\nSales of Ford's passenger cars in China have collapsed by 45% in the first nine months of the year. The people who bought Jeep to China, Fiat Chrysler, have seen sales fall by 35%, and General Motors' Buick sales were down 9%, The Journal said, citing LMC Automotive data.\n\nChina Photos/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, China's luxury-car market is rolling along. Cadillac sales are up 30% in the first nine months of the year, while BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz are up 10% to 13%, The Journal reported.\n\nIn a sign of China's wealth gap, the auto dream has begun to spin away from China's aspirational new middle class. But at the same time, the number-plate-less black cars with tinted one-way mirrors that glide through second-tier cities like Chongqing and Chengdu are still everywhere.\n\nBut it's not curtains for Geely. Though investors have fretted as its shares, listed in Hong Kong, have shed about 50% since this time last year, so have shares of several top-shelf names listed in China, as the country grapples with an uncertain economy. Bloomberg reported last month that the Shanghai Composite was down 24% in the past 12 months.\n\nGeely's sales were defiant in the interim, up 27% year-over-year from January to September, according to The Journal. October is where the winning streak came crunching to a halt.\n\n'Generally weaker demand'\n\nA Geely spokesman told The Journal of \"generally weaker demand for vehicles ... across different regions.\"\n\nThe trade war has surprised and deflated Chinese consumers used to hearty, consistently good economic news. For a long time, money has been pretty easy to come by, and if banks pull back on lending as they've done \u2014 regardless of instructions not to \u2014 a shadow-lending system has always been close by for the intrepid.\n\nThose deep pools have started to look a lot drier. Following an explosion in nonbank, micro-, and peer-to-peer lending, officials have sought to clamp down on informal lines of credit for everyday Chinese consumers.\n\nNevertheless, a Macquarie Group executive told The Journal there was ample room for Chinese auto sales to continue their trajectory and rise to 30 million to 35 million from nearly 29 million last year.\n\nBut of course, there is still a trade war to consider\n\nChinese finished vehicles exported to the US represented only 0.3% of China's total exports last year, worth $7.2 billion, according to the US International Trade Commission.\n\nHowever, the US is by far the largest destination of Chinese auto-parts exports, so any tinkering with China's access to that market would be tough for China-based exporters to swallow.\n\nAccording to Economist Intelligence Unit figures, China accounted for almost 20% of US finished-vehicle exports by value last year, or about $10.3 billion worth of cars.\n\nChinese tariffs on US auto imports could exert downward pressure on automakers that export their finished product to China from the US, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz (both German and very popular).\n\nMost of these shipments are in the luxury sector, however, and the big-name US automakers selling to China's mass market, like GM and Ford, produce their Chinese units overwhelmingly via their local joint ventures in China.\n\nBMW and Mercedes-Benz have operations in nearby Thailand, and in the case of a deterioration in the US-China trade dispute, they're likely to ramp up their local output to support shipments to China, the EIU suggested.\n\nAP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File\n\nAuto-parts exports from the US are likewise less exposed to the US-China trade dispute, as they're shipped mostly to Canada or Mexico; shipments to China accounted for only 5% of the total in 2017, the EIU added.\n\nOther trade concerns\n\nFor Asian producers in the auto sector more generally, there are bigger concerns than the US-China trade war, such as the tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed by the US in earlier this year.\n\nAlso on the horizon is a Section 232 report from the US Department of Commerce that could very well cite national security concerns to slap tariffs on all vehicles and auto parts exported to the US.\n\nGeely, though its run came to a sudden end, can relax for a while \u2014 it holds a substantial 9.69% share of Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz's parent company, The Journal reported. And Volvo sales were up one-third in China year-over-year from January to September.\n\nGeely has a bunch of new models in its garage outside Shanghai, and that should be more than enough to get it back in the winner's circle, the Geely spokesman told The Journal."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Isobel Asher Hamilton", "title": "10 things in tech you need to know today", "description": "Good morning!

China's top diplomat said on Tuesday the world should ignore \"gossip\" about Xinjiang and trust authorities there.\n\nIt was not clear if the letter had been sent yet or if it contents could be revised. One diplomatic source said it was being passed around for more countries to potentially sign.\n\nSeveral other diplomats familiar with the letter would only confirm its existence and refused to discuss it further, citing its sensitivity. All of the diplomats declined to be identified.\n\nMany foreign governments have refrained from speaking out over the Xinjiang situation, with diplomats saying countries are fearful of angering China, an increasingly weighty diplomatic player thanks to its economic heft and initiatives such as the Belt and Road infrastructure program.\n\n'WE ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED'\n\nIn the draft letter addressed directly to Chen, who outranks the region's ethnic Uighur governor Shohrat Zakir, the ambassadors said they were highly concerned by the U.N. findings on Xinjiang.\n\n\"We are deeply troubled by reports of the treatment of ethnic minorities, in particular individuals of Uyghur ethnicity, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,\" the draft reads, using an alternate spelling for Uighur.\n\n\"In order to better understand the situation, we request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss these concerns.\"\n\nThe letter is copied to China's Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Public Security and the Communist Party's international department.\n\nIt is not possible to directly contact any senior Chinese leader for comment. The Xinjiang government, ministries of foreign and public security, the party's international department and party's spokesman's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nChina has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions with the ethnic Han Chinese majority.\n\nThe letter carries the names of 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, Dutch and Australian envoys. The other countries' ambassadors names in the letter are Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Estonia, Finland and Denmark.\n\nFour diplomats familiar with the letter and its contents said Canada had taken the lead in its drafting.\n\nCanada's Foreign Ministry, in a statement sent to Reuters, did not comment directly on the letter but expressed deep concern over the reports of detention and mass surveillance of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.\n\n\"The Minister of Foreign Affairs raised the situation faced by the Uyghurs directly with China's Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly. Canada regularly raises concerns about Xinjiang with Chinese authorities both publicly and privately, bilaterally and multilaterally, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe EU, British, German, Swedish, Swiss, Belgian, Dutch, Finnish and Norwegian embassies declined to comment on the letter.\n\nThe Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was concerned about the situation in Xinjiang and officials had conveyed these concerns to China on a number of occasions.\n\nThe Irish, Danish, French and Estonian embassies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe United States is not represented on the letter, although non-U.S. diplomats say the country has been deeply involved in advocacy on the Xinjiang issue.\n\n\"We remain alarmed that since April 2017 the Chinese government has detained an estimated 800,000 to possibly more than 2 million Uighurs, Kazaks and other Muslims in internment camps for political re-education,\" a U.S. embassy spokesman said, responding to a question regarding the letter.\n\n\"The United States will continue to call on China to end these counterproductive policies and free all those arbitrarily detained. We are committed to promoting accountability for those who commit human rights violations and abuses, including by considering targeted measures against Xinjiang officials.\"\n\nThe United States has said it is considering sanctions against Chen, other officials and Chinese companies linked to allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.\n\n(Additional reporting by Christian Shepherd.

Boeing's manual for its 737 MAX 8 model, the near-new passenger jet that crashed 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta last month Java Sea last month, had nothing in it at all about a critical feature that could trigger the plane to dive.\n\nLion Air's operational director Zwingli Silalahi, said the manual failed to alert pilots that the jet's stall-prevention system could, in certain near-stall situations, trigger an automated response, that included lowering the airplane's nose.\n\n\"We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 MAX 8,\" Zwingli said Wednesday.\n\n\"That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation.\"\n\nAir crash investigators are trying to determine if an external sensor sent exactly this kind of erroneous data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.\n\nLion Air's allegations appear to support comments made by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) that allege Boeing withheld information about the danger of the Max 8's new features.\n\nLion Air Flight JT610 fell into waters off Jakarta on October 29, killing all 189 on board.\n\nBoeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued directives last week telling flight crews about the system, which is designed to provide extra protection against pilots losing control.\n\nBoeing's has since said that its safety bulletin was only meant to reinforce existing procedures.\n\nSubsequently many aviators, unions, and flight-training departments began to realize that none of the documentation including pilot's manuals for the Max 8 included an explanation of the system, according to the APA.\n\nIndonesian investigators said on Monday that more training was surely required for Boeing 737 MAX pilots after realizing the in-flight situation now thought to have faced the crew of JT610 was not a part of Boeing's flight manual.\n\nRead more: The Indonesian Lion Air flight JT 610 aircraft that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff with

Reuters.\n\n\"We don't like that we weren't notified,\" Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\nBoth Lion Air and the APA have now rejected Boeing's claim about merely reinforcing existing procedures, describing the bulletin as \"enlightening\" and in no way \"reaffirming.\"\n\n\"They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft,\" Captain Dennis Tajer, an APA spokesman told CNN.\n\nAccording to Zwingli, Boeing's bulletin did not call for any special Max 8 pilot training.\n\n\"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" Zwingli said.\n\nZwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission, the US National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary, Lion Air pilots would undertake it.\n\nBoeing has said it will not \"discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nAlthough the company did tell CNN that it had \"provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the MAX 8 planes, \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\"\n\n\"What seems to have happened here is that a new version or a modified anti-stall capacity was added which pushes the nose down automatically, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. said.\n\n\"If it's true, it is beyond comprehension that Boeing did not tell the airline and pilots about this.\"\n\nThe FAA's directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems impacts 246 Boeing 737 Max aircraft worldwide.\n\nThere are some 45 of these passenger jets run by US carriers.\n\nRead more: The US government

including Indonesia's National Transportation Commission, the US National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing said the angle-of-attack or AOA sensor that helps determine if a plane will stall or dive had been replaced the day before the incident, but problems remained.\n\nThe AOA sensor on the Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 was replaced after a flight from North Sulawesi to Bali, on October 28. During a later flight to Jakarta that same day, pilots reported further AOA problems.\n\nThe AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nIn the end, Lion Air's almost-new Boeing 737 Max 8 jet encountered difficulties on all of its final four flights, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, the KNKT, Soerjanto Tjahjono said.\n\nLost and lost\n\nRescue workers with a part of the plane's wreckage that shows Lion Air's logo.

Stone is at the center of the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor.\n\nA key thread in that investigation revolves around determining whether any Trump associates knew in advance or helped the Russians steal Democratic emails and disseminate them via WikiLeaks.\n\nStone is known to have been in direct contact with the Russian hacker Guccifer 2.0, who helped spread some of the emails, as well as WikiLeaks in the months leading up to the election. He has also said that he communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange using Credico as an intermediary.

He said that he doesn't mail in his ballot for fear of it being disqualified over his signature not matching the state's records.\n\nDeSantis himself \u2014 along with other Florida lawmakers\u2014 has had his mail-in ballot rejected because his signatures were mismatched.\n\n\"I don't know whether the lawsuit has merit or not \u2014 I'm not a lawyer, the judge will figure that out,\" Schale said of the lawsuit concerning voter signatures. \"But the reality is that it's been a problem. It is a problem \u2014 and that is decreasing confidence among voters when they cast a vote-by-mail ballot.\"\n\nScott's team has also filed suits demanding, among other things, that law enforcement seize and monitor ballots and voting equipment during the recounts (which was denied by a judge on Monday) and an injunction to stop Broward County from counting any ballots not submitted by last Saturday's deadline."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christian Edwards", "title": "Trump is handing another US ambassadorship to a member of his Mar-a-Lago resort that costs $200,000 to join", "description": "Trump is handing another US ambassadorship to a member of his Mar-a-Lago resort that costs $200,000 to join.

Stamos' report reportedly resulted in Zuckerberg and Sandberg getting grilled by the board.\n\nThe revelations shed new light on exactly how senior leadership was involved in trying to protect the company's image as it lurched from crisis to crisis. But it's still having an impact: According to another report published Wednesday, Facebook employee morale has dropped dramatically in recent months.\n\nIn a previous statement about the report, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told Business Insider: \"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face.
