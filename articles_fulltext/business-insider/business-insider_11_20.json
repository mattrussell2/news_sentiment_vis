So far, one victim of the E. coli outbreak developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, but no deaths have been reported.\n\nBecause it typically takes a few weeks for new illnesses to be reported to the CDC, the agency is telling everyone not to eat romaine this Thanksgiving out of an abundance of caution, since bad lettuce could still be out there. The CDC is urging shoppers and businesses to throw out any lettuce that was in the fridge and sanitize the areas where it was stored.\n\nWhen will it be safe to buy romaine lettuce?\n\nSince ill people reported eating several different kinds of romaine lettuce, both at home and in restaurants, the CDC is suggesting a very cautious approach for now: throwing it all away.\n\nIn some cases, it may not be clear whether a mix of \"spring greens\" contains romaine either, so be careful about those, too.\n\nBecause the CDC is still investigating the E. coli outbreak, they're concerned that new cases may continue popping up \u2014 it can take 10 days for symptoms of E. coli show up. So the warning about romaine lettuce does not have an end-date yet.\n\nShutterstock\n\nA nasty strain of E. coli\n\nLeafy greens like romaine or spinach are the most common sources of foodborne illness infections, according to an analysis by the CDC. There are many opportunities for bacteria to spread to these products and they're usually eaten raw, which means bacteria aren't killed by cooking. Washing produce can reduce some contamination, but it doesn't kill bacteria.\n\nE. coli Flickr/NIAID\n\nInvestigators have performed whole genome sequencing on the E. coli in question and found that this particular strain, E. coli O157:H7, is most similar to one that sickened 25 people who ate leafy greens (including romaine lettuce) last November and December. One Californian died during that outbreak. In May of last year, O157:H7 also turned up in soy-nut butter. Thirty-two people got sick, and nine developed kidney failure. Earlier this spring, another deadly O157:H7 strain sickened near 200 people and killed 5, but it was less genetically similar to this strain.\n\nO157:H7 usually originates in the guts of cattle, but it can also be found in goats, sheep, deer, and elk as well. It can travel from cattle farms to nearby fields where lettuce is grown and contaminate the greens in the soil. It can also get on the lettuce when food-handlers don't wash their hands properly after coming into contact with E. coli-harboring feces.\n\nThe O157:H7 strain is especially dangerous for people because it produces a nasty Shiga toxin that can make us really sick. This kind of Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, as it's sometimes called, spreads to humans when little bits of feces get inside our mouth. That's why a bit of undercooked meat, raw milk, or contaminated lettuce can make you ill.\n\nSo until the CDC issues an all-clear update, continue to avoid romaine.\n\nKevin Loria contributed to an earlier version of this story."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sonam Sheth", "title": "Trump reportedly wanted to order the DOJ to prosecute Comey and Clinton", "description": "President Donald Trump reportedly wanted to order the DOJ to prosecute former FBI director James Comey and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The DOJ is meant to be independent of the White House, but Trump has previously shown that he believes it is a political tool to be wielded against his perceived enemies.\n\nIn addition to publicly pressuring the DOJ to prosecute his rivals, Trump once reportedly asked advisers why he couldn't have \"my guys\" at the \"Trump Justice Department\" do his bidding.\n\nTrump has long harbored resentment toward both Comey and Clinton. When he ran against the former first lady in the 2016 election, Trump and his surrogates regularly led chants calling to \"lock her up\" in response to revelations that Clinton used a private email server to conduct government business when she was secretary of state.\n\nHe initially backed down after he won the presidency, but Trump soon resumed his calls for her prosecution when Clinton began criticizing him after the election, and as the FBI began investigating his campaign's contacts with Russia.\n\nComey, meanwhile, moved into Trump's crosshairs when he publicly confirmed the existence of the Russia investigation last March, shortly after Trump took office.\n\nRead more: Trump rips into Mueller and Russia probe as the special counsel reportedly prepares to drop more indictments\n\nJames Comey has long been Trump's bete noire.

When Comey refused, Trump fired him and later publicly stated he ousted the FBI director because of the Russia investigation.\n\nComey's firing now makes up the basis of a separate inquiry, overseen by the special counsel Robert Mueller, into whether Trump sought to obstruct justice in the Russia probe.\n\nWhen Comey began publicly criticizing Trump after his removal, the president called for prosecutors to investigate Comey for leaking classified information to The Times when he had his friend share a memo with the paper that documented some of what Comey believed were his most troubling interactions with the president. The memo did not contain any classified information.\n\nHe has also called for Comey and other current and former FBI and DOJ officials to be investigated over their handling of the Clinton email probe during the election."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb", "title": "Microsoft is about to roll out an amazing holiday discount to what's already the best deal in video games (MSFT)", "description": "Microsoft is offering a major holiday sale on the Xbox Game Pass, the Netflix-style subscription service that lets users play more than 100 games on Xbox One and PC.

What is this thing? How did it become?

I want you to know guys, they are going to do that and it doesn't matter to us. It's irrelevant.

Some have been complaining about inventory shortages and quality problems, as Business Insider's investigation revealed.\n\n\"I empathize 100% with your frustrations that you don't have the product to serve your customers,\" Stidham said. \"I don't have the product to serve you, and therefore I don't have the product to serve your customers. I understand that.\"\n\nLuLaRoe representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt one point during the call, Stidham offered an explanation for the company's loss of top sellers. About one-third of LuLaRoe's top sellers have exited the company since July, according to data reviewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Have you noticed that a whole bunch of top retailers have left lately? You want to know why? Because I refused to give them preferential treatment,\" he said. \"They came to us and said, 'We're your biggest sellers you need to give us first choice. You need to let us come into the warehouse and pick our own orders. You need to let us get the things we need so that we can continue to grow our business.' And I challenged them on that thinking.\"\n\nTowards the end of the call, Stidham said that he recently traveled to China to secure more sources for production.\n\n\"I had a vision that we would find these old Chinese guys smoking cigarettes in a backroom somewhere with a factory,\" he said. \"The people that we met are young entrepreneurs that are excited about the opportunity that is coming to them because of what you sell.\"\n\nShortly after that, he paused and it sounded like he had started to cry.\n\n\"We are making a difference in the world, don't lose sight of that,\" he said, his voice faltering. \"We have over two million garments coming in the next three weeks and the pipeline is filling and we will continue to have things coming.

They even reached New York City, according to an experimental NOAA forecasting tool called High Resolution Rapid Refresh.\n\nAn experimental NOAA forecast predicted California wildfire smoke particles would drift across the US on November 19, 2018. NOAA\n\nThe image above shows a 4 p.m. EST forecast for yesterday, right before the sun set in eastern New York.\n\nSpecifically, the forecast showed levels of \"vertically integrated smoke\": fine smoke particles dispersed throughout various layers of the atmosphere.\n\n\"Wow.

This may be because the smoke particles that wafted over the US \u2014 like other fine air pollutants\u2014 are as small as 2.5 microns, or about the size of a single microbe. Such particles can absorb bluer colors of sunlight and affect the look and color of sunrises and sunsets. They can also cool down air temperatures.\n\nThe animated map below shows the NOAA's 36-hour smoke forecast as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThis forecast shows a thinning trail of smoke drifting across the US through Wednesday. That diminishing trend should continue, since California's wildfires are increasingly being contained (and spouting less soot into the air).\n\nHowever, far-flung smoky sunsets caused by wildfires may become a \"new abnormal\" for the US as climate change exacerbates dry, fire-spreading conditions in California and other states."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "David Slotnick", "title": "27 Target Black Friday deals you can get without dealing with the crowds or the cold", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nOnce again, if you have any romaine lettuce in the fridge \u2014 be it pre-chopped, whole heads, or hearts \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says you should throw it out. Now.\n\n\"CDC is advising that U.S. consumers not eat any romaine lettuce, and retailers and restaurants not serve or sell any, until we learn more about the outbreak,\" the agency wrote on its website, just 48 hours out from the biggest nationwide feast of the year \u2014 Thanksgiving.\n\nThe CDC is investigating an E. coli outbreak that has so far sickened 32 people across 11 US states. Canada's health agency has also reported 18 E. coli cases in Ontario and Quebec. The CDC says the affected people all fell ill between October 8 and October 31, but the agency thinks it's possible that the bad lettuce could still be out there.\n\nSo far, no one has died in this outbreak. But the E. coli at play comes from the same family as the one that infected romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Arizona, growing region in the spring. That outbreak killed five people and sickened near 200 others. The fingerprint of this new E. coli, however, is closer to a strain that contaminated leafy greens in 2017; that outbreak killed one person and sickened 25 others in the US.\n\nThe O157:H7 strain of E. coli behind all three of these outbreaks can cause kidney failure in about 5% to 10% of cases (usually among people under the age of 5 and over 60, according to the Merck Manual). Less severe symptoms include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. So far, 13 people have gone to the hospital and one person developed kidney failure.\n\nThe CDC has not linked this outbreak to any region, retailer, or brand of greens, so it is warning anyone who bought romaine recently to get rid of it.\n\n\"This advice includes all types or uses of romaine lettuce, such as whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad,\" the agency said. \"Consumers who have any type of romaine lettuce in their home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick.\"\n\nTen illnesses have been reported in California, seven people got sick in Michigan, and other reported illnesses came from Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nHere's how an E. coli bug like this spreads and what can you do to reduce your risk of catching the potentially deadly bacteria.\n\nWhat is E. coli?\n\nE. coli is a rod-shaped type of bacteria that lives in our guts. But some dangerous strains can make you really sick. Flickr/NIAID\n\nE. coli gets a bad reputation as an illness-causing, bad-guy bacteria, but you probably have a bit of good E. coli inside your body right now.\n\nEscherichia coli is a broad term for a species of diverse bacteria. Certain strains of E. coli colonize our guts almost immediately after birth and stick to the mucus of our intestines, keeping our intestinal tract humming along smoothly.\n\nThe strain that has been linked to this outbreak, however, O157:H7, tends to be a naughty version of the bug.\n\nWhat makes the O157:H7 strain so dangerous for people is that it produces a nasty Shiga toxin, which can make us really sick. Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, as it's sometimes called, spreads to humans when little bits of feces get inside our mouths. That's why a bit of undercooked meat or raw milk can make you ill.\n\nO157:H7 usually originates in the guts of cattle, but it can also be found in goats, sheep, deer, and elk. It can travel from cattle farms to nearby fields where lettuce is grown and contaminate the greens in the soil. It can also get on lettuce when food-handlers don't wash their hands properly after coming into contact with E. coli-harboring feces.\n\nThe O157:H7 strain sickened 25 people who ate leafy greens including romaine lettuce in November and December, 2017. One Californian died. In May 2017, O157:H7 turned up in soy-nut butter. Thirty-two people got sick from that outbreak, and nine developed kidney failure. Then in the spring of 2018, 197 people across 35 US states got sick on romaine, and a handful of people died.\n\nBut contaminated food isn't the only source of potentially illness-inducing E. coli.\n\n\"People have gotten infected by swallowing lake water while swimming, touching the environment in petting zoos and other animal exhibits, and by eating food prepared by people who did not wash their hands well after using the toilet,\" according to the CDC.\n\nSome signs that you've got a Shiga toxin-producing strain of E. coli inside include:\n\nBloody diarrhea\n\nHarsh stomach cramps\n\nVomiting\n\nA mild fever\n\nWhat you can do to reduce your risk\n\nA chopped-salad recipe from the chef Jamie Oliver, a blend of fennel, romaine, endive, and smoked salmon. AP Photo/Matthew Mead\n\nThe number-one way to reduce your risk of an E. coli bug is something you've probably heard before: Wash your hands. And make sure people who prepare your food wash their hands, too.\n\nBecause E. coli contamination spreads from ingesting little bits of poop, any person or animal along the food chain from field to table can easily contaminate your produce or meat. So it's important to:\n\nCook meat properly\n\nKeep raw meat separate from other food, and sanitize cutting boards after cutting up raw meat\n\nEnjoy pasteurized dairy and juices, not raw milk\n\nWash produce before you eat it\n\nLeafy greens (like spinach and romaine) are especially prone to picking up bacteria from nearby cattle farms. Rinsing away extra dirt can help reduce your risk of illness, but if a bit of lettuce is contaminated with E. coli, washing it won't save you.\n\nPregnant women, young children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems need to be extra careful about steering clear of E. coli-contaminated food. But most of us can survive E. coli food poisoning \u2014 the miserable symptoms usually last five to seven days. There's not much you can do to treat the illness, and typically the best thing to do is try to stay hydrated until it's over.\n\nIt can be tough for public-health officials to track the source of an E. coli outbreak to one specific ingredient, but investigators tend to notice certain common foods when they interview sick people about what and where they ate."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Sophia Mitrokostas", "title": "11 ways you're wasting water that are costing you", "description": "There are small everyday things you're doing that are wasting water.

Her remit as COO includes overseeing communications and policy \u2014 two areas that have placed her at the center of the most recent scandal.\n\nLast week, The New York Times published an investigation into how Facebook has handled its successive crises, from the spread of Russian misinformation to Cambridge Analytica. It found executives attempted to deflect criticism, downplay some public disclosures, and smear critics with links to liberal billionaire George Soros\u2014 a line of attack some have said plays into anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nThe report described Sandberg as integral to many of the decisions made, and while she has publicly denied knowledge that Facebook hired Definers, the opposition research firm behind the George Soros attacks, she has accepted responsibility for it. And according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg blamed her for the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, making her wonder whether she should fear for her job.\n\nPublicly, Zuckerberg has defended her role, telling reporters: \"Sheryl is doing great work for the company. She's been a very important partner to me and continues to be, and will continue to be.\" Another executive has said Sandberg has seen a groundswell of support from Facebook employees amid the turmoil.\n\nBut this clearly isn't enough to completely assuage Wall Street investors' concerns she might be on her way out.\n\nEven if Sandberg doesn't leave, other employees might\n\nEvercore is lowering its price target for Facebook's stock in response to investor fears, from $180 to $175.

Waymo's will debut in Phoenix in December, while Cruise has said its service will arrive at some point in 2019.\n\nBoth services will likely be limited to relatively small areas that have been subject to intensive mapping and testing, but media reports have described self-driving vehicles operated by each company that struggle with basic functions, casting doubt over how ready each company's autonomous-driving technology is for even limited commercial use. An August report from The Information said Waymo vehicles had difficulty making unprotected left turns, distinguishing between individuals in a large group, and merging into turn lanes and highway traffic, among other trouble areas, and an October report from Reuters said Cruise vehicles had trouble determining if objects on the road were moving or stationary.\n\nWaymo told The Information it had implemented feedback it had received regarding its test vehicles and said safety is the company's highest priority. Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt told Reuters the company prioritizes safety and would fix early development issues before launching an autonomous ride-hailing service.\n\n\"Waymo was founded on a mission to make our roads safer, and that's why we built a cautious and defensive driver,\" a Waymo representative told Business Insider. \"As the only company with a fleet of fully self-driving cars on public roads, our vehicles are continually learning, so we can safely expand our capabilities over time.\"\n\nCruise did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nRead more: Tesla just had the worst year in its history, but now it's starting to look like the best tech company in the world\n\nTesla and Uber have faced more visible setbacks. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the automaker would likely be able to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service by the end of 2019, pending regulatory approval, he also said in 2015 that Tesla would have fully-autonomous-vehicle technology ready in about two years. The automaker has not yet said that its vehicles are capable of full autonomy. Tesla has also missed multiple deadlines set by Musk to send a self-driving vehicle across the US.\n\nTesla declined a request for comment.\n\nUber's autonomous-driving program has had the most tumultuous year of the four. In March, a self-driving Uber hit and killed a pedestrian, leading the company to suspend testing of its autonomous-driving software. Uber once intended to include self-driving vehicles in its ride-hailing service in 2019, but backed off that goal after the accident. It has just recently asked for permission to resume testing vehicles with their autonomous software in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Right now the entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in self-driving mode,\" an Uber representative said. \"Our team remains committed to implementing key safety improvements, and we intend to resume on-the-road self-driving testing only when these improvements have been implemented and we have received authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\"\n\nAutonomous-driving companies haven't set realistic expectations\n\nSam Abuelsamid, a senior research analyst for Navigant, and Pete Kelly, a managing director at LMC Automotive, told Business Insider they have not been surprised by the autonomous-driving industry's setbacks.\n\n\"None of these vehicles are close to being ready for full deployment anywhere,\" Abuelsamid said. \"They all still have significant limitations on what they're capable of doing.\"\n\nAbuelsamid and Kelly said the autonomous-driving industry has done a poor job of communicating the progress of its technology in a realistic manner. Abuelsamid highlighted Tesla as the worst offender.\n\n\"I would put Tesla at the worst end of the scale in terms of managing expectations,\" he said.\n\nMusk has developed a reputation for setting aggressive goals and making bold proclamations about Tesla's products. He told Recode in early November that Tesla was far ahead of its competitors in developing autonomous-driving technology that can be used in all circumstances, and Tesla has since 2016 sold a hardware upgrade it says will give vehicles full self-driving capabilities when the necessary software is ready. The upgrade was removed from the automaker's website in October, but Musk has said it would remain available to those who ask for it.\n\nAbuelsamid said Tesla's autonomous-driving technology lags behind its competitors'.\n\n\"They have the least capable technology of any company,\" he said.\n\nUnlike many of its competitors, Tesla's autonomous-driving hardware includes only cameras and radar, forgoing the lidar sensors (which emit pulses of light that bounce off objects to determine where they're located) that some companies and experts say are necessary for vehicles to drive without human assistance. A self-driving Tesla vehicle would be vulnerable to weather or road conditions that could cover its cameras or radar and render them ineffective, Abuelsamid said.\n\n\"The hardware that they have on the vehicles today will never, ever be Level-5 capable,\" he said, referring to the designation for vehicles that can drive without human assistance under any conditions.\n\nAbuelsamid also highlighted Uber for being too aggressive in promoting its self-driving technology. In 2016, the company offered rides in self-driving vehicles to some customers and members of the press.\n\n\"They gave the impression that they were a lot farther along than they really were,\" Abuelsamid said.\n\nCruise has created questions around how it will deploy self-driving vehicles, Kelly said. GM president Dan Ammann said in November 2017 that self-driving Cruise vehicles would be introduced \"in large scale, in the most complex environments\" in 2019 if the development of company's autonomous-driving technology continued at its then current pace. But neither GM nor Cruise has specified exactly what \"in large scale\" means, Kelly said.\n\nWaymo has been more cautious than its rivals\n\nBoth Abuelsamid and Kelly said Waymo has been better than its rivals at managing expectations. While the company is ahead of its competition and has the right to boast, it has declined to do so, Kelly said.\n\n\"I get a sense that they've been far more sensible with their pronouncements, even at the same time as clearly being miles ahead of anybody else in terms of the amount of real-world and simulated testing that's taking place.\"\n\nWaymo CEO John Krafcik said at the National Governors Association conference in July that the rollout of autonomous-driving technology made by Waymo and its competitors would face obstacles and that fully autonomous vehicles were far from mass adoption.\n\n\"It's not going to be an easy rollout,\" he said. \"There are going to be incidents in a Waymo service and other services from other players.\"\n\nThe media has also set unrealistic expectations about autonomous-driving technology, Kelly said, as some outlets have published bold claims made by some in the industry without challenging the basis for those claims.\n\nBut while they have made missteps, both the media and the autonomous-driving industry have improved their messaging in the past year, Kelly and Abuelsamid said, though there's still work to be done.\n\n\"I think the reality check is just starting,\" Kelly said.\n\nRead more about automotive technology:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Joe Perticone", "title": "Who is Marcia Fudge?

Prior to that, she was the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.\n\nRegarding Pelosi, Fudge has often been critical, most recently calling her \"elitist\" in an interview with HuffPost.\n\nShe also railed against Pelosi for taking too much credit for Democrats retaking the House majority, which they had failed to capture for the last eight years.\n\n\"Everybody wants to give her such big credit for winning back the House, and she should be here because she won,\" Fudge said. \"She didn't win it by herself.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for minority leader shortly after the 2016 elections, Fudge nominated him on the House floor.\n\nAfter Pelosi defeated Ryan, Fudge said, \"We didn't lose today.\"\n\n\"We now have a leadership team that listens to us,\" she added. \"Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.\"\n\nPotential challenge to Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House\n\nA Fudge challenge to Pelosi would satisfy a lot of Democrats looking for an alternative.\n\nMany of the Midwestern Democrats in Congress have lamented their lack of representation at all levels of the House leadership, and Fudge's Ohio roots would certainly fill that void.\n\n\"I think the leadership team matters,\" Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos told INSIDER. \"I know the focus is everybody gets asked about the speaker's race, but the leadership team matters in all sorts of ways. And one of those is geographic diversity.\"\n\nBustos, who is a Pelosi backer and candidate to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is one of just two Midwesterners running for a spot on the leadership team.\n\nAnother Midwesterner, Rep. Tim Ryan, is one of the Democrats leading the charge to oust Pelosi. Ryan signed the letter released by a working group of 16 congresspeople and incoming freshmen opposed to Pelosi.\n\nFudge was previously a signatory on the letter, but did not appear when it became public on Monday. However, the removal of Fudge's name does not necessarily mean she is ruling out the challenge to Pelosi.\n\nPelosi welcomed any challengers during a Thursday press conference, noting that while she believes many Democrats have the chops to serve as speaker, she believes she is the best choice for the moment.\n\n\"I have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House,\" Pelosi said. \"And, certainly, we have many, many people in our caucus who could serve in this capacity. I happen to think at this point, I am the best person for that.\"\n\nBut while there is a sizable amount of ground to be gained for insurgents in the Democratic caucus, Pelosi also has to court more members if she wants to be able to secure the necessary 218 votes on the House floor to become speaker."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Becky Peterson", "title": "Wall Street thinks these 5 public software companies could get acquired in mega-deals amid the market downturn (COUP, EVBG, SPSC, MDSO, TYL)", "description": "Big tech acquirers are more willing than ever to spend big on the best companies on the market, according to a note published by the investment firm Needham.

Kirsten Gillibrand also released a statement echoing Ocasio-Cortez's sentiments.\n\n\"While I'm glad that Amazon recognizes that Queens is a great place to do business, I'm concerned about the the lack of community input and the incentivizes that Amazon received in order to convince them to bring these jobs to New York,\" Gillibrand said in a statement on Twitter. \"One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from the taxpayers while too many New York families struggle to make ends meet.\"\n\nOther voices, like editorials in the nation's largest newspapers, have also made their concerns known.\n\n\"We rarely agree with socialist Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but she's right to call billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies for Amazon 'extremely concerning,'\" wrote the Wall Street Journal's editorial board.\"These handouts to one of the richest companies in the history of the world, with an essentially zero cost of capital, is crony capitalism at its worst.\"\n\nNational Landing, where Amazon will develop the other part of its HQ2. Google Maps\n\nThe New York Times' board wrote its own editorial calling the HQ2 deal \"a bad bargain.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bezos has owned a home here for years,\" the board wrote. \"He knows what our city has to offer; and as the web's biggest retailer, he knows what he's getting in setting up shop in Long Island City: a discount.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has defended his decision to lure Amazon to New York. In an op-ed that he self-published on Monday, he called the HQ2 deal a \"historic transformative moment for the entire New York City region.\"\n\nHe also slammed his critics, including the Times.\n\n\"The New York Times also argues that New York was wrong. The New York Times is also being totally hypocritical,\" Cuomo argued. \"The New York Times itself makes the same economic decisions and has also received significant tax benefits from New York State and New York City in making decisions on their locations.\"\n\nThe Times did include a disclaimer in its editorial that it drew benefit from New York's tax incentive programs.\n\nThe criticism over its HQ2 decision comes at a perilous time for Amazon, which has seen its reputation take numerous hits over the past several months.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders frequently made an example of Amazon, pointing to high-profile news stories describing strenuous working conditions and low pay. Amazon fought back against this characterization before eventually raising its starting wage to $15.\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Stephanie Pandolph", "title": "THE SOCIAL COMMERCE REPORT: How Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, and other popular apps are upending the e-commerce space (FB, GOOG, GOOGL)", "description": "This is a preview of a research report from BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service.

And with more and more retailers offering quick access to their sites via social media pages, and shoppable content becoming more popular, it's likely that social media will play an even larger role in e-commerce.\n\nIn this report, BI Intelligence examines the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, and reviews case studies of successful campaigns that helped boost conversion and increase brand awareness. Additionally, we explore how retailers can bring social aspects into their own sites and apps to capitalize on consumers' desire for social shopping experiences.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nSocial media is becoming more influential in all aspects of the purchasing journey.\n\nFacebook is the clear winner in social commerce, with its huge user base and wide-ranging demographics.\n\nHowever, retailers should have a presence on every platform their target market is on. Each platform will require a different strategy for retailers to resonate with its users.\n\nRetailers can also benefit from bringing social aspects in-house.

Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat currently mulling a challenge to Nancy Pelosi for the speaker's gavel when the new Congress forms in January, has long been a thorn in the side of the Democratic leadership.\n\nWhile Fudge is waiting until after the Thanksgiving break to decide whether or not she will mount a bid against Pelosi, who has been Democratic leader for the better part of the past two decades, many of her colleagues wait anxiously as they split into factions of those who ardently back Pelosi, those who want to oust her in favor of new blood, and the small group of still-undecided members and incoming freshmen.\n\nFudge, 66, has represented Ohio's 11th congressional district since 2008. Prior to that, she was the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.\n\nRegarding Pelosi, Fudge has often been critical, most recently calling her \"elitist\" in an interview with HuffPost.\n\nShe also railed against Pelosi for taking too much credit for Democrats retaking the House majority, which they had failed to capture for the last eight years.\n\n\"Everybody wants to give her such big credit for winning back the House, and she should be here because she won,\" Fudge said. \"She didn't win it by herself.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for minority leader shortly after the 2016 elections, Fudge nominated him on the House floor.\n\nAfter Pelosi defeated Ryan, Fudge said, \"We didn't lose today.\"\n\n\"We now have a leadership team that listens to us,\" she added. \"Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.\"\n\nPotential challenge to Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House\n\nA Fudge challenge to Pelosi would satisfy a lot of Democrats looking for an alternative.\n\nMany of the Midwestern Democrats in Congress have lamented their lack of representation at all levels of the House leadership, and Fudge's Ohio roots would certainly fill that void.\n\n\"I think the leadership team matters,\" Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos told INSIDER. \"I know the focus is everybody gets asked about the speaker's race, but the leadership team matters in all sorts of ways. And one of those is geographic diversity.\"\n\nBustos, who is a Pelosi backer and candidate to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is one of just two Midwesterners running for a spot on the leadership team.\n\nAnother Midwesterner, Rep. Tim Ryan, is one of the Democrats leading the charge to oust Pelosi. Ryan signed the letter released by a working group of 16 congresspeople and incoming freshmen opposed to Pelosi.\n\nFudge was previously a signatory on the letter, but did not appear when it became public on Monday. However, the removal of Fudge's name does not necessarily mean she is ruling out the challenge to Pelosi.\n\nPelosi welcomed any challengers during a Thursday press conference, noting that while she believes many Democrats have the chops to serve as speaker, she believes she is the best choice for the moment.\n\n\"I have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House,\" Pelosi said. \"And, certainly, we have many, many people in our caucus who could serve in this capacity. I happen to think at this point, I am the best person for that.\"\n\nBut while there is a sizable amount of ground to be gained for insurgents in the Democratic caucus, Pelosi also has to court more members if she wants to be able to secure the necessary 218 votes on the House floor to become speaker."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christian Nguyen", "title": "This spray paint lights up at the flip of a switch, but it's not glow-in-the-dark", "description": "LumiLor is a spray on paint that illuminates in the dark.

Reproductive rights advocates argue the legislation would criminalize abortion before many women even know they're pregnant.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project called the bill \u2014 and others like it \u2014 \"blatantly unconstitutional\" in a phone interview with INSIDER.\n\n\"A state can't ban abortion, which is what this has effectively done, and it would be struck down by the courts, certainly in the lower courts,\" Amiri said. \"This is a direct attack on Roe v. Wade, this is an attempt by the other side to overrule the constitutional right to abortion.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Ohio House's health committee is considering an even more severe abortion bill, HB 565, which would go a step further to designate fetuses as \"unborn humans\" statewide, allowing for women and doctors who receive and provide abortions to be punished with life in prison, and even the death penalty.\n\nThat bill, however, has not gained much traction since lawmakers introduced it in March, and is unlikely to be voted on this year.\n\nAmiri explained the six-week ban is unlikely to hold up legally, since Roe v. Wade protects abortion to the point of viability, around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Similar six-week bans in North Dakota and Iowa were either struck down by federal courts or blocked by state courts for violating either Roe, or state-level abortion protections.\n\nAfter Justice Brett Kavanaugh was nominated in July, legal experts told INSIDER that while it's unlikely for a Supreme Court even with a 5-4 conservative majority to fully overturn Roe v. Wade, the Court could uphold less extreme restrictions on the procedure.\n\nRead more:23 creative ways states are keeping women from getting abortions in the US \u2014 that could erode Roe v. Wade without repealing it\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen until the Supreme Court takes one of these cases. There are 13 cases in the pipeline right now. Whether the Supreme Court is going to take up one of those cases and what they're going to say is unknown, but we're deeply concerned.\"\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Amiri warned that the Ohio legislature's recent actions are a \"harbinger of things to come\" when it comes to states restricting abortion access.\n\n\"We're concerned this is the first of several states that will try to ban abortion, which is why people need to stay vigilant,\" Amiri added. \"I was a little surprised that Ohio was so quick to do so, and it makes me deeply concerned that other states will be acting quickly when the legislatures come back in session in 2019 in other states.\"\n\nAmiri said she has just one message for the Ohio state government if they pass the six-week ban: \"we'll see you in court.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jessica Tyler", "title": "The most iconic toy store in the world just reopened after suddenly shutting down 3 years ago \u2014 take a look inside", "description": "FAO Schwarz, the iconic toy retailer that closed its Fifth Avenue flagship store in 2015, reopened its doors at 30 Rockefeller Plaza last week.

According to ESPN Stats & Information, the total (63.5) was the highest set since at least 1986, as far as their records date back.\n\nBut despite the huge number posted by sportsbooks, the Rams and Chiefs blew past the total with ease, surpassing 63.5 points before the end of the third quarter.\n\nMichael Grodsky, a spokesperson for William Hill sportsbooks, told ESPN that the game wound up being a \"healthy seven-figure loss\" for their books, as almost 70% of bettors were backing the over.\n\nBut it wasn't just the pre-game betting that cost the books money.\n\nJay Kornegay, VP of Race and Sports Operations at the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, told Business Insider that it was in-game betting that did the most damage.\n\n\"Pre-game wagering was fairly balanced and didn't hurt us,\" Kornegay told Business Insider when asked about how the total had been bet. \"In-progress wagering was tough on us as the betting public couldn't get enough of the 'over.'\"\n\nIn-game wagering is a huge growth opportunity for sportsbooks, as it allows for bettors to continue placing bets throughout the game beyond the usual pre-game and halftime lines.\n\nBut as Monday night showed, there's also a risk in offering bettors to keep their bets coming during the game. While books can mitigate their losses on pre-game wagers by adjusting the line to attract action on both sides of a bet, in-game wagering could prove more difficult to keep balanced.\n\nTake last night for example \u2014 it's hard to imagine a casual bettor watching that game at a sportsbook would start putting money on the \"under\" side of the live total after the teams put up 46 points in the first half alone.\n\nNo matter how high bookmakers decided to set the live total, it probably wasn't enough as you can't assume a game is going to be the third-highest scoring affair in the history of the league.\n\nThe result was a massive payday for the gambling public, who recognized both before and during the game that these teams were going to start scoring and never stop.\n\nIt meant a hard day for the sportsbooks, but I wouldn't worry too much about them \u2014 they always seem to bounce back from a tough week."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Avery Hartmans", "title": "The Apple Watch is on sale for as much as $80 off for Black Friday \u2014 here are all the deals worth your time - Business Insider UK", "description": "Business Insider UK The Apple Watch is on sale for as much as $80 off for Black Friday \u2014 here are all the deals worth your time Business Insider UK Many major retailers are offering deals on the Apple Watch for Black Friday.

The chip giant also reported brutal third-quarter earnings earlier this month, sending shares down nearly 50% from its all-time high of $292.75, reached on Oct. 1.\n\nThe weaker-than-expected financial results were largely due to an excess of mining GPUs for cryptocurrency, the largest of which, bitcoin, on Tuesday sunk to its lowest level in more than a year.\n\n\"Our near-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the crypto-currency boom, which will be corrected,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in release following the report. Management in August warned that it's expecting \"essentially no cryptocurrency\" business moving forward.\n\nAlso at stake is a product transition which will unlikely ramp until next year.\n\nIn August, Nvidia unveiled its new graphics cards, which are designed to improve the gaming experience through features like real-time ray tracing. But those new features aren't yet available because games supporting the high-end graphics cards won't be released until 2019.\n\nBut nearly every Wall Street analyst has still been bullish about the chip giant, saying it's time to buy the dip as the company has good fundamentals.\n\n\"Near-term softness on excess channel inventory, but secular growth in datacenter and gaming still intact,\" said JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.\n\nWilliam Stein, an analyst at Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, recently made similar comments.\n\n\"Long-term thesis seems intact; Buy the dip,\" he said. \"Datacenter, Pro-Viz, and Automotive results support our structural growth view.\"\n\nNvidia is now down 25% this year.\n\nNow read:\n\nMI"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Laura McCamy", "title": "I'm convinced power napping is the key to my productivity \u2014 and there's research to back me up", "description": "When my eyes start to cross, and I can\u2019t think straight at work, I take a power nap of about 15 minutes.

But studies have shown there's something even more effective for memory and motor function: taking a nap.\n\nI don't like caffeinated drinks, so if I start to fade after lunch, the one thing I do to counteract the fatigue is take a 15-minute power nap. When I get up, my brain is fresh and ready to spring into action.\n\nThe power of sleep\n\nScientists don't know why humans need to sleep, but there are several theories. The plasticity of the brain (which allows you to learn) seems to improve during sleep. Losing sleep certainly can limit your brain functioning, according to Time.\n\nYour body also apparently repairs itself during sleep. Studies show that the immune system replenishes T cells during sleep, which might explain why lack of sleep can make you sick.\n\nWhat researchers do know is that Americans don't sleep enough. The Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep for adults. Gallup found that, in 2013 (the last year it measured), Americans slept an average of only 6.8 hours a night, down from 7.9 hours in 1942. So, it's no wonder we hit bottom by mid-afternoon \u2014 a sensation which a power nap can counteract.\n\nHow to nap\n\nAs Daniel Pink explains in his book, \"When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing,\" a short nap acts like a Zamboni on your brain. As the day goes on, your brain glitches up. A short nap smooths the glitches, so you can function for the rest of the day.\n\nI like to nap for 10 to 15 minutes at work (as I work from home). Any longer, and I feel sluggish and have a hard time getting up. I put in headphones and listen to a mellow podcast, to keep my mind from spinning on my next task. I set a timer and put on an eye mask.\n\nWhen my time is up, I find I can get right back to work with renewed focus. One power nap is usually enough to get me through the rest of the afternoon. If I'm tired enough that I need two naps, I'm probably getting sick and shouldn't be working.\n\nThe best way to take a power nap is subjective. The Mayo Clinic recommends anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Author Daniel Pink has a power nap hack: drink a cup of coffee, nap for 25 minutes (the amount of time it takes for the caffeine to hit), then get up doubly refreshed.\n\nWhere to nap\n\nThe more difficult issue for most people is where to nap at work. If you work from home or your own office, like I do, it's pretty easy.\n\nIf you work in a more open space that you share with coworkers, finding a place to nap can be much harder. You run the risk that, if your boss finds you curled up under your desk or snoozing in your car, she'll think you're slacking.\n\nThe good news is that employers have begun to recognize the restorative potential of the power nap. Some even have nap rooms for their employees. And you now have multiple choices of odd little tents to deploy at work \u2014 if you can sleep through your coworker's laughter."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Hilary Brueck", "title": "How to have a carb-free keto Thanksgiving, according to science", "description": "Thanksgiving dinner is traditionally a high-carb affair.

The approach is backed by some evidence that suggests limiting carbs could boost your health.

You might even want to share those photos with friends and family.\n\nLots of people go to Facebook or Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, to share their photos. But after the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year, the hack in October that affected 30 million users, and the recent reports of turmoil within the company, I personally feel less comfortable sharing my photos, which I consider very personal data, to those sites.\n\nInstead of Facebook or Instagram, I've been increasingly sharing my photos with friends and family through iCloud, Apple's built-in cloud service that works across Apple devices, but also the web (in case you don't own an Apple device).\n\nThe case for iCloud\n\nSharing photo albums through iCloud is easy.\n\nTake any Apple device you have that's connected to iCloud and your Apple ID, open your Photos app, select a handful of photos, and press the share button in the bottom-right corner \u2014 the little box with an arrow sticking out the top of it.\n\nOne of the first options you should see has an icon of Apple's Photos app, but it's called \"Shared Albums.\" Click that to share those photos you selected.\n\nAt this point, you can make a new album for your photos, or select a previous album you already made. You can add comments at this point, or just click \"Post.\" That's it! You made a shared photo album on iCloud.\n\nRead more: We compared Google Drive with Apple's iCloud and Dropbox to find the best cloud storage solution \u2014 and the winner is clear\n\nTo let others see your photos or add their own, visit your Shared Album and you should see a toggle at the bottom with two options: \"People\" and \"Photos.\"\n\nClick the \"People\" toggle, and you should now see a slew of new options: You can invite people to the album (all you need is their email address or phone number) and choose a handful of other settings, like letting subscribers post their own photos and videos to your album (or not), or letting your album exist on a public website on iCloud.com.\n\nThat's all there is to it. All of these processes happen within your Photos app, which makes it hard to mess up.\n\nPrivate and secure\n\nOne of the other reasons I prefer iCloud is because it's private and secure \u2014 I get to choose everyone who sees the photos, and I know Apple isn't using my photos in other ways, like scanning them for additional descriptive data to better target advertisements.\n\nApple clearly cares about user privacy and security: It has an entire webpage dedicated to both of those things, just so customers can understand what Apple is (and isn't) doing with their data. Apple makes it clear that it doesn't sell your photos or personal data to third-parties, and that all personal data, including login and transaction data, is fully encrypted.\n\nSo for convenience and security reasons, I prefer iCloud. But I also like it because, unlike Facebook, I don't feel like I'm vying for the Likes and attention of friends and family that may not necessarily care about seeing my pictures. With iCloud, I'm sharing photos with specific people because I know they'll enjoy my photos.\n\nAnd iCloud is surprisingly robust, too. Even if your potential recipients don't have Apple devices, you can still see a shared photo album you're invited to access through iCloud.com. And all photos, as well as the albums themselves, can be commented on as well. It's very similar to Facebook overall, just without the massive built-in network.\n\nIf you're feeling leery about Facebook, I highly recommend giving iCloud Photo Sharing a try. It's simple, secure, and gives you more control over who can see your photos. It also comes down to trust, and Facebook has suffered one too many dings this year to make me feel totally comfortable posting there."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Aria Bendix", "title": "San Francisco's homelessness crisis is so bad, people appear to be using poop to graffiti the sidewalks", "description": "An NBC Bay Area investigation found graffiti presumably written in feces in downtown San Francisco.

Also known as the VIX, it tends to move in the opposite direction as the S&P 500 and is an indicator of future price fluctuations expected by traders.\n\nIts relationship with Treasury yields is one that BAML has tracked since the mid-2000s, and one that has served as a tool to forecast volatility.\n\nSpecifically, BAML examined the VIX and the yield curve, which displays the gap between shorter-term, 2-year Treasury yields and longer-term, 10-year yields. Earlier this year, the spread narrowed to almost zero (as the yield curve flattened), meaning that traders were demanding a higher premium for buying short-term bonds instead of their long-dated counterparts. The reverse is normally the case.\n\n\"A flattening yield curve signaled a withdrawal of liquidity and over the last three cycles has preceded rising volatility by a few years,\" Savita Subramanian, BAML's head of US equity and quant strategy, said in a note.\n\nThe signal now suggests that the VIX should double through 2021, she added.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nA rising VIX does not necessarily spell doom for stocks, since the S&P 500 delivered annual returns of 21.6% between 1993 and 1998 even as the VIX was rising, Subramanian noted.

But this move would signify that Amazon is getting into regional sports for the first time.\n\n\"When Amazon made the move to streaming NFL, it was a signal that they were going to become a much more viable bidder in sports land,\" Amobi said. \"Amazon looks at the RSNs as a unique opportunity to significantly bolster their sports offerings and use it as another catalyst for Prime sub growth.\"\n\nFor many people, regional sports are the last thing tethering them to their linear-TV cords. If Amazon offers another way to view the full suite of sports programming offered in a region, it may encourage consumers to cut the cord and sign up for Amazon Prime.\n\nIn addition to Amazon, Apollo Global Management, KKR, Blackstone, Sinclair Broadcast Group, and Tegna also bid in the first round, CNBC reported.\n\nAmid the bidding from private-equity shops and broadcast companies who already own sports networks, Amazon seems an unlikely player in the regional-media-buyer space.\n\nWhy would Amazon want these assets?\n\nAmazon has a platform with a national distribution strategy, so buying these RSNs would signal a change in business strategy and a move into regional sports rights on a large scale, according to sports-media analysts who spoke with Business Insider.\n\nSo why would tech companies want these assets?\n\nThe answer, in part, may lie in the sheer size of the assets coming to market. These 22 networks have the broadcasting rights for 44 professional sports teams in the NBA, the NHL, and MLB. They offer local sports broadcasting for teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Yankees.\n\nFox owns over 50% of the market. The next biggest owner of RSNs is Comcast, which has seven representing 16 teams, followed by AT&T with four representing eight teams.\n\nEven though these assets broadcast regional programming, owning the entire block is akin to having a national presence in regional sports.\n\nThe volume of games played in these leagues also makes the regional networks attractive. MLB teams, for example, play 162 games in a season, meaning they're almost daily.\n\nLinear broadcasting wouldn't change much\n\nAmazon's buying these assets wouldn't change much from a viewing perspective \u2014 at least to start.\n\nThe RSNs are self-sustaining businesses and could effectively run on their own, and they already have contract rights in place for both linear and digital distribution of their programming.\n\nFor example, the Yes Network \u2014 home to coverage of the Yankees and the NBA's Brooklyn Nets \u2014 has contracts in place to stream on platforms like Hulu, Sling TV, and DirecTV.\n\nEach RSN has its own set of distribution deals, and distribution contracts typically span three to five years, according to Lee Berke, the CEO of LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media.\n\nIf Amazon acquired the RSNs tomorrow, it could offer Prime subscribers streaming access to regional sports content immediately. But it wouldn't have exclusive rights to air the programming until contracts expired.\n\nOnce the contracts end, Amazon could choose not to renew them and air content exclusively on Prime. But that's highly unlikely, according to industry experts, as the distribution deals and contracts generate consistent cash flow that Amazon would want to continue.\n\nAnd there's an OTT opportunity in the future\n\nWhile going regional would be a shift in strategy for Amazon, it already has the technology to regionalize digital streaming content, or \"over the top\" viewing.\n\nBerke told Business Insider he'd been in negotiations with various virtual multichannel video programming distributors, known as vMVPDs, and \"they can geofence content on a ZIP-code-to-ZIP-code basis.\"\n\n\"In certain respects, that is more fine-tuned than with pay television,\" he said.\n\nWhile Amazon has not offered regional content within the US, it regionalizes on a continental basis. Amazon has exclusive rights to air US Open tennis and some Premier League soccer games in the UK.\n\nIf Amazon acquired an RSN, it would be \"extremely feasible\" for the company to regionalize content in the US, according to Berke.\n\nAnd owning sports rights could help with the problem that one in five Amazon subscribers doesn't know they have access to streaming videos through Prime Video.\n\nNo matter the rationale for buying the RSNs, analysts expect a bidding war for these assets.\n\n\"It could top $25 billion the way bidding is evolving,\" Amobi said. \"We will see a frenzy of bidding.

Dementia is an umbrella term given to the symptoms caused by various diseases \u2014 most commonly Alzheimer's \u2014 and 152 million people are expected to suffer with it by 2050, according to the charity Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nDiane Darby Beach, a doctor with Right at Home's Cognitive Support Program, told Business Insider most people with dementia are taken care of for the entirety of their disease at home with their family or friends.\n\n\"The burden of the care falls to these, what we call, informal caregivers,\" she said. \"Family and friends who don't necessarily have any training in it, and are just kind of thrown into this situation. And for some, it's almost unmanageable \u2014 it's very, very difficult.\"\n\nSymptoms get worse over time\n\nSomeone with dementia needs help with everyday tasks. In the early stages of dementia, most people are able to enjoy their life as they did before their diagnosis. But over time, symptoms get worse, and they tend to get more forgetful, distressed, and confused, meaning they require more care.\n\nAccording to the National Health Service website, some of the tasks someone recently diagnosed with dementia might be grateful for are shopping, laying the table, gardening, and taking the dog for a walk.\n\nMemory aids, such as signs of cupboards and doors, can help the person remember where certain rooms are, or where to look for bowls and cups.\n\nBut as time goes by, dementia can affect the person's personality, ability to do anything themselves, and how they communicate. This means carers have to adjust how they talk to the person they look after.\n\nThe best way of not causing further distress to the person with dementia is to adjust to their reality, Darby Beach said. For instance, if someone is trying to pack their things to go to work or school, you shouldn't focus too much on trying to tell them they retired over a decade ago.\n\n\"We're not going to talk them out of their reality because that's only going to cause them frustration, so we meet them where they are,\" she said. \"If Sally is a school teacher in this moment, then she's a school teacher. We never ever argue or try to reason with the person with dementia because the brain's reasoning centers, the abstract thinking, has been thrown.\"\n\nPeople with dementia require constant care. Issei Kato/Reuters\n\nRather than trying to convince Sally she is in an assisted living community, which may confuse and alarm her, her carer can tell her it's a Saturday, and there's no school today.\n\n\"That's what's hardest for families, because if you take an adult child with their parent, they've always reasoned with them... but it doesn't work anymore,\" said Darby Beach. \"Don't expect them to be who they were, but find out where they are and what they can still do and organise activities and conversations around that.\"\n\nCarers have to reframe and simplify the world for the person they're caring for into an environment they can handle.\n\n\"I'm talking one of the two steps at a time,\" said Darby Beach. \"It's being in the moment with that person, and not trying to think too far in the future.\"\n\nA surprise for caregivers is that it's a 24/7 job, and every day is different, Darby Beach said. They need to be really flexible and patient because something that worked today may not work tomorrow.\n\n\"The disease is so all over the place,\" she said. \"One day a person with the disease can have a very good day where they're able to manage, and the next day they're not.\"\n\nSmall changes can make a big difference\n\nSometimes dementia doesn't impair someone's memory and functions until it's very advanced \u2014 but it does affect vision. Laura Phipps, the head of communications and engagement at Alzheimer's Research UK told Business Insider that some types of dementia only affect sight and perception, which is the type English author Terry Pratchett had.\n\n\"One thing people often tell us about is that puddles on the ground can look like holes because there are issues with... depth perception and colour perception,\" said Phipps. \"You know when you go into a shop and they... have those big black mats in front of the door... for some people with dementia that looks like a massive abyss.\"\n\nIn this situation, reframing their environment may be as simple as going to a store that doesn't have those kind of mats. Phipps said a lot of the time, people with dementia can't make the judgement because their brain isn't working at 100%.\n\n\"There are big impacts on how people can live but people don't realise them,\" she said. \"It may just be a really small thing that causes someone to be anxious, but if they can't articulate that you can't change it.\"\n\nThat's why there's a big movement for understanding why people with dementia are acting aggressive or agitated. There's a good chance it's something to do with their environment \u2014 the lighting, the way shadows are cast, or the floor \u2014 that could be causing their anxiety.\n\nCarers need to look after themselves, too\n\nThere are good moments too. Ocskay Mark / Shutterstock\n\nCaring for someone with dementia is tough. If the carer is someone close, they may feel like the person they loved is being washed away and replaced by someone they don't recognise. Their world also gets smaller and smaller as they realise they don't have time for everything they used to before becoming a carer.\n\nIt's also like going through grief, as the person they care for slips away. As their loved one deteriorates and they start to lose their abilities, the caregiver is simultaneously caring for them and battling their own sadness that they aren't fully there anymore.\n\n\"The person eventually becomes a shell of who they were,\" said Darby Beach. \"They are there in body, but the relationship is gone, the memories are gone, and that's hard on caregivers.\"\n\nShe said it's really important for carers to take care of themselves first. In her work, and from personal experience, she knows how draining it can be to care for someone else full time. And there's no way you can do that properly if you're completely burnt out.\n\nShe said it's like when flight attendants are reading out the safety instructions on a plane, and they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping anyone else. Carers are likely to feel guilty if they make time for themselves and leave their loved one with someone else for a few hours. But ultimately it's just one of the rollercoaster of emotions they'll feel, and it's better to minimise them wherever they can.\n\n\"It's okay be angry, it's okay to be frustrated, it's okay to not handle a particular situation exactly the right way,\" she said. \"They need to forgive themselves and not be so hard on themselves, because the family caregivers are really tough on themselves.\"\n\nFor all the stress, there are good moments too\n\nDarby Beach said there are also a lot of good things that come out of being a carer. There is a great deal of stress that comes with the territory, but there will be moments where they're thankful they're around.\n\nFor example, carers can also stimulate old memories and conversations with their loved one by bringing props that remind the person with dementia of their past. Someone who used to love cooking might not be able to eat solid food anymore, but they still have a sense of smell, so you could bake some bread. Or someone who used to love riding horses might like to see a saddle and talk about what it was like.\n\n\"Something like that can remind them of that interest ... and spur those memories and that connection,\" said Darby Beach.\n\n\"It's what's called person-centered care, and that really means knowing that person. The more that we know about somebody, the more information we have to be able to validate that person's [feelings and memories] and redirect them... So they're not all bad moments.\"\n\nShe added that she's seen families grow closer because of the time they spend together as carers.\n\n\"It's tough but there are also a lot of good things that come out of it,\" she said. \"They do have that sense of satisfaction that they really were there to the end and helped their loved one, and they get closer. So they're not all bad moments.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ashley Collman", "title": "Unearthed footage shows Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky briefly holding hands after he met her family at the White House in 1996", "description": "Footage unearthed by A&E for their new docuseries, \"The Clinton Affair,\" shows former White House intern Monica Lewinsky bringing her family to meet President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office in June 1996.

Anthony, Democrats win the House. President Trump fires his AG and appoints someone that has immediately caused controversy across the political spectrum. What is next?\n\nAnthony Scaramucci: Well, I mean, I think, specific to the Attorney General slot, I think that that's a temporary position. And so, I think what'll happen is that'll burn off and blow over in the next two weeks, I predict. When he gets back from Paris, they'll have a permanent Attorney General that will have to go through the process and be Senate confirmed. And my guess is whoever he picks will get that confirmation. Because remember, he picked up seats in the Senate. I think that's good news for the President's agenda. The fact that he lost seats in the house and it flipped, that's bad news for him if they start pressing on him with investigatory and subpoena powers. It may be bizarrely good news for him if they can cut a deal on immigration, and they can reach across the aisle and create some bipartisan activity.\n\nBlodget: And the Attorney general, now, controversy is, would be very difficult to confirm. From the outside, it certainly looks like this is a person who has been supportive of really limiting the Russia investigation. You don't think that that's what the President is really trying to do?\n\nScaramucci: Well, I think what the President is trying to do is, he had a personality difference, obviously, with Attorney General Sessions. He probably wasn't happy with the way he recused himself. I mean, that's been pretty obvious. And so, I think he's really trying to find who should be the interim person until he picks a more permanent person. And I think he's now discovering that there's nuances to that. Because Attorney General designee Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate, like somebody like Rod Rosenstein has been confirmed by the Senate. And so, I think there'll be a tussle, two week tussle, probably. But, I think he'll get somebody in place permanently. So, what we're talking about right now will probably burn off and go away. But, if it doesn't, then I think the President does have a problem. And somebody that's honest with him will say, listen, from a bipartisan perspective, if you look at the Constitution, a person that you're gonna have run this department needs to be Senate confirmed. And so, my guess is that Whitaker will not be there for that long of a period of time. But, can I just address the Russian thing, quickly? I think the President's gonna be exonerated on the Russian thing. And I think the President's made a decision that he's gonna be treated fairly on the Russia thing. Otherwise, Rod Rosenstein would have been fired as well.\n\nBlodget: The President has said, under pressure, often, that he supports a free press. But, he certainly doesn't act like it. And we had a situation this week where a Washington Post reporter was stripped of his credential. We have what appears to have been a doctored video circulated by Washington or CNN reporter? CNN, I apologize. CNN reporter, I'm sorry. But, situation, that following so many other acts Yeah seems like, actually, If given his druthers, the President would shut down any press that appeared critical of him.\n\nScaramucci: Well, I certainly don't think that's the case. I mean, I know him personally and obviously, I was his comms director for 11 short days. But, they were a lot of fun for me. And I've had a lot of conversations with him about the press. And as you know, he has been a product, a by-product of the press for 45 years. So, I mean, and I'll share this with your viewers. My first day in the Oval Office, he turned to me and said, man, I had such a great relationship with the press for 45 years. What do you think has happened? And I said to him, well sir, you declared war on the press. You allowed Stephen Bannon, at CPAC, to declare war on the press. You're saying that the press is the enemy of the people. And this sort of stuff. And that's not helping you. Because what ends up happening is, you're setting each other up, now, for anytime a match gets struck, it burns into this gigantic bonfire. And so, the example you're using from last week I think is an unfortunate example. But, I do think there's fault on both sides. I'm not equivocating. I believe in the First Amendment. I believe in the free press. I believe that the press should be adversarial. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have faced the adversary of the press. I just don't think it should be warlike. That's one of my big issues. And so, but, I know the president well. He's 72 years old. And he feels that you're in the White House, you're in the East Room, he's the president of the United States. You may not like Donald J. Trump, but you should respect the office of the presidency and probably be a little bit more polite in those situations, even if you're being adversarial. That's just my personal view. Having said that, they have the right to be there. I turned the lights and cameras back on my first day when I got to the White House. I went to the press box and tried to answer every single question I could, as objectively as possible. And I think the President's tried to do that. I think, Henry, you'd have to stipulate this, with me, that he has been way more open, in terms of press sprays, talking in front of the- Recently, he certainly has been. the Rose Garden or leaving from Marine One and doing this sort of thing. And so, yeah, he's been more accessible. I think that's probably a direct result of Bill Shine's influence. And, let's see what happens. But I hope they dial this back. I don't think it's good for America.\n\nBlodget: And the President is fond of saying that the press is the enemy of the people. Does he actually believe that, or is that just shtick?\n\nScaramucci: I don't think he believes that he thinks that they're the enemy of the people. You may have caught that Axios interview that went on HBO. I think what he gets upset about is that if he thinks he's being treated unfairly, he'll lash out. He'll say those sorts of things. But, I don't really think, down deep, he thinks he's the enemy of the people. And by the way, you're not asking me this, but I'm gonna answer it anyway. He's definitely not a nationalist. If you define nationalism the way George Orwell or Barbara Tuchman did in \"The Guns of August,\" he is nothing, not even close to a nationalist. But, he likes saying that as well, because he knows it irks these intellectual elitists who have actually read those books and they get very upset. They strike a match to their hair and they run around on these cable shows upset that the president's calling himself a nationalist.\n\nBlodget: Well, he also seems to Say nationalist knowing it will stoke the passions of white nationalists. The word is very much entwined in that.\n\nScaramucci: I think that is a big issue. I think that, and let's be fair. When you look at things like ethnocentrism and white nationalism, it's a very small fringe. It gets a lot of attention. And think that that's an unfortunate by-product of trying to stoke up the liberal elites and the media. But, you know, I'm not a fan of any of those things. I mean, that's one of the main reasons why I was at such odds with somebody like Steve Bannon. Because at the end of the day, this stuff is, in my opinion, totally anti-American.\n\nBlodget: There was a great quote, in one of Donald Trump's books. Basically to the extent of, just say it, people will believe it. And this is certainly been in evidence in his presidency. Does he feel it is negative of the press to call him out when he just says something that doesn't happen to be true?\n\nScaramucci: Okay so, I've actually talked to him about this. So, I was on Bill Maher's show two weeks ago. The President called me after that media appearance and he's the media coach in chief. And so, he was giving me pointers and telling me what I was doing right and wrong. But, what he did point out, which I think is worth sharing with people, is that some of the stuff that he's doing, okay, is almost like a diversionary tactic. Scott Adams, who is the author of the Dilbert series, wrote an unbelievable book about the President called \"Win Bigly\" and it's got a great little cartoon of the orange hair and the whole thing. And what Scott says in the book is that the president steps on some of these, pufferies, mistruths, lies, whatever you wanna call them. Look, I'm not here equivocating. You can call them any one of those things. He does that as a diversionary tactic to take people off of the main thing that he's driving. And this is one of the points in my book, \"The Blue-Collar President.\" He is going after the blue-collar base that's been traditional to the Democratic party. And so, what he's found is by doing this mistruths or these misdirections, his opponents are focused on those and they come across like a hall monitor on television or they come across like Charlie Brown's teacher. You know with the And he like that because it keeps them off focus of what he's really doing. And my recommendation to the Democrats, and Bill Maher didn't let me say it, but I think you're gonna let me. And so, I'll give my recommendation to Democrats. Focus on the people that you left behind. There's been a 35-year vacuum of advocacy for middle-class and lower-middle-class people. And so, what the president did, and you have to just think about this, is historic. He stole the Republican nomination from the Republican establishment. They clearly did not want him to have it, he took it. And then he reached over and grabbed the base of the Democratic Party and he moved it over to him, and I describe how he did that in the book. Why he was capable of doing that and despite the fact that he's had an unbelievably gilded life, Henry, he still saw something in those people and he was able to galvanize them towards him and I try to describe why in the book.\n\nBlodget: So, on the untruths, puffery, whatever you wanna call it, it's basically marketing. It's tactics to get something. It's part of his game. That's his game plan. Heres the thing, though. I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of it this way, but the presidency, he is an employee of the people. You have lots of employees in your business. Honesty, forthrightness, they are the core of any organization.\n\nScaramucci: I agree with that. And so, I think he tried to make the point to John Karl, the ABC correspondent, that he's doing the best he can to tell the truth. But, you have to understand, he's been a showman his whole life. He's been a raconteur his whole life. And so, you know, it's a little bit like my grandfather. Why would you let the truth sometimes get in the way of a really good story, okay? And that's sort of what he's doing. I can speak from a market perspective. The stock market and the people that are market participants have sort of priced this into the equation. They give the president, based on his personality, more or less a free pass verbally. You know, he can jawbone at the Fed, doesn't impact the market. He can talk about the dollar, doesn't really impact the market. He can say things that typical presidents, or the first 44 presidents wouldn't say and the market says it's okay. And so, I think the population and the marketplace has sort of adapted to the president's personality, as opposed to him at age 72 changing. I don't see the guy changing.\n\nBlodget: So, behind closed doors, is he the same way? In staff meetings, are huge percentage of the things that he says not true?\n\nScaramucci: I try to point that out. That he is way more temperate. He's way more deliberate in his thought process. If you really got an inside portal to what he's like in those meetings, I think you would gain a lot of comfort. I mean, there was one meeting, I can't get into the details because it's somewhat classified, but he turned to me after the meeting, and he looked at me and he was like, and they call me the warmonger. And it was an insinuation that there was a number of different things that needed to be decided, and he was really choosing the most moderate, most peaceful way of going about something. And so, I think the American public, if they knew that about him, they would calm down a little bit. They would find that that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\n\nBlodget: And you talk about how Wall Street is priced in the president and things he says. When he was elected, I remember lots and lots of smart people said, oh yes, ignore the bombast. This is a very smart business person. This is gonna be great for everybody and then we get into what looks increasingly like a real trade war. Like he is intending to press this on. I think you've said recently that actually, there'll be a deal soon. Not a big deal, don't worry about it.\n\nScaramucci: Yeah so, I wrote an op-ed last July, which was published in the FT, that described what he's doing. And I also strongly suggested to the President to be careful with the rhetoric. Because what you don't wanna do is you don't wanna make the rhetoric so heated that the market starts losing confidence in the pro-business agenda. If you really understand the president, he's using the tariffs more as a cajole, Henry, in the negotiating process. It's too long-winded to describe here, but there's been a 75-year decision by the United States to uneven the playing field to allow for economic interdependence among nations, and a rising living standard around the world. The US made that decision because we thought that would allow the world to have less conflict. And so, the president's looking at that now and saying, well, the side effect of that is it's hollowed out lower-middle-class and middle-class living standards. Wages are down, on real economic terms, over 30 years. And so, his suggestion is, we have to start to even up that playing field today. And so, if you look at the tariffs that he's proposing, it's really, he's always looking for parity. So, if the Chinese tariffs are up here on our goods and services, and ours are down here on theirs, he's just saying, okay, we're coming up here, unless you're willing to come down here. And so, my prediction is, just like he did with the Canadian situation. He met the deadline, signed that deal. Now calling it the USMCAI, or whatever he's calling it. MCA. I think he'll do the same thing with China. My prediction is in the next three months, he'll have a deal done with China. I think the Chinese are ready to seed on IP, because their IP is soaring over there. Their AI, artificial intelligence, their intellectual property is soaring over there. And I think they're at a state of economic maturity, where they're willing to relax aspects of their market, and I think that'll be very, very good for the world. These two leaders, I believe, like each other. At least that's been my impression when talking to the President. And I think there's a deal there. I'm not saying it's gonna get done at the G20 in Argentina, but I do think it gets done by the time you and I are freezing in Davos, Switzerland, in January, I do think we get a deal.\n\nBlodget: Midterms out of the way, stock market has stumbled recently, where do we go from here?\n\nScaramucci: Well, I think the stock market's stumbling from a combination of different things. One of them is seasonal. October's typically a rough month for the stock market as people rebalance. Secondarily, rates are going up. And so, you can look, as an economist, you can look at interest rate sensitive areas of the economy, like housing and financial services, and see some pressure there. Also, weirdly, the yield curve is flatter than it should be at this point in the cycle. That has more to do with the way the treasury is borrowing. So, we took out a lot of debt to finance the tax cut. And the treasury's made a decision to borrow at the forward end of the curve. And so, that's artificially flattening the curve. But some economists are looking at that and saying, a flat yield curve augurs for a recession. And so, we at SkyBridge, we don't see that. We don't see a recession, but we do see, if the Fed doesn't start moving more aggressively towards data dependency, we do see a sell-off into 2019 if we stay on current trend. And so, that'll be unfortunate because the economic growth is there. Over the next two years, you could clearly see a 3% number for economic growth. But, my prediction on that, as well, is that the Fed will start to curb their interest rate hikes. You'll likely get two to three more hikes instead of the three to five more. And I think the economic story for the US is still very much intact. And so, I think this is a temporary dip in a still long-term trend of a bull market.\n\nBlodget: And what about the deficit, which you mentioned? We had the tax cut. Deficit has ballooned. In the late stage of the cycle, usually it's small now. If we do go into recession, it's going to explode.\n\nScaramucci: Well, I mean, you know, one of the reasons why I couldn't last in Washington, right? Because I actually don't like politicians, right? Because they're very hypocritical and they tell a lot of mistruths. And so, at certain times they're saying, we hate the deficit, and other times they're ignoring the deficit. It depends on who's in charge. But, I've studied the deficit for 30 years as an economist, and what I would say about the deficit is that we can handle the debt that we're taking on, provided that we don't touch off inflation. So, that's the real dilemma for the Fed. If you look at the US balance sheet, it's about $72 trillion. That's the governmental balance sheet. You've got $21 trillion of debt. You could add on more debt, particularly if you're gonna get the economic growth through 3%. But, the issue is if you have inflation, you'll stall the capital market. You'll stall the debt market. And so, that's the dilemma for Jerome Powell. He's gotta get the rates moving in a mama bear sort of position. Where it slows down inflation, it gets everybody comfortable with the US dollar and the rate of inflation, but also allows for economic expansion and opportunity. But, the dirty secret that all of us know that study the deficit, as long as you don't have systemic inflation, the United States can handle this level of debt.\n\nBlodget: Talk about opportunity zones, which is a part of the tax bill. SkyBridge is now launching a new product to take advantage of that.\n\nScaramucci: Yeah, so we're Launching our product on December 1. We've created a private REIT to take advantage of the new tax code's regulations on opportunity zones. So, briefly, clients will be able to sell low basis, high-valued securities, wine collections, businesses. This should have been available to you, Henry, when you sold Business Insider. We gotta put you in our opportunity zone. But, what basically happens is, you can sell your low basis, high-valued stock. That liquid cash, you can dump into an opportunity zone. You have 180 days to do it. There's 8,700 of them, according to the 2010 census. And you can make real estate investments, other types of investments, and you have a 10 year tax deferral on that basis, the creation. And then, any money that you make in the opportunity zone over the 10 years comes to you tax free. So, this is a fabulous piece of the tax code. It should unleash one to three trillion dollars of capital into the nation's poorer areas. It'll almost be like an off-balance sheet infrastructure infusion and real estate infusion into areas that need it. And some areas, frankly, that don't need it. As an example, all of Brooklyn is in the opportunity zone and parts of Manhattan. But, I think it's a fabulous idea. One of the first things I did, when we got back to SkyBridge, is started to organize a fund around this. And so, we're creating a private REIT, which will throw off some yield and will give people diversity, as opposed to doing one-off real estate projects, like some of our competitors.\n\nBlodget: Anthony, thank you so much. It's great to have you."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Aria Bendix", "title": "These 7 states have the worst homelessness crises in the US.

The company also told several suppliers last week that it cut its iPhone XR production schedule again.\n\nIt's been a big fall for the tech giant, which in August became the first US company with a $1 trillion market cap. But Apple has lost over $220 billion in market value from its October peak.\n\nApple is now up just 5% this year.\n\nNow read:\n\nMI"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Appolonia, provided by<br><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><img src=\"//imgs.sfgate.com/graphics/partners/businessinsider/article_header.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>", "title": "Why NASA blasts half a million gallons of water during rocket launches - mySanAntonio.com", "description": "NASA blasted almost\u00a0half a million gallons of water a hundred feet into the air.\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) is designed for deeper space missions, able to explore far beyond Earth's orbit.\nWatch the video above to see how NASA is prepping to launch its mos\u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-uses-water-blast-test-space-launch-system-sls-2018-11?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=allverticals", "urlToImage": "https://www.mysanantonio.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:22:04Z", "content": "The following is a transcript of the video Alex Appolonia: This is almost half a million gallons of water being blasted a hundred feet into the air.

It was all done in just 60 seconds.\n\nNASA created the massive fountain as part of a test for its Space Launch System, scheduled to launch for the first time in 2020.\n\nIt will be the largest, most powerful rocket NASA has ever built. Standing upright, the SLS will reach 322 feet in height, 17 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty, and weigh almost 6 million pounds.\n\nIts first planned mission? A 25-day trip around the moon.\n\nWhen it lifts off, its engines will generate 8.4 million pounds of force and sound waves so powerful that they could easily destroy the rocket from the ground up.\n\nThat's where NASA's Ignition Overpressure and Sound Suppression System comes in. NASA projects the water onto and over the launchpad during ignition and liftoff. This not only protects the ground from the rocket's engines it also prevents the sound waves from bouncing off the ground and back up which could cause catastrophic damage to the engines. The system also prevents the giant flames generated by the engines from catching anything on fire.\n\nDuring an actual launch, some of the water will evaporate due to the extreme heat, while the rest exits through nozzles. This test is just one of many more that NASA will conduct over the coming months in preparation for the rocket's first launch.\n\nThe SLS is designed for deeper space missions able to explore far beyond Earth's orbit. It can carry astronauts in an Orion capsule, or ferry other cargo, like exploratory robots, to distant worlds like Jupiter and Mars. Pretty impressive, huh?\n\nThis latest test, performed in the beginning of October, was to evaluate any needed upgrades, like corrosion control, renovating the water storage tank, and checking the conditions of the pipes and valves. Now, it will be in tip-top shape for when the SLS is ready to make its debut flight in 2020."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Brian Pascus", "title": "An 11-year-old boy made it through security and nearly boarded a Delta plane without a boarding pass", "description": "An 11-year-old boy in Atlanta made it through airport security and nearly boarded a Delta Air Lines plane all without a boarding pass or ticket, multiple sources have reported.

The smiling photographs captured people who had been with the store for five years, 10 years, 15 years, and more. The longer you stayed, the higher your picture moved up.\n\nBut the employee realized that some of the pictures were disappearing.\n\n\"Those pictures have been slowly coming down, because those people who have been there for so long \u2014 a lot of whom are higher-ups \u2014 are not satisfied with the company anymore,\" the employee told Business Insider. \"They don't like the direction it's going.\"\n\nThe vanishing pictures weren't just a phenomenon at that one employee's store. A second Ikea employee based in a different state told Business Insider, \"More and more people are being taken down as they leave the company. The one at my store has had at least one-third of the people taken down.\"\n\nA third employee estimated they had witnessed 15 Ikea colleagues quit over the past year.\n\nAll three described this turnover rate as previously uncharacteristic of their respective stores.\n\nIkea has long been touted as an ideal retail employer. On Glassdoor, it ranked among the best places to work in 2013 and 2017. Reviewers praised the retailer's benefits, which include health insurance, PTO, and employee discounts.\n\nSo why are US-based employees reporting an exodus from the furniture store?\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to a group of five Ikea employees \u2014 whom Ikea calls \"coworkers\" \u2014 across three states, all of whom asked to be kept anonymous for fear of retribution. They attributed dissatisfaction among employees to the new, Ikea US-wide policy called \"organization for growth,\" or O4G.\n\nThe policy \u2014 which was officially launched on October 15, 2017, and has not been applied at any Ikea locations outside of the United States \u2014 restructured employee roles within the stores.\n\nIn a statement provided to Business Insider, a company spokesperson said Ikea Retail US rolled out the policy in order \"to change the way we were organized and the way we work together throughout our organization.\"\n\n\"Our objective was to empower our coworkers to meet our customers' expectations in today's multichannel environment, and strengthen our position in the fast changing US retail environment,\" the spokesperson said. \"Hundreds of coworkers from throughout Ikea US contributed to the process of creating the new organization's design, including coworkers from our stores.\"\n\nBut among employees, the new policy has also generated a lot of dissent.\n\n\"Before O4G happened, Ikea was kind of like a paradise,\" one employee told Business Insider. \"I know it's a rose-colored glasses thing, but the company actually did have a pretty open budget, and they did give a lot of freedom of choice with how budgets were spent, based on sales.\"\n\nEmployees say that the new policy has changed the company's US operations \u2014 largely for the worse.\n\n\"I've been involved with management, and I know how the system works,\" an employee who has worked at Ikea for more than a decade told Business Insider. \"I know it's not working.\"\n\nBefore the new policy kicked in, employees say stores were centered on departments\n\nBefore O4G, the employees said work in Ikea's 48 US-based stores was primarily centered on different departments. Salaried employees known as shopkeepers helmed departments dedicated to specific goods categories, like sofas, media products, and bedrooms.\n\nSales workers were hourly employees assigned to different departments. They were tasked with helping customers and performing backend work, like tidying up departments and handling price tags.\n\nEmployees could also work in the cash department as cashiers or man the returns department, while others were assigned to the store's restaurant or bistro, inventory, goods flow, and security. Many locations also had HR, IT, childcare, and interior design departments.\n\nPreviously, the employees said Ikea's structure allowed employees to build up an expertise within their department.\n\n\"There were specific people for specific roles,\" one employee told Business Insider. \"That way, you'd know everything there could possibly be to know about your role and your department.\"\n\nBut things didn't always play out that smoothly, according to some of the employees who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"We'd get a lot of complaints that there weren't any employees on the floor ever,\" one employee said. \"Or, if there are employees, they look busy and so customers don't feel like they can help them.\"\n\nThe new policy, O4G, was meant to change that.\n\nO4G was billed as a shift toward becoming more 'customer-centric,' according to employees\n\nWhen O4G was first announced, employees said it was billed as a policy that would help Ikea US become more \"customer-centric.\"\n\nThe policy did away with much of the departmental focus of the stores, and entirely new roles were established.\n\n\"Active seller\" was one such new job title. The job, which also entailed a pay bump, required these employees to focus exclusively on selling products and assisting guests. All of the backend work would fall to merchandising basics employees, who would replace mislaid inventory, build displays, and keep the departments clean.\n\nEmployees characterized O4G as splitting the work of the now defunct sales employees into two new roles. The division sparked resentment, according to employees, because active sellers received a raise while merchandising basics employees remained at what one employee told Business Insider was the \"lowest pay band within the store.\"\n\n\"Some people got a pay bump and some didn't,\" another employee told Business Insider. \"I know that was frustrating for the merchandising basics people, because it wasn't really like they got a choice in the matter.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a number of departments were merged. Employees who previously worked as cashiers now could find themselves working in the restaurant, handling returns, or covering home delivery within the new customer service department. Prep and flow employees were tapped to handle logistics like cleaning the aisles and keeping the stores stocked throughout the day.\n\nAnother reason employees were given for the pivot was technological modernization. One employee said competition with Amazon came up a lot in training. Two different employees agreed that Ikea's impulse to update its online-fulfillment capabilities with a new click-and-collect program was justified.\n\nEmployees attended training sessions for O4G for months before it was implemented. Jens Meyer/AP Images\n\nBut employees said they began having concerns about O4G early on\n\nOctober 2017 might have marked the launch of the new policy, but employees told Business Insider that they attended numerous O4G trainings for about a year until then. These sessions featured presentations, interactive games, and group discussions.\n\n\"We worked with our coworkers to ensure they were informed and engaged throughout the yearlong process with multiple opportunities to provide input,\" an Ikea US spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. \"We offered the opportunity for every coworker to have a role in the new organization.\"\n\nThree employees described experiencing low-grade anxiety over the policy shift, but said they were assured that no one would be losing their jobs. The employees said they worried about the vagueness of some of the announced changes.\n\nOne longtime Ikea employee told Business Insider that the new policy \"sounded kind of great in the beginning,\" but added that there was a sense within the store that employees were \"either with O4G, or you're against it.\"\n\nOther employees reported having major concerns from the get-go that were dismissed by higher-ups.\n\n\"They would basically sit us down and do slideshows, and show us how O4G was going to make things better for the store,\" said one employee. \"We would ask them, 'How is this going to make anything better?' But they were like, 'Oh you guys have to just wait and see how it's implemented.'\"\n\nOne employee said concerns among store workers stemmed from confusion over how the announced changes would actually benefit the store.\n\nThat employee described asking a manager about why O4G was changing a certain aspect of work in the store.\n\n\"I remember him saying to me, 'I don't know, I think it's stupid,'\" the employee said. \"And I was like, 'Cool, I'm really glad that we feel so positively about this.'\"\n\nThat employee said the group of managers and company representatives rolling out O4G kept touting their transparency, but that the process left employees and even some managers confused.\n\nEmployees took a test in order to be placed into new roles\n\nAll Ikea store employees filled out a quiz in order to place into their new, post-O4G jobs. Questions focused on their skills and their current roles. According to employees, the testing started off with the higher-ups and then trickled down to the employees.\n\nOne employee, who had just recently started working at Ikea at the time, described feeling confused over some of the questions.\n\n\"I'm this new employee taking this test and they're asking me questions and it's like \u2014 I don't even know what this question means,\" the employee said. \"I don't even know what this role does.\"\n\nThe employee explained that the quiz had participants rank their skills and their preferred departments.\n\nDirect team leads would also fill out a quiz for each of their reports. The employee said in cases where the quiz results between the team lead and employee didn't match up, a meeting with management was called.\n\nAnother employee from a different store said some of their colleagues took the test \"willy-nilly,\" not recognizing its importance.\n\n\"Some people were not giving it the most attention,\" another employee from a different store said. \"And some of them suffered for it.\"\n\nBased on the results of the test, employees were then given their new assignments. Most employees received a single offer, but some were given the opportunity to choose between two jobs.\n\nNot everyone was happy with their new assignments at Ikea, according to employees. Shayanne Gould/Business Insider\n\n'You kind of felt like you were trapped'\n\nEmployees told Business Insider that not everyone was happy with the results of the placement tests.\n\n\"We had an employee get switched out of the department that she was working in for six years, so that's something she was upset about,\" one employee said.\n\nAnother Ikea employee said employees who weren't satisfied with their new assignments didn't have much recourse.\n\n\"They said, 'If you're not satisfied, you have two weeks to find and apply for a new position within the company. Otherwise, you're gone,'\" the employee said.\n\nA longtime employee told Business Insider: \"You kind of felt like you were trapped. You might be taking a position that you may have wanted, or you just took it because you didn't want to lose your job and all your benefits. You took it until you could find something else.\"\n\nThree of the employees told Business Insider certain shopkeeper roles were eliminated and some of their colleagues were slated to take pay cuts as a result of the policy change.\n\n\"There were some demotions,\" one employee said. \"A ton of demotions. People that we had as managers are now team leads or just regular employees.\"\n\nHowever, Ikea established a policy of pay protection that will last until December 2018, meaning that employees could opt to earn their old salaries until then. Anyone taking a pay cut could begin planning their exit in October 2017, when the new policy rolled out, without taking an immediate financial hit.\n\nSince Ikea's stores have restructured, employees have complained about pay disparities\n\nIn response to one internal survey, over 250 Ikea employees said they believed that newer hires were making significantly more than them. Andreas Rentz / Getty Images\n\nThe five employees who spoke to Business Insider mentioned a perceived pay disparity between employees who were hired before and after the O4G rollout.\n\nA survey on Yammer, Ikea's internal social network, that attracted 267 participants found that 67% of respondents believed that new, post-O4G hires were earning significantly more than them. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents said they believed that newer employees were making more than them, but not by much, according to a screenshot that Business Insider reviewed.\n\nOnly 7% of respondents said they believed new hires were making the same amount as them, while 3% said new hires were making less.\n\nIkea did not provide a response to questions about the perceived pay disparity in its statement to Business Insider.\n\nOne employee told Business Insider that complaints about the O4G-related pay gap were met with explanations centered on the new hires having more experience.\n\n\"All the employees now are like, 'Well, we're training them. So what experience do they have that we don't, if we're the ones training them to do the same job?'\" the employee said.\n\nThe employee added that the situation wasn't fair for the new employees, either, \"because they're getting thrown into this pit of animosity for no reason.\"\n\nA different employee added that managers had responded to complaints about the pay disparity by implying, \"If we don't like it, we have other opportunities in life \u2014 away from Ikea.\"\n\nEmployees also expressed concerns about understaffing within the stores\n\nIkea's O4G push didn't truly solve the problem of helping customers easily access employees, according to four of the employees who spoke to Business Insider.\n\nInstead, they pointed to chronic understaffing in stores. The new policy was meant to ensure that active sellers would take care of guests, but workers told Business Insider the problem largely went unsolved.\n\n\"Customers always come up and complain about how they can't find anyone on the floor, even active sellers,\" one employee said. \"There are apparently not enough on the floor.\"\n\nThat employee added that in the initial trainings, presenters said there would be one active seller available per department. In practice, though, the employee said there often isn't one employee for every four departments.\n\n\"I get yelled at at least once a day because a customer couldn't find an employee and I'm the only person in that department,\" another employee told Business Insider. \"It's like, 'I'm sorry, I'm with 12 other customers.'\"\n\nA third Ikea employee who is not an active seller said, \"I get stopped by customers asking for help. And that's because they cannot find an active seller in that respective department. In order for me to get my job done \u2014 because customers are waiting for their stuff \u2014 I have to find an active seller.\"\n\n\"I get yelled at at least once a day,\" one coworker told Business Insider. Cancan Chu / Getty Images\n\nSome employees also feel more 'disposable' now \u2014 and they say it's making the store less efficient\n\nThe changes brought about by O4G allowed employees to become generalists within the store, rather than specialists.\n\nBut one Ikea employee told Business Insider that the changes make employees feel \"disposable.\"\n\n\"Now that tons of people know how to do all of the things, if we lose one person, we still have 30 other people who know the same things,\" the employee said. \"So, no harm, no foul.\"\n\nThree employees also said this approach \u2014 combined with understaffing \u2014 brought about unintended consequences within the stores.\n\n\"With the active sellers, you may have one person in marketplace that's covering the cook shop, bed textiles, home textiles, home organization, lighting, rugs, prints, and frames,\" one employee said. \"And the customers can't find them.\"\n\nOne employee said that before O4G, at least six employees would be scheduled in the bedrooms department, the section of the store that brought about \"a massive portion of the store sales.\"\n\nThe employee said that, recently, only one or two employees would be available to help out with bedrooms.\n\n\"Then we'll immediately get a call saying that cash lanes needs help, and so they take our employees, and they put in the cash lanes because cash lanes doesn't have enough cashiers,\" the employee said.\n\nA different employee added: \"There have been a couple of occasions where cash lanes were backed up, and they pulled people from returns or home delivery or what have you, and then, as a result, those departments became backed up. You're just moving the line from one department to the other.\"\n\nEmployees agree that morale has declined\n\n\"Going above and beyond doesn't really exist anymore,\" one store worker said. Mark Lennihan/AP Images\n\nAll of the employees that Business Insider spoke with agreed that morale had taken a hit.\n\nThey described their colleagues as upset, stressed, and resentful of the new employees they believe are earning higher wages.\n\n\"The body language says it all,\" a longtime employee said. \"Without even speaking to an employee, you can look at the way they walk when they come in. They're not smiling anymore.\"\n\nTwo employees agreed that the new policy had done away with the desire of many employees to \"go above and beyond\" in helping customers \u2014 and one another.\n\n\"Going above and beyond doesn't really exist anymore, because so many employees already have all this extra work that they have to do,\" an employee told Business Insider.\n\nA third employee said the atmosphere has made answering customers' questions about what it's like to work at Ikea awkward.\n\n\"We were their biggest cheerleader,\" the employee said. \"Now we're kind of hesitant to answer those questions from customers.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed a Yammer post in which an employee appeared to quit the company. J Pat Carter/AP Images\n\nEmployees have taken to social media to complain about the new policy\n\nA number of Ikea employees have made their ire toward O4G known online.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed a post on Yammer in which an employee appeared to quit the company.\n\nThe employee described their time with the store as \"one of the worst experiences I have ever had to deal with\" and concluded their \"dreams\" of continuing with the store were \"quickly killed off and cremated by O4G.\"\n\nOne employee who spoke with Business Insider said they had witnessed others post farewell messages on Yammer: \"They write their goodbyes and say they can't do it anymore. In terms of O4G comments that are posted there, there are no positive comments about it at all.\"\n\nAnother longtime employee said some employees had posted positive comments about O4G on Yammer.\n\n\"Then you have other employees a few comments later saying, 'No, it's not,'\" the employee said.\n\nThe retailer has also taken a hit on Glassdoor since O4G started\n\nIkea's rankings are slipping on Glassdoor. Glassdoor\n\nIkea's overall rankings on Glassdoor have slipped since O4G was first announced in 2016. Glassdoor ratings are anonymous and therefore cannot be verified, but the data shows a marked trend.\n\nThe chain received overall scores ranging from a 4.5 to a 4.7 out of 5 throughout 2015.\n\nBy the beginning of January 2017, those had dropped down to a 4.1. Today, Ikea's overall score still hovers at a 4.1.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of reviewers who said Ikea had a \"positive business outlook\" has also dropped.\n\nFor the entirety of 2015, the percentage of reviewers who had a positive outlook on Ikea rose from 88.1% to 93.5%. That percentage began declining in January 2016 and has fallen to 69.6% today.\n\nEmployees told Business Insider that they have seen few \u2014 if any \u2014 positive outcomes brought about by O4G\n\nOne full-time Ikea employee told Business Insider that, at their store, customers benefitted from some of the changes.\n\n\"The customers have actually probably seen more employees on the floor,\" the employee sad. \"Every issue that they have had has been seen to by somebody. So for the most part, it's actually helped customer experience from my standpoint. The idea that they have is solid, they're just trying to spread themselves really thin.\"\n\nThat positive assessment isn't the norm among store workers, however. The other four employees said understaffing undermined any positive outcomes for shoppers.\n\nAs far as Ikea's efforts to boost its online strategy, three employees said that certain changes, like emphasizing online-order fulfillment, did make sense for the company. One employee also had somewhat backhanded praise for the policy.\n\n\"It definitely has banded together the team leads and the employees,\" the employee told Business Insider. \"It's created more of a close-knit community because of the joint frustration. My managers and the team leads at Ikea are phenomenal and nobody blames any of them for this.'\"\n\nThe employee added that by combining departments and making roles more general and less department-based, the policy also made taking time off easier at their store.\n\nBut all of the employees agreed that the negative aspects of the new policy, along with the perceived pay disparity with newer hires, outweighed the positives.\n\n\"I've actually had a manager say, 'O4G is changing the company, but you shouldn't be taking the changes home with you. It's just a job,'\" a different employee told Business Insider. \"Yeah, but our paychecks, we do take those home with us. That is something that goes in our pocket every two weeks, and that's how we live.\"\n\nIkea employees say morale is low.

Now that members of parliament have seen the details of it, they are rebelling. Many hate it. For the hardcore Leavers, it keeps Britain too closely tied to Europe's customs rules. For pro-Europe Remainers, including moderate MPs in the opposition Labour party, the ties aren't close enough.\n\nMany of them are demanding the deal be renegotiated. Some of May's own cabinet think she should go back to Brussels and get a new deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on November 19 that \"You've got to go back and negotiate something else.\"\n\nSome MPs are pushing for a second Brexit referendum. Now that we have more details on just how bad Brexit might be, they say, the public should be given a chance to reconsider.\n\nThis is the \"Greek fallacy\" stage of Brexit.\n\n\"Brits [have] fallen for Greek fallacy that [a] domestic vote gives you stronger position in Brussels.\"\n\n\"Brits [have] fallen for Greek fallacy that [a] domestic vote gives you stronger position in Brussels. Other countries have voters too,\" tweeted Duncan Robinson, the Brussels correspondent for the Financial Times, in 2017, when he saw that Britain was becoming delusional about its ability to negotiate with the EU.\n\nBritain can have a second referendum. The Conservatives can topple Theresa May. Labour could win a new general election, and demand new talks.\n\nIt will make no difference.\n\nThe reality may well be that the EU won't change a word.\n\nNo matter what happens, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will likely say, that's the deal. The Article 50 clock runs out on March 29. Don't forget to sign it on your way out the door.\n\nThe Greeks had five different votes \u2014 and the EU ignored them all\n\nWe know this because it has happened before. During the Greek debt crisis, in which Greece threatened to default on its debts to the EU and leave the eurozone, the country had four national elections and one referendum, each one giving the country a \"mandate\" to secure a better deal for Greece.\n\nThe 2015 referendum, on the single issue of whether Greece should accept the EU's bailout or not, soundly rejected the deal. Many thought that vote would force the EU to change course, or forgive part of Greece's debt. I certainly believed that on the night of the triumphant Greek vote in 2015.\n\nBut Brussels didn't blink.\n\nThe terms of the deal were not changed.\n\nGreece is still paying off those debts today.\n\nGreece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has written about his experience of trying and failing to persuade the EU that a country with a gross domestic product of only \u20ac175 billion ($200 billion), and zero growth, isn't able to pay debts of \u20ac368 billion ($420 billion).\n\nBrussels doesn't care about elections inside individual countries. In fact, its officials work actively to suppress or negate them, Varoufakis believes.\n\nThat's not because they are inherently evil. It's because of the way the EU is structured.\n\nThe EU is a very difficult body to negotiate with\n\nThe Union consists of 28 countries (Britain plus 27 others) who all have their own democratic mandates. To pass any new laws or enter into any trade deals is very difficult, with a \"super-qualified majority\" of the EU council required to agree any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe EU, therefore, exists mostly as a system of rules, policies, and laws that are incredibly difficult to be changed or broken. There is no way to negotiate with a body that cannot change its mind if just one of its 28 members won't go along.\n\nSince the UK referendum on the EU in 2016, many politicians have taken the line that if only Britain is insistent enough, the country will get its way with Brussels. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, the arch-Leaver, suggested earlier this month that May would be successful if she showed more \"backbone.\"\n\nThe danger is that the \"Greek fallacy\" becomes a \"British delusion\"\n\nShe can show as much backbone as she wants. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's Brexit coordinator rather underestimated the matter when he said last week: \"There is not a lot of room for manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'.\"\n\nThe danger is that the \"Greek fallacy\" becomes a \"British delusion.\" I began arguing for a second referendum a year ago. But the EU has no interest, and little ability, to be bound by the result.\n\nAbsent a cast-iron promise from all 27 EU members that they will give the UK time to process the result of such a vote \u2014 and right now that doesn't exist \u2014 Britain's choice may be a simple one: Take it or leave it."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Paige Leskin", "title": "Elon Musk just announced a new name for the 387-foot-long SpaceX rocket he wants to send to Mars", "description": "Elon Musk and his company SpaceX have been working on a gigantic, 387-foot-long spacecraft that's designed to eventually send humans to Mars.

Predictably, it came in behind the latest movie in the blockbuster \"Harry Potter\" universe, \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\"\n\nLess predictable, though, was that it came in fifth overall, falling short of the weekend's other major new release, the Mark Wahlberg-starring comedy \"Instant Family,\" as well as the Freddie Mercury biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Grinch,\" which held strong in their third and second weekends.\n\nRead more:How 'Venom' scored one of the biggest superhero-movie openings ever in China\n\nSo what went wrong with \"Widows\"? It stars the Oscar winner Viola Davis and the audience favorite Liam Neeson, along with Colin Farrell, the \"Get Out\" star Daniel Kaluuya, and more. It's an action movie wrapped in a tale of corruption that's politically and socially relevant. And yet, it didn't find an audience.\n\nA social-media analysis conducted by the consumer-insights company Crimson Hexagon for Business Insider found that social-media buzz around the film during its opening weekend was subpar, especially compared with that surrounding the debut of its first trailer on June 4. The movie generated more than 26,000 posts on Twitter and Instagram at that time, according to Crimson Hexagon, compared with fewer than 10,000 posts Friday.\n\nA chart from Crimson Hexagon showing the data is below:\n\nCrimson Hexagon\n\nDeclining interest in the film could be attributed to a marketing problem. BoxOfficeAnalyst.com's Doug Stone said the movie was primarily marketed toward African-American audiences even though the film was \"really not ethnically unidirectional.\"\n\n\"While this type of marketing thrust isn't a bad thing in and of itself for the appropriate product, the film perhaps should have been marketed to cross over to a broader audience,\" Stone told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bock, a senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations, said that Fox, the studio behind the movie, didn't make a smart call opening \"Widows\" against Warner Bros.' \"Fantastic Beasts\" (Fox's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" fared better earlier this month, having made over $380 million worldwide). \"Fantastic Beasts\" overshadowed \"Widows\" online, as well. According to Crimson Hexagon's analysis, \"Fantastic Beasts\" generated more than 157,000 Twitter and Instagram posts over the weekend.\n\nStone agreed that the film's release date in the midst of a jam-packed schedule wasn't favorable and said it would have fared better opening later in the year.\n\n\"The consensus among theatre exhibitors is that the 11/2 - 11/21 period is very much overloaded with product,\" Stone said.\n\nIts mature themes and R rating most likely limited its appeal, too, and Stone said \"that may have been a detriment during this particular time frame\" when more family-friendly options are in theaters.\n\nRead more:The American-flag controversy surrounding 'First Man' isn't the reason it's struggling at the box office\n\n\"Widows\" also highlights a trend in recent months of audiences ignoring critical reviews. Poorly reviewed films, including \"The Nun,\" \"Venom,\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" have exceeded expectations at the box office despite subpar or even abysmal reviews. On the flip side, audiences ignored \"Widows\" despite its impressive 91% critic score on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Similar issues plagued critically acclaimed films like \"First Man\" and \"Suspiria,\" which failed to generate excitement among general moviegoers.\n\nAll of this is why a rebound for \"Widows\" is hard to predict. Oscar buzz and good word of mouth could benefit the movie in the long run, as well as this weekend's holiday, according to Stone. But a lack of interest now despite plenty of critical buzz may not bode well for that prospect, either.\n\n\"User ratings were not stellar with it showing 66% on Rotten Tomatoes,\" Stone said. \"The Metacritic response was somewhat better, but the Cinemascore was a B. That is not a great result. IMDb responses put it as above average but not in the good category.\"\n\n\"We'll have to wait and see how it performs this week before we make any long-term judgments,\" Bock said."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Malarie Gokey and Owen Burke", "title": "The best coffee grinders you can buy", "description": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

If you want to make the perfect brew each morning, you need a coffee grinder.\n\nThere's nothing better than a perfect cup of coffee. If you're a coffee snob, you probably know that freshly ground coffee makes for a better cup of Joe. Coffee goes stale relatively quickly, so when you buy pre-ground beans, you may be losing some of your coffee's flavor. A good grinder will grind your beans to a uniform size so that you get the most out of your beans. Grinding beans every day before you make coffee may sound like a hassle, but a grinder can quickly pulverize your beans to maximize their flavor.\n\nCoffee grinders range from the incredibly affordable to the absurdly expensive. You can get grinders at any point in between as well. We've tested a few coffee grinders and researched dozens more to find the best ones you can buy. Before we get into our picks, these are the key terms and features you need to know.\n\nBlade versus Burr grinders\n\nThere are two main types of coffee grinders: blade and burr grinders. Purists say that you shouldn't even consider blade grinders because they don't grind the coffee beans to a nice uniform particle size, which results in an uneven and unpredictable brew. Blade grinders are much cheaper than burr grinders, though, and not everyone will be able to afford the pricier burr grinders. As such, we've included one blade grinder and the rest are burr grinders at varying price points.\n\nWhen you start looking at burr grinder machines, there's a lot more to know. As The Wirecutter explains, \"burrs work by using two serrated pieces of metal or ceramic that are positioned a specific distance apart from each other (depending on the grind) and rotate to crush the beans to the exact size you want.\" Here are the different types of burrs used on most machines:\n\nFlat versus Conical burrs: There's much debate over which type of burr is better, but they perform pretty similarly, so you shouldn't worry too much about this point. Flat burrs are two parallel rings with a space between them where the beans enter to be sheared into coffee grounds, while conical burrs involve a cone in a ring that grinds your beans down to the right size.\n\nThere's much debate over which type of burr is better, but they perform pretty similarly, so you shouldn't worry too much about this point. Flat burrs are two parallel rings with a space between them where the beans enter to be sheared into coffee grounds, while conical burrs involve a cone in a ring that grinds your beans down to the right size. Steel versus Ceramic burrs: Steel burrs are more affordable and more common in coffee grinders, but they don't last as long as ceramic ones do. Ceramic burrs are typically used in manual hand grinders and for grinding espresso beans perfectly.\n\nHaving a powerful, consistent, and well-made grinder is essential to making the most out of your beans. These are the best grinders you can buy, ranging from less than $20 to $230.\n\nHere are our picks for the best coffee grinders you can buy:\n\nUpdated on 11/20/2018 by Owen Burke: Updated prices and formatting, added the OXO BREW Conical Burr Grinder as a \"Best for less than $100\" pick and the Brim 1.6-Oz Handheld Electric Coffee Grinder for a less than $75 pick.\n\nRead on in the slides below to check out our top picks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Christopher Woody", "title": "75 years ago, US Marines waded into 'the toughest battle in Marine Corps history' \u2014 here are 25 photos of the brutal fight for Tarawa", "description": "By the fall of 1943, Japanese forces had been ejected from Alaska's Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, and the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific were on the verge of capture.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nCanadian technology company BlackBerry is acquiring cybersecurity company Cylance for $1.4 billion, Business Insider reports. The startup, which was founded in 2012 and raised nearly $300 million in venture funding, specializes in AI-powered security tools. The all-cash acquisition is set to close in February 2019, and Cylance will operate as a separate unit.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nBlackBerry has been turning more and more to enterprise services, especially in IoT communication and security as well as the connected car, in an attempt to transform from its mobile roots. The company wasn't able to keep pace with Apple and Google in the smartphone space, but it was able to establish itself as a company known for fast and secure communication in the minds of workers at large enterprises.\n\nIt's overhauled its business in the last few years and moved almost entirely away from mobile phones \u2014 recently released devices with the BlackBerry moniker are actually designed and sold by Chinese manufacturer TCL as part of a licensing deal. Instead, it's been focusing its development efforts on building up its QNX business unit, which is one of the leading operating systems for in-car infotainment centers, as well as tools like its Spark IoT communications platform.\n\nThe acquisition of Cylance is meant to add new capabilities to the Spark platform. Cylance offers AI-powered tools that are meant to actively prevent malware or other attempts to compromise an enterprise network, rather than passively scanning to find areas that have already been compromised.\n\nIt does this by monitoring behaviors and understanding what is out of the ordinary for users of a platform, so it can highlight and stop any unusual activity from getting into a network. BlackBerry plans to integrate elements of Cylance's technology stack into its Spark platform, which it intends to function alongside another platform that handles things like analytics, while Spark tackles communication.\n\nThis could help the company capitalize on demand for security in the IoT platform market. Seventy-nine percent of respondents to Business Insider Intelligence's 2017 Global IoT Executive Survey called an extremely important factor in an IoT platform.\n\nThis acquisition will likely help the company to expand its presence in the market as an adjacent tool alongside platforms like AWS IoT and Microsoft Azure IoT by providing secure communication to augment those platforms' capabilities."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Tom Murray", "title": "Stephen Curry broke traditional NBA style to wear an elegant $57,000 Cartier watch courtside", "description": "An injured Steph Curry was spotted wearing a classy timepiece as he watched his teammates lose on Saturday.

Luckily, even if you're not normally a fan of moving around your neighborhood in spandex, there are a wide range of options available that will help you achieve peak performance, and look good doing it.\n\nWhen considering your next pair of performance tights, you'll want to keep a few things in mind. First off, what kind of activities are you most likely to engage in? If you're a trail runner, you'll likely want a different pair from the guy who spends most of his workout doing squats at the gym.\n\nYou'll also want to think about the degree of compression you want in your tights. Compression clothing is generally thought useful for holding your muscles in place, helping you achieve a higher level of athletic performance. Of course, there's some conflicting evidence as to just how effective compression really is when it comes to improving athleticism, but all the same, if you're a fan of even tighter tights, you may want to consider a pair of compression leggings.\n\nYou should also pay heed to the material used in your next pair of tights. If you're generally engaged in pretty sweaty workouts, it may behoove you to check out a pair of moisture-wicking tights. Alternatively, there are other manufacturers that use more breathable fabrics, which allows for greater air flow and overall comfort during your workout.\n\nFinally, of course, you'll want to keep price points in mind. Workout gear doesn't have to set you back hundreds of dollars, and you can often find pretty fantastic pieces without burning a hole in your wallet.\n\nHere are the best men's running tights you can buy:\n\nRead on in the slides below to check out our top picks."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Travis Clark", "title": "Stephen King loved Netflix's new psychological thriller, 'Cam,' from Hollywood's hottest horror studio", "description": "Netflix Stephen King gave his stamp of approval to Netflix and Blumhouse's new thriller, \"Cam,\" on Monday.

In 2017 Bose was the big winner.\n\nAs in the two previous years, we started with five contenders:\n\nBurmester\n\nBang & Olufsen 3D\n\nELS Studio 3D\n\nHarman Kardon\n\nTesla Audio\n\nAs Business Insider's car audiophile, I did most of the testing, but I debated my assessments with senior reporter Ben Zhang and deputy executive editor Cadie Thompson.\n\nWe don't have a scientific process, or even an elaborate methodology for this award. As was the case in 2017, however, we did review close to 70 vehicles in 2018, which exposed us to a wide variety of audio systems.\n\nWe tend to pick out what some setups do better than others, though most car audio these days is excellent. The old AM/FM, two-speaker arrangements of yesteryear are of course long gone.\n\nAnd even the most basic vehicles frequently offer Bluetooth integration, AUX ports, satellite radio, and multi-speaker soundstages, complete with powerful amplifiers, carefully tuned speakers, and subwoofers.\n\nThe market is separated into three tiers: fairly basic systems; premium systems; and super-premium, high-end systems. These upmarket systems are often an option on luxury vehicles, and at times a pricey one. But in our view, they're well worth considering.\n\nWhen listening to music in your car, you're likely to be surfing media: terrestrial radio, satellite radio, CDs, MP3s, Bluetooth streaming, and streaming audio services such as Pandora, Spotify, or Tidal.\n\nYou may also be using USB inputs or an aux jack, so the quality of your source audio will vary. This year again I found that the aux jack gave me the best modern audio, although some experts maintain that the USB port is better and that using a CD player, if available, still offers the finest sound.\n\nThe big winner\n\nOne of four roof speakers in the system. Matthew DeBord/BI\n\nI sampled the Acura ELS Studio 3D system in the all-new 2019 Acura RDX, and I was monumentally impressed.\n\nIt comes in two versions. The 3D specification taps a 710-watt amplifier and includes four specialized overhead speakers to go along with 14 others throughout an Acura vehicle. The \"base\" system has 550 watts and 12 speakers.\n\nAccording the Acura and ELS parent Panasonic \u2014 who jointly launched the system in early 2018 \u2014 the 3D configuration was tuned by \"eight-time Grammy-winning producer and engineer Elliot Scheiner,\" who has worked with some of the biggest names in music, including the Eagles, Eric Clapton, Steely Dan, and the Foo Fighters.\n\nIn the two years we've been handing out the Audio System of the Year, I've highlighted the exquisite nature of Bowers & Wilkins, whose system won in 2016, and the admirable consistency of Bose, last year's victor.\n\nWhat struck me about the ELS Studio 3D is, understandably, the professional aspect. Scheiner has been involved since 2004, and in an interview he told me that the goal with ELS was always to get \"studio sound in the car.\" What that means is audio accuracy. That differs from, say, the sort raptures that Bowers & Wilkins and Burmester deliver. It also isn't the same as consistency across musical genres, which I've admired in Bose.\n\nInstead, the ELS Studio 3D sounds incredibly real. It doesn't sound like you're listening to a raw studio mix. But it creates a rich analog impression for music coming from digital sources. It's the kind of audio system that musicians appreciate because it can max out a mix, showcasing the skills of the players and singers as well as the engineers. More than any other car-audio system, it proves music is a team sport.\n\nIn terms of the specifics, there isn't quite as much sparkle on highs as I've enjoyed with other premium systems, and the bass is less broad than what I'm used to from Bose and Harman Kardon. The midranges are expansive, and in the Acura RDX the soundstage truly was 3D, an envelope of music. My overall impression was that ELS Studio 3D is a real thinking person's system. Whether it was Zeppelin or the magical phrasings of Melody Gardot, the sound was serious and beautiful.\n\nThe runner-up\n\nTesla's minimalist interior is open and airy, the perfect stage for the in-house audio system. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nTesla designed its own audio system, and in both the Model X SUV and the new Model 3 sedan I've found it to be consistently impressive. It's a secret weapon for Tesla, and further proof the company wants to design and oversee as much of the vehicle experience as possible.\n\nWhile it lacks the jaw-dropping capabilities of Burmester, the Harman-developed Revel Ultima setup found in Lincoln vehicles, and Bowers & Wilkins' deep audiophile credibility, Tesla audio makes compressed, streamed music sound wonderful. In my testing, the system has also been quite well tuned to the airy, open, minimalist interiors of Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe remaining three systems are stunning. You aren't going to be disappointed in any way. Burmester, in particular, has shown me a steady talent for creating warm, concert-hall-like euphony, befitting the Mercedes-Benz automobiles in which I've encountered the system."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Ethel Jiang", "title": "Target is tumbling after disappointing earnings, and it's dragging Kohl's and Best Buy with it (TGT, KSS, BBY)", "description": "Target missed expectations for third-quarter profits and same-store sales, sending shares down as much as 12% early Tuesday.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nThe percentage of consumers converting to a paid Amazon Prime membership after their 30-day free trial has eroded from 84% to 67% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2018, according to analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).\n\nBI Intelligence\n\nThis decline is likely attributable to two factors, according to CIRP cofounder Mike Levin. First, consumers who are most interested in Prime have likely already signed up for the service. Second, non-Prime members have the option to sign up for monthly memberships when they're most likely to need the benefits, like around the holidays, but they may only remain members for a few months.\n\nThe news is not all bad for Amazon, however, as paid membership renewal is in excellent shape, with 93% of members renewing after their first year and a whopping 98% of members renewing after two years.\n\nAmazon could also lose loyalty to local merchants, which consumers and Prime subscribers alike have indicated a preference for. An impressive 76% of Prime members said that they would pay more for something at a local independent business as opposed to buying the same item on Amazon, according to a survey by Funding Circle. This mirrors the 77% of consumers overall who express this preference, and the majority of these respondents even said they would pay a 10% premium or more at a small- or medium-sized business (SMB).\n\nThe e-commerce giant seems to be leaning into this proclivity for SMBs by embracing them on the Amazon marketplace. In September, the e-tailer added a page called Amazon Storefronts to its website exclusively for the sale of products from US SMBs. It currently features over 1 million products from roughly 20,000 small local companies. If Amazon can amass a large number of SMBs on its site, it may gain both sales and loyalty as well as new Prime memberships from consumers looking to support SMBs. This could also foster a more positive image of the company as one that supports mom-and-pop shops as opposed to overpowering them.\n\nAmazon is making Prime more alluring by steadily adding a plethora of new perks for members, which could drive conversions. The company recently announced that Prime members are invited to an exclusive early showing of \"Aquaman\" at select theaters across the US on December 15, almost a week before it becomes available to other US viewers on December 21.\n\nAnd this is only the most recent of several new benefits the e-tailer has used to up Prime's value. For example, it rolled out its try-before-you-buy (TBYB) apparel service, Prime Wardrobe, across the US in June, debuted a subscription children's book box service in late August, and has been continuously expanding grocery delivery and pickup from Whole Foods via Prime Now.\n\nIf Amazon can grow Prime's benefits to the point where there's something for everyone and the package is too tempting to pass up, it may see new member signups and higher conversion from free trials again."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Lea Nonninger", "title": "Foreign online banks are keen on US expansion (GS, JPM, BCS)", "description": "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \" Fintech Briefing \" subscribers.

Moreover, banks in the US have not had to contend with the rapid rise of digital challengers as other markets have, especially in Europe.\n\nAs such, while many legacy players in the UK have been forced cut down on fees and prices to compete with tech-savvy neobanks, US banks still charge customers plenty of fees, including when making ATM cash withdrawals. By offering cheap and free digital services, Pepper can fill this gap in the US market.\n\nHowever, Pepper isn't the only new entrant looking to capitalize on this opportunity.Pepper will join a number of other foreign challenger banks that want to set up shop in the country.

After hitting the spend requirement, you'll have 85,000 miles (or more, if you earn at the Hotels.com bonus rate), which transfers to about 63,750 airline miles (Capital One transfers to airlines at a 2:1.5 ratio). You can also use the bonus simply for $750 worth of travel purchases (or $850 when you factor in the spending), although you can potentially get a better offer by transferring miles to an airline partner. This is one of the best offers we've seen on this card in years.\n\nThe Spark Miles for Business, meanwhile, has an incredible bonus \u2014 as long as you have a business that typically has high expenses. Also for a limited time, you can get up to 200,000 miles. The bonus is broken into two chunks: 50,000 miles after you spend $5,000 in the first three months, and an additional 150,000 miles when your business spends $50,000 in the first six months.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nThe Spark Cash for Business is offering a similar limited-time bonus, although you'll get cash back rather than miles, so you can't transfer them to airline partners. For a limited time, you'll get $500 after spending $5,000 in the first three months, and an additional $1,500 after spending $50,000 in the first six months.\n\nRead more: Dining rewards are on the rise in 2018 as credit card issuers like Capital One and AmEx target foodies\n\nRemember, it isn't worth spending more than you would otherwise spend to earn the bonus, and it definitely isn't worth carrying debt in order to earn rewards. However, with the holiday season coming up, and people budgeting for holiday spending anyway, this could be a great time to open the Venture. And if you have a business that spends a lot of money \u2014 for instance, fronting expenses that are billed to clients, or purchasing supplies \u2014 the bonus requirements for the Spark Miles could be easy to hit.\n\nAs always, keep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Jason Guerrasio", "title": "Sylvester Stallone wanted Apollo Creed to appear as a ghost in 'Creed 2' \u2014 here's why it didn't happen", "description": "Sylvester Stallone wanted to show the ghost of Apollo Creed in one scene of \"Creed II.\" But director Steven Caple Jr. didn't know how to pull it off in a way that would work with the tone of the movie.

He admitted that he even wondered if there was a clever way to get Mr. T (who was in \"Rocky III\") in \"Creed II.\" But when it was time to lock picture, the best way to celebrate the myth of Apollo Creed was through pictures and old \"Rocky IV\" footage.\n\nBut you can't say Caple didn't try.\n\n\"Creed II\" opens in theaters on Wednesday."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alexandra Appolonia and Rob Ludacer, Business Insider", "title": "Why NASA blasts half a million gallons of water during rocket launches - Business Insider UK", "description": "Business Insider UK Why NASA blasts half a million gallons of water during rocket launches Business Insider UK NASA blasted almost half a million gallons of water a hundred feet into the air.

The system also prevents the giant flames generated by the engines from catching anything on fire.\n\nDuring an actual launch, some of the water will evaporate due to the extreme heat, while the rest exits through nozzles. This test is just one of many more that NASA will conduct over the coming months in preparation for the rocket's first launch.\n\nThe SLS is designed for deeper space missions able to explore far beyond Earth's orbit. It can carry astronauts in an Orion capsule, or ferry other cargo, like exploratory robots, to distant worlds like Jupiter and Mars. Pretty impressive, huh?\n\nThis latest test, performed in the beginning of October, was to evaluate any needed upgrades, like corrosion control, renovating the water storage tank, and checking the conditions of the pipes and valves.

This not only protects the ground from the rocket's engines it also prevents the sound waves from bouncing off the ground and back up which could cause catastrophic damage to the engines. The system also prevents the giant flames generated by the engines from catching anything on fire.\n\nDuring an actual launch, some of the water will evaporate due to the extreme heat, while the rest exits through nozzles. This test is just one of many more that NASA will conduct over the coming months in preparation for the rocket's first launch.\n\nThe SLS is designed for deeper space missions able to explore far beyond Earth's orbit. It can carry astronauts in an Orion capsule, or ferry other cargo, like exploratory robots, to distant worlds like Jupiter and Mars. Pretty impressive, huh?\n\nThis latest test, performed in the beginning of October, was to evaluate any needed upgrades, like corrosion control, renovating the water storage tank, and checking the conditions of the pipes and valves. Now, it will be in tip-top shape for when the SLS is ready to make its debut flight in 2020."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Dennis Green", "title": "More than 60 malls across America will be closed on Thanksgiving.

She posted photos and videos of herself on cruises in the Caribbean, flying in private jets, posing next to her husband's expensive cars, and riding horses during visits to her $7 million ranch in Wyoming.\n\nBehind the scenes, Stidham took LuLaRoe's most successful sellers \u2014 called \"consultants\" \u2014 on shopping trips to Versace and Gucci stores. She told them to \"buy nice cars, buy big houses, and show people what it can be like if we're successful,\" according to one recent LuLaRoe consultant who attended the shopping trips.\n\nSources told Business Insider that they understood her social-media posts and advice to LuLaRoe's top leaders as conveying an implicit promise to the company's army of consultants: Invest enough in LuLaRoe, and DeAnne's lifestyle could be yours, too.\n\nFor some consultants, the money came. A few earned upwards of $80,000 a month.\n\n\"It's actually been pretty awesome,\" said LuLaRoe consultant Jamie Harrington. \"We've sold a lot of clothes. We've done everything we've set out to do.\"\n\nThousands of others reached deep, sometimes into debt, in hopes of achieving the same rewards. These people directly fund the company.

Facebook/LuLaRoe\n\nBeth Mason, of Colliers, West Virginia, has an entire spare bedroom in her home filled with LuLaRoe clothing she can't sell.\n\nWhen her sister unexpectedly died, in July, Mason decided to exit the LuLaRoe business and return the clothes to get some of her money back. For over a month, Mason said, the LuLaRoe site that processes inventory returns was down, preventing her from returning the clothes, before becoming operative again last week. She believes LuLaRoe owes her $4,500.\n\nIf other consultants' experience is any indication, Mason might have to wait months to get a refund after she returns the clothes.\n\nRead more: LuLaRoe's CEO tearfully addresses inventory problems in leaked audio\n\nHundreds of LuLaRoe sellers have said they've been waiting months, some more than a year, for refund checks after exiting the business. Now, speculation is swirling among these sellers that the cause of the refund delays is simply that LuLaRoe does not have the money to pay back the tens of thousands of people who have recently left the business, according to discussions among current and former consultants in private online forums with several thousand members.\n\nA Business Insider investigation involving interviews with more than two-dozen current and former consultants in the past two months has revealed evidence that suggests LuLaRoe's business is in peril.\n\nLuLaRoe founders DeAnne and Mark Stidham address hundreds of sellers at a convention held on a cruise ship. Facebook/LuLaRoe\n\nThe privately held company releases little information about its operations, but a top LuLaRoe leader told us that she knew of two teams of sellers that had shrunk by roughly two-thirds from their peak. She estimated that LuLaRoe now has fewer than 25,000 consultants, down from the more than 77,000 it had in February 2017.\n\nAmong those fleeing are many of LuLaRoe's highest-performing consultants, which include its top 100 sellers and several dozen mentors who managed teams of thousands of women. About one-third of these top performers \u2014 some of whom were earning upwards of $80,000 monthly at the peak of their business \u2014 have exited LuLaRoe since July, according to data we reviewed.\n\nMeanwhile, LuLaRoe said in a filing with the state of California that it had laid off 127 people from one of its two distribution centers in June. Sources claim the company is overdue on payments to suppliers. And, according to an Experian report, the company has several bills past due, including a $1,700 manufacturing payment that's more than 91 days late.\n\nThe company also lost its head of design and production, Patrick Winget, in September, and it's facing mounting complaints about out-of-stock problems and quality issues with its clothing. The exodus of sellers and the volume of inventory returns are creating unprecedented internal tension, insiders said.\n\n\"They always advertise that they are a billion-dollar company,\" a recent high-ranking consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told Business Insider. \"Well, that billion dollars in goods they've sold, people don't want it. They are trying to return it all right now.\"\n\nIn an email involving four LuLaRoe executives, LuLaRoe's executive director of marketing and media declined a request to discuss this story verbally and asked to correspond via email, instead. The executives did not respond to four follow-up emails. Stidham and her husband, Mark, who is also LuLaRoe's CEO, also did not respond to emails from Business Insider. The company's chief marketing officer was unreachable by phone, as his voice mailbox was full.\n\nLuLaRoe became a $2.3 billion business in less than 5 years, promising 'full-time income for part-time work'\n\nDeAnne Stidham has at times addressed consultants directly through impassioned appearances at company events. Facebook/LuLaRoe\n\nLuLaRoe began with Deanne Stidham and her sisters sewing maxi skirts around her kitchen table for her daughter's friends. Stidham and her husband, Mark, turned the hobby into a business in 2013. They produced limited quantities of brightly patterned clothing and sold it at wholesale prices, sight-unseen, to sellers, called consultants, who turned around and sold it to friends and family.\n\nThe company's comfortable, stretchy clothing and recruitment promise of \"full-time income\" for \"part-time work\" appealed particularly to three main contingencies of women: stay-at-home moms, single women, and people with both mental and physical disabilities, many of whom had limited mobility, recent and former consultants told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nInitially, most sales were conducted at pop-up parties in people's homes. Then sellers realized how many more people they could reach on Facebook, and they started selling the clothing online.\n\nSuddenly, there was a lot of money to be made selling LuLaRoe. Some successful sellers and team leaders started advertising on social media that they were earning five-figure bonus checks on a monthly basis selling LuLaRoe, and interest in the company skyrocketed.\n\nIn late 2016, LuLaRoe was onboarding thousands of new consultants \u2014 mostly women \u2014 every month, according to data obtained by Business Insider. To start their businesses, these women invested upwards of $5,000 in inventory.\n\nAs LuLaRoe's top leaders, called mentors, aggressively recruited new sellers, they encouraged them to buy as much inventory as possible, former consultants said. Those leaders were incentivized to do this because for years their bonus checks were based in part on how much their teams bought wholesale from LuLaRoe. (This bonus structure was later changed. A standard created by case law in the 1970s, known as the Koscot standard, considers whether a multilevel-marketing company bases compensation on inventory purchased versus items sold as part of its analysis of whether it has an unlawful compensation structure.)\n\nEvery year LuLaRoe trains and rallies sellers at massive, elaborately planned conventions. Facebook/LuLaRoe\n\nIf sellers didn't have the money to buy more inventory, LuLaRoe leaders in some cases encouraged them to take out loans and credit cards for their LuLaRoe businesses, current and former consultants said.\n\n\"Mentors encouraged people to take out second mortgages; mentors encouraged people to cash out their 401(k)s or take loans out on their 401(k)s; mentors encouraged women to sell their breast milk, and then buy everything on low-interest credit cards,\" RJ Franks, a former consultant, said.\n\nSeveral women said they followed leaders' instructions to rapidly expand their inventories, and they poured money into buying hundreds of LuLaRoe leggings, dresses, and T-shirts. This helped fuel remarkable growth for LuLaRoe.\n\n\"They really drove retailers to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy as much as you can,\" Merilisse Beyelia, a stay-at-home mother to two disabled children, said. \"They said you can take out a personal loan, and you can put it on credit cards. So I did that.\"\n\nBI Graphics/Shayanne Gal\n\nIn 2017, just four years after it was founded, the company said it generated $2.3 billion in sales.\n\nThen came LuLaRoe's first major public stumble.\n\nLuLaRoe stumbled when customers complained about pants that 'rip like wet toilet paper'\n\nA 2017 Business Insider report revealed widespread quality complaints about its clothing, including claims that its pants develop holes quickly and \"rip like wet toilet paper.\" After that report LuLaRoe launched a refund program for customers that was intended to make it easier for customers to get refunds, credits, or exchanges for purchases.\n\nSuddenly, the company was stuck with damaged inventory it couldn't sell, sources said. About the same time a growing number of consultants started complaining that they couldn't even sell the undamaged clothing that LuLaRoe was sending them because the patterns were undesirable and customers were losing interest.\n\n\"I kept getting horrible stuff from the warehouse \u2026 and the quality started tanking,\" said Emily Wright, a stay-at-home-mom and military wife who decided in October to close her LuLaRoe business after sinking more than $11,000 of her family's savings into it. \"It's hard to sell something to someone when you know it could fall apart after one washing.\"\n\nSeveral consultants claimed they received items with issues, such as uneven hems, one armhole higher than the other, ripped-open seams, and visible mold on the clothing.\n\n\"It made my entire room smell \u2014 it was disgusting,\" said one former consultant, who asked to be identified only by her initials, K.W. \"I was trying to Febreze the clothes before selling them.\"\n\nSavanah Quirion, another former consultant, said she wanted to quit selling LuLaRoe for months but felt pressured by her \"sponsor\" \u2014 another consultant who trained her \u2014 to press on.\n\n\"I could never get ahold of anything that was going to sell,\" Quirion said. \"I was getting these awful ugly prints that were impossible to unload. All throughout this, all I kept hearing from the company was buy more stuff ... just buy more stuff ... you'll have more luck and be fine.\" Following the advice of her sponsor, she tried to take out a loan to fund more clothing, but the bank denied her. She ended up getting a loan from a friend.\n\nFormer LuLaRoe consultant Emily Wright said several rooms in her home are filled with LuLaRoe clothing she couldn't sell. Business Insider\n\nUltimately, thousands of consultants began fleeing the business. As they sent their unsold inventory back to LuLaRoe for a refund, the company's cache of unsold inventory and debt in the form of unpaid refunds ballooned.\n\nIn late 2017, LuLaRoe changed its 100% buyback policy. The policy said the company would provide sellers leaving the business with a 100% refund for all their unsold inventory. Some sellers who spoke with Business Insider cited this guarantee as a key reason why they took a chance on joining LuLaRoe.\n\nLuLaRoe's new buyback policy, the company said, would apply only to inventory purchased within the previous 12 months, and LuLaRoe would refund just 90% of the wholesale value of those goods.\n\nMany consultants were furious about the change, according to Derryl Trujillo, who spent more than a year working in LuLaRoe's corporate offices. The company's service department was \"bombarded\" with calls from women planning to go out of business as well as those who had already jumped ship and were waiting on refunds, he said.\n\nTrujillo said he spent many hours in the company's service department taking calls from women pleading for money they were owed by LuLaRoe. The company's top brass wouldn't give him any answers as to why the refunds were delayed for months on end, he added.\n\nBI Graphics/Shayanne Gal\n\n\"There was one call in particular \u2014 after string of 20 in a row \u2014 that made me sick to my stomach,\" Trujillo said. A woman on the line was begging for the refund because she needed to make a mortgage payment.\n\n\"I logged out of the system, ran to the fourth-floor bathroom, and locked myself in a stall for 15 minutes,\" he said. \"I resolved never to come back there again.\"\n\nAround this time, lawsuits started piling up against LuLaRoe, attacking its business practices and accusing the company of copyright infringement for the patterns displayed on its clothing. Two copyright suits have been settled; three others remain open. One suit, which accused LuLaRoe of being a pyramid scheme, is in arbitration.\n\nConsultants started struggling to sell LuLaRoe clothing, which led to an emergency meeting and a call about 'horrific' clothing\n\nLuLaRoe's top performers were summoned to Phoenix for an emergency meeting in the summer of 2016. They had 48 hours to get there.\n\nAt the meeting, LuLaRoe's founders, DeAnne and Mark Stidham, said they were seeing signs of a slowdown in profitability among new consultants.\n\n\"They told us that they are watching the classes of people that sign up every month, and people were becoming profitable less quickly,\" said one person who attended the meeting. The Stidhams asked for input on what was going on, and wanted to brainstorm ways to improve profitability.\n\nAlmost exactly two years later, in August 2018, the profitability problems had infiltrated even top sellers, and the issue had reached a boiling point.\n\nMark Stidham had a call with the company's highest-performing sellers, and it turned contentious.\n\nStidham told sellers to \"charity out\" prints that wouldn't sell \u2014 in other words, they should give them away free or at a discount. Three sellers described Stidham as \"yelling\" on the call.\n\n\"So we pay full price to you but have to donate and discount?\" one seller asked in a live online chat with others on the call, according to a transcript of the discussion reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nBI Graphics/Shayanne Gal\n\nSome sellers called the clothing prints \"horrific\" and \"ugly\" and said business was in \"decline\" and \"getting worse and worse.\"\n\n\"Our teams are leaving,\" one person said. \"They can't keep taking hit after hit.\"\n\nAnother added: \"We are being blunt because we are truly concerned. We care, our lives our built on this company. And we are scared. Truly worried and these answers are a slap in the face.\"\n\nOver the next several months, several of the people on the call quit the business.\n\nLuLaRoe's founder has been accused of 'flaunting her wealth in the faces of the people in the bread line'\n\n\"Don't hang on to your money,\" Stidham said in a video in August. Facebook/LuLaRoe\n\nAs the company's top performers flee in droves, LuLaRoe founder DeAnne Stidham has insisted publicly at meetings with consultants and in Instagram live videos that everything is fine. She urges sellers to trust her and to buy more goods, according to several hours of recordings viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Don't hang on to your money,\" she said in a video in August that encouraged people to buy more inventory and promised \"exciting\" things to come.\n\nStidham has made vague promises about new products in the pipeline in response to sellers' concerns about inventory shortages.\n\n\"There's some new things coming,\" she said in late October. \"We just saw a great big thing. Everybody's so excited.\"\n\nIn the same video, she chalked up the speculation surrounding LuLaRoe's business to the work of \"trolls.\"\n\n\"We all get hit by the trolls and you know what, we're going to stop it,\" she said.\n\nOne person close to Stidham accused her of being out of touch.\n\n\"DeAnne is Marie Antoinette telling people to eat cake. Right now she is on a cruise, flaunting her wealth in the faces of the people in the bread line,\" the person said, referring to a recent video that Stidham had posted from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts.\n\nA lawsuit filed against the company last year, which is in arbitration, alleged that, with LuLaRoe's riches, DeAnne and her husband, Mark, have \"lavished themselves with millions of dollars in luxuries such as expensive international vacations and exotic supercars.\"\n\nAttorneys representing the Stidhams denied the allegations, writing, \"LLR's success is built on tremendous demand by the consumers who buy its products.\"\n\nMark Stidham owns a collection of expensive cars, including a rare Koenigsegg Agera RS, which, in 2017, set a record to become the world's fastest car. It is estimated to cost more than $2 million, according to the suit. Stidham has displayed his cars at company events, according to former consultants.\n\n\"Mark would line up his luxury cars on the premises where they were having conferences, for people to see and gawk at,\" said a former consultant who asked to be identified only by her initials, E.M.\n\nMark Stidham owns a collection of expensive cars, including a rare Koenigsegg estimated to be worth $2 million. YouTube/Car Throttle\n\nThe couple also frequently travels in a private Gulfstream G550 jet and owns a sprawling 250-acre ranch near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, estimated to be worth more than $7 million.\n\nHigh-ranking LuLaRoe leaders were encouraged to show off their wealth on social media with the hashtag #becauseoflularoe. The strategy worked, according to several consultants.\n\n\"All the little fish would follow the big sellers like they were celebrities,\" E.M. said. These top sellers showed off their \"lavish lifestyles\" involving frequent vacations, personal assistants, and new homes, primarily on Facebook and Instagram, she said.\n\nQuirion said she felt convinced by this display.\n\n\"We listened to the consultants who were so successful, that they were going on vacations with their kids every other month,\" she said. \"They just kept saying to us if your don't like your inventory, buy more to change it up and you can sell that.\"\n\nNow consultants are worried they may never get their refunds\n\nMeanwhile, former consultants like Mason say they are growing increasingly worried that they may never see their refunds.\n\n\"I'm terrified there's a possibility that they could [go] bankrupt and I don't get my money,\" Mason said.\n\nLuLaRoe said in a statement after the publication of this story that it has a \"comprehensive and efficient system in place\" to manage the process of consultants cancelling their contracts. \"We remain committed to making the process as seamless and efficient as possible,\" the company said.\n\nAccording to sources, dozens of consultants are giving up on seeking refunds from LuLaRoe and trying to sell their goods to consignment shops and liquidators at steep discounts.\n\n\"We lost our life savings,\" said former consultant Amy Lyrio-Takis. \"I am in the hospital with a broken hip and had to have my children buy the medical equipment needed for my discharge.\"\n\nAnother consultant, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Saskia, said she's $20,000 in debt after quitting selling LuLaRoe.\n\n\"My mistake was I listened to everybody,\" she said. \"They kept telling you if you buy more you sell more.\"\n\nAt least 70 people associated with LuLaRoe have filed for personal bankruptcy in the past two years, according to court filings. Jill Domme is one of them. In April 2017 she bought a brand-new Toyota RAV4 with the money she was making selling LuLaRoe.

But, refusing permission on Tuesday, the court said the Court of Session's ruling was \"preliminary\" which means it would still have to reach a judgement after the ECJ has issued guidance.\n\nA statement released by the Supreme Court said: \"It is clear that this interlocutor did not constitute a final judgment.\"\n\n\"As both this court and the CJEU have made clear, the preliminary ruling is merely a step in the proceedings pending before the national court \u2014 It is that court which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision,\" it said.\n\nThe case was initially brought by a cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians including Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP, and lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law project.\n\nAfter Tuesday's hearing, Maugham tweeted: \"No government acting in the public interest could spend money blinding the eyes of MPs to the options before them.\"\n\n'All just a bad dream'?\n\nREUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe court case argues that Article 50, which triggered the UK's EU withdrawal process in March 2017, can be revoked without the agreement of the other 27 European member states.\n\nHanding May's government the unilateral power to reverse Article 50 would allow the UK to retain the perks of its current membership including the economic rebate that Margaret Thatcher negotiated in 1984 and the UK's opt-out from the Euro. These would potentially be lost were Britain forced to seek the approval of the rest of the EU to reverse Brexit.\n\nGunther Oettinger, the EU's Budget Commissioner has previously stated that under those circumstances \"the gradual exit from the rebate would still be kept.\"\n\nJolyon Maugham told BI in October that having the power to unilaterally reverse Brexit \"sweetens the option of remaining\" for the UK government.\n\n\"Plainly it is better for the country if we can unilaterally revoke the Article 50 notice,\" Maugham added. \"In that circumstance, we know that we could treat Brexit as though it was all just a bad dream.\"\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, has previously said that the EU27 would need to provide their consent to reverse the Brexit process. In that scenario, should the government seek in future to remain in the EU, it could lose the perks of membership it currently enjoys.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether approval from other countries is required for a country to cancel the process because Article 50 has only been triggered once and the process has never been tested in court.\n\nLawyers who argued that the matter is \"hypothetical\" because the government does not intend revoke Article 50 were overruled by Scotland's highest judge in June, who said it was \"neither academic nor premature\" to ask whether it was legally competent to revoke the notice. That means has now been fast-tracked from a Scottish court to the European Court of Justice, where it is expected to be settled in as little as six weeks.\n\nLegal opinion is split on the subject of whether the case will be successful. Those arguing against the viability of the case say handing member states the right to withdraw would undermine the integrity of the two-year notice period which defines Article 50.\n\nHowever, Maugham said he believed the case still has a good prospect of succeeding.\n\n\"It's absolutely fair to say that legal opinion is divided on the matter,\" Maugham told Business Insider. \"I genuinely don't know which way the court will jump.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the Union said that it was considering the decision and added that it was \"committed to implementing the result of the referendum.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Alex Lockie", "title": "Judge shoots down Trump's asylum ban, clearing the way for the migrant caravan", "description": "President Donald Trump's November 9 proclamation restricting asylum for immigrants who cross the border into the US illegally has been shot down by a US District Judge in San Francisco.

As an extension of that, Greenblatt is focused on attractively priced stocks that also have viable underlying businesses. His so-called formula equates to value plus quality.\n\n\"Buffett is looking for companies that generate high returns on tangible capital,\" Greenblatt told Business Insider in a recent interview. \"If you combine that with buying a cheap version of a company that's providing a high return on tangible capital, that's a crude version of Buffett's approach \u2014 cheap and good businesses.\"\n\nHe continued: \"At Gotham, we're doing that on steroids. While the principles are the same, we are actually valuing businesses. We look at every financial statement.\"\n\nWe are actually valuing businesses. We look at every financial statement.\n\nTo further quantify Greenblatt's commitment to the cause, consider that Gotham employs 38 people, 20 of whom are focused on research. That's a formidable backbone of manpower dedicated to building upon Buffett's core methods.\n\nAnd going off past results, Greenblatt's enhanced approach to the Buffett method seems to be working. The Gotham Index Plus, which is the firm's flagship fund, has generated a 16% return over the past three years, putting it in the 99th percentile relative to peers, according to Bloomberg data. On a trailing one-year basis, the fund is up 15%, putting it in the 97th percentile.\n\nA deeper dive on Greenblatt's methodology\n\nThere are three additional wrinkles to Greenblatt's methodology that have helped make his investing strategy a market-dominating force.\n\nThe first is the way he constructs his portfolio, which has both long and short portions. For every dollar that's invested in the Gotham fund, Greenblatt does the following:\n\nUses that $1 to buy the stocks underlying the S&P 500, at the index's set weighting\n\nPuts an additional 90 cents in his favorite S&P 500 stocks \u2014 the cheapest ones, in terms of trading at a discount to fair value\n\nSells short 90 cents' worth of stocks that are the most expensive, based on those same terms\n\nWith a portfolio set up like this, when Gotham's longs beat their shorts, the firm is able to add that additional return to what the index has generated. Clearly it has succeeded in doing so over the past few years.\n\n\"On average, we want to buy cheap companies that are doing well, and short expensive companies,\" Greenblatt explained.\n\nThe second prong of Greenblatt's core methodology is the way he looks at investing overall. Greenblatt is largely focused on the amount of cash generated, rather than the simple price level, which immediately differentiates him from more traditional value investors.\n\n\"When you're buying a business, you're looking at cash flows, not whether a business is trading at low valuations relative to history,\" he told Business Insider. \"We're just valuing the business and buying at a discount.\"\n\nThird, Greenblatt doesn't just pick a single stock to serve as his bellwether for an investment theme. If he sees something he likes, he buys stakes in numerous other companies that share similar attributes. He then simultaneously shorts handfuls of stocks that don't strike his fancy.\n\nWe own a bucket of Apples, and we're short a bucket of Teslas.\n\nAs he's doing this, Greenblatt is keen to weed out stocks whose prices aren't supportive of their current cash flows. That means betting against companies like Tesla, whose lofty valuations are based on their predicted cash flow several years down the line.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's opposed to all high-flying tech names. In the end, all that matters is cash flow. Some cash-rich companies \u2014 like Apple \u2014 are still enticing when viewed through those terms, even if they might look expensive to the novice observer.\n\nGreenblatt sums it up succinctly: \"We own a bucket of Apples, and we're short a bucket of Teslas.\"\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nThe elephant in the room when discussing the future for any investment firm \u2014 or strategy \u2014 is that the landscape as we know it seems to be warping into something unrecognizable.\n\nOne of the bull market's most tried and true trades has stopped working, volatility is spiking, and the playing field feels flipped upside down.\n\nBut Gotham appears uniquely positioned to withstand these topsy-turvy conditions. Greenblatt notes that the worst type of environment for his strategy is a \"hopeful\" market that keeps pushing prices higher for speculative stocks not supported by cash flows.\n\nConsidering many Wall Street experts characterized the stock market's performance throughout much of 2018 as a euphoria-based \"melt up\" of sorts, it's a small wonder that Greenblatt's fund is still in the 99th percentile over a long period.\n\nNow that the tone of the market appears to be shifting more defensive, with investors rotating out of expensive winners and into cheaper laggards, it should play right into Gotham's hands.\n\n\"We believe we'll be much more insulated, because we're long-short investors,\" Greenblatt said. \"Our longs will tend to hold up better because we didn't pay up for them. On the short side, we're short companies with super-high expectations. When they come down a little bit, those companies get crushed. That combination should really be helpful for our strategy.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Akin Oyedele", "title": "A $736 billion strategist is bracing for a 2019 stock-market meltdown worse than anything we've seen this year \u2014 here are his top 3 tips for profiting from it", "description": "Stock-market volatility is set to continue in the new year and could trigger a correction steeper than any we've seen this year, said Andrew Milligan, the head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

Stocks took off late in the year and into January before giving way to a sharp correction the following month. And just after the S&P 500 achieved record highs in September, it rolled over once again.\n\nAndrew Milligan, the head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is gearing up for a new year that's just as volatile as the old. In fact, the strategist at the UK-based $736 billion asset manager foresees a 5% to 15% global-market correction next year. Peak to trough, neither the S&P 500 nor the iShares MSCI All Country World Index has fallen by much more than 10% in 2018.\n\nAt the very least, the ongoing slump in markets shows that investors are pricing in risks that could materialize in a potent way next year. It's a robust list that includes higher interest rates, slower earnings growth, lofty valuations among growth stocks, the US-China trade dispute, fading fiscal stimulus, and the aging of the US economic cycle.\n\nThere's a silver lining to all this, according to Milligan. \"Barring a major shock, share prices will eventually recover as the outlook for company profits remains positive, even if margins are coming under pressure,\" he said.\n\nIn the interim, investors need to position themselves for a bumpy season in markets. In commentary shared exclusively with Business Insider, Milligan offered three ways investors could ride out the wave and even profit from it.\n\n1. Start putting cash to work\n\nCash has earned something of a bad reputation during this nine-year-plus bull market, as riskier assets like stocks and corporate credit offered more bountiful returns.\n\nBut with risk-free interest rates on the rise, the asset class is now a serious consideration for investors who are looking for downside protection.\n\nMilligan recommends that investors use cash as a portfolio stabilizer that lets them buy strong, cheaper assets when sell-offs create the opportunity.\n\nOf course, it's also key to identify underlying growth triggers that would propel such stocks higher. These include companies that benefit from healthy cash flows that can be put to work through capital spending.\n\n2. Squeeze more juice out of risk assets\n\nMilligan, who works at the UK's largest active manager, says that stock picking will be more critical for investors going forward.\n\nThat's because higher valuations equally increase the risk that many companies become disconnected from their earnings growth. Indeed, concerns about peak earnings \u2014 induced in part by company guidance during the third-quarter earnings season\u2014 have been a key driver of the ongoing tech-led sell-off.\n\nStock picking also helps investors profit from big winners and avoid big losers in a way that's not easily achievable with passive strategies.\n\n3. Diversify for less correlated returns\n\nOne outcome of the ongoing sell-off has been a breakdown in the historical relationship between stocks and bonds.\n\nTreasurys typically benefit (and their yields fall) as a safe haven when stocks are falling. But the ongoing turmoil hit both asset classes and turned the correlation between stocks and bond yields negative\u2014 an occurrence that has been rare during the past 20 years, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"The current higher correlations between equity and bond markets are making a traditional balanced strategy riskier than usual,\" Milligan said.\n\n\"Genuine diversification across wider asset classes will smooth out volatility in a portfolio and offset some of the risks. For example, a mixture of diversified equities, emerging market debt, US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and European real estate will provide some ballast to portfolios.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Thomas Colson", "title": "Theresa May to finalise Brexit deal in talks with EU", "description": "LONDON \u2014 Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as she attempts to wrap up the final details of her proposed Brexit deal.

If the meatier parts of that job might have to wait until 2022, would someone in that position want to hang around?\"\n\nIn October, Crawford told The Telegraph that his job would be redundant if the UK remained in a customs union with the EU after completing its departure from the bloc.\n\nUnder the draft Withdrawal Agreement, the UK will stay in the customs union for a transition period lasting at least 21-months and remain tied to EU customs rules until a UK-EU trade deal which preserves the frictionless Irish border is ready to be implemented. Figures involved in negotiations believe could take several years.\n\nA report earlier this year suggested that Falconer, who is described by insiders as \"highly opinionated,\" had his role in Brexit talks \"marginalised\" by Downing Street. Before joining DIT, he was Special Trade Commissioner for the Legatum Institute think tank and held roles in international trade including New Zealand's Chief Negotiator.\n\nInsiders at the department told BI that Falconer has been close to resigning \"several times\" this year, including when May revealed her plan for a \"common rule book\" with the European Union as part of her Chequers proposals.\n\nFalconer is angry with the prime minister's decision to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU during the transition period and potentially beyond, as it will limit DIT's ability to sign new trade deals, insiders claim.\n\n\"He certainly isn't doing the role for the pay,\" a friend of Crawford told BI.\n\n\"He took it up because there aren't many opportunities to set up an independent trade policy for a western country. If we're stuck in the Customs Union and forced to follow EU regulations, his role is basically superfluous.\"\n\nA source close to Falconer stressed that the UK will be able to implement trade deals in services and investment once the transition period is over. However, the UK will be limited in other areas as long as it remains tied to EU rules.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox.

At the start of November, with US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping injecting a little optimism into a bilateral relationship that's been at its lowest ebb in decades, unfortunately it now seems resolving US-China trade differences ahead of a possible face-to-face at the G20 meeting in Argentina looks pretty distant. The weekend's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Port Moresby was one of open hostility, bilateral acrimony, and big-brother posturing over which giant would make the stronger regional partner. The ill will spilled over into what was now a historic APEC summit for all the wrong reasons. The annual meeting, this year held in the New Guinean capital of Port Moresby, ended in disarray and a little chaos when a belligerent contest between the two dominant powers ensured that, for the first time, there was no consensus communiqu\u00e9 for the 21 national leaders to walk away with. That failure was \"by no means accidental,\" the Chinese government foreign ministry spokesman Wang Yi said in his weekly comments posted on the foreign ministry's website. \"It is mainly that individual economies insisted on imposing their own texts on other parties, excusing protectionism and unilateralism, and not accepting reasonable revisions from the Chinese and other parties,\" Wang said, in a reference to the US and the disintegration that was APEC's final hours. Not only could leaders not meet at a consensus \u00adposition for the first time in a quarter of a century, but Peter O'Neill, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, was bundled out of the summit in a media scrum and Chinese officials were accused of pressuring the country's foreign minister and breaking into his office. It is the first time since 1993 that a leaders' communiqu\u00e9 has not been issued after the annual APEC meeting.

SAEED KHAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nO'Neill referenced \"the two big \u00adgiants in the room\" when asked why the closing communiqu\u00e9 was not drawn up, amid chaotic scenes.\n\nThe unusually tense gathering of Pacific nation leaders in Port Moresby fell into disarray after speeches from Chinese President Xi Jinping and US Vice President Mike Pence, fell into tit-for-tat rhetoric and criticism of their chosen paths to regional leadership.\n\nThe simmering tension between the power rivals boiled over after Papua New Guinea were presented with a set of significant pledges from the major competing blocs.\n\nA day after Pence accused China of seeking to \"drown our partners in a sea of debt,\" the two regional giants imported their trade war into APEC, refusing to cede even a few disputed paragraphs in the proposed APEC communiqu\u00e9, according to a report in The Australian published on Monday.\n\nIt is understood China refused to agree to US calls for changes to world trading rules targeting predatory economic conduct and demanding state-owned enterprises be forced to compete on \"a level playing field\" with private businesses.\n\nNo surprises where these changes were aimed.\n\nAnd perhaps no surprises when Chinese officials were reportedly kicked out of PNG Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato's office by security a few hours later as they sought to secure their own changes to the communiqu\u00e9.\n\nBut the problems really started from the outset, and merely reached a crescendo when Xi and Pence gave subsequent addresses on Saturday night.\n\nXi you in Port Moresby\n\nThe Chinese President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, speaking at the APEC CEO Summit, November 17, 2018 in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.

FAZRY ISMAIL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA strategic slumber\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional Pacific powers appear to have awoken from their geostrategic slumber to a new day in the Pacific, full of challenges presented by what they characterize as China's territorial ambitions, couched in rich infrastructure promises through Xi's \"Belt and Road Initiative.\"\n\nAfter five years of touting, billions of dollars of investment, and a series of names that failed to articulate its exact purpose, the still uncertain Belt and Road initiative (One Belt, One Road or OBOR) is China's quasi-interconnected network of land and sea links that purport to open up a trade corridor and at the least seed Chinese influence through Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\n\nChina's expansive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 play to gain friends, partners and customers in the resource-rich Pacific states like New Guinea have been causing a rising angst among the formerly influential powers in the region.\n\nAustralia is a former colonial power here, as its closest military ally, the US, while there has been some newfound and welcome ballast from Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe met with the leaders of Australia and New Zealand in the days leading up to the summit, while Pence was in Japan last week as Japan tightens its regional bonds, while China becomes more assertive in the Pacific and the contested South China Seas.\n\nCritics have suggested that while Western countries are bound to particular standards when it comes to aid, the Chinese state-led investments and loans have been galvanizing corrupt practices and leveraging so-called \"debt-trap diplomacy.\"\n\nFor security reasons, Pence originally planned to fly in and out of New Guinea by way of Cairns, in Australia.\n\nBut following the rapid-fire diplomacy on display from Beijing, the vice president decided at the last moment to stay in Port Moresby, perhaps with Xi's dominant performance weighing on minds in Washington.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks during an informal press conference at APEC Haus in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018. AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nA 'one-way' road\n\nCertainly, when Pence got up to deliver his address, minutes after Xi, on Saturday, he spoke his mind on the behaviors of a rising China in the region.\n\nPence set out in blunt terms what he saw as the two stark choices facing Pacific nations caught between China and the Western bloc.\n\nHe warned these nations of the dangers of being seduced by the easy money of China, describing a Beijing that offers struggling Pacific nations \"opaque\" loans with strings attached.\n\nChina, he warned, is happy to create a \"staggering debt burden.\"\n\nIn a sign of how much Chinese and US relations have deteriorated, the vice president appeared to openly mock president Xi's signature foreign policy in front of a blank Chinese delegation, suggesting the belt was \"constricting\" and the road was \"one-way.\"\n\nFor good measure, Pence drew on President Donald Trump, when he accused China of having \"taken advantage of the United States for many, many years,\" adding: \"those days are over.\"\n\nThat speech was reportedly met with stony silence from the Chinese delegation, particularly because Xi's star had reached its APEC apex moments earlier when he assured the gathering of regional heads that his One Belt, One Road strategy was obviously not a debt trap.\n\nAny final agreement on a joint communiqu\u00e9 was done and dusted when the US sought clauses on China's predatory trade conduct and demanded China's state-owned enterprises compete on a level with other private businesses.\n\nPower play\n\nBefore the summit burst into the latest live battlefront in the ongoing trade war between the US and China, O'Neill announced that PNG \"invited\" Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the US to work together on the goal of connecting 70% of its population to electricity by 2030.\n\nThe move represents, along with Australian and US participation in the development of the Lombrum naval base at Manus Island port, a key staging facility as part of the counter play offered by the Western bloc.\n\nRight now, only about 13% of Papua New Guinea's population has any reliable access to electricity. Rolling out power promises to directly raise the living standards of communities in cities, towns, and remote villages \u2014 and is commonly a precursor for the growth of the private sector and industry.\n\nFor its part, Australia is focusing anew on the Pacific after once again being caught between its strongest ally and its biggest trading partner.\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a press conference on Monday that the \"APEC family\" remains committed to working together, despite the US and China spat.\n\n\"If the major powers here are not going to agree, we shouldn't be pretending that they do. And we shouldn't be trying to smooth that over for the sake of a communiqu\u00e9, and we should call that out.\"\n\nHowever, he said there were many areas of agreement, such as the need to improve digital connectedness and the benefits of dropping trade barriers.\n\n\"We are all still absolutely committed to stronger trading outcomes because we understand that here in the APEC family we have been able to reduce tariffs,\" Morrison said in a pointed reference to what is not happening between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nDonald Trump and Xi Jinping. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nNo reason for optimism\n\nChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying reserved a few words of advice for the US ahead of Xi and Trump's showdown in Buenos Aires where the 2018 G20 Summit will be held.\n\n\"Our advice for the relevant country is that instead of pointing fingers at others, it would be better to match its deeds with its words and truly treat all countries, big or small, as equals, respect the right enjoyed by other countries to choose the development path in light of their national conditions and make substantial contributions to the development of developing countries.\"\n\nTrump and his Chinese counterpart are to meet at the G20 in Argentina, and hopes had been rising that the two might be able to seek some way to hit reverse on a trade war in which Xi has warned their will \"be no winners.\"\n\nTrump had recently been talking up his personal admiration for Xi and Tweeted a few weeks earlier of his optimism of an outcome heading into the G20.\n\nThat optimism may be dead in the warm Pacific waters as Xi now heads to Brunei and the Philippines with a newly appreciative sense of US regional opposition."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Will Martin", "title": "10 things you need to know in markets today", "description": "Good morning!

They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king's death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman's only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family's senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead the kingdom's tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\n(Saudi royal family: tmsnrt.rs/2OGPHTB)\n\nSenior US officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior US official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA's assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi's murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi's killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi's killing \"very premature\" but \"possible\", and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \"nothing else to add at this time\".\n\nThe Saudi sources said US officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \"focus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\" and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nUS role key\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to US sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed's rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi's security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \"would not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\" because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\"They (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\"\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \"roll some heads to appease the US.\"\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi's death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role - including one of MbS's closest aides.\n\nUS lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nAllegiance council\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman's wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi's killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away.

The ELN has engaged in peace talks with the Colombian government that have not gone anywhere; the group is believed to be growing in power and present in at least half of Venezuela's states, where it has attacked the military and civilians.\n\nCorruption and impunity in Venezuela have allowed criminal activity to flourish, with Colombian groups deeply involved and with Venezuelan officials actively participating.\n\nVenezuelans line the street at the border between Venezuela and Colombia, in Cucuta, Colombia, February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Eduardo Ramirez\n\nHowever, officials have said the links to Hezbollah and other terrorist groups may be overstated. \"The whole Hezbollah line has been distorted for political purposes by the more extreme elements of the US right wing,\" a former CIA senior official told Reuters earlier this year.\n\nAssessments of the potential impact of such a designation on Venezuela were mixed, according to officials who spoke with The Post.\n\nNaming Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism could interfere with efforts to support health programs in the country, though Trump could provide waivers to groups involved, William Brownsfield, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, told The Post.\n\nRead more: Mexican troops are in the streets to fight the drug war, and the country's defense chief says legalization may be 'a way out'\n\nDesignating Venezuela as a sponsor of terrorism could also complicate dealings with the US oil industry, which processes most of Venezuela's crude. (Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves.)\n\nThe designation may also further efforts to portray Venezuela as a threat to US national security, though applying it and further discussion of military action may be counterproductive to the goal of forcing Maduro out of power.\n\nSuch threats \"contribute to the unity and coherence of the Maduro government and undermine opposition organization and unity,\" David Smilde, a Venezuela expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, told The Post. \"Since President Trump first suggested a military option in August 2017 the Venezuelan opposition has fallen apart.\""}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Kevin Webb, provided by<br><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><img src=\"//imgs.sfgate.com/graphics/partners/businessinsider/article_header.gif\" border=\"0\"></a>", "title": "It looks like Amazon ended a deal for a new Echo Dot for $1 after only a few hours (AMZN) - CT Post", "description": "Avery Hartmans\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\u00a0was offering the newest version of the Echo Dot for $1 to new subscribers of Amazon Music Unlimited.\nThe deal lasted for a few hours, but appears to have been taken down after only a few hours: it was hugely popular while it lasted.\n\u2026", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/echo-dot-amazon-music-unlimited-deal-how-to-2018-11?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=allverticals", "urlToImage": "https://www.ctpost.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T02:22:58Z", "content": "Avery Hartmans If you've ever been interested in the Amazon Echo Dot, you may have missed the best chance to get the smart home speaker for just a fraction of the cost.

Our numbers will be commensurate with the capacities that DHS and CBP have requested.\"\n\nFor those not heading home, Thanksgiving dinner will be shipped to troops at the border.\n\nA CNN report published late Monday seemed to contradict the assertion that the border operation was beginning to wind down.

However, the troops sent ahead of the midterm elections included active-duty troops: \"three combat engineer battalions, members of the US Army Corps of Engineers and troops who specialize in aviation, medical treatment and logistics,\" according to The Washington Post.\n\nCritics called the mobilization of troops to the border a political stunt pulled before the midterm elections to rally the president's base.\n\nThe troops were mainly responsible for building barriers along the border including shipping containers and barbed wire. Thus far, roughly seven miles of wire have been placed at the border, according to Military.com. And the concertina wire mission has been completed in Texas, Stars and Stripes reported. The Pentagon said it does not have any clarity on the next step now that barrier emplacement has been completed.\n\nMigrants have begun to arrive in Tijuana, Mexico, and roughly 7,000 could end up there, according to KPBS.

But the window of opportunity for companies to grab a piece of it is closing fast.\n\nThat's the word from Goldman Sachs, which just released its quarterly report on the cloud market. The good news \u2014 according to the analysts Heather Bellini, Heath Terry, Piyush Mubayi, Caroline Liu, Mark Grant, and Ted Lin \u2014 is that the market for cloud services will continue to grow by at least 20% a year through 2021.\n\nThe bad news? A growing percentage of that spending will go to just four players: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba.\n\n\"We continue to expect that the public cloud landscape will consolidate into an oligopolistic market structure,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts said in the report.\n\nAmazon pioneered the cloud-computing market when it launched Amazon Web Services more than a decade ago. Though AWS has since grown into a multibillion-dollar behemoth, the overall market is still a nascent one, Goldman Sachs said in the report. Many companies still haven't shifted over to the cloud, and most enterprise spending is still on traditional services.\n\nThe core cloud-computing market is expanding rapidly\n\nThe analysts focused on the core cloud services \u2014 infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where companies such as Amazon offer computing processing power, and platform as a service (PaaS), where Microsoft and other companies offer a kind of cloud-based operating system on which people can build and run applications \u2014 as well as the non-cloud enterprise-tech services with which they directly compete.\n\nThe combined amount that companies spend on cloud services and on the non-cloud ones that are direct competitors represents the total potential market for cloud services.\n\nAs cloud spending expands, it does so in part by eating into money companies used to spend on such things as maintaining and running applications on their own servers.\n\nLast year, spending on cloud services accounted for about 8% of the total potential market. That should jump to about 15% by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated. In other words, a growing portion of corporate IT budgets is likely to go to the cloud.\n\n\"Our checks continue to suggest that we remain in the early innings of public cloud,\" the analysts said in their report.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nThat trend represents a big move in real dollars as well as percentages. Enterprise companies spent about $47 billion last year on the core cloud services, according to Goldman Sachs. The firm expects that amount to grow to $62 billion this year and to $116 billion by 2021.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nBut the top 4 firms are leaving little room for other players\n\nFrequently, with a rapidly expanding market there's room for plenty of competitors to flourish. But that's not what Goldman Sachs expects.\n\nThe cloud market has already started to consolidate, and that trend will only become more pronounced in the coming years, the analysts predicted. Basically, only the biggest players \u2014 Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and the Chinese giant Alibaba Cloud \u2014 have the resources to offer differentiated services and continue to build out the data-server infrastructure needed to compete, they said.\n\nRead this: Google just named a former Oracle exec as the head of its giant cloud business\n\nLast year, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba accounted for about 56% of the core cloud-computing market. By next year, their combined share should hit 84%, according to Goldman Sachs' forecast. The three American giants alone will account for 77% of the total market, the analysts said.\n\n\"The largest three players (AWS, Azure, Google) will continue to dominate share of the market,\" the analysts said.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nWhile the biggest players would see their revenue go up, the amount of revenue going to the rest of the players in the cloud market would decrease, despite the market's overall expansion. While companies other than the big four pulled in about $21 billion by offering core cloud services last year, that amount will decline to $20 billion this year and just $12 billion next year, Goldman Sachs projected.\n\nThat could be ominous for IBM, Oracle, and other companies that have been trying to edge into the cloud-computing market. If Goldman Sachs is right, they're going to be left fighting for fewer and fewer table scraps left by the cloud giants.\n\nNow read:"}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "Avery Hartmans", "title": "Here's how Apple's new $1,000 iPhone XS compares to last year's iPhone X (AAPL)", "description": "Every fall, Apple introduces new iPhones.

At the end of 2017, the company had about 25,000 staff members, up from 17,000 at the end of 2016. A year prior to that, it was roughly 12,700, and in 2014 it was just over 9,000.\n\nIn other words, most employees simply haven't been at the company very long \u2014 and this means they may be less incentivized to stick around to clean up the mess and tackle some of the hardest problems that Facebook has yet had to face.\n\n\"Most of the company has not been there more than two years, so they have not been \u2026 through a crisis like this, and they might not be emotionally invested in the company like the first thousand might be,\" another former employee said. This person summarized employee perceptions of executive attitudes as, \"Hey, we made a bunch of mistakes, and now it's your job to clean it up.\"\n\nAccording to a recent leak, Facebook's employee morale has already plummeted, with the proportion of employees who are \"optimistic about the company's future\" dropping from 84% to 52% over the last year.\n\nWhere will the buck stop?\n\nIt's not yet clear whether we'll see any major departures as a result of the most recent revelations.\n\nOne of the former employees suggested it was unlikely, pointing out that top communications exec Rachel Whetstone left back in August, and Elliot Schrage \u2014 head of communications and public policy \u2014 quit in June.\n\n\"Mark and Sheryl aren't going anywhere, no one else is really worth getting rid of, so I don't really expect to see heads roll,\" a former employee said.\n\nA current employee, meanwhile, suggested that Joel Kaplan, Facebook's policy boss in DC, might ultimately exit.\n\nKaplan is a rare conservative at the famously liberal company, having previously served in the former President George W. Bush's White House. Kaplan drew flack from employees earlier this year after publicly appearing in support of his longtime friend Brett Kavanaugh as the then Supreme Court nominee testified to Congress regarding allegations of sexual misconduct. According to The Times, Kaplan played a key role in the social network's attempts to downplay to the public the spread of misinformation on its platform.\n\nA former employee said that some of Sandberg's lieutenants and other mid-level executives could leave (or be forced out) amid the turmoil.\n\nMeanwhile, it's almost guaranteed that there will be some kind of discipline for those leakers who spoke to The Times.\n\n\"There will be firings from that.

Other programs have had moments of greatness during those spans \u2014 most notably Xavier during the 2017-18 and 2015-16 seasons \u2014 but none have enjoyed the prolonged success that Villanova has enjoyed.\n\nThe Big East has relied on its basketball prowess as its saving grace as many of its longtime members have fled for greener pastures \u2014 read: more money \u2014 in conferences that also boast strong football networks. But without the Wildcats' success, the Big East conference is rendered virtually irrelevant in the world of college basketball, especially when compared to powerhouse conferences like the ACC, SEC, Big Ten, and Big 12.\n\nSteve Wojciechowski and the Marquette Golden Eagles may be the Big East's only hope for relevance this season. Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n\nIf Villanova's matchup against the Jayhawks goes south, the Big East's best hope lies with Mike Krzyzewski disciple Steve Wojciechowski and the Marquette Golden Eagles. They also fell out of the rankings last week after losing on the road to the Indiana Hoosiers, but they will have the opportunity to prove themselves and catapult back into the rankings with a win against any of the four ranked opponents they will face before the new year.\n\nStill, the precarious state of today's Big East is a far, far cry from the conference that boasted grudge matches between Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin in the mid-1980s. If the Big East wants to return to its former glory in the basketball arena, the path back will undoubtedly run through Villanova."}, {"source": {"id": "business-insider", "name": "Business Insider"}, "author": "David Choi", "title": "White House issues rules for the media after it grudgingly reinstates CNN correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass", "description": "The White House has issued rules for the news media in the wake of a dispute between President Donald Trump and CNN correspondent Jim Acosta.
