As officials race to recount ballots, they\u2019ve had to deal with aging election equipment, poor ballot design and accusations of manipulating the election process for partisan gain.\n\nSome of the parallels between the 2000 and 2018 recounts are strikingly similar. The state\u2019s governor again faces accusations of a conflict of interest. (Unlike then-Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the brother of a candidate, Gov. Rick Scott is a candidate himself for Senate.) In Broward County this year, there is speculation that a poorly designed ballot may have led voters to skip voting in the Senate race \u2014 which lawyers for Sen. Bill Nelson (D) say could have cost him thousands of votes. The episode echoes the infamous butterfly ballot controversy in Palm Beach County, where a confusing ballot likely hurt Al Gore.\n\nBoth recounts involve the actual machinery of the elections. In 2000 antiquated punch card machines produced the chads and election chaos. In 2018 the machines Palm Beach County used to conduct its recount malfunctioned, and it wasn\u2019t able to submit recount results in time to the state. Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, has come under scrutiny after her office missed the deadline to submit results to the secretary of state\u2019s office by two minutes, refused to turn over ballot tallies and was slow posting election results.\n\nAt the heart of the 2000 election controversy was a dispute over how election officials should judge the intent of a voter if the selection on a ballot was unclear. There were inconsistent standards across the counties. After 2000, the state stopped using punch cards and developed clearer standards for judging voter intent. Officials across the state are now leaning on those new standards as they manually recount ballots from voters who appear to have selected two or more candidates in a race or no candidate at all.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problems have not changed because there\u2019s no will to change them. When winners are elected in a system that works, that\u2019s an incentive not to rock the boat. There\u2019s also not enough resources that a state will devote to election administration,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who wrote about the 2000 Florida recount in his book The Voting Wars.\n\nThe fundamental problems have not changed because there\u2019s no will to change them. Rick Hasen, law professor, University of California, Irvine\n\nNed Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, said that after a recount like Florida\u2019s in 2000, there\u2019s a push to fix the specific issues driving the dispute. But partisanship can prevent larger systemic changes to prevent similar meltdowns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the problems with faulty technology right now. We haven\u2019t replaced the machines, and Palm Beach can\u2019t finish because it can\u2019t run the machines fast,\u201d said Foley, who wrote Ballot Battles: The History of Disputed Elections in the United States. \u201cIf we put more money and we didn\u2019t fight over these things so much, we would get better machines. We would have a good process to begin with.\u201d\n\nHasen and Foley said the most striking difference between 2018 and 2000 was how quickly elected officials like Scott and President Donald Trump were willing to accuse election officials of acting in bad faith. The 2000 election, Foley said, showed Democrats and Republicans that post-election disputes over elections can really matter and pushed them to prepare to go to all out if a race is relatively close.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing element to what I see now compared to 2000 is it seems like we\u2019ve got a deterioration of norms and culture. There\u2019s more accusations about stealing in the context of a senator\u2019s seat and a governor\u2019s seat \u2014 important, but it\u2019s not the presidency,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThey do fundraising off of this. ... It feeds off of the polarization that occurs off the last two decades, and it feeds the polarization.\u201d\n\nWhile the approximately 12,600-vote margin between Scott and Nelson is small, given the more than 8 million ballots cast, it\u2019s much bigger than the 537 votes that separated George W. Bush and Gore. If a margin more than 12,000 votes causes so much controversy, it\u2019s difficult to imagine what might happen in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf you think about how divided the country is, you think about how polarized things are, when you go to the 2020 election, you can imagine if Trump and his Democratic opponent were within 12,000 votes of each other, how awful this would be,\u201d Hasen said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Antonia Blumberg", "title": "California Wildfires Are A Bigger Public Health Nightmare Than Anyone Imagined", "description": "Even people nearly 200 miles from the flames are suffering the consequences of the massive Camp fire.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-wildfires-public-health_us_5bef0747e4b0f7192ca93d1c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef07b62100002906ca274c.jpeg?cache=ORR09SbVMo&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:46:49Z", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO Skies so hazy that the Golden Gate Bridge looks like a shadow of itself.

A fire so devastating that hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Air so polluted that people without safety masks are trapped inside. A quarantine set up by the National Guard to limit the spread of a dangerous virus.\n\nThis is not the climactic scene of an apocalyptic horror movie, set far in the future. This is California in 2018.\n\nThe flames and smoke from the Camp fire ripping through Northern California \u2015 a record-breaking catastrophe that has claimed at least 63 lives with more than 600 people still missing \u2015 is the public health crisis that climate change researchers have been warning about.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a 55-and-older community in Paradise, California, was burned to the ground.\n\nIn Butte County, where the fire has been raging for more than a week, thousands of people have been evacuated to shelters set up in churches, high schools, fairgrounds and other sites. Many have lost their homes, loved ones and neighbors. The fire has destroyed nearly 10,000 residences so far, and over 15,000 more are threatened, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\nRight now, though, there\u2019s another acute issue preoccupying evacuees and shelter workers.\n\nMore than 140 Camp fire evacuees huddled in crowded shelters are showing norovirus symptoms, the Butte County Public Health Department announced Thursday. That number is likely much higher now.\n\n\u201cThe number of sick people is increasing every day,\u201d a release from the health department stated. \u201cTwenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support. Staff serving the shelters have also been sick.\u201d\n\nA visit to the East Avenue Church shelter in Chico shows just how quickly norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, is spreading in a community that has already suffered through so much unforeseen devastation.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty people were camped at the church on Friday when illness erupted in one corner of the shelter\u2019s multipurpose room. Evacuees overcome with sudden vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration were eventually protected by a barrier as volunteers rushed to treat them. They were feet away from their fellow evacuees, wearing air filtration masks and precautionary adult diapers, hoping not to add illness to the others\u2019 long lists of misfortunes. While volunteers bleached floors covered in feces and vomit, some evacuees took to the bushes outside the shelter to relieve themselves. These are the indignities of a catastrophe that no one plans for.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Avenue Church Shelter in Chico, California, where norovirus has spread and makeshift quarantine barriers have been erected.\n\nIt\u2019s not 100 percent certain that all patients are suffering from norovirus specifically, but the threat the infection poses justifies a prompt response. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are about 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly young children and the elderly, each year among those infected by it in the U.S.\n\nLater on Friday, the National Guard began setting up medical tents for Camp fire evacuees affected by norovirus in an attempt to better control its spread from shelter to shelter, all overcrowded with people made homeless by the fire and people who were already homeless but needed relief from the smoke. Some brought dogs and other pets.\n\nMeanwhile, counties more than a hundred miles from the fire are grappling with the health consequences of smoke that\u2019s settled around their homes.\n\nSince the Camp fire erupted on Nov. 8, the skies throughout the affected areas and spilling down into the San Francisco Bay Area have been brown and hazy. Visibility is poor. In San Francisco, the tops of buildings seem to disappear into the haze. Everywhere the air smells like fire.\n\nThat smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter measuring roughly 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5. These particulates are too small to be caught by our lungs\u2019 filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams, posing potential health risks to anyone breathing it but particularly to those with respiratory issues, as well as to older adults and children. Coughing, wheezing and other side effects have already affected many of those exposed to the abysmal air.\n\nThe Butte County Air Quality Management District reported \u201chazardous\u201d air quality in Paradise, where the fire started, and in nearby Chico, Oroville and Gridley. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AirNow site reported an Air Quality Index of 350 in Chico. For context, Delhi, India \u2015 one of the most notoriously polluted cities in the world \u2015 on Friday measured an AQI of about 240.\n\nEven the Bay Area, more than 165 miles from the epicenter of the Camp fire, is experiencing air quality conditions considered unsafe for anyone to go outside. The EPA measured an AQI of 238 in San Francisco on Friday.\n\nNorthern Californians take their good air for granted. Last year, San Francisco had 276 days with an AQI rating of \u201cgood.\u201d The average AQI in Delhi is \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Golden Gate Bridge is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires Friday.\n\nMany schools and universities throughout the Bay Area have closed in recent days due to the poor air quality. Public schools in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano and Marin counties canceled classes on Friday due to the poor air quality. The University of California, Berkeley, San Francisco State University, California State University East Bay and other colleges closed their campuses, as well. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a \u201cSpare the Air\u201d alert effective from Thursday through Tuesday that includes a ban on \u201cburning wood, including manufactured fire logs or any other solid fuel, indoors or outdoors.\u201d\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s famous cable cars were shut down on Friday.\n\nAuthorities also urged residents to stay indoors and to wear a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, marked N95 or higher, if and when they need to go outdoors.\n\nOne ACE hardware store in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district was out of masks Tuesday night but told customers a shipment of 1,000 more would be in the next morning. By Wednesday night, they were out again.\n\nThe shortage is standard across the city. Many vendors have limited customers to four masks per person. That limit has gone down to two in some places as supplies have dwindled.\n\nSmoke entering through the state\u2019s Central Valley is hovering in Bay Area counties, unable to escape through the Golden Gate, the National Weather Service explained. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of high daytime temperatures and low evening ones has triggered a phenomenon that traps the smoke close to the ground.\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS Pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District wear protective masks against the hazardous air.\n\nThe particulates in wildfire smoke also have a somewhat different chemical makeup than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources of pollution. And it comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire, which may present a different set of risks.\n\nNext to the immediate loss of life from the Camp fire, the air quality may seem a distant secondary concern. But how the poor air may affect survivors and other surrounding residents in the long term poses a frightening prospect.\n\nInhalation of PM 2.5 particles has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues. PM exposure has also been linked to increased kidney disease risk and shortened life spans of those exposed to it in the womb.\n\nHazy conditions in the Bay Area are projected to persist over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. As for now, people\u2019s hope for relief from the smoke hinges on a chance of rain that may help clean the air late next week."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Laura Bassett", "title": "Stacey Abrams Acknowledges Loss In Georgia Governor\u2019s Race", "description": "The Democrat said she isn't conceding but is ending her run against Republican Brian Kemp.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stacey-abrams-acknowledges-loss-in-georgia-governors-race_us_5bef4370e4b0b84243e25ece", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef45d62100002906ca275a.jpeg?cache=48i81Eo0EI&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:44:46Z", "content": "In a speech to her supporters on Friday night, Democrat Stacey Abrams acknowledged that she\u2019d lost the Georgia governor\u2019s race to Republican Brian Kemp.

Meanwhile, Daniel\u2019s loving but co-dependent mother, Lydia (Anna Holbrook), is eager to find a way to use the couple\u2019s lack of a marriage certificate to her advantage. The show\u2019s climax is, easily, one of the most heartbreaking scenes you\u2019re likely to see off-Broadway this season.\n\n\u201cDaniel\u2019s Husband\u201d also boasts nuanced yet emotionally charged performances from its ensemble cast. Each of the five principal actors has been a part of the show since its 2016 premiere at the Penguin Rep Theatre in Stony Point, New York, and appeared in a subsequent 2017 production at Cherry Lane Theatre in New York\u2019s West Village neighborhood.\n\nThe fact that America\u2019s political climate has shifted during the various incarnations of \u201cDaniel\u2019s Husband\u201d isn\u2019t lost on its stars. Still, they told HuffPost the play\u2019s lack of an \u201cintentional agenda\u201d means its message doesn\u2019t rely on the civic views of its audience members.\n\nCarol Rosegg Anna Holbrook (center) plays Lydia, Daniel's doting but co-dependent mother, in \"Daniel's Husband.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a message we need our audience to leave with, and because of that, I think it\u2019s that much more effective,\u201d Wheeler told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s about not taking anything for granted, which is something that everyone can relate to.\u201d\n\nThe show also arrives at a time when the New York theater scene is hosting a plethora of LGBTQ narratives. Both \u201cTorch Song\u201d \u2015 a revised version of Harvey Fierstein\u2019s 1982 queer theatrical milestone, \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d \u2015 and an inclusive new musical, \u201cThe Prom,\u201d opened this month to stellar reviews.\n\nFor his part, Montelongo believes the show\u2019s unexpected latter half \u201chelps break open that \u2018gay play\u2019 box everyone wants to categorize us as.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about protecting the love that\u2019s a priority in your life,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you leave feeling not so much that you have to get married, but that you have to fight for those protections, whatever they are for you.\u201d\n\nCarol Rosegg \"Daniel's Husband\" is \"about protecting the love that\u2019s a priority in your life,\" Montelongo (left, with Spahn) told HuffPost.\n\nSpahn echoed those sentiments, noting that \u201cDaniel\u2019s Husband\u201d emphasizes \u201cthe arguments in any relationship that can divide a couple\u201d rather than the sexuality of its characters. Audiences who don\u2019t identify as LGBTQ will find much to admire in its narrative, he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ryan Grenoble", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Top Brass Say They Knew Nothing About Definers.

Pressed to explain who, then, was aware of Facebook\u2019s relationship with Definers, he offered the verbal equivalent of a shrug: \u201cSomeone on our comms team must have hired them.\u201d\n\nChief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg echoed that denial in a note published later Thursday. \u201cI did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I should have.\u201d\n\nShe really should have \u2015 and it seems almost unbelievable she didn\u2019t.\n\nA TechCrunch breakdown of Facebook\u2019s communications team found numerous staffers linked to Sandberg formerly worked for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign alongside Matt Rhodes, who founded Definers after the campaign. This includes Facebook\u2019s Director of Policy Communications Andrea Saul, who worked for Sandberg\u2019s non-profit LeanIn.org for two years after the campaign concluded.\n\nAnother possible link: Facebook\u2019s chief lobbyist, Joel Kaplan, worked in the George W. Bush White House at the same time as Rhodes and has strong ties to Sandberg. The two attended Harvard together and he reportedly consults with her on high-level strategy at Facebook \u2015 including deciding to downplay Russian disinformation activities on the site, another bombshell allegation made in the Times report. (Facebook denies this).\n\nIn addition to Sandberg\u2019s internal corporate ties to Facebook\u2019s communications and policy leaders, her claim of ignorance doesn\u2019t line up with basic executive oversight.\n\nDocuments obtained by NBC show Facebook paid Definers $3.3 million for its services in the first quarter of 2018 alone. Assuming the relationship lasted longer than one quarter, that\u2019s one hefty annual expenditure for both a COO and CEO to know absolutely nothing about.\n\nTheir denials also represent a 180-degree reversal of the company\u2019s own spin. Just one day earlier, before its top executives publicly professed their ignorance, Facebook sought to combat the story by painting its contract with Definers as mundane, common knowledge:\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Definers was well known by the media,\u201d the company said in a release, \u201cnot least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Sandberg\u2019s and Zuckerberg\u2019s portrayal of Definers\u2019 relationship with the company as a little-known undertaking conflicts with Definers\u2019 own description of it. While Definers disputed the nature of its work in a statement Friday, the firm said its work for Facebook included \u201ca large-scale news alert service\u201d that kept \u201chundreds of Facebook staff informed.\u201d\n\nAs a refresher, here\u2019s some of the work Definers reportedly carried out on Facebook\u2019s behalf:\n\n- Seeking to undermine and discredit Facebook critics in a group called \u201cFreedom From Facebook\u201d by linking them to the billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros, a common tactic on the far right that\u2019s fueled by anti-Semitism. Even worse, Soros didn\u2019t even fund the group.\n\n- Lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to then cast Facebook critics as anti-Semitic. (Zuckerberg and Sandberg are both Jewish)."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sebastian Murdock", "title": "Trump Says He Was Too Busy \u2018On Calls\u2019 To Honor Soldiers On Veterans Day", "description": "\"I was extremely busy on calls for the country,\" President Donald Trump told Fox News.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-too-busy-on-calls-veterans-day_us_5bef29e7e4b0b84243e25212", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef2fc72200000f03de3d69.jpeg?cache=NQcBWqYx8K&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:37:29Z", "content": "President Donald Trump loves to talk about his love of U.S. soldiers, but did absolutely nothing to honor them on Veterans Day because he was \u201cbusy on calls.\u201d In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace set to air Sunday, the host asked the president why he \u2026 [+2183 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump loves to talk about his love of U.S. soldiers, but did absolutely nothing to honor them on Veterans Day because he was \u201cbusy on calls.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace airing later this weekend, the host asked the president why he didn\u2019t visit Arlington National Cemetery on the holiday honoring U.S. veterans.\n\n\u201cI should have done that, I was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling as you know,\u201d Trump said, according to a partial transcript of the interview given to reporters.\n\nTrump on going to Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran's Day:\n\n\n\n\"I should have done that,\" but says he was busy. pic.twitter.com/or1D88k0r4 \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) November 16, 2018\n\nPressed on the question, Trump then said he assumed it would be fine to skip the honoring and added that he was \u201cbusy because of affairs of state.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments follow his embarrassing refusal to honor World War I soldiers in France for an event marking the 100th anniversary of the end to the war.

But the policy faces daunting obstacles. Democrats\u2019 long-standing obsession with balanced budgets is at odds with a plan to spend trillions on clean-energy research and building weatherization retrofits and infrastructure for renewable electricity \u2015 especially when Republican tax cuts are ballooning the national deficit.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders are considering a rule that would require a supermajority to raise income taxes \u2015 all but crippling any expensive, big-ticket legislation like a Green New Deal or Medicare for all, the popular proposal for universal health care.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, remain in the thralls of climate change denialism, and are closely allied with deep-pocketed oil, gas and coal companies eager to upend any such legislation.\n\n\u201cGiven that we are at or near full employment, the green jobs concept seems a bit distant from our current reality,\u201d former Rep.

More than a dozen other people were injured.\n\nAuthorities did not enter the school until more than 10 minutes after the first shots were fired.\n\nCruz, who was arrested in Coral Springs shortly after he escaped the scene, confessed to the shooting, according to an affidavit by the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nPeterson resigned after an investigation by the sheriff\u2019s office determined he failed to engage the shooter.\n\nAt the time, Peterson\u2019s former boss, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, heaped scorn on Peterson and said he made him \u201csick to his stomach.\u201c\n\nPeterson, who has been receiving an $8,700 monthly pension, according to media reports, launched the GoFundMe campaign after ignoring a subpoena ordering him to appear Thursday before the state commission investigating the Parkland school massacre.\n\nAccording to the Sun-Sentinel, Peterson\u2019s lawyer made a brief appearance, during which he served the commission with a lawsuit seeking to quash the subpoena.\n\nThe lawsuit reportedly claims the commission acted improperly in using its civil power to issue subpoenas.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter, Jamie, was killed in the Parkland school shooting, right, cries while his wife Jennifer comforts him during a state commission hearing on Nov. 15, 2018.\n\nPeterson has broken his silence only once since the shooting. In June, he gave an interview to NBC\u2019s Today show, during which he defended himself and claimed he did not know the source of gunshots on the day of the shooting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of lies,\u201d Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chairman of the commission, said of Peterson\u2019s excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s fictitious.\u201c\n\nInvestigators for the commission presented compelling evidence to the commission, the Miami Herald reported. Among that evidence is a radio call Peterson made less than two minutes after shots rang out on campus:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got shots fired. Possible shots fired. 1200 building.\u201c\n\nA first responder also claimed Peterson told him the shooter was on the second or third floor.\n\nSheriff Israel testified before the commission and, according to the Miami Herald, blamed the department\u2019s poor response to the shooting on \u201ca patchwork 911 system and \u2014 perhaps \u2014 a lack of courage\u201d by his deputies.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have been there for the kids that day,\u201d Israel said.\n\nMax Schachter, a commission member whose son Alex was killed in the attack, had harsh words for Peterson, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a piece of garbage,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cHe could have gone in and saved \u2026 children\u2019s lives. He stood behind a concrete pillar for 45 minutes and did nothing. He\u2019s a despicable human being.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Peterson will be held in contempt for failure to appear. The commission said they first need to review the lawsuit.\n\nCruz, who has been charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder, is awaiting trial.\n\nSend David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "HuffPost Video", "title": "Hundreds Missing In California Fire", "description": "The numbers of people missing and killed in the Northern California Camp Fire continue to rise.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hundreds-missing-in-california-camp-fire_us_5bef303de4b047439533c071", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef303d2100002906ca2752.jpeg?cache=vBLgmOHVlU&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:00:00Z", "content": "Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

We\u2019ve started a number of initiatives that I\u2019d like to see through to conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request to interview Wheeler.\n\nThe move is a formality. The Senate easily confirmed Wheeler to be deputy administrator in April with support from every Republican and three Democrats. Republican challengers unseated two of those Democrats, and the remaining one, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), is expected to support Wheeler again.\n\nIn a tweet, Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), whom Wheeler served as a top aide in the early 2000s, called him \u201cthe perfect choice to lead the EPA\u201d and a \u201cgreat pick.\u201d\n\nWheeler\u2019s nomination swiftly drew criticism from environmentalists, who resoundingly oppose his deregulatory agenda and condemn his refusal to accept as settled the science showing industrial emissions are the main cause of climate change.\n\nI think I\u2019m making a difference. Andrew Wheeler\n\n\u201cWheeler is far more dangerous than Pruitt, and if allowed to run the EPA for two more years, would cause irreversible damage to our environment,\u201d Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the nonpartisan Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \u201cHis giveaways to special interest polluters are sickening our children and shortening people\u2019s lifespans. He needs to be rejected by the Senate if nominated.\u201d\n\nEven if green groups drummed up enough votes to tank his confirmation, experts said Wheeler could, in theory, stay on in an acting capacity indefinitely due to conflicting rules for acting chiefs at the EPA.\n\nThe announcement comes days after Wheeler surprised his critics by unveiling a new initiative aimed at toughening pollution rules on big-rig trucks.\n\n\u201cBurdensome regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,\u201d he said during a call with reporters Monday. He touted the EPA\u2019s efforts to gut regulations that cost industry players a combined $1.6 billion, and said he planned to propose 49 additional \u201cderegulatory actions estimated to provide up to $100 billion in savings.\u201d\n\nWheeler has not been without his own controversies. As HuffPost reported in October, the agency chief repeatedly engaged with inflammatory content on his personal Facebook and Twitter accounts over the past five years. The online activity included liking a racist image of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Facebook and retweeting an infamous \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theorist. At least two Democratic senators called on him to resign over the revelations.\n\nIn early February, The Intercept published a report detailing fundraisers that Wheeler held for Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May, five months before his formal nomination to be deputy administrator came before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, on which the senators serve. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to appoint him to the position is a decision to double down on failure and will lead to weakened protections for clean air and water,\u201d Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who led the charge to investigate Pruitt, said in a statement. \u201cAndrew Wheeler remains a coal lobbyist at heart, and the Senate should reject his appointment.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kevin Robillard", "title": "How To Take Down A Candidate In An Era Where Nothing Matters", "description": "Democratic super PAC American Bridge readjusted for the Trump era, and it paid off.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opposition-research-in-trump-era_us_5beda3f2e4b0dbb7ea688300", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef01aa2000005e060293e7.jpeg?cache=OWkaFVHWrl&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T20:10:24Z", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the early months of 2017, Bradley Beychok was worried he had become obsolete.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, journalists and opposition researchers had documented now-President Donald Trump\u2019s history of alleged sexual misconduct, his history of stiffing workers, his years of political flip-flopping. None of it seemed to matter on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWe would talk about it internally. We talked about it on the road with donors, supporters and political operatives. Does this really matter? Is it outdated?\u201d Beychok told HuffPost. \u201cIt was a scary conversation to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump definitely challenged the mantra of opposition research,\u201d Beychok said.\n\nHis conversations with donors and fellow operatives led to a revamp and refocusing of American Bridge to become an organization less focused on assembling traditional, inches-thick opposition research books on GOP candidates and one more focused on quickly generating newsworthy hits and pitching them to local media organizations.\n\nSince then, Bridge\u2019s 35 trackers \u2014 spread across 28 states \u2014 traveled more than 850,000 miles to cover 11,000 events in 164 races. Its public records team in D.C. filed more than 1,600 public records requests. The group estimates its research has generated more than $50 million worth of news coverage.\n\nThe work led to damaging hits used in Democratic ads against Republicans like Roy Moore in Alabama, Martha McSally in Arizona and Matt Rosendale in Montana. Its tracking footage forced the National Republican Campaign Committee to back away from supporting a GOP candidate in a New Jersey district previously held by Republicans. Not every candidate it targeted lost; the research generated multiple negative stories targeting Florida Gov. Rick Scott (who appears likely to win his Senate race, pending a recount) and highlighted Virginia GOP Rep.-elect Denver Riggleman\u2019s fondness for Bigfoot erotica, for instance.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change Bridge made in 2018 was to ditch the research book for U.S. House candidates. Standard operating procedure for opposition researchers is to assemble a heavy binder listing almost everything a candidate has ever said on a host of subjects, along with every vote he or she has ever taken and almost every imaginable line of attack a campaign might employ.\n\n\u201cResearch is such a factory-oriented mindset,\u201d said Shripal Shah, American Bridge\u2019s vice president. \u201cEveryone comes into it with this mindset where you start with issue A and then issue B and then literally go alphabetical. And then you end up with these books that are superheavy on agriculture. But it doesn\u2019t have the stuff consultants and everybody want you to find.\u201d\n\nInstead, Bridge provided its House team with a list of 70 candidates to focus on and decided to leave book creation to individual campaigns and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Instead, American Bridge let experienced researchers rely on instinct to find instances of corruption and racism, which they then focused on pitching to local outlets instead of national ones obsessed with Trump.\n\nResearch is such a factory-oriented mindset. ... You end up with these books that are superheavy on agriculture. But it doesn\u2019t have the stuff consultants and everybody want you to find. Shripal Shah, vice president, American Bridge\n\n\u201cIn the past, Huffington Post or Politico or CNN or MSNBC were, like, prime time for where we want to land material,\u201d Beychok said. \u201cWhen something leads the front page of the St. Louis or Philadelphia paper, that\u2019s when it\u2019s really a success.\u201d\n\nBridge also created its own news site \u2014 The American Ledger \u2014 to quickly publish some stories on its own, what Beychok said was a necessary counterweight to right-leaning websites.\n\n\u201cThe right wing does this a lot better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Daily Caller, Gateway Pundit, The Free Beacon \u2014 they\u2019ve caused some problems for Democratic campaigns.\u201d\n\nBridge spent the first six months of the cycle focused on researching Trump\u2019s nominees and conflicts of interest with his businesses and on finding ways to highlight the damage of his policies for local outlets. It hopes to resurrect the research as 2020 draws closer. It has already filed more than 225 public records requests focused on Trump and his possible GOP primary opponents. The group plans to have trackers on the ground by Jan. 1 in the three states with governor\u2019s races in 2019 \u2014 Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 and in most of the states with potentially competitive 2020 Senate races.\n\nAlso, the organization is launching a program focused on Republican state legislators, with the goal of taking down rising GOP stars.

But with a Democratic majority taking over the House, Republicans now seem to believe they had better take whatever they can get.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) declined to confirm whether the training program was out, saying only that he hoped a bill would pass soon.\n\n\u201cThis system can move at a glacial-like speed, but every once in a while, we go lightning,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeed of the deal notwithstanding, other lawmakers hinted Friday at the shape of the bill.\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with where Conaway seemed to be going with the negotiations and that the final bill would probably pass with Democratic votes \u2015 unlike the House version of the bill, which passed in June with only Republican votes because Democrats hated its nutrition funding cuts.\n\n\u201cThe important stuff for me, honestly, are what happens in the agriculture part of the bill,\u201d Cole said.\n\nThe farm bill reauthorizes both nutrition assistance and farm welfare, which amounts to about $17 billion annually in payments to farmers through insurance subsidies and reimbursement for crop losses or price drops.\n\nOne priority for Conaway has been increased subsidies for certain farm corporations. Just like with food stamps, there are limits on who can get farm subsidies, based on how much money they make. Farmers earning more than $900,000 annually aren\u2019t eligible, and for those who are, payments are capped at $125,000 annually per farmer.\n\nThe Senate bill would lower the income limit to $700,000, while Conaway\u2019s House bill would leave the current limit and actually make it easier for farmer family members and partners in certain corporations to qualify for the full $125,000. Under current law, a corporation counts as one person for subsidy purposes. The proposal would expand eligibility to each partner in certain firms.\n\nThe provision would seem to benefit large companies. Only 5 percent of farm businesses are the type of corporation that would qualify for the new benefits, though such firms are responsible for more than 26 percent of production value, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nWhile there are still quite a few unknowns, one thing became clear for Republicans after the midterm elections: They had better take a deal now before Democrats take back the House.\n\n\u201cWe got to get the farm bill done,\u201d Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said. \u201cIf we could get this one done with some bad modifications, it will be so much better than what will be negotiated under the Democrat majority next year.\u201d\n\nSince SNAP already has work requirements, Republicans could abandon their push for stricter rules and instead focus on restricting the ability of states to waive the rules when local unemployment rates are high \u2014 a long-standing conservative complaint. They could still win stricter eligibility standards relating to applicants\u2019 assets and income. Lawmakers haven\u2019t released the final language, and there are many ways Republicans could tighten work requirements without the bill adopting the House language.\n\nThompson was one of the main architects of the training program, which was key to the stricter work requirements in the House bill. Republicans insisted that anyone subject to the new work rules could fulfill them by enrolling in training, so the bill wouldn\u2019t unfairly take anyone\u2019s food benefits away. Without training, that talking point would collapse."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Alanna Vagianos", "title": "Betsy DeVos' New Title IX Guidelines Prioritize Schools Over Sexual Assault Survivors", "description": "The Education Department just proposed guidelines to the civil rights law that would drastically change the way schools handle sexual misconduct.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/besty-devos-new-title-ix-guidelines-prioritize-schools-over-sexual-assault-survivors_us_5beede5fe4b0510a1f3037cf", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef00e9240000490299b918.jpeg?cache=Z7dF8R6PhH&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:29:28Z", "content": "Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released her long-awaited proposed Title IX guidelines Friday morning, and there\u2019s a lot to unpack.

Additionally, the guidelines essentially prioritize schools above all by creating fewer sexual misconduct cases, which reduces costs (saving colleges anywhere from $286 to $368 million over 10 years, according to estimates included in the proposed guideline).\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s proposed rule is designed to let schools off the hook for sexual assault and harassment,\u201d Sage Carson, manager of the anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, said in a Friday morning statement.\n\n\u201cThese proposals signal the Department of Education\u2019s decision to prioritize schools\u2019 bottom line over survivors\u2019 right to an education,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf these draft rules become law, more survivors will be forced out of school by harassment, assault, and their schools\u2019 indifference to their complaints.\u201d\n\nThese proposals signal the Department of Education\u2019s decision to prioritize schools\u2019 bottom line over survivors\u2019 right to an education. Sage Carson, manager of Know Your IX\n\nTitle IX, the federal civil rights law created to ensure gender equality in education, applies to all schools that receive federal funding, including nearly all colleges and universities, all public K-12 schools and a few private K-12 schools that receive federal dollars. The regulations differ slightly for K-12 schools versus college and university campuses.\n\nThe suggested guidelines are similar to a copy partially leaked in August which faced swift criticism from survivor advocacy groups for making it harder for victims to report harassment and assault.\n\nBelow are the provisions that could have the largest impact on how sexual misconduct is handled in school settings across the country:\n\n1. Narrowing The Definition Of Sexual Misconduct\n\nKeeping with the leaked copy, Friday\u2019s suggested guidelines narrow the definition of sexual misconduct, defining it as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d\n\nJess Davidson, executive director of survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, described this portion of the regulations as \u201cone of the most harmful parts of the rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe definition is extreme and it\u2019s going to require that students are harassed multiple times before they are able to receive any form of accommodation,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\n2. Schools Are Only Responsible If Assaults Take Place On Campus\n\nUnder the proposed guideline, a school \u201cis only responsible for responding to conduct that occurs within its \u2018education program or activity.\u2019\u201d The Education Department loosely defines \u201ceducation program or activity\u201d as \u201call of the operations of\u201d a school including anything that has \u201cany academic, extracurricular, research, [or] occupational training.\u201d\n\nThis definition, however, does not include off-campus housing or bars and other settings within a school environment where assault and misconduct often take place. This is one of the most worrisome provisions of the entire 149-page proposal because 87 percent of college students live off campus.\n\nDavidson noted that this provision could prove disastrous for marginalized students, specifically community college and commuter students who spend a majority of their time off-campus.\n\nAdditionally, this would allow schools like Michigan State and Ohio State, both currently embroiled in sexual assault scandals, to sidestep misconduct perpetrated by staff at off-campus events.\n\n\u201cWould it make sense for Larry Nassar not to be held accountable if he only abused student athletes at off-campus events? It\u2019s absurd,\u201d Sejal Singh, policy coordinator for Know Your IX, said to HuffPost in August. 3. \u2018Mediation\u2019 Instead Of Investigation\n\nUnder the proposed provisions, the accused can participate in a live cross-examination of the alleged victim through a third party (although this does not apply fully to K-12 incidents).\n\nUnlike the earlier leaked copy, Friday\u2019s proposed rule would not allow the accused to cross-examine their accuser personally. Additionally, the accuser is allowed to request that their alleged perpetrator watch the live cross-examination from a separate room which prohibits \u201cany unnecessary trauma that could arise from personal confrontation.\u201d\n\nThis process, known as mediation, encourages schools to simply work it out themselves instead of following a regulated investigation protocol.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), schools pushed survivors to \u2018work it out\u2019 with their rapists, fostering a climate where students were afraid to come forward\u201d anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX said in a Friday statement. \u201cThe Department\u2019s decision to revert back to a harmful status quo will allow for schools and rapists to intimidate survivors into silence.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Education Department has not offered any guidelines on how this mediation process would potentially play out.\n\n4. Victims Can Only Report To Certain People\n\nThe guidelines would restrict whom a victim can report to in order to implement corrective measures through the school. College students would only be able to report a Title IX issue with the school\u2019s Title IX coordinator which, Davidson said, is cause for concern.\n\n\u201cThe lived experience of most college students don\u2019t set them up to go first to the dean of students or to the Title IX administrator directly,\u201d she said. \u201cMost students want to talk to \u2015 as anybody does \u2015 students want to talk to a campus official or an adult who they trust, who will be on their side, who will affirm them, and will help them find safety and an answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see this definition go forward \u2015 that would essentially give a free pass to OSU and Michigan State and Larry Nassar \u2015 is really horrifying,\u201d Davidson added.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that mandatory reporting laws still apply, but for a student to receive help and protection from their school specifically, they would need to seek out a Title IX coordinator.\n\nThis provision would not apply to students K-12.\n\n5. A Higher Standard Of Evidence Needed To Prove Guilt\n\nThe proposed guidelines state a school can use \u201ceither the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard.\u201d Many survivor advocate groups, however, highlighted that using a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard would treat sexual misconduct survivors more harshly than victims of other discriminatory campus crimes.\n\n\u201cInstead of imposing discriminatory procedural hurdles for campus sexual harassment cases, schools should use the same standards that they use for other serious campus wrongdoing, such as physical assault or arson,\u201d Know Your IX noted.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Meghan Downey of Chatham, New Jersey, protests in Arlington, Virginia, as U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announces changes in federal policy on rules for investigating sexual assault reports on college campuses on Sept. 7, 2017.\n\nMany politicians and Title IX advocates were up in arms over the proposed guidelines. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) urged Congress to stand against the proposal, writing that it \u201cseems intended to make college campuses safe spaces to commit sexual assault and harassment instead of safe spaces to learn.\u201d\n\nIn a Friday statement, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called on \u201cevery woman, man, mom, dad, and anyone else who cares about campus safety and preventing sexual assault to make your voices heard and demand that Secretary DeVos and President Trump withdraw this proposal immediately.\u201d\n\nLara Kaufmann, Director of Public Policy for Girls Inc., pointed out how damaging this proposal could be for K-12 girls specifically.\n\n\u201cAll girls should be able to grow up safe, respected, and valued,\u201d she said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cUnfortunately, these new proposals will lead to fewer students reporting assaults and harassment, more dangerous K-12 schools, and more girls being denied their civil right to equal access to education.\u201d\n\nPresident of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten also condemned the proposed rules in a Friday statement.\n\n\u201cThis rule abdicates the responsibility to protect every student\u2019s right to safety on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells academic institutions that they needn\u2019t bother helping to protect students; they won\u2019t be liable. These changes once again demonstrate that students are not DeVos\u2019 priority.\u201d\n\nSince she was confirmed as Secretary of Education last year, DeVos has been on a mission to overhaul the Obama-era Title IX guidelines and regulations. In 2017, DeVos met with people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes (a group consisting mainly of so-called men\u2019s rights activists) and, not long after, rescinded an Obama-era Title IX guideline, The Dear Colleague Letter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the secretary has talked a lot about the importance of a fair process but that\u2019s not what this reads like to me,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t somebody trying to create fairness in the process, this is somebody who is trying to prevent the process from taking place at all.\u201d\n\nLegally, the Education Department is required to consider all comments from the public and publicly respond to criticism before making a decision."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Taylor Pittman", "title": "The Creative Way One Family Is Diversifying Bookshelves Across The Country", "description": "50 States 50 Books is an important project from a family on  a mission.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diverse-books-project-charnaie-gordon_us_5bed9d6ee4b0dbb7ea686b6d", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beee9d7240000040499b90c.png?cache=yLiM5gcCBt&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T18:28:10Z", "content": "Troubled by the lack of diversity in children\u2019s books and the literacy gap involving kids around the country, a mom and her two kids have set out to send 50 diverse children\u2019s books to each of the 50 states.

Rowling (aka She Who Must Not Be Questioned) announced that Nagini, the notorious snake/Voldemort\u2019s favorite Horcrux, was once a real live woman.\n\nThat means the evil pet we\u2019ve known for years was actually a female human, imprisoned in the body of an animal at the behest of a very bad serpent man the entire time. For goodness snakes!\n\nIn the movie \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,\u201d pre-Voldemort Nagini is portrayed by South Korean actress Claudia Kim, a casting decision that has prompted some backlash among Potterheads. But before Kim took on the role (and Nagini was little more than a twinkle in the Dark Lord\u2019s dead eyes), Rowling\u2019s character was portrayed by someone \u2015 or, if you prefer, something \u2015 else: a real snake actor.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost in 2017, Moving Picture Co. VFX supervisor Greg Butler explained that the crew behind the original \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film franchise used real snakes as models for the CGI reptilian version of Nagini. But before the seventh and eighth movies, Nagini went through a significant redesign.\n\n\u201cThe Nagini we used in [the fifth and sixth movies] was starting to get a bit old, wasn\u2019t holding up anymore, and then also wasn\u2019t going to be able to perform all of these intensive scenes,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a lot of these things, we had to upgrade our techniques. Our assets from 2008 by 2011 had to be something better. What might be photo-real in the first \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 might be laughable in the last one.\u201d\n\nBottom line: The production team felt it needed a new real snake.\n\n\u201cWe picked out a picture [of the snake],\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a photo session with the real snake. We did video of it slithering around, doing everything we could get. And then we just started a complete remodel, repainted everything brand new, and really the last two films are brand new. She should look different because it\u2019s a different actor, basically.\u201d\n\nThe franchise\u2019s human stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint went on to global fame, but I\u2019ve wondered for a while: What happened to the snake actors that played Nagini? Could the money and popularity associated with the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d world have been, um, constricting? Was Hollywood too cold-blooded? Is the industry just full of vipers?\n\nYou get it. We had to know.\n\nSo I reached out to Jules Sylvester from Reptile Rentals, who has worked with Warner Bros., the studio behind the two franchises. He didn\u2019t know much about the live snakes that posed for Nagini\u2019s scenes, but he referred me to Birds and Animals Unlimited, which worked on the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films. That\u2019s how I got in contact with Birds and Animals\u2019 Julie Tottman.\n\nTottman knew the story of at least one of the real Naginis.\n\n\u201cThe snake in question was a Reticulated Python named Ticky,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHe was born at Drayton Manor Zoo by head keeper John Foden in, I believe, 1996.\u201d\n\nNagini wasn\u2019t Ticky\u2019s first role on screen. She told me Ticky was a favorite of naturalist and TV presenter Steve Backshall and had a \u201cmain part\u201d in David Attenborough\u2019s \u201cLife in Cold Blood,\u201d in the much-coveted role of \u201csnake eating a deer.\u201d\n\nWithout further ado, here, according to Tottman, is one of the real, non-CGI Naginis, aka Ticky, in a scene in \u201cLife in Cold Blood\u201d:\n\nOh, deer. What a star. So the obvious question is, where is the real-life Nagini now?\n\nThe answer might surprise you. But if you\u2019re at all familiar with the regrettable realities of owning pets, it probably won\u2019t.\n\nHe\u2019s dead.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately he was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and went to the Royal Veterinary College near Potters Bar for surgery, which gave him a huge improvement,\u201d Tottman said. \u201cBut the cancer returned and [veterinarians] thought it best to put him to sleep.\u201d\n\nTicky was then taken to a taxidermist for skin preservation.\n\nReticulated pythons can in some circumstances live up to 30 years, according to the internet, so if that estimation is correct, Ticky was certainly taken before his time."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Daniel Marans", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Approach To Washington Has History On Its Side", "description": "The New York Democrat's \"inside-outside\" strategy takes a page from successful movements on the left and right.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez_us_5beef47ce4b0510a1f30761d", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beef63d2100005204ca2742.jpeg?cache=kha4iwk1tl&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:41:24Z", "content": "When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez addressed climate action demonstrators staging a sit-in in House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi s office on Tuesday, some of her harshest critics were liberals.

Philip Randolph and then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nRandolph, who founded a groundbreaking labor union for the predominantly black sector of train porters, wanted Roosevelt to open up World War II-related federal contracting jobs to African-Americans.\n\nRoosevelt reportedly told Randolph that he agreed with him, but he needed a show of force from Randolph\u2019s movement to \u201cmake [him] do it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some debate as to whether that particular exchange actually occurred.\n\nRegardless, Randolph eventually decided to do just that. In 1941, he called for a 100,000-person march on Washington to demand an end to racial discrimination in the defense industry. FDR met with Randolph, informing him, \u201cWe can\u2019t have\u201d so many black people marching in the nation\u2019s capital, Randolph recalled. He offered instead to issue an executive order protecting African-Americans\u2019 rights to work in federal government jobs. When FDR delivered on his promise, Randolph canceled the march.\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s repeated itself throughout American history: Elected leaders on the left or right, nominally aligned with a grassroots movement, find themselves on the receiving end of the most unrelenting pressure from those same activists.\n\nComparing protests against Democrats with protests against Republicans, Jamie Henn of the climate change action group 350.org deadpanned, \u201cI\u2019d rather spend my time shaping play-dough than I would banging my head against the wall.\u201d\n\nHenn knows a thing or two about using bare-knuckle tactics to take on Democrats. 350.org spearheaded the successful effort to pressure then-President Barack Obama into denying the Keystone XL oil pipeline the permitting it needed to cross from Canada into the United States.\n\n\u201cWith Democrats back in power in the House and a number of new Democratic governors in office who can be pressured, you\u2019ll see quite a bit more of that action,\u201d he added.\n\nAssociated Press/Susan Walsh House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks during a press conference on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018. Pelosi faces a revolt from a group of largely centrist Democrats.\n\nThere is also a \u201cman bites dog\u201d factor in challenging one\u2019s own party when it comes to attracting publicity. Democrats protesting President Donald Trump or congressional Republicans is by now pass\u00e9, whereas protesting Pelosi is catnip for the press.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be covering this if we didn\u2019t go after her,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that played a leading role in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s winning primary campaign and supported Tuesday\u2019s protest. (In an October essay in The Nation, Shahid envisioned Ocasio-Cortez serving a similar role to the one that the \u201cradical,\u201d anti-slavery Republicans played in pushing Abraham Lincoln to the left.)\n\nRonald Rapoport, a William and Mary professor who has studied the Obama-era Tea Party movement, likened the timing and theatricality of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Tuesday action to that of the Tea Party in 2010. Days after the GOP\u2019s activism-fueled midterm election win, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) agreed to a demand by more conservative senators to bar members of his caucus from accepting earmarks that direct federal funding to their home states.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s participation in the protest \u201cwas a direct action,\u201d Rapoport said. \u201cIn that sense, the tactics are Tea Party in nature.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a comparison that Trent, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman, rejected out of hand. The far right, he said, has \u201ccertainly been effective.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Tea Party, and its heirs in House Republicans\u2019 Freedom Caucus, were, for philosophical reasons, content to limit the federal government\u2019s functioning as much as possible. Harnessing grassroots energy to stop something from happening is easier than using an \u201cinside-outside\u201d strategy to steer a complex set of reforms through Congress.\n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s demands are narrow in this case. And the New York representative may have some leverage: She has not yet endorsed Pelosi\u2019s speakership. With the Democratic leader under assault from centrists in her party, agreeing to a compromise with Ocasio-Cortez may be the better of multiple options.\n\nShahid, who has worked closely with Ocasio-Cortez in the past, is confident that the freshman progressive will not use a one-size-fits-all approach to governing.\n\n\u201cShe unveiled one of the tools in her toolkit [on Tuesday], but she\u2019s also going to be a great legislator and a great consensus builder,\u201d Shahid said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Cole Delbyck", "title": "Armie Hammer Apologizes For \u2018Asshat\u2019 Tweet About Stan Lee Tributes", "description": "The \"Call Me By Your Name\" star vowed to work on his \"Twitter impulse control.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/armie-hammer-apologizes-for-asshat-tweet-about-stan-lee-tributes_us_5beee618e4b0c19de3ff5147", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beee8982100003506ca273c.jpeg?cache=8bWktgZcjR&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:17:58Z", "content": "Armie Hammer, who criticized fellow celebrities for posting grief selfies in the wake of Stan Lee\u2019s death, now agrees with the rest of the internet that he was acting like an \u201casshat.\u201d The \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d actor was mercilessly dragged on social media a\u2026 [+1553 chars]", "fulltext": "\u201cIf your answer is \u201cpost a selfie\u201d then I think we need a cultural revamp across the board,\u201d he wrote in response to a fan who argued it was natural to share photos on social media after someone\u2019s death.\n\nHammer\u2019s tweeting spree caught the attention of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who dropped by Hammer\u2019s Twitter to write, \u201cYou sound like a real asshat.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "title": "Dane Cook Blasted For Insensitive Tweet About People Who Are Deaf", "description": "The comedian later deleted his tweet.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dane-cook-blasted-by-nyle-dimarco-for-insensitive-tweet-about-deaf-people_us_5beed762e4b0860184a7bb0c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beee52d2100002906ca2737.jpeg?cache=mSdPA42oIq&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:17:11Z", "content": "Dane Cook \u2019s attempt at a joke about deaf people backfired spectacularly on Wednesday.

He was 87.\n\nGoldman\u2019s daughter Jenny said her father died early Friday in New York due to complications from colon cancer and pneumonia. \u201cSo much of what\u2019s he\u2019s written can express who he was and what he was about,\u201d she said, adding that the last few weeks, while Goldman was ailing, revealed just how many people considered him family.\n\nGoldman, who also converted his novels \u201cMarathon Man,\u201d \u2033Magic,\u201d \u2033The Princess Bride\u201d and \u201cHeat\u201d into screenplays, clearly knew more than most about what the audience wanted. He was not only a successful film writer but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \u201cpunch up\u201d weak screenplays.\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase \u201cfollow the money\u201d in his script for \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \u201cFollow the money,\u201d became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his 1985 book, \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade,\u201d he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he remarked.\n\nScreenwriter and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin called Goldman a mentor.\n\n\u201cHe was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\u201d Sorkin said in a statement. \u201cHe wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I\u2019ll always wish he\u2019d written one more, I\u2019ll always be grateful for what he\u2019s left us.\u201d\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master\u2019s degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \u201cThe Temple of Gold\u201d in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\u201cIf the book had not been taken,\u201d he told an interviewer, \u201cI would have gone into advertising ... or something.\u201d\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \u201cSoldier in the Rain,\u201d which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play \u201cThe Lion in Winter,\u201d which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \u201cNo Way to Treat a Lady,\u201d and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screen writing. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted his novel \u201cHarper\u201d for a 1966 film starring Paul Newman as a private eye.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d starring Newman and Redford. Based on the exploits of the real-life \u201cHole in the Wall\u201d gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in \u201cThe Hot Rock,\u201d \u2033The Great Waldo Pepper\u201d and \u201cIndecent Proposal.\u201d\n\nOther notable Goldman films included \u201cThe Stepford Wives,\u201d \u2033A Bridge Too Far\u201d and \u201cMisery.\u201d The latter, adapted from a Stephen King suspense novel, won the 1990 Oscar for Kathy Bates as lead actress.\n\nIn 1961 Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, and they had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. The couple divorced in 1991.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist and didn\u2019t rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\u201cA screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\u201d he once said. \u201cAnd except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it\u2019s not an art, it\u2019s a craft.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sara Boboltz", "title": "Florida County Submits Recount 2 Minutes Late And State Rejects It", "description": "Broward County's new numbers probably wouldn't have affected the final results, though.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/broward-county-florida-recount-late_us_5beed993e4b0860184a7c03a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beedb261f0000d505263714.jpeg?cache=yXuuigI9Zu&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:54:24Z", "content": "Volunteers in Broward County, a Democratic stronghold in Florida, recounted hundreds of thousands of votes this week by order of the state but it was all for nothing.

It hasn\u2019t worked. Utilities continue to shutter coal-fired power plants, and mining firms continue to shed workers.\n\nDesperate to throw a lifeline to the coal sector, the administration has considered directly subsidizing coal in the name of national security. Coal-fired power plants, they say, are essential to grid security, as they are uniquely able to withstand a cyber attack or a natural disaster and continue to generate power on demand. But as experts have pointed out, nothing could be further from the truth. As it happens, locally sourced renewable power, not coal, promises the most resilience in the face of a catastrophe.\n\nThat\u2019s why the military has embraced clean energy\u2014for the sake of national security.\n\nA new report from the Association of Defense Communities and Converge Strategies details how military bases are turning to renewables to guard against blackouts in the wake of floods, storms or cyber attack. \u201cThe [Department of Defense] is deploying these projects because of increasing threats to the U.S. electric grid,\u201d said Wilson Rickerson, a principal at Converge Strategies and a co-author of the report.\n\nGeorgia Power The Fort Benning solar facility.\n\nThe report details how adversaries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are developing the ability to launch cyber attacks on critical infrastructure \u2014 Russian hackers have already proven capable for breaking into the power grid. In response, bases are developing microgrids, installing wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and diesel generators that can supply power in the event the grid fails.\n\nRickerson noted that, in many cases, bases are partnering with local developers and electric utilities on renewable energy projects that serve not just the base, but the surrounding community as well. The report describes several instances where microgrids are making bases more resilient, while supplying clean power to nearby homes and businesses.\n\nThe Naval Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport, Mississippi hosts a 29,000-panel solar array that feeds into the power grid. The array is owned by a private company that, in exchange for use of the land, is installing diesel generators and battery storage on site. In the event of a blackout, the generators, battery and solar panels will power the base.\n\nMarine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California features a solar array, battery storage, and gas and diesel generators, as well as two generators that burn gas seeping from a landfill onsite. The microgrid is helping the Marine Corps save money on electricity, and in the event of an emergency, it can can power the entire base for three weeks.\n\nThe Otis Air National Guard base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts boasts the military\u2019s first wind-powered microgrid. The installation, which includes one wind turbine, a diesel generator and battery storage, can power the base for up to 120 hours in the event of an outage. The project was funded in part by the state of Massachusetts, which is working to develop renewable energy on military bases.\n\nEPA A wind turbine powering the Otis Air National Guard base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nThe report encourages more states and cities to partner with military bases on projects like these. \u201cThe partnership models highlighted in this report are powering military missions and can be scaled to benefit surrounding communities and economies,\u201d Rickerson said. Onsite clean-energy projects, the report notes, can create jobs and help limit pollution.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense has made energy resilience a priority, and communities and states who can help achieve this goal will be in a stronger position to retain missions and attract new ones,\u201d said Tim Ford, CEO of the Association for Defense Communities. \u201cIt can also improve the resiliency of communities, which is important when you have 70 percent of military families living off-base.\u201d\n\nUnited States Army The U.S. Army is increasingly deploying solar power in the field. Above, soldiers assemble a solar shade canopy during a training exercise.\n\nIn many ways, the U.S. military stands at the vanguard of the transition to clean energy. Troops in the field have deployed solar power and batteries to reduce their reliance on oil and gas, saving money and helping to guard against attack. Fuel conveys are frequent targets for roadside bombs, and diesel generators can be a liability when under siege. Firsthand experience with clean energy leads many veterans to pursue careers in the industry after they leave the service.\n\nKevin Johnson, an Army veteran who now runs GlidePath Federal Solutions, a developer of resilient energy systems for the Department of Defense, said that when men and women work on a base powered by solar, \u201cThey\u2019re going to see, right there on the base, that solar is viable, that the military finds value from energy security and energy resiliency.\u201d The fact that so many veterans are then drawn to jobs in clean energy is testament to this fact.\n\nFar from making the grid more vulnerable to disasters and attacks, wind, solar and battery storage are making the grid more resilient. The military is helping to prove that.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Kevin Johnson currently runs CleanCapital. He left the company and now runs GlidePath Federal Solutions."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Stateline", "title": "Provisional Ballots Protect Voting Rights \u2014 When They Are Counted", "description": "Provisional ballots often go overlooked, until they make a big difference in a tight race.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/provisional-ballots-voting-rights_us_5beed69ae4b028c7b8274916", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beed6f8240000ae02583576.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:45:17Z", "content": "By Matt Vasilogambros More than a week after Election Day, much remains murky in Georgia and Florida.

Untraditionally, absentee and provisional ballots played a major role in this election.\n\nBy Matt Vasilogambros\n\nMore than a week after Election Day, much remains murky in Georgia and Florida. But one thing is clear: Provisional ballots, often forgotten and minimized, will help determine the results.\n\nProvisional ballots are a proven fail-safe for voters across the country, but their role in the political dramas playing out this week illustrates how the little-understood tool can fall prey to political manipulation.\n\nWhen candidates inaccurately attack provisional ballots as perpetuating voter fraud, they take advantage of a complicated process many Americans don\u2019t understand. And when states decline to count all the provisional ballots or discard some on questionable grounds, then the system doesn\u2019t work for all voters.\n\nCreated by a federal law in 2002, provisional ballots are supposed to be a protection against administrative and technical errors that prevent registered voters from casting a normal ballot on Election Day. In other circumstances, voters cast a provisional ballot if they go to the wrong polling place or, in some states, forget their photo ID.\n\nLocal officials add each one to the tally only after they confirm that it was cast by a registered voter.\n\nRegardless of how close a race is, officials are supposed to verify and count every provisional ballot.\n\nMyrna P\u00e9rez, the deputy director of the democracy program at Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said state and local election officials need to make sure provisional ballot protections are utilized to the fullest.\n\n\u201cThey are supposed to be a fail-safe,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Stateline. \u201cBut if provisional ballots are just placebos, they\u2019re not doing their intended purpose, and they\u2019re just an administrative drain.\u201d\n\nThe number of provisional ballots was \u201cunusually high\u201d in Georgia, testified Michael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, in a court case decided Monday.\n\nIn its lawsuit against the state, Common Cause Georgia, a voting rights group, said the state\u2019s insecure voter registration database may have led to many voters arriving at their polling places to find they were not on the rolls.\n\nOr, the group said, it might just be an issue of competently maintaining databases.\n\nGetting the Full Count\n\nCivil rights activists and Democratic politicians have filed lawsuits in Florida and Georgia seeking to ensure that those states verify and count every ballot \u2014 provisional or otherwise \u2014 before officials certify results.\n\nP\u00e9rez, who was the lead lawyer in the successful case against Georgia, said it was inappropriate for then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp to declare himself the winner in the gubernatorial race with Democrat Stacey Abrams without trying to verify all 21,000 statewide provisional ballots. (Kemp declared victory in the gubernatorial race and stepped down from the secretary of state position.)\n\n\u201cThis is an important case because it lays bare the challenges and gross needs in how we use provisional ballots in Georgia,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Florida, too, a large amount of provisional ballots factored into tightening the state\u2019s elections for governor and U.S. Senate, triggering a statewide recount. But thousands more may not have been counted because of a signature mismatch with official state registration records.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, seeking re-election, filed a lawsuit to count thousands of absentee and provisional ballots in his race that were not counted because voters\u2019 signatures did not match state records.\n\nProvisional ballots may end up making a difference in these races.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2016, 79 percent of midterm provisional ballots and 69 percent of presidential provisional ballots were counted, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. In 2016 alone, U.S. voters cast 2.4 million provisional ballots, the commission found.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a manager in the Election Law Reform Initiative at the right-leaning think tank Heritage Foundation, helped congressional staffers create the provisional ballot protection in his role at the Justice Department in 2002.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the provisional ballot,\u201d von Spakovsky said, \u201cwas to make sure that people didn\u2019t lose their right to vote because of a mistake made by election officials.\u201d\n\nSixteen years later, said Thessalia Merivaki, an assistant professor of American politics at Mississippi State University, the primary reason voters cast a provisional ballot is that there is no record of the voter\u2019s registration in poll books. This may be caused by administrative error. Counties and states need to do a better job, she said, of maintaining and modernizing registration databases.\n\nThat may include encouraging more states to join the Election Registration Information Center, a nonprofit that identifies people who may need to update their registration information because they either moved or are considered inactive voters.\n\n(The Pew Charitable Trusts, which funds Stateline, helped launch the center in 2012 through logistical and financial support. It is now independently run and funded by state contributions.)\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of evidence provisional ballots are working as a fail-safe,\u201d Merivaki said. \u201cBut proactive states maintain clear and accurate registration rolls.\u201d\n\nLocal officials, while verifying each individual provisional ballot, can check county databases or reach out to voters for more information, like proof of residence from a utility bill. In some states, voters may be required to verify their registration in person after the election.\n\nVerification can take anywhere from hours to 21 days after polls close, depending on the state, as local election administrators compare the provisional ballot to registration databases, driver\u2019s license records or social security information, Merivaki said. Some states allow voters to correct any wrong information that may have forced them to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nProvisional ballots are most often rejected because the voter isn\u2019t actually registered, the election assistance panel has found. In some states, casting a provisional ballot in an incorrect precinct, lacking a signature on a ballot or illegible handwriting may prompt officials to reject a provisional ballot.\n\nThese policies, however, vary by state. Idaho, Minnesota and New Hampshire, which all have same-day voter registration, are exempt by federal law from issuing provisional ballots. And in nearly 20 states, provisional ballots cast in incorrect jurisdictions are partially counted for statewide and countywide races.\n\nA Better Way?\n\nProvisional ballots may help protect certain voters who have been disenfranchised by strict voting laws.\n\nMinorities vote using provisional ballots more often in some places around the country, a 2014 report from the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress found. In 16 states, the report found, counties with high rates of minority voters used provisional ballots more often than predominantly white counties.\n\nRestrictive voting laws, difficult voting procedures and poorly maintained registration lists all contribute to the heavy use of provisional ballots, according to the report.\n\nThe authors of the report also said, noting that around a quarter of provisional ballots are rejected, that the prospect of minority voices being silenced in the electoral process is \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, provisional ballots can slow down the voting process.\n\nIn a 2013 review of election procedures ordered by President Barack Obama, long lines at polling places were partially blamed on a high volume of provisional ballots. Stricter voting laws, like registration purges and voter ID, can lead to more voters using provisional ballots and slow the process, the study found.\n\nTo reduce the number of provisional ballots cast every election, some elections observers have suggested changes to registration procedures. In its 2014 report, the Center for American Progress recommended states modernize voter registration databases, implement same-day registration, provide online voter registration and expand early voting.\n\nThe left-leaning think tank Demos, which is based in New York, agrees that same-day registration can help cut down on provisional ballots. However, its analysts also recommend states partially count ballots that were cast in the wrong precinct. This would allow registered voters to participate in a state or federal contest for which they were qualified to vote had they gone to the correct precinct.\n\nA partial count, though, was never the intention of the provisional ballot protection when it was created, said von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation.\n\nProvisional ballots remain an important aspect of elections, Mississippi State\u2019s Merivaki said, and those votes are just as valuable as ones from regular ballots. It\u2019s something she wants officials in Florida, Georgia and around the country to understand."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Samantha Montano", "title": "Trump's Response To The California Wildfires Isn't Just Inaccurate.

Instead, he offered an explanation for the wildfires \u2015 California\u2019s \u201cpoor forest management\u201d \u2015 and threatened to withhold federal recovery funds.\n\nPoor forest management is a nod to logging interests and, for reasons others have pointed out, is not the root cause of California\u2019s year-round wildfire problem.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s comment isn\u2019t just factually inaccurate. It signals a larger problem that should be of major concern to those of us who want to prevent future disasters like this one.\n\nIncorrectly placing blame on \u201cpoor forest management\u201d keeps the American public from understanding the actual cause of the wildfires. This matters, because if we don\u2019t understand our risk, we can\u2019t take the appropriate steps to minimize or eliminate those risks going forward.\n\nGene Blevins / Reuters Firefighters prepare to hose down flames as the Woolsey fire consumes a condo unit in Malibu, California, on Nov. 9, 2018.\n\nThe president\u2019s comment adds to a long history of denying or misunderstanding the causes of disasters. At one point, disasters were considered \u201cacts of God.\u201d They were thought to be events that could not be stopped, retribution for all manner of sins.\n\nAs science evolved, so too did our understanding of the natural world. With advancements in fields like seismology, meteorology and volcanology, we began to understand that hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes and volcanoes are a part of our natural world. A town wasn\u2019t shaking because the residents had angered God; it was shaking because residents were living next to a fault line. And thus, the term \u201cacts of God\u201d was replaced by \u201cnatural disasters.\u201d\n\nIn more recent decades, disaster researchers have built on the work of hazard scientists studying exactly what turns a natural hazard into a disaster. What is it that makes an earthquake destroy an entire city? Why do some homes stay standing while others fall? Why do some neighborhoods flood when they never have before? Why do some countries recover more quickly than others?\n\nIt\u2019s not God. It\u2019s not just nature. It\u2019s us.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve come to understand is that earthquakes, wildfires and hurricanes are not, by themselves, disasters. It\u2019s only when these hazards interact with our communities that the potential for disaster arises.\n\nIn other words, disasters are a result of a hazard\u2019s effects on our built environment, our laws and policies, and other decisions people have made.\n\nIt\u2019s not God. It\u2019s not just nature. It\u2019s us.\n\nThis revelation actually is empowering. It means that disasters aren\u2019t necessarily inevitable. There are things we can do to mitigate our risk and prevent a disaster\u2019s worst impacts. We can change our actions. We can build disaster-resistant homes and infrastructure. We can relocate to places that face fewer risks. We can change our laws and policies and make different decisions to minimize our risk \u2015 from wildfires in California to hurricanes in Texas to sea-level rise in Boston.\n\nIn the past, America largely took a reactive approach to disaster management. We\u2019ve done relatively little across the country to adequately mitigate our risk, instead choosing to deal with the consequences of disasters once they\u2019ve already happened. With a more comprehensive understanding of the cause of disasters, we have a chance to be more proactive.\n\nThe president\u2019s comment adds to a long history of denying or misunderstanding the causes of disasters.\n\nIn fact, mitigating our risk is an integral part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s first strategic goal in its plan released this year. The need for mitigation has repeatedly been articulated by FEMA Administrator Brock Long, appointed by Trump himself. Long, testifying before Congress after the devastating 2017 hurricane season, explained: \u201cPre-disaster mitigation is the key to becoming more resilient and reducing disaster impacts.\u201d\n\nWe know that stricter building codes, land-use policies, community infrastructure projects (like levees), and individual actions (like raising homes in floodplains) can pay off, but we need to invest in it \u2015 and we need to invest correctly. That starts by understanding the cause of our risk.\n\nSo, when people, including the president, ignore \u2015 or worse, deny \u2015 the cause of disaster, our ability to protect ourselves and our communities is undermined.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet about the California wildfires continues his pattern of misleading, obscuring, ignoring or blatantly denying the realities of disasters during his tenure. From his rejection of the official death toll in Puerto Rico to revoking policies that contribute to national climate adaptation efforts, the president has repeatedly pushed a new wave of disaster misinformation.\n\nThe knowledge that humans are not powerless against disasters gives us the ability to make informed decisions to keep ourselves and our communities safe, especially as we increasingly experience the consequences of the climate crisis.\n\nDenying our risk doesn\u2019t make it go away. It just makes it harder for us to protect our communities."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Yahoo News", "title": "George Conway: Trump Administration \u2018Like A S**tshow In A Dumpster Fire\u2019", "description": "\u201cI think the Republican Party has become something of a personality cult.\u201d", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-conway-trump-yahoo-interview_us_5beede44e4b0860184a7d09d", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beedffb20000057060293d9.jpeg?cache=oiiizmrpwe&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:38:10Z", "content": "WASHINGTON George T.

Its broader lawsuit concerns whether the White House\u2019s decision to revoke his press pass was unconstitutional.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year, said CNN\u2019s attorneys were likely to prevail in their argument that the White House had violated Acosta\u2019s and the network\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nKelly said he did not decide whether the White House violated the First Amendment, relying primarily on the Fifth Amendment in saying that Acosta\u2019s and CNN\u2019s right to due process was likely violated because the White House process for revoking his press pass was \u201cshrouded in mystery.\u201d\n\nThe judge also cited the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Acosta. The White House had argued that CNN could simply send other reporters in Acosta\u2019s place, yet Kelly argued that it \u201cdoes not make the harm to Mr. Acosta any less real.\u201d\n\nUnder the ruling, Acosta will temporarily receive his press pass back, while the full lawsuit proceeds.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the White House \u201cwill temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass.\u201d\n\nBut in a statement, she also appeared to view the temporary ruling as a victory: \u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\u201d\n\nSanders added that \u201cwe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\u201d\n\nTrump also told reporters at the White House: \u201cWe want total freedom of the press. It\u2019s more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect when you\u2019re at the White House.\u201d\n\nCNN on Tuesday sued the Trump administration for confiscating Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which grants White House press pool reporters access to the White House, following a spat between the president and Acosta during a post-midterm elections press conference last week.\n\nIn a hearing in federal court on Wednesday, Justice Department attorney James Burnham said the president has the authority to ban reporters from the White House, The Washington Post reported.\n\nBurnham also argued that Acosta can continue reporting on the Trump administration from outside the White House and noted that CNN has other reporters with White House credentials.\n\nShannon Finney via Getty Images A judge ruled in favor of CNN and reporter Jim Acosta.\n\nIn response, CNN attorney Ted Boutrous said the government had a \u201cwarped view\u201d of the First and Fifth amendments.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s now taking the position that [the president] can do anything he wants,\u201d Boutrous said, according to the Post.\n\nAfter Acosta challenged Trump with questions on his anti-immigration rhetoric and the federal Russia investigation last week, Trump demanded Acosta sit down and called him a \u201cterrible person\u201d and \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nDuring the exchange, Acosta also moved away when a female intern tried to take away the microphone he was using. The White House suspended Acosta\u2019s credentials hours after the press conference, citing his behavior toward Trump and the intern.\n\nKelly on Friday seemed unpersuaded, calling the White House\u2019s initial justification \u201cof questionable accuracy\u201d and \u201clikely untrue.\u201d\n\nThe White House later shifted its story to claim that Acosta was rude to reporters.\n\nA group of prominent news organizations have expressed support for CNN\u2019s lawsuit, including CNN competitor Fox News, which frequently provides favorable news coverage of Trump.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Fox News President Jay Wallace said the network would file an amicus brief in favor of CNN\u2019s \u201clegal effort\u201d with the U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\n\u201cSecret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\u201d Wallace said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News and The Associated Press also backed CNN\u2019s lawsuit."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Zeba Blay", "title": "\u2018Widows\u2019 Is A Stylish Heist Movie That\u2019s Actually About Post-2016 America", "description": "It's more than a genre movie starring Viola Davis and Liam Neeson.

They are neither pedantic nor moralistic, and they often say something about the culture as it stands far more profoundly than any \u201cCrash\u201d or \u201cAmerican History X\u201d ever could.\n\nThis is the case with \u201cWidows.\u201d\n\nAs Steve McQueen\u2019s follow-up to \u201c12 Years A Slave,\u201d the movie might seem like a wild departure from his last three films. (The overtly socio-political \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cHunger\u201d round out his body of work.) \u201cWidows\u201d is, and has been heavily sold as, an action heist movie. Yet deliberate threads link \u201cWidows\u201d in more ways to the messages of \u201c12 Years\u201d than to those of, say, \u201cOcean\u2019s 8.\u201d\n\nThe movie, written by McQueen and Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, is loosely based on a U.K. soap series that ran for two seasons in the 1980s. Far from the campy \u201cWidows\u201d of 1983, this iteration of the story is grittier, more violent, less sleek. A group of women, led by Viola Davis\u2019 character Veronica, lose their husbands after a job gone wrong and, in order to settle some scores and start their new lives, endeavor to carry out one last heist themselves. Trailers for the movie feature explosions, high-speed chases, ominous villains and Viola Davis spewing one-liners like, \u201cNo one thinks we have the balls to pull this off!\u201d\n\nBeyond the quips and pyrotechnics, the movie is a fascinating blend of genre \u2015 of the heist movie and political drama. Veronica must recruit her fellow widows to pull off a $5 million job partly because she\u2019s broke and partly because a Chicago gangster-turned-politician is looking for the $2 million her husband Harry Rawlins (Liam Neeson) stole before he died. They have one month to pull off the heist and pay back the money, or face consequences.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the surface of \u201cWidows.\u201d A concise, spoiler-free summary misses the undercurrent of political and racial tension bubbling beneath the cinematic portrait of post-2016 America.\n\nIf the biggest consequence of the election was a grim amplification of power imbalances (previously more obvious to some than it was to others), then \u201cWidows\u201d can be read as an allegory of that imbalance. It\u2019s a story about who we choose to empower and what happens when we do. It\u2019s a story about the inexorable shifting of paradigms and who we consider heroes. It\u2019s about the tension of power between real people \u2015 between black women and white men in love, between white women who seem oblivious to their own privilege and black women who do not, between black men seeking power and white men who have always had it.\n\nIdentity and desire form two ends of each tug of war, a dynamic that is evident in several scenes throughout \u201cWidows.\u201d Like when Veronica seeks shelter in the home of fellow widow Alice (played by Elizabeth Debicki), then upbraids Alice for seeing a new, rich man so soon after her husband\u2019s death. The conversation gets heated, and she slaps the younger woman. Alice slaps her back. In 2018, a scene in which a black woman slaps a white girl for disrespecting her and the white girl slaps her right back, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m not getting pushed around by anyone anymore,\u201d is heavy with irony. The irony isn\u2019t a mistake.\n\nNeither is an earlier scene, in which Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), a gangster running for city alderman, pays a visit to Veronica to find out why her husband stole $2 million dollars from him and where that money is. He walks menacingly around Veronica\u2019s swanky apartment (that she doesn\u2019t even own), and teases her about the years she spent as the wife of a wealthy white criminal. Now that her husband is dead, he says, \u201cYou\u2019re nothing now. Welcome back.\u201d\n\nIn spite of their posturing and their violence, the technical bad guys end up being just cogs in a machine.\n\nSo much in this film hinges on that \u201cwelcome back,\u201d the idea that in America, proximity to greatness is proximity to whiteness and the power it affords; this idea that the power of whiteness is like a door one walks through, and for some, that door is either always open or always closed. This is, after all, what Jamal himself intimates when his brother asks him why he wants to go into politics, pivoting away from what, up until this point, has been a lucrative life of crime.\n\n\u201cI want what they have\u201d is Jamal\u2019s explanation. \u201cPower.\u201d\n\nFor the widows, the kind of power Jamal references has always been accessible to them by association \u2015 not by birthright, not by taking it. Even Veronica, with her ultimate proximity to whiteness, still grieves the reality of this by way of the death of her son, murdered by police while driving his father\u2019s expensive car \u2015 a scene that is as brutal as it is telling about the world which the characters inhabit, a world so much like our own.\n\nVeronica, like the other wives, has been backed into a corner, a cage not of her own making. She\u2019s grieving, broke, and her life is in danger. Like her, every character in this film is yearning for more than her lot in life, even though, as Jamal tells Veronica, \u201cNothing you do is going to change your situation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scene halfway through the film where, after a disastrous political rally in a rough neighborhood of the 18th Ward, candidate Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) rides home in the backseat of a swanky black car with his campaign-manager-slash-lover. Over the course of five minutes, several things play out at once: We watch the car move through a dilapidated black neighborhood, slowly, into the rich part of town where he lives. The vista changes before our eyes gradually and yet so suddenly it\u2019s hard to remember where the poor neighborhood ended and the rich neighborhood began.\n\nWe hear Farrell\u2019s character repeatedly ask his lover if she\u2019s ever slept with a black man. We hear him lament the point of campaigning at all, giving that \u201cThese people are killing each other.\u201d But we never see his face. Instead, the camera remains focused on the expressionless face of the car\u2019s driver, a black man, as Jack groans, \u201cWhat are we fighting for?\u201d\n\nThis is the American question. In this great experiment, every one, at every level of society, asks it. And every one thinks they have the answer. In this way, \u201cWidows\u201d is an American movie because it asks the question in a rhetorical sense. The film provides no real answers, even after we\u2019ve explored the political and criminal underbellies of a wider machine powered by racial tension, by money, by the selfishness of (white) men.\n\nSpeaking of white men \u2015 there\u2019s a twist near the end of the film that, if you really consider it, is only shocking for a few terrible seconds. Then it makes complete sense. Veronica, visiting the apartment of a widow who never joined the heist, knows intrinsically what lies behind a mysterious closed bedroom door after her little white dog crazily scratches against it.\n\nHer reaction, her despair and her unwillingness to open the door, cements the inevitability of betrayal. It echoes something implicit: in 2018, is there anyone we trust less than powerful white men?\n\nWhite men are not the outright villains in the heist plot of \u201cWidows.\u201d The Manning brothers occupy that character space for most of the film in a chilling double act that deserves its own analysis. Instead, white men are symbols for the ubiquitous nature of white male power. In spite of their posturing and their violence, the technical bad guys end up being just cogs in a machine. White men, however, are the machine.\n\nIt\u2019s the moment that turns the movie \u2015 a really well-done heist, a political thriller \u2015 into something completely different: a dirty mirror to the present day.\n\nIn the movie\u2019s final showdown, one I won\u2019t spoil in full here, Veronica hears the following words, a confession that, at its core, is American too: \u201cI couldn\u2019t save us. So I had to take care of me!\u201d\n\nThe excuse represents a less idyllic version of America, an America in which powerful white men will gladly throw others under the bus if it means securing their own futures. In the past, we were taught to root for these men. But in \u201cWidows,\u201d in post-2016 America, a paradigm has shifted. We\u2019re rooting for Veronica now, as she shoots her assailant before he can shoot her. It\u2019s the moment that turns the movie \u2015 a really well-done heist, a political thriller \u2015 into something completely different: a dirty mirror to the present day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many white folks cheer for someone[\u2019s] demise,\u201d a friend of mine wrote of the scene on Twitter. \u201cThe applause was so loud I thought it was in my head.\u201d\n\nAll art, intentional or not, is a reflection of the times in which it was created. \u201cWidows\u201d was greenlit a year and a half before the election, but it was written and filmed once Trump was in office. What \u201cWidows\u201d does, above all else, is demonstrate the potential of genre film to reflect culture without outlining in painstaking detail every terrible thing that\u2019s gone down in the last two years. This is the true potential of genre \u2015 it lends itself to symbolizing our times in ways both subtle and unsubtle, so that something like a heist movie can serve as both entertainment and commentary without complication."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "Michelle Obama And Jimmy Kimmel Shade Melania Trump", "description": "The current first lady's role in firing an administration official led to some digs on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-michelle-obama_us_5beec166e4b0c19de3ff0094", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beec9a82000005b060293cf.png?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:15:45Z", "content": "Former first lady Michelle Obama threw some shade at successor Melania Trump on Thursday\u2019s \u201c Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d but she was led into it by the late-night host. \u201cIf you wanted to get someone in your husband\u2019s administration fired, how would you do that?\u201d Kimm\u2026 [+1013 chars]", "fulltext": "Former first lady Michelle Obama threw some shade at successor Melania Trump on Thursday\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d \u2015 but she was led into it by the late-night host.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to get someone in your husband\u2019s administration fired, how would you do that?\u201d Kimmel asked in the clip above.

The Democrats longshot strat\u2026 [+6514 chars]", "fulltext": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign and legal team is preparing an unprecedented legal challenge in the unresolved Georgia governor\u2019s race that could leave the state\u2019s Supreme Court deciding whether to force another round of voting.\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s longshot strategy relies on a statute that\u2019s never been used in such a high-stakes contest. It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that\u2019s been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn\u2019t finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams\u2019 campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \u201cmisconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\u201d\n\nThe legal team is \u201cconsidering all options,\u201d Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor\u2019s mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don\u2019t regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\u201cThese stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\u201d said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\u201d\n\nKemp, who served as the state\u2019s chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won\u2019t change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams\u2019 legal maneuvers so far a \u201cdisgrace to democracy\u201d and an attempt to \u201ccount illegal votes.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp\u2019s unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump\u2019s nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp\u2019s 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn\u2019t show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University\u2019s law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\u201cI would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\u201d Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams\u2019 team doesn\u2019t have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \u201cdoubt\u201d to the election. \u201cWould a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\u201d she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \u201can architect of suppression.\u201d\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \u201cthe real extreme remedy.\u201d\n\nA more \u201csurgical\u201d course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that\u2019s unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there\u2019s no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Claire Fallon", "title": "Let HBO\u2019s \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 Turn You Into A Socialist", "description": "Consciousness can be raised through any medium, including one that can cost over $100 a month.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-socialist-is-hbos-my-brilliant-friend_us_5bec8e7ae4b0dbb7ea66ca9e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec907e220000bb04de3c9e.jpeg?cache=GmeRJFQ38p&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:00:02Z", "content": "Socialist prestige TV is here.

Yes, consciousness can be raised through any medium, including one that costs over $100* a month, like premium cable. Bit by bit, anti-capitalist sentiments have been worming their way into the most vital cultural product of our era, from Samin Nosrat\u2019s Netflix cooking show \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat\u201d to, most recently, HBO\u2019s new series adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, \u201cMy Brilliant Friend.\u201d\n\nThe series, like the first novel in Ferrante\u2019s quartet, is told by Elena \u201cLen\u00f9\u201d Greco, an older woman reflecting on her girlhood in a working-class neighborhood in 1950s Naples. In her retelling, little Len\u00f9 befriends Raffaela \u201cLila\u201d Cerullo, the daughter of a cobbler and the cleverest girl in her class. Len\u00f9, also a top student, is impressed by her rival\u2019s brains, but by also her rebellious spirit and courage; early on, Lila shows little patience for bullies or social norms. The two become inseparable as children and cling to a fraught but profound friendship even as, through adolescence and young adulthood, their paths diverge: Len\u00f9 continues her education and grows more detached from the mundane violence of their neighborhood. Lila is forced to give up formal schooling and becomes immersed in attempts to better her condition, both through socialist ideology and schemes to design and sell superior shoes from her father\u2019s shop.\n\nIf Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels had been published under a man\u2019s name, if they had featured a friendship between two poor but clever boys from Naples or perhaps if they\u2019d come to the U.S. just a few years later, conversations about the quartet would have begun with its keen-eyed explorations of Italian politics \u2015 specifically, socialist organizing. It\u2019s a central, inescapable concern of the series. In a Jacobin article this April, Dawn Tefft praised Ferrante as \u201cthe organizer\u2019s organizer.\u201d The later books, set amid the political upheaval of Italy in the 1970s, dwell upon the logistics of organizing factory workers, the roles of the privileged and oppressed in activist spaces, the urgency and crushing impossibility of revolution.\n\nInstead, Ferrante\u2019s blockbuster series came to American shores amid a pop feminist enthusiasm for female friendship \u2015 girl squads, BFFs, even the fragile, perilous joys of a frenemyship like that of narrator Len\u00f9 and her \u201cbrilliant friend\u201d Lila. In the mainstream, feminism was ascendant and somehow entangled with capitalism, an egalitarian movement that manifested in reverence for leaning in, girl bosses and millennial pink merch emblazoned with pro-woman slogans. The socialist concerns of the novels, to many, appeared more as historical detail than a theme with contemporary significance.\n\nThe context has changed. Socialism, as my colleague Zach Carter put it recently, is good now, and that means the economic politics of the books no longer register as historical backdrop but as open questions. \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is coming to HBO at a moment when America is newly ready to see its socialist themes \u2015 and Saverio Costanzo\u2019s adaptation of the novel, coproduced by HBO and Italian network RAI, doesn\u2019t hide them.\n\nTranslating a novel to the screen, especially one as meditative as My Brilliant Friend, is a process bedeviled by the shifting ratios of interiority and exteriority. If a character\u2019s perception and anxiety and contemplation fill up the pages of the book, meaningful gazes might be all the action that makes its way on screen. We do, indeed, often see Len\u00f9, the audience surrogate portrayed by Elisa Del Genio and later Margherita Mazzucco, lost in silent thought, staring mournfully or even blankly. Her occasional voice-over narration fills in certain gaps, clarifies her bittersweet adoration for Lila (Ludovica Nasti and Gaia Girace) and her intellectual insecurities. But inevitably, the clamor of Len\u00f9\u2019s lifelong obsession with her friend fades on camera. What can be more easily heard, in this relative hush, are the political conversations that Ferrante was already having in My Brilliant Friend.\n\nTake, for example, the violent thrall in which the neighborhood is held by Don Achille Caracci, and later by the Solara family. The menace of these wealthy men is deeply woven into the novels, but on-screen the screams of terror that accompany street brawls and enforcement beatings are more jarring than they are when mediated by Len\u00f9\u2019s pensive, even narration. These men control capital, and therefore they are able to both continue to accumulate more wealth and operate with near impunity in a mostly impoverished neighborhood. As the series opens, carpenter Alfredo Peluso has lost his business because of predatory loans from Don Achille; he\u2019s left ruined and bitter, with nowhere to turn. The Solaras, who operate the only bar in town, offer him a job and scheme to loosen Don Achille\u2019s grip on the neighborhood. But nothing else changes when power switches hands, except which men everyone else must fear.\n\nWe may balk at seeing the economy of post-war Italy, which operated under quite different conditions, as an object lesson in the failings of capitalism for Americans today. But the way capital works in the neighborhood\u2019s marketplaces should look familiar in many ways. Those who have money are able to invest in schemes to get more of it; those who don\u2019t have money struggle simply to stay out of debt. Those who have money commit crimes without facing consequences; those without money have little choice but to stay silent.\n\nEduardo Castaldo / HBO Ludovica Nasti as young Lila and Elisa Del Genio as young Elena.\n\nEducation offers an escape to Len\u00f9 and Lila, who are (Lila in particular) uncommonly bright. Their teacher, Maestra Oliviero, quickly observes how much potential they have and presses their parents to allow them to continue to middle school when most of their peers will end their education to start working or helping their mothers with housework. But, we\u2019re bluntly reminded, if education is an opportunity to rise out of the working class, that means it is also a mechanism for maintaining a stratified society. Maestra Oliviero wants to pull Lila and Len\u00f9 out of the suffocating muck of their poor neighborhood, but when Lila is forced to give up on formal schooling in episode two, \u201cMoney,\u201d the teacher dismisses her former pupil in cruelly classist terms.\n\n\u201cElena, do you know what the plebs are?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe plebs are quite a nasty thing. And if someone wishes to remain a plebeian, he, his children, and the children of his children deserve nothing. Listen to me carefully: Forget Cerullo, and think of yourself.\u201d\n\nHer attentive care to these girls, one realizes with the force of a slap, comes from the stock she puts in the marketplace value of a sharp mind. Those who lack obvious promise for more lucrative, educated work do not merit concern. Even Lila\u2019s boundless curiosity, her autodidactic habits and her creative gifts earn no consideration from her teacher unless they are funneled through the traditional education system toward middle-class success. Maestra Oliviero\u2019s dismissal, in fact, comes in response to Len\u00f9\u2019s presenting her with a beautiful little book, \u201cThe Blue Fairy,\u201d that Lila wrote and illustrated.\n\nThe disdain toward the lower classes, and anxious attachment to the current social order, is not universal in the girls\u2019 neighborhood. The ruined carpenter Alfredo Peluso and his son Pasquale, a friend of Lila\u2019s and Len\u00f9\u2019s, are rumored to be Communists and are accordingly treated as dangerous. When Pasquale pays some ambiguously romantic attention to Len\u00f9 at a library event, both her parents and Maestra Oliviero sharply insist that she not associate with him. Lila, who refuses to be resigned to the exploitative rule of Don Achille or the Solaras, is intrigued by Pasquale\u2019s politics. After they leave a dance party where the Solara men threw their weight around and stole a dance with Lila, Pasquale issues a trembling rant to his friends about how the wealthy family ran a black market in their bar, and how they \u201cgathered votes for monarchists and fascists.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople talk and don\u2019t know anything. You know a lot of things,\u201d Lila tells him plainly. \u201cExplain it to me. What are monarchists? And fascists? And what\u2019s the black market?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain people made money from people\u2019s hunger during the war,\u201d he responds. \u201cThey sold bread, pasta, coffee, at exorbitant prices. People were forced to buy them to survive. Everything you see, the houses, the cars, the buildings, they bought it all by fleecing from someone else.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unusually didactic moment for a TV show \u2015 a mini-seminar on the evils of price-gouging, a first step toward radicalization \u2015 and while it\u2019s fairly faithfully rendered from the book, it\u2019s no longer delivered through murky layers of Len\u00f9\u2019s recollection and interpretation.\n\nIn the book, for example, the scene concludes with Lila\u2019s questions. When Len\u00f9 continues her narration, she is filled with uncertainty and preoccupied with her own past and present emotions surrounding the event: \u201c[O]n me, at the time,\u201d she recalls, Pasquale\u2019s answers \u201chad no concrete effect. But [Lila], in her usual way, was so moved and altered by them, so that for the entire summer she tormented me with a single concept that I found quite unbearable.\u201d The reader experiences this moment as an impressionistic portrayal of political awakening.\n\nBut in the show, the viewer experiences Pasquale\u2019s speech as directly as Lila does, as a transfer of knowledge and a call to arms. At moments like this, the adaptation errs on the side of bluntness, leaving no doubt of its socialist interests.

In his senior year, she recalled in interviews, he sexually assaulted her in a rage \u2015 groping her stomach and buttocks \u2015 because she was holding his cellphone. It was not the first time his behavior scared her, but it was the most serious, and she felt she had to act.\n\nSo she kicked him off the team. Soon, she said, colleagues at her school pressured her to change her mind. They said that his future was at stake, that he might not get into the Marines because of her. One administrator even told her that because she was young and attractive, it was no surprise that the incident happened. She should just let it go.\n\nThe message was clear: His unrealized potential was more important than her pain. And so she allowed him back on the team.\n\n\u201cI was pressured and guilted, and I gave in,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is no more effective way to silence a woman than by telling her that she will ruin a man\u2019s future with her words. It triggers a flurry of self-doubt: Maybe she is overreacting. Maybe she misunderstood. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t make a fuss. It plays on women\u2019s shame, often present after a sexual assault.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Colell caved in to her co-workers.\n\n\u201cIt is really easy to push women over the line of doubting themselves,\u201d said Stefanie Johnson, a professor at the University of Colorado who has studied sexual harassment. \u201cPeople often question themselves a little bit \u2014 \u2018What did I do to bring this on?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor ages, women have been socialized to put others before themselves, said Tali Mendelberg, a Princeton political scientist who has written about women\u2019s voices in society.\n\n\u201cWe are taught that men\u2019s careers take priority over women\u2019s needs, because everyone\u2019s welfare is best served when men achieve,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen and children still tend to depend on men to be the main provider.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, milder forms of sexual aggression have been seen as a natural prerogative of men \u2015 \u201cboys will be boys\u201d \u2015 and merely a minor inconvenience for women, Mendelberg added. When women decide to speak out about such behavior, they risk being seen as petty and vindictive.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University in California, knew all this when she decided to go public during the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh with her allegation that he sexually assaulted her when they were teens.\n\nThe backlash was intense and immediate. Ford was accused of trying to ruin his life. Random people on the internet debated whether she was a liar or an attention whore or was simply crazy. President Donald Trump mocked her. At least one Republican senator said that even if she was telling the truth, her allegation shouldn\u2019t derail Kavanaugh\u2019s career at this stage in his life. Kavanaugh declared himself the victim, claiming that his family was \u201cpermanently destroyed\u201d by the allegations against him.\n\nThe problem with doing something wrong and not getting in trouble for it is that you\u2019ve been told that what you did was acceptable. Stefanie Johnson, professor at the University of Colorado\n\nIt has been a month and a half since Kavanaugh and Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and their fortunes have significantly diverged. Kavanaugh is now a Supreme Court justice.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford is still being harassed. She has had to move four times. And she hasn\u2019t been able to return to her school to teach.\n\n\u201cMy real reaction to all of these cases where people are worried about the men\u2019s careers is that we don\u2019t spend any time considering the women\u2019s careers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWomen are being driven out of their jobs.\u201d\n\nWhen men\u2019s careers are valued over women\u2019s lives, dangerous men are free to find even more people to prey on without consequence, as a recent long-form story on former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar from New York magazine\u2019s The Cut so eloquently reveals.\n\nOne of Nassar\u2019s first victims, Larissa Boyce, tried to sound the alarm about his behavior. She told her coach that Nassar was touching her inappropriately, under the guise of medical treatment. Her coach dismissed her concerns, telling her she just didn\u2019t understand what he was doing. If she went forward with her allegations, she said, it would have serious consequences.\n\nNot just for her but for Nassar.\n\nThe insinuation was obvious: Did she really want to be the one who derailed his career? Boyce, only 16 years old, let it go. Now more than 20 years later, nearly 500 women have come forward with similar stories.\n\nIt is chilling to imagine what might have happened if Boyce had been taken seriously back then, her teenage complaint deemed as important as Nassar\u2019s reputation.\n\nOr to imagine what might have happened if the Thousand Oaks shooter faced real consequences for sexually assaulting his coach. How would things have changed if his coach\u2019s safety had been valued as highly as his potential future?\n\nMaybe he wouldn\u2019t have gotten into the military. Maybe he would have received help. Maybe that shooting wouldn\u2019t have happened."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Joseph Fox", "title": "The Once Hated Wolf Could Now Save A Struggling Community", "description": "Wolf tourism is bringing more benefits than hunting.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wolf-tourism-hunting-spain-zamora_us_5bd06b3fe4b055bc9486e617", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bede7c62000005e0602939c.jpeg?cache=kngf7zj1tf&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:50:00Z", "content": "SAN PEDRO DE LAS HERRERIAS, Spain I meet Javier Taleg\u00f3n and the other wolf enthusiasts at 6:30 a.m. in the blink-and-you-miss-it town on the eastern fringe of the Sierra de la Culebra in the province of Zamora in northwestern Spain.

This undulating mountain range, whose name translates as \u201csnake mountains,\u201d slides over the border into neighboring Portugal.\n\nTaleg\u00f3n, an expert and guide, is keen to get moving. He bundles us into a couple of waiting cars packed with tripods and telescopic equipment, and we set off for a nearby ridge, where he says we\u2019ll have the best chance of spotting a wolf. Time is of the essence, as the mostly nocturnal wolf we are here to see tends to move only at nightfall and early in the day.\n\nWe spend the next two hours in a line and in silence. Our eyes are glued to telescopes, but a dense fog that has engulfed the ground beneath the ridge hampers our vision. Then, just when silence starts to give way to the mumblings of small talk, Taleg\u00f3n spots something. It\u2019s a wolf, a male, and it\u2019s about a mile away on the farthest ridge in front of us.\n\nJoseph Fox Wolf watchers train their telescopes in the hope of spotting wolves.\n\nNext to me, a biology student from the nearby city of Salamanca who has been going to see the wolves for a couple of years beams and says, \u201cI come here because I like nature, animals in particular, and wolves are definitely nice ones. It\u2019s always amazing being able to see them in the wild.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the people of this region haven\u2019t shared his enthusiasm for the wolves. Shot at to protect farmers\u2019 sheep and a favorite target of hunters, wolves have long been considered vermin. After centuries of decline, the wolf population had fallen to just a few hundred by the 1970s, says Taleg\u00f3n.\n\nBut as this rural slice of Spain reels from depopulation, with young people leaving in droves for jobs in bigger towns and cities and the effects of the financial crisis of 2008 still lingering, much of the once heavily farmed area has fallen back to the wilds of the sierra.\n\nThe result? Fewer sheep, meaning less conflict, meaning more wolves. Now Sierra de la Culebra is considered one of the best places in the world to see wolves in the wild.\n\nJoseph Fox As farming declines in Sierra de la Culebra in northwestern Spain, the area has returned to wilderness, and wolves have returned with it.\n\nExact numbers are hard to pin down, but it\u2019s believed there are now about 2,000 wolves in Spain, with some 60 percent of the population found in the Castile and Le\u00f3n region. Wolf tourism has subsequently seen a rise, and while official figures on its financial contribution are hard to come by, Taleg\u00f3n, who conducted a study with other wolf experts, estimates it generates annual revenue of about $500,000 for the area.\n\nEven if not quite everyone is on board, the once reviled wolf could ironically be one of the region\u2019s saviors, providing an unexpected boost to the local economy as well as helping rewild the landscape.\n\nJoseph Fox Wolf tourism has been on the rise in Villardeciervos in the Spanish province of Zamora.\n\nIn what is arguably the most thriving town in the region, Villardeciervos, an incongruous hot-pink tourist coach is parked in the main square. From it pour 40 or so tourists who have stopped at the Remesal hotel bar, where they refuel on ham croquettes and tortillas, surrounded by pictures of hungry-looking wolves.\n\nIt\u2019s here I meet Lorenzo Jim\u00e9nez, the local supermarket owner, the mayor and a confessed wolf fan. \u201cWe have lived 11 years in Villardeciervos, and we came here for the wolf ... The opportunities in this area for tourism is great. It\u2019s Sunday today, and look how many people there are. They come here for the nature.\u201d He says there are several wolf tourism companies in the area now, which host domestic tourists as well as visitors from the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\n\nAs mayor, Jim\u00e9nez has been working to improve the fortunes of both the townspeople and the wolves, and for him, that means trying to change perceptions that hunting wolves is the best option. While he says it\u2019s vital to use economic aid and other measures to get people to stay in the area, he thinks the wolves can be an important part of this puzzle. \u201cMy main task is tourism and to make our town known, because already in a very small way the population issue is being fixed, thanks to wolf tourism. The latest studies that have come out make it quite clear that wolf tourism leaves more money than hunting tourism.\u201d\n\nJoseph Fox \u201cWolf tourism leaves more money than hunting tourism,\u201d says Villardeciervos Mayor Lorenzo Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nEach year, Spanish authorities issue a certain number of licenses to hunters to kill wolves \u2014 about 140 in Castile and Le\u00f3n \u2014 and campaigners say many more are killed illegally. A March 2018 study, which used data from the government, conservation organizations, hunting associations and the media, found more than 300 wolves in the region died nonnatural deaths in 2017, from hunters, poachers, poison, vehicle collisions and other causes.\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 hunting season, however, licenses have been suspended, and hunting was temporarily banned after the Association for the Conservation and Study of the Iberian Wolf, a nonprofit nongovernmental organization, took the Castile and Le\u00f3n government to court. The court\u2019s decision revolved around the need to guarantee the conservation of wolves, which are protected by European and national regulations.\n\nA local wolf guide and a critic of the regional government, Carlos Soria Perille, is trying to go one step further and ban hunting in the region for good. His petition to that effect has so far collected 200,000 signatures. He says two censuses of wolf populations, undertaken by the Ministry of Environment in 1988 and 2012, were inaccurate and the numbers were inflated to allow for more hunting permits.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment said the censuses were a collaboration between the central and regional governments and \u201cwere coordinated by the best specialists in the study of the species.\u201d The government of Castile and Le\u00f3n has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nFor Soria Perille, wolf tourism has an important role to play in this community. \u201cIt can be an engine of development, a vehicle to change opinion ... That may be the future of this area.\u201d\n\nJoseph Fox Local wolf guide Carlos Soria Perille is trying to ban wolf hunting in the region.\n\nFarmers are more circumspect. One of the few remaining traditional shepherds, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, is out in a field on the border of the sierra near Cobreros with his wife \u2014 also a shepherd \u2014 two daughters, 10 dogs and 1,100 sheep. \u201cBefore, there were no trees. Before it was all cultivation here,\u201d he says, gesturing to the thicket of trees under which his sheep are clustered to avoid the midday sun.\n\nHe says working the land here is hard, thanks to a difficult climate and poor soil. \u201cYou plant a crop, and you have a 10 percent chance of coming to fruition. The odds are very small,\u201d he says. For him, that is a key reason for the drain of young people from the farms toward the cities.\n\nJoseph Fox \u201cI know that I have to live with the wolf, because I know it will not go away,\u201d says Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, a traditional shepherd. \u201cThere are ways of living together, and with dogs, I have no problem.\u201d\n\nAsked what he thinks about the new boom in ecotourism, he says, \u201cIn the end, you need contact with nature, or else you go crazy. I know that I have to live with the wolf, because I know it will not go away. \u2026 There are ways of living together, and with dogs, I have no problem.\u201d\n\nThe Iberian Wolf Center in Castile and Le\u00f3n in the town of Robledo is dedicated to debunking the idea that the wolf is dangerous to humans and to educating people that the wolf is the threatened species. The center was recently renamed for Felix Rodr\u00edguez de la Fuente (the Spanish version of David Attenborough), who is credited with bringing the natural world into Spaniards\u2019 homes through his wildlife documentaries. His work with wolves inspired a nation to view the animal through his softer gaze, and he was largely responsible for the Hunting Act of 1970, which changed the wolves\u2019 status from vermin to huntable game, which means a license is required to hunt them.\n\nWhen I arrive at the center, I speak briefly with Carlos Sanz, its director of operations, before he is due to feed the wolves by hand in a semi-wild enclosure \u2014 something you can do only with wolves raised by humans. He excuses himself and re-emerges dressed in elbow-length protective gloves and wanders into the enclosure. Watching are 50 or so people, mesmerized. We all stand on a viewing platform and watch as four graceful wolves trot into view.\n\n\u201cThe wolf has been expanding its territory and its population in recent decades,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cDespite this, the wolf is still threatened by multiple factors, such as the destruction of its natural habitats, the fragmentation of its territories by highways, rail lines and other infrastructure, and especially by poaching.\u201d\n\nJoseph Fox Wolves may be the traditional enemy to many in Spain, especially farmers, but attitudes are changing.\n\nSanz says that since the center was opened in 2015, it has received more than 100,000 visitors. \u201cMost of the population is realizing and accepting that the wolf is a key element in maintaining the biological balance of the ecosystems in which they live,\u201d he adds.\n\nVictoria Rodriguez, a young biologist and one of Sanz\u2019s employees, agrees that attitudes are shifting. \u201cWith the tourism here, young people like me come to live here because there are opportunities,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to work in a laboratory, but I swapped by lab coat for my boots.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page.\n\n\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cThis New World\u201d series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Give or take a few pounds, they were identically pallid and big-breasted birds \u2015 classic Butterball-type turkeys. These hybrids were bred to fatten quickly on formulated feed in climate-controlled barns. In about 12 weeks, they grew from freshly hatched poults to 24-plus-pound hens, ready for slaughter.\n\nThese turkeys cooked \u2015 and tasted \u2015 pretty much the same from year to year.\n\nBut what makes a turkey a turkey is no longer so generic.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re one of the many people who has made the switch with a pasture-raised or a heritage bird for your holiday table. You may know all about the animal welfare benefits that result in a more nutritious turkey. But what most people don\u2019t know is how these birds of a different feather perform in the kitchen.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson I learned the hard way my first Thanksgiving with a house full of guests and a pasture-raised bird cooked on my Traeger grill. The turkey turned out Instagrammably browned and the digital thermometer registered 165 degrees. But when I slid my knife between the thigh to start carving, I saw that the meat was still vividly, inedibly pink.\n\nWhat was it about this turkey that made cooking it so different from conventional turkey? I started asking around and learned that there is more variability to cooking turkeys raised on pasture: The breasts cook quicker while the thigh meat takes longer. Here\u2019s why.\n\nKnow Your Turkey\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s important to recognize that a pasture-raised turkey is not necessarily a heritage turkey. Any turkey raised outdoors can be called pasture-raised. (Also called free-range, this term is not regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and shoppers should look for third-party animal welfare certifications.)\n\nAlthough turkeys raised on pasture are often slower-growing hybrids than industrial turkeys, their genes still bestow them with stubby legs, weak joints and oversized breasts that prevent them from flying, roosting or mating. But free to move outdoors, they have space to flap their wings, wobble around and forage.\n\nThe distinctions are even more marked with heritage turkeys. Bred from rare genetic poultry lines to express their natural behaviors, including running, flying, roosting and even mating, they have tapered breasts and strong legs. Officially called standard bred turkeys, these are the much-touted Bronze, Bourbon Red and Narrangansett turkeys. But other turkey breeds, like Chocolate and Jersey Buff, that are not formally recognized by the American Poultry Association, are also called heritage.\n\nOne of the first experts I consulted was Frank Reese, the foremost heritage poultry breeder in the country. He raises about 5,000 Thanksgiving turkeys each year on Good Shepherd Poultry Ranch in Lindsborg, Kansas. \u201cIt takes twice as long for me to grow these turkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference in how the carcass looks.\u201d\n\nMost striking is the breast, which is slender and hugs the prominent keel bone. The wings and the legs are longer too, and the muscles are well exercised. Both the white and the dark meat have more color, too. This is the result of oxygenation, Reese explained. \u201cThe whiter the meat, the poorer the muscle mass.\u201d\n\nHeritage Foods Heritage turkeys look different from a store-bought turkey: their legs and breast bones are twice as long.\n\nPasture-raised poultry \u2015 even from faster-growing breeds \u2015 has more muscle tone, whereas birds raised in confinement are flabby with limp joints and weak bones. Well-exercised muscles, as any good butcher will tell you, are the most flavorful. And this meat takes longer to cook.\n\nReese didn\u2019t have a positive word to say about the white broad-breasted turkey \u2015 even those raised on pasture. But he helped me to understand how living conditions and muscle composition were the reasons my turkey remained pink.\n\nHow To Cook It\n\nClearly, this is not the average turkey that you pop into a 350-degree oven to roast for 15 to 20 minutes per pound while you turn your attention to the Thanksgiving sides. So, how do you properly roast a turkey that didn\u2019t come from a factory farm?\n\nHeritage Foods USA is the principle purveyor for Reese\u2019s turkeys. One of their key tips is that there is no standardized timing that works for every bird. Cooking times depend on the size of the turkey, the roasting temperature, whether the turkey is stuffed and the idiosyncrasies of your oven.\n\nWestern Daughters Butcher Shoppe CEO Kate Kavanaugh, who has nearly 10 years experience cooking heritage turkeys, doesn\u2019t like to give instructions for minutes per pound. \u201cIn general, we have found that heritage birds run 8 to 12 minutes per pound,\u201d she said. But that\u2019s just a guideline. The key is to trust your thermometer, and to check the temperature in both the breast and the thigh meat to gauge doneness.\n\nWhen it comes to cooking temperatures, Indiana farmer Greg Gunthorp, who sells his pasture-raised turkeys to Rick Bayless and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, among others, recommends low and slow for best results whether in the oven or a Big Green Egg. Heritage Foods USA stipulates 325-degree oven temperature to allow the fats to render, yielding white meat that is both tender and juicy. But prepare yourself for pigmented meat, especially close to the bone.\n\nJosh Rathbun, executive chef of Siena Tuscan Steakhouse in Wichita, Kansas, also firmly endorses the low-and-slow approach.\u201cIf you can slow it down \u2015 and maybe even throw some foil on the breast \u2015 and rock slow heat for a while, you\u2019ll give the meat time to break down,\u201d he told HuffPost. He suggested cooking your heritage turkey at 325 degrees or below, and also recommended turning up the heat to 400 or 425 degrees at the end to crisp the skin.\n\nTo avoid the problem of overcooking the breast meat at any temperature, many experts recommend separating the thigh and leg meat.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how I resolved my dilemma of undercooked meat. I separated the thighs and legs, and after the breast meat finished cooking and rested under foil, I continued to roast the legs and thighs to 175 degrees, until the juices ran clear, for over an hour.\n\nOnce the meat was carved onto a platter, no one was the wiser that Thanksgiving \u2015 except for me."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Caroline Bologna", "title": "39 Funny Tweets About The Nightmare That Is Hosting Thanksgiving", "description": "From turkey disasters to awkward family dynamics, this job is no walk in the park.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tweets-about-hosting-thanksgiving_us_5beb3173e4b0783e0a1d18a0", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bede5323c00001d040eb9cf.png?cache=qDcvpbX9Oa&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:45:00Z", "content": "Offering to host Thanksgiving may seem like a good idea at the time, but as those who have been there can attest, this task is no walk in the park.

Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution. Nuon Chea was considered the main ideologist of the Khmer Rouge and the right-hand man of the group\u2019s late leader, Pol Pot, while Khieu Samphan served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nMembers of the Cham community were among the large crowd of spectators who attended Friday\u2019s session.\n\nThe court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for insuffient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u201cauto-genocide\u201d through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nOne of the spectators at Friday\u2019s hearing was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed by the Khmer Rouge, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that the both Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ed Mazza", "title": "Twitter Users Taunt NRA With 'Thoughts And Prayers' Amid Reports Of Financial Struggles", "description": "The gun lobby reportedly cut out free coffee at its headquarters as money runs tight.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nra-no-coffee-thoughts-and-prayers_us_5bee2fd6e4b0860184a6dbb9", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bee5a3e240000040499b8d3.jpeg?cache=Ey1wya1KGP&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T06:00:19Z", "content": "The National Rifle Association is getting some \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d amid a new report of financial struggles.

It is a tactic that labor unions of various stripes use to shame management during a dispute.\n\nThe inflatable rat, known as Scabby, made an appearance outside a less-conventional location Thursday: the offices of the subscription news service Law360 in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nThe non-management staff at Law360, which unionized with The NewsGuild of New York in August 2016, has been fighting since then to negotiate its first collective-bargaining contract.\n\nAfter two years of talks that the union claims have not led to significant economic concessions, members voted by a wide margin on Oct. 23 to authorize a strike. (Ordinarily, collective bargaining in newsrooms produces a contract after about a year.)\n\nSeveral dozen of those employees walked off the job Thursday afternoon, braving snow and freezing temperatures for a brief rally opposite Scabby the Rat on 19th Street.\n\n\u201cWe are using our maximum leverage and maximum pressure to get this done before the end of the year,\u201d Juan Carlos Rodriguez, a senior environmental reporter and chairman of the bargaining unit, told the crowd through a megaphone.\n\n\u201cThe rat is going to help us along the way,\u201d he said, eliciting laughs from his colleagues. \u201cBut look, we voted: We can have it out here every day if we need to. We\u2019re serious about it.\u201d\n\nNastaran Mohit, a NewsGuild organizer, led the group in a chant. \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d she asked. \u201cA fair contract!\u201d they replied. \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d she asked. \u201cNow!\u201d they answered.\n\nThe demonstration concluded with the union members posing for a photo in front of Scabby.\n\nWhat\u2019s a little sleet on the road to the contract we deserve? @law360union is stronger and more resolute than ever @Law360 @LexisNexis! #FairContractNow #1u pic.twitter.com/qEqXTvmw1F \u2014 NewsGuild of NY (@nyguild) November 15, 2018\n\nThe union has been steadily escalating its tactics since authorizing the strike. On Wednesday, bargaining unit leaders hand-delivered a letter with their demands to Mike Walsh, the CEO of LexisNexis, which bought Law360 in 2012.\n\nEmployees emphasized to HuffPost that they are prepared to make good on their vote and go out on strike.\n\nLaw360 is not budging on the union\u2019s demand for across-the-board annual pay increases and paid sick days that are distinct from the vacation days allotted to staff members, according to the NewsGuild. The company has even avoided agreeing to times for bargaining meetings, the union said.\n\nA spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to an email inquiry asking about the lack of a contract and the factors driving it.\n\nSome employees at the demonstration maintained that pay at the outlet lags behind its competitors.\n\n\u201cI might not have trouble paying my bills, but I know people who do,\u201d said Danielle Smith, an active member of the Law360 bargaining unit. \u201cI know people who struggle in the newsroom and need these protections and things that we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe strong state of the economy has encouraged the union not to back down, according to NewsGuild of New York President Grant Glickson. Glickson said the union had given companies some latitude during the Great Recession, but it was less accommodating when business was booming.\n\n\u201cNow that things have turned a bit in journalism, we feel like it\u2019s time that they start paying people appropriately and that they have protections they should have in a professional career,\u201d he said.\n\nIt has been several years since Scabby the Rat was last used in a news media contract dispute, but it is far from the first occasion, he noted.\n\nLaw360\u2019s alleged hardball tactics are in keeping with its aversion to its employees unionizing in the first place. The company hired a notorious \u201cunion avoidance\u201d law firm during the 2016 organizing drive, encouraging employees to attend meetings with anti-union consultants who, among other things, played up the burden of union dues. The employees, many of whom are deeply familiar with labor law, voted to form a union anyway.\n\nThe management of Law360\u2019s fight against the unionization drive and subsequent bargaining difficulty with the union are likely the strongest instances of labor strife since the digital media industry began unionizing en masse in June 2015."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Saba Hamedy", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "description": "The chief operating officer denies that she and Mark Zuckerberg \"weren't interested in knowing the truth, or we wanted to hide what we knew.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bee3f291f0000d5052636dc.jpeg?cache=CxlmPow2Q4&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:30:18Z", "content": "Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg weighed in on the recent explosive New York Times article that reported the social network carried out a campaign to discredit those who criticized how it handled Russian interference and disinformation.

Maybe in some cases, it\u2019s an issue of economic reasons, but that\u2019s not the case for most people anymore,\u201d Whinston said. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility as religious people, as one of the wealthiest countries in the world, to do what we can to help these asylum-seekers, rather than treating them as criminals.\u201d\n\nWhile economic opportunity has long been a draw to the U.S., today\u2019s migrants from Central America are composed of many families and children fleeing gang violence.\n\nThe tent city at Tornillo has rapidly expanded since it was first built in June as a temporary home for a few hundred migrant children. It now has the capacity to hold up to 3,200 children, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nVictoria L\u00f3pez, an ACLU attorney who visited the Tornillo camp in late October, said over 1,000 unaccompanied minor children are still being held there, waiting to be reunified with family members or other sponsors. The children sleep on bunk beds and receive a few hours of education every day, L\u00f3pez wrote.\n\nThe camp\u2019s remote location means it is \u201cfar from public scrutiny\u201d and access to legal resources and community support, she wrote.\n\n\u201cDetaining children, especially in these conditions, is certainly not in their best interest,\u201d L\u00f3pez wrote. \u201cIt creates immediate risks as well as long-term physical and mental health consequences.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS An undated file photo provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows the shelter used to house unaccompanied migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.\n\nWhinston became involved in advocacy for immigrants over the summer in response to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy that separated thousands of migrant children from their parents. The rabbi decided to organize the drive to Tornillo after a congregant at his synagogue expressed frustration that she couldn\u2019t do more to help the hundreds of children still detained at the camp.\n\nThe rabbi said that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting injected urgency into his desire to organize what he called a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d \u2015 especially after he heard that the suspected shooter had spoken out against HIAS, a Jewish refugee resettlement agency.\n\nWelcoming the stranger is a core Jewish value, Whinston said.\n\n\u201c[The suspect] murdered Jews because of our values. Hearing that gave me even more energy to do what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Whinston said. \u201cYou can kill people ... but you cannot kill our values.\u201d\n\nThe group started with about 10 people in Ann Arbor, Whinston said. Over the three-day drive, the activists held awareness events in multiple cities and picked up a few more people along the way. Once they arrived in El Paso, Texas, they were joined by local activists and others who had flown in from around the country.\n\nOn Thursday, group members first visited an international bridge connecting Mexico and the U.S. They then drove about 35 miles southeast of El Paso to hold the rally at Tornillo. Afterward, they volunteered at 11 shelters in the region that take in migrants who have been released from detention centers. The structure of the day was meant to mimic the journey migrants take as they enter the U.S., Whinston said.\n\nCourtesy Rabbi Josh Whinston Activists with the \"Let Our Families Go\" protest drove from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Tornillo, Texas.\n\nThe ACLU claims the Trump administration has escalated the crisis by restricting the legal options available to people seeking asylum in the U.S. The administration has also adopted new policies that have increased the amount of time it takes to vet potential sponsors for unaccompanied minor children.\n\nThe protesters ultimately want to see the camp shut down completely, Whinston said. Until then, they want federal officials to allow a greater level of public oversight at the camp. Press and some activist organizations have been able to access the camp on guided tours, but some advocates still say oversight is lacking.\n\nWhinston said he hopes that rally participants will be encouraged to start conversations with their elected officials about improving the situation for unaccompanied minor children at the border.\n\n\u201cI believe we can have borders and still be compassionate and still treat people like human beings,\u201d Whinston said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Mary Papenfuss", "title": "Kim Kardashian: Kanye Likes Trump's 'Personality,' Doesn't Know 'The Politics'", "description": "\u201cI know it\u2019s very confusing ... he\u2019s just fighting for the freedom to like a person,\u201d the reality star tells CNN's Van Jones.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-trump-politics_us_5bedff19e4b0860184a6bc39", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bee0d962200004205de3d11.jpeg?cache=0ouumVNTSU&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T02:09:52Z", "content": "Even though Kanye West has been outspoken in his controversial support of President Donald Trump, wife Kim Kardashian insists that her husband doesn\u2019t understand \u201cthe politics\u201d of the president \u2014 but likes his \u201cpersonality.\u201d \u201cI feel like he\u2019s very misundersto\u2026 [+2560 chars]", "fulltext": "Even though Kanye West has been outspoken in his controversial support of President Donald Trump, wife Kim Kardashian insists that her husband doesn\u2019t understand \u201cthe politics\u201d of the president \u2014 but likes his \u201cpersonality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like he\u2019s very misunderstood and is the worst communicator,\u201d Kardashian said of West in an interview with CNN commentator Van Jones on Wednesday at a criminal justice reform conference.\n\nWest is \u201cvery not political, actually.

Progressive ideas about inequality, health care and corporate power have taken hold in the ideological mainstream, and after a decisive midterm election, at least 36 fresh Democrats will arrive in Washington \u2015 at least 22 of them new members of what will be the most expansive Congressional Progressive Caucus in history.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to exercising power in American politics than winning elections. On much of the key strategic jockeying in Washington that matters most, progressives have a history of losing badly. One of the most important arenas now in play is the Byzantine battle for committee assignments: who gets to sit on which panels devoted to crafting legislation. And the outcome of that struggle may well have greater influence on the shape of the party\u2019s policy agenda than the higher-profile contests for leadership positions. Bills are written and amended in committee, establishing subjects of political change and setting the scope of legislative debate.\n\nIn the past, progressive lawmakers have ceded battles over some of the most powerful committees in Congress to more conservative Democrats. \u201cToo often, what\u2019s lacking is a strategy,\u201d said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a nonprofit devoted to expanding Social Security and Medicare. \u201cOur activists or champion members in Congress get bought cheap by promises. Leadership can promise to fight for anything ... and it can even be a sincere promise, but if the committees are stacked with Wall Street people, Wall Street always wins.\u201d\n\nThis time around, according to Lawson and other activists roaming the halls on Capitol Hill in the days since the Nov. 6 election, progressives are getting more serious about the mechanics of power.\n\nConsumer groups, labor unions including the Communication Workers of America, and two leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2015 Reps. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) \u2015 are working to secure posts for left-wing Democrats on the committees with jurisdiction over what matters most on Capitol Hill: money. On Thursday, Pocan and Jayapal issued a joint statement indicating they\u2019d received a commitment from presumed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to guarantee CPC members are \u201cproportionally represented\u201d on the major House committees.\n\nFew major pieces of domestic legislation make it through the House without hitting at least one of four ultra-powerful committees: Appropriations, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, or Financial Services. Appropriations is responsible for government spending. Ways and Means handles tax policy. Financial Services and Energy and Commerce oversee the rules of exchange for everything from prescription drugs to housing to high-speed securities trading. Each panel exercises so much authority that official party rules forbid any member from serving on more than one without obtaining a special waiver from leadership.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just panels that oversee obscure regulations. Any bill to pass Medicare for all, for instance, has to clear both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee. Ditto for any legislation attacking high prescription drug prices.\n\nProgressives are typically underrepresented on all four of these committees. While making up 40 percent of the current House Democratic roster, members of the CPC account for just 27 percent of the Democratic seats on the House Financial Services Committee, 28 percent of the Energy and Commerce Committee, 31 percent of the Ways and Means Committee, and 36 percent of the Appropriations Committee.\n\nPart of the problem has to do with personalities \u2015 young lefty activists don\u2019t grow up to be accountants or bank examiners. The most common career path to Congress for serious progressives involves at least a few years as a civil rights attorney, and so 76 percent of the Judiciary Committee is made up of CPC members. It\u2019s more fun to serve on a committee with a lot of like-minded members \u2015 it\u2019s easier to get things done on issues like immigration or criminal justice reform. The prospect of battling both Republicans and conservative Democrats over offshore derivatives trading doesn\u2019t carry the same allure.\n\nBut much of the problem for progressives is about the party\u2019s leadership-driven fundraising strategy. Democratic leaders don\u2019t restrict lawmakers to one A-list committee for the sake of decentralizing legislative power. They do it to spread the wealth. Ways and Means, Appropriations, Energy and Commerce, and Financial Services are magnets for campaign contributions. Every major corporation in America has something at stake on all of them, and they spend heavily to see their interests represented.\n\nThe Progressive Caucus vs. The New Democrat Coalition\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition \u2015 the traditional intraparty rival of the CPC \u2015 is a 68-member crop of self-styled moderates with close ties to the corporate establishment. Much of the New Democrat agenda is defined in opposition to progressive priorities. They\u2019re against Medicare for all and are sharply critical of the recent Abolish ICE campaign but have devoted much of their legislative energy in recent years to bank deregulation, supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s recent rollback of several rules adopted in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nNew Democrats know how to play the game. Though the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee is Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), a CPC member, she has to contend with the interests of New Democrats on her panel, who outnumber CPC members 11 to 7. Waters can\u2019t just shoot down every bank-friendly bill that New Democrats cook up with Republicans on her committee.\n\nCentrist Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) has been encouraging freshman lawmakers who have pledged their allegiance to the New Democrats\u2019 cause to pursue seats on the Financial Services Committee, emphasizing the fundraising potential the slots offer his new colleagues, according to multiple sources familiar with his remarks. Gottheimer spokesman Matt Fried denied that the congressman brought up fundraising with other members, calling it \u201ca lie.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019d never say that,\u201d Fried said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a new strategy. New Democrat chair and Financial Services Committee member Jim Himes (D-Conn.) raised over $964,000 from the financial sector for the 2018 cycle alone, part of a $2.3 million haul he secured despite representing a safely blue New England district. Himes turned over $560,000 of this total to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which in turn spends on behalf of Democrats around the country.\n\nNew Democrats aren\u2019t just playing for seats on committees. They\u2019re making aggressive maneuvers to control key leadership slots and even subcommittee chairs. Though CPC members have floated the idea of creating DCCC co-chairs and advanced Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) as their progressive stalwart, the plan hasn\u2019t received much traction. All four members of Congress who have put their names forward as candidates for DCCC chair are New Democrats.\n\nTrade And Finance\n\nOn the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a New Democrat, is trying to oust Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) in a contest to chair the panel\u2019s subcommittee on international trade. The trade panel is extremely powerful, particularly for its size, with jurisdiction over every industry involved in trade negotiations, from Big Pharma to heavy manufacturing to high finance. Pascrell has put in the work as the ranking member on that subcommittee with Republicans in control, but Kind is trying to gin up support by invoking a rare claim on bizarre rules governing seniority \u2015 which is typically an overriding factor in Democratic leadership contests. Though both Pascrell and Kind were sworn in on the same day, Kind is technically more senior \u2015 his last name is ahead of Pascrell\u2019s alphabetically.\n\nThis is, of course, ridiculous. Pascrell hasn\u2019t received any complaints about his leadership so far, and he sent a letter to his colleagues the day after the election affirming his commitment to remaining the top Democrat on the panel. But it will ultimately be up to the party to decide who stays in charge.\n\nAnd even this decision depends on further complications. If Kind wants to press Pascrell for the subcommittee gavel, the Ways and Means Committee ultimately gets to decide whether Pascrell should be removed. And we won\u2019t know who the members of the Ways and Means Committee are until leadership decides on assignments.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of signaling for 2020. The position will play an outsized role in the congressional response to the Trump administration\u2019s very real and frequent changes to U.S. trade policy. Kind is an old-school free-trader, an advocate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership. That puts him out of step with the party more broadly \u2015 just 28 House Democrats voted for TPP in 2018, while 158 opposed it. (Though in another previous, failed vote, the Democratic yeas went as high as 40.)\n\nEven with Pelosi committed to a proportional representation for the CPC, it will require actual CPC members to step up and put their names forward to secure posts on the money committees. So far, most of the leading freshman lefties \u2015 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) \u2015 are staying mum in public about their preferences.\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to get new members on powerful committees in a system that rewards seniority, but activists are marshaling arguments. Ocasio-Cortez ousted Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) in a primary \u2015 shouldn\u2019t she get his Ways and Means Committee seat? Pressley defeated Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.), one of the few reliably progressive votes on the Financial Services Committee, while Omar is replacing one of the others, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). Shouldn\u2019t they take over the committee seats, as well?\n\nThe Take On Wall Street campaign, a coalition of consumer groups, labor unions and civil rights organizations, is hoping to secure slots on the Financial Services Committee for incoming Reps. Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Colin Allred (D-Texas), Jason Crow (D-Colo.), Katie Hill (D-Calif.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cFinancial Services is one of those sort of unsung places,\u201d said Porter McConnell, who directs the campaign. \u201cHousing, jobs, remittances, retirement, student loans, big banks, corruption \u2015 it\u2019s a huge list, and there\u2019s a lot you can do with it.\u201d\n\nThough she acknowledges that in the past the committee has \u201cbeen used as a vehicle for a lot of terrible things,\u201d she\u2019s optimistic that \u201cthat\u2019s starting to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing realization that you can\u2019t talk about economic justice without talking about racial justice, and you can\u2019t talk about racial justice without talking about economic justice.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Daniel Marans", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Wins Southern California House Race", "description": "The Democrat ousted GOP Rep.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), flipped a GOP-held seat in California\u2019s traditionally Republican Orange County.\n\nBecause so many California voters cast their ballots by mail or through absentee voting, the final outcome of the race was decided more than a week after Election Day. Porter initially trailed her opponent, but the ballots counted after Nov. 6 skewed toward her.\n\nPorter benefited from the backlash to President Donald Trump among moderate suburban voters in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District \u2015 one of seven Republican-controlled seats in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nShe ran as an unabashed proponent of Medicare for all, expanded Social Security and tough banking rules, but emphasized issues with broad appeal: the damaging effect of the Republicans\u2019 tax cuts and effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, tougher gun laws and women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cThe electoral tide almost always pulls against the president\u2019s party during his first midterm election, and this year\u2019s tide was especially strong because President Trump has been especially divisive,\u201d said Matthew Beckmann, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPorter\u2019s campaign \u2015 focused on unifying Californians and checking President Trump \u2015 was pitch perfect for riding this national wave all the way from a Republican district in California to the seat of power in Washington.\u201d\n\nRELATED COVERAGE An Elizabeth Warren Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Is Defying The Odds In The Cradle Of California Conservatism\n\nPorter, a 44-year-old law professor at UC Irvine, defeated two-term Rep. Mimi Walters (R), 56, a former investment banker who served in House Republican leadership.\n\nWalters, who was registered to vote in another district as recently as June 2017, drew criticism from some constituents for her lack of accessibility and declined to make any joint appearances with Porter.\n\nAnd unlike some other Republicans in vulnerable seats, Walters stuck with Trump on his two major legislative initiatives \u2015 the failed bid to repeal the ACA, as well as the tax cut bill that became law.\n\nAlthough California\u2019s 45th is an affluent district, the tax law\u2019s near-elimination of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction made it a net tax hike for many of the district\u2019s upper-middle-class residents. Porter\u2019s support for reinstating the deduction earned her the backing of the influential California and National Realtors Associations, which spent heavily on her behalf.\n\nPorter also bucked the California Democratic Party by declaring her intention to vote for a ballot initiative repealing a modest gas tax levied by the Democratic-run state government to fund infrastructure improvements. She argued that Orange County residents had already been hit hard by the federal tax law and that infrastructure funds could be secured through other means.\n\nPorter typically eschews labels, but she told HuffPost that she plans to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Medicare for All Caucus. She is critical of some Democrats\u2019 support for legislation that rolled back oversight of many large banks, and said she hopes to serve on committees that allow her to apply her expertise in financial policy.\n\nPorter, who collaborated with Warren in studying the impact of health care costs on household bankruptcies, was one of just two candidates who Warren endorsed in the Democratic primaries. Warren, who cruised to re-election on Nov. 6, was also an early backer of former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray. Cordray fell short in his gubernatorial bid in Ohio."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Moye", "title": "Twitter Users Have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Back After She Was Fashion-Shamed", "description": "Washington Examiner journalist Eddie Scarry seemed amazed the newly elected congresswoman could wear nice clothes after she said she couldn't afford rent in D.C.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-fashion_us_5bee0181e4b0510a1f2f217a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bee03282100002906ca26fa.jpeg?cache=PJXgQtP42L&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T01:17:26Z", "content": "A conservative journalist attempted to fashion-shame newly elected congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but got a dressing-down from Twitter users instead.

He has a segment, called \u201cThe Cuck Zone,\u201d in which he often criticizes the Trumpier segments of the GOP.\n\nAccepting Miller as a friendly face in liberal circles required a certain transient amnesia about what the Republican Party is and how Miller has served it. The effort of not knowing became a lot harder on Wednesday, when The New York Times published a blockbuster report that, among other unseemly details, revealed that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm to push back against anti-Facebook groups. The campaign exploited the anti-Semitism on the right, encouraging reporters \u201cto explore the financial connections between [George] Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe Republican operative behind the campaign was none other than Miller.\n\nThis created an awkward situation for the boys of Crooked Media. When the story first dropped, Favreau disgustedly tweeted out the paragraph about the smears, seemingly without realizing it was his buddy who had propagated them. Several hours of silence later, the official Crooked Media account announced that Miller would not be contributing to Crooked while Favreau, Lovett and Vietor got \u201cto the bottom of Tim\u2019s involvement in this work.\u201d\n\nBut what about his involvement in their work? Miller\u2019s presence on the Crooked team was a modern media spin on a familiar phenomenon: prominent liberals inviting the right-wing weasels into the living room, allegedly in the interest of getting a different perspective, the totally predictable result of which is an orgy of special pleading and whitewashing. These days, there are few better publicists for the forces of illiberalism than the establishment liberals who wish to appear broad-minded.\n\nTo be fair, the bros of Crooked Media aren\u2019t wholly part of this same establishment liberal rot. They are far more humane and grounded than your average left-of-center D.C. politico. (I should mention here that I have appeared on Lovett\u2019s podcast). They don\u2019t really whine about civility. They don\u2019t make meaningless calls for bipartisanship (in government, at least). And for the most part, they rarely punch left. But they do have a weakness common to liberal creatures of the D.C. professional political class: their token Never Trumper.\n\nMuch like David Frum and Bill Kristol, Tim Miller has capitalized on his status as one of the country\u2019s dozen Never Trump Republicans for which establishment media remains insatiably horny. Miller puts a charming millennial twist on the type, perfect for the more youthful \u201cPod Save America\u201d crowd. He\u2019s become a regular contributor on Crooked Media\u2019s podcasts and has even written for its website.\n\nHere\u2019s what Miller had to say for himself, regarding his little Facebook anti-Semitism oopsie:\n\nFor ppl asking - Definers shared a narrow document about an anti-Facebook group's funding. It was entirely factual, as Open Markets organizers have acknoweldged they get funding from Soros. I have defended Soros from smears & conspiracies that weren't based in fact. 1/ \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 15, 2018\n\nAll he did was share a document about an anti-Facebook group\u2019s funding \u2014 and a factual document, no less. It\u2019s not his fault the Jews really were behind it!\n\nThe thing is, every group needs funding. It\u2019s unclear why George Soros funding this group, in particular, would have been noteworthy. Unless, of course, you want to make use of the long history of anti-Semitic smears and conspiracies swirling around Soros for political gain. Nothing in Miller\u2019s explanation indicates that he did anything less.\n\nAnd he knew exactly what it was he was doing.\n\nI'm no fan of Soros' politics but the fact that the conservative media is spinning him donating half a billion dollars to support refugees fleeing terror and oppression is a good sign of the moral rot on the right. https://t.co/4HIzgTHLx8 \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 5, 2018\n\nWhere the alt-righters handed out their Protocols of the Elders of Zion pamphlets in public, Miller tried to achieve similar ends with a raised eyebrow behind closed doors. Maybe Miller doesn\u2019t like Trump and his kind because they\u2019re giving the game away.\n\nBut why would a bunch of Obama administration alums even bother with a professional Republican operative in the first place? According to their statement, its because Miller \u201chas interesting things to say about the Republican Party in the Trump era.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see what those interesting things are:\n\n\u201cThe politician x got $ in exchange for dead kids\u201d isn\u2019t just rhetorically out of bounds it is also wrong and counterproductive.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s also incorrect, or at least it\u2019s defining \u201cbase voters\u201d so narrowly as to render them politically meaningless. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 want stricter gun control. But it\u2019s understandable why someone who benefits from politicians raking in piles of toxic cash might want people to believe otherwise.\n\nLet\u2019s see what else he\u2019s got.\n\nThis is a beautiful Heidi ad on her sister's adoption.

In return, the Never Trumpers get even more cash and a crucial credibility boost among liberals and centrists.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Favreau, Lovett and Vietor didn\u2019t know who it was they were boosting. From 2007 to 2009, Miller was a communications strategist at the D.C. public affairs firm Berman and Company, where he also worked as a spokesperson for the Employment Policies Institute, which put out this highly misleading ACORN attack ad. ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, advocated for the poor, helped families navigate federal aid programs and registered people to vote \u2014 until it was brought down by Republican strategists like Miller, working alongside less respectable ratfuckers like James O\u2019Keefe of Project Veritas. According to ProPublica, the Employment Policies Institute also \u201cproduced numerous reports arguing that boosting the minimum wage hurts teen workers and frustrates job creation.\u201d The folks who write the white papers are just ratfuckers who carry briefcases.\n\nIn 2013, Miller helped co-found the GOP opposition group America Rising, a group that put out ads like this:\n\nMiller actively worked to paint Hillary Clinton as a lying thief and to terrify Americans into believing that the only thing standing between them and ISIS was a Republican president. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone that a professional smear man would, as the Times reported yesterday, casually talk about a willingness to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d regarding Facebook\u2019s egregious privacy issues. Plus, he still very much sees George W. Bush as a man of honor.\n\nTo a certain Beltway mindset, it is the height of seriousness not to take political ideas so seriously that you attach life-or-death significance to them. For the \u201cPod Save America\u201d hosts and for most of the other liberals eagerly embracing Never Trumpers, showing off your Republican pal \u2014 the good, polite kind of Republican! \u2014 feels harmless because most of them will never actually have to deal with the consequences of actual Republican policies."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Catherine Pearson", "title": "Half Of Reproductive-Age Women Want Easier Access To Abortion Pills, Study Finds", "description": "The survey shows many women want the two medications to be available over the counter or online.

Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical.

About 234 Democrats are expected in the chamber next year, and 17 have already pledged to oppose her.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) insists she\u2019s still on track to be the next speaker of the House, telling reporters Thursday she has the \u201coverwhelming\u201d support of the Democratic caucus. While she may indeed have the vast majority of Democrats, she doesn\u2019t quite have the number needed to be speaker, 218 \u2015 at least not yet.\n\nHer math problem at the moment is this: There are 17 seemingly intractable Democrats signed on to a letter pledging to oppose her, and there are a handful of other Democrats \u2015 at least six, sources told HuffPost \u2015 who say they won\u2019t support her on the floor. With about 234 Democrats expected in the House in the next congressional session, she can lose only 16 of her members, if everyone votes.\n\nOn top of the 17 opposing her, there are nine moderate Democrats in the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus who say they won\u2019t vote for Pelosi unless she pledges \u2015 in writing \u2015 to back a slate of procedural changes for next Congress by Friday.\n\nWhile she has asked the incoming Rules Committee chairman, Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), to address those proposals, she still hasn\u2019t signed on, and one of the leaders of the group, Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), told reporters Thursday that \u201cnothing\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nStaffers from the offices of two prominent Democrats have reached out to HuffPost in the last two days to say members have been urging their bosses to run for speaker.\n\nHardly anyone on Capitol Hill thinks those nine Democrats are a real hurdle to Pelosi, but it\u2019s becoming clearer by the hour that the Democrats publicly opposed to Pelosi could be \u2015 with an even larger group of freshman Democrats who haven\u2019t said one way or the other whether they will support her.\n\nIn short, there are a number of Democrats who could oppose her and already a critical number who look likely to.\n\nBut Pelosi has plenty of tricks at her disposal.\n\nFor one, she is largely in control of committee assignments, potential campaign dollars and a whole host of other goodies. There was even some talk of creating yet another leadership position \u2015 an assistant majority whip \u2015 though that seems to have been shot down by some members, including the last Democrat to have a position made for him, current assistant minority leader, Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), who is running to stay at the No. 3 spot in Democratic leadership as the majority whip.\n\nPelosi continues to meet with incoming and some incumbent Democrats to discuss their speaker vote. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), one of the incumbents the anti-Pelosi group is trying to woo, told HuffPost he was meeting with her soon and wouldn\u2019t be able to say where he stands until after that meeting.\n\nShe could make a number of promises to secure the speaker\u2019s gavel again. She could vow to make this her final term as speaker. She could say she\u2019ll serve only for a year as speaker in a transitional role. Or she could set stricter rules in the caucus, binding Democrats to vote for the party\u2019s speaker nominee or try to get commitments from her closest allies that they will support only her for the position.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s detractors are betting that Democrats will want to avoid the possible dysfunction of a knock-down, drag-\u2019em-out speaker\u2019s race. They don\u2019t think she would go to the House floor on Jan. 3 if it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t have the votes \u2015 and they think prominent Democrats in the caucus will begin campaigning in the shadows right away if it\u2019s clear that\u2019s the case.\n\nThat shadow campaign has already started in some ways. Staffers from the offices of two prominent Democrats have reached out to HuffPost in the last two days to say members have been urging their bosses to run for speaker and that they are well positioned to mount a campaign if Pelosi steps down.\n\nPublicly, Democrats seem to be sticking with the story that they\u2019re running for their prospective leadership positions and back Pelosi. That\u2019s what Clyburn and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) \u2014 who has thrown his hat in the ring for the No. 4 spot, caucus chair \u2014 told HuffPost on Thursday. But Clyburn also said that if she doesn\u2019t have the votes, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Lord has in store. That\u2019s how we say it down South.\u201d\n\nAt least one Democrat, Marcia Fudge (Ohio), seems to be shedding some of the pretense and openly discussing a possible challenge to Pelosi. Fudge told HuffPost on Thursday morning during a sit-down interview that she takes offense that Pelosi has not endorsed Clyburn to be whip and that Pelosi takes Congressional Black Caucus support for granted in general.\n\nFudge, who has signed the letter opposing Pelosi, is a welcome ally for the anti-Pelosi members as they push back against criticism that it\u2019s mostly white moderate men who are looking to dethrone Pelosi. (Two of the effort\u2019s ringleaders, Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), have said they would prefer the next speaker to be a woman, pointing to Fudge.)\n\nBut Fudge may be hobbled by her past refusal to co-sponsor the Equality Act, which would extend federal civil rights protections to people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. She is one of two House Democrats who refuse to sign on to the legislation.\n\nShe told HuffPost that her opposition simply stems from not wanting to open up the Civil Rights Act to amendment and that she would happily support the legislation if it is introduced as a standalone proposal. But that answer might still be unpalatable for a lot of Democrats. One senior Democratic aide suggested to HuffPost that it wasn\u2019t a \u201ctenable position for a leader in the Democratic Party to be in opposition to extending civil rights protections to the LGBTQ community,\u201d though Fudge would almost certainly disagree with that characterization and has challenged anyone to find a vote in which she didn\u2019t stand up for LGBTQ rights.\n\nWhile the anti-Pelosi group looks satisfied to not present any alternative candidate, satisfied that blocking her would be enough to eventually spur a race, she seemed happy to have Fudge in the race."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Lohr", "title": "Couple, Homeless Vet Scammed People Into Donating Thousands: DA", "description": "The GoFundMe campaign, which raised more than $400,000, \"was predicated on a lie,\" a prosecutor said.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/couple-homeless-vet-scammed-people-into-donating-thousands-with-viral-fake-story-da_us_5bedf07be4b0860184a6b0cc", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bedf34e240000070499b8c6.jpeg?cache=pPfCO8IjsC&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:04:45Z", "content": "The story of a homeless veteran giving a stranded woman his last $20 went viral online last year, prompting good Samaritans to respond in kind with nearly a half-million dollars in GoFundMe donations.
