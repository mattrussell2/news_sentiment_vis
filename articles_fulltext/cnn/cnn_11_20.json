They analyzed antidepressant prescriptions and compared them with prescriptions for drugs treating conditions unlikely to be influenced by uncertainty or depression, such as gout, iron deficiency and thyroid problems.\n\nBoth groups showed an increase every year before the referendum. But antidepressant prescriptions continued to increase after the vote, albeit at a slower rate than before, while other drugs experienced a decrease.\n\nrose 13.4% faster than the other drugs monitored, according to the study, published Tuesday in the Antidepressant prescriptionsrose 13.4% faster than the other drugs monitored, according to the study, published Tuesday in the BMJ\n\n\"This study adds to previous studies that show that events at the national level can have an effect on people's mental health or mood,\" said Sotiris Vandoros, senior lecturer in health economics at King's Business School and lead author on the study.\n\nVandoros believes that the Brexit referendum may have triggered the increase in antidepressant prescriptions.\n\nBut the findings are open to interpretation, as they are based on trends and can't prove causation, Vandoros added, nor do they imply an overall increase in depression for the entire country.\n\nThe study instead shows that \"people who were negatively affected by the referendum and might have started feeling worse\" ended up driving an increase in antidepressants, he said.\n\nThe main cause of worry around Brexit is the question of what will happen afterward. Other causes of stress include economic uncertainty, job opportunities, companies relocating and whether EU nationals will have the opportunity to stay in the UK.\n\n\"All this uncertainty is going to cause people stress and anxiety and worry, and some people might end up feeling more depressed due to this,\" Vandoros said.\n\nThe trend shows that for some people, the referendum could be linked to a worsening of mental health, he said. However, others also became happier after the vote, and this development just isn't captured in antidepressant prescriptions.\n\nIt's hard to explain why there was a drop in prescriptions for other classes of drugs compared with antidepressants, Vandoros said. One possible reason is that people were distracted after the Brexit vote and had less time to see their doctors and fill their prescriptions.\n\nVandoros added that in this scenario, people's distraction should have led to a decrease in antidepressants, which was not seen. \"But possibly, all this uncertainty and depression balanced out that effect,\" he said.\n\nfor reasons such as increased anxiety, stress and sleep deprivation. Previous research by Vandoros found an increase in traffic accidents the first two days after austerity measure announcements, such as salary and pension cuts,for reasons such as increased anxiety, stress and sleep deprivation.\n\nSeeking help\n\n\"Clearly, it's very difficult to make a concrete link between Brexit and antidepressant use,\" said Ian David Cummins, senior lecturer in social work at Salford University, who was not involved in the study. He believes that this is because Brexit in itself is a very complicated event, but depression and why people are seeking advice and medication are also complex matters.\n\nCummins added that the study needs to put the Brexit vote in the context of more widespread austerity and growing inequality in the UK.\n\n\"Austerity is a huge driver\" of a lot of concerns, said Cummins, who published a research paper this year on the effects of austerity on mental health. Cummins' report concluded that austerity and associated policies in the UK have increased the overall burden of mental distress.\n\n14 million people, one-fifth of the population, living in poverty. A recent UN report stated that austerity in the UK has contributed to14 million people, one-fifth of the population, living in poverty.\n\nPeople could be seeking help due to a range of reasons, including welfare service reductions, greater pressure at work or from housing pressures, Cummins explained.\n\nKamaldeep S. Bhui, professor of cultural psychiatry and epidemiology at Queen Mary University of London, pointed out that the study mainly looked at antidepressant prescriptions, which is \"not a perfect method\" to measure mental health.\n\nAntidepressant monitoring data is not very accurate, and there are many reasons people may take such drugs, explained Bhui, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAllan Young, professor of mood disorders at the King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry Psychology & Neuroscience, noted that \"antidepressant prescriptions have risen in England consistently over recent years, and these data may simply reflect that rather than one single event.\"\n\n\"It should be noted that antidepressants are prescribed to treat anxiety disorders as well as mood disorders, and it is credible that people may be more anxious because of recent uncertainty in society,\" said Young, who was not involved in the research.\n\n\"Levels of anxiety across the population were not reported in this study so cannot be shown explicitly,\" he added.\n\nMoney and mental health\n\nUncertainty is widespread globally. A Deutsche Bank report from January states that economic policy uncertainty in Europe has risen to \"extraordinarily high levels.\"\n\nPeople whose mental health is most affected by uncertainty are usually lacking a safety net of financial or emotional support through friends or family, Vandoros said.\n\ninsomnia and substance abuse. One in four British adults who has a mental health problem also has problems with debt, according to UK charity Money and Mental Health . Nearly a quarter -- 24% -- of people experiencing depression or anxiety are in problem debt, the charity says.

But Wyatt soon got a lot more help than she had imagined.\n\nTurkeys, pies and beer\n\nCity officials offered one of the community's largest buildings, the McBean Pavilion, for the event. The city's fire department donated more than 100 turkeys. Local wineries offered wine, and breweries offered beer.\n\nA local casino is offering 100 apple pies and a community bakery is offering 100 pumpkin pies.\n\n\"I'm overwhelmed by it,\" Wyatt said. \"Everyone is offering volunteering, doing table decorations and making signs.\"\n\nWyatt said she's heard from more than 100 volunteers who want to help set up, serve, clean up and create activities for the kids.

Wyatt hopes the holiday will be a welcome break for families who have been dealing with the loss of their homes and belongings.\n\n\"It hits close to home because Paradise is not that far away and our community is family.

His group visited North Carolina after Hurricane Florence and delivered more than 140,000 meals to shelters. They also served more than 3.6 million meals in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada brewery in Chico is preparing to serve close to 2,000 people.

It's called America First!\" Trump wrote in a statement , effectively repudiating the concept of American Exceptionalism, the idea that the US is embarked on a unique, moral mission exemplified by support for freedom, democracy and universal values.\n\nHe kept up his praise on Wednesday, thanking the Saudis in a tweet for low oil prices, even though the tumble in crude oil owes largely to market fears about a new supply glut and weakening demand.\n\nThe President's decision Tuesday to answer the long-running question of how he will respond to the murder of the Washington Post columnist revealed other pillars of the Trump doctrine in one of the most colloquial and oddly stylistic statements on US foreign policy ever written.\n\nIt showed a President willing to ignore and prejudge US intelligence assessments that conflict with his political goals.\n\nHis readiness to offer impunity to Saudi Arabia represented another blow to the international rule of law and global accountability, concepts Trump has shown little desire to enforce in nearly two years in office.\n\nThe President's statement is certain to trigger a fierce clash with Congress, where there is bipartisan momentum to punish Saudi Arabia.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted Trump's response.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\" he tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nAnd it may deepen the estrangement between Trump and the intelligence community, given his rejection of a CIA assessment that the crown prince knew about the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nNo room for misunderstanding\n\nTrump's statement was remarkable because it was not just an explanation of Saudi policy. He consciously used the moment to deliver a lesson about how he would wield American power as he redefined the nation's role in the world.\n\nHe essentially argued that although the murder of the Washington Post journalist was \"terrible\" and could not be condoned, it did not merit the disruption of a strategic relationship he has elevated to extraordinary levels.\n\n\"We're not going to give up hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and let Russia and China have them ... it's a very simple equation for me. I'm about make America great again,\" he told reporters.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ward: US saying it doesn't care about Khashoggi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ward: US saying it doesn't care about Khashoggi 02:27\n\nHis decision appeared to suggest that as long as a foreign power enriches the United States it would face no censure for despotic behavior.\n\nPerhaps Trump should get marks for frankness.\n\nMany Presidents have wrestled with the tension between American values and the trade-offs required by realpolitik. Often Washington's actions -- in the Vietnam War for instance or in the war on terror, have been seen by outsiders as falling well short of the lofty principles it has preached to others.\n\nAmerican relations with Saudi Arabia, a key power broker in the Middle East and crucial oil producer vital to the global economy have often fallen on the hypocritical side of this line.\n\nBut the pull of the idea that America is leading a group of like-minded nations wedded to democratic, enlightened principles was always strong and while waxing and waning under different Presidents it never disappeared.\n\nYet Trump is getting rid of any pretense. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it: \"It's a mean nasty world out there,\" in an apparent sign that Washington is ready to play the same cynical game as Beijing, Moscow and other challengers to Western power who reject the US-backed international system.\n\nTrump's pivot shocked many more conventional politicians in Washington.\n\n\"I am concerned about our standing in the world and what it says about the United States,\" Republican Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"From our very beginnings we have been a country founded on important principles of freedom, rule of law. The Declaration of Independence kind of sets the road map. And I don't think we want to back up on that and cut a break for Saudi Arabia murdering someone,\" Rooney said.\n\nYet Trump's argument will please his supporters, who reject the premise of the international liberal order and multinational institutions, and believe the previous Obama administration was ineffectual.\n\nAnd it represented the latest show of force from a President who is showing signs of breaking free from any remaining restraints, and is increasingly confident in a course that has sown historic disruption.\n\nConsequences in Washington and abroad\n\nTuesday's events were all more poignant since they coincided with Thanksgiving, the quintessentially American holiday that remembers pioneers who fled tyranny in Europe to found a land built on freedom in the new world.\n\nThey will have significant reverberations in Washington and around the world.\n\nAfter all, the President made clear he is willing to ignore his own intelligence agencies and to blur facts in order to advance his pre-cooked political goals -- in this case preserving the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt is a trend that has also been evident in the President's dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin over election meddling and his rejection of intelligence agency assessments that Iran is abiding by a nuclear deal he overturned.\n\nTrump seems especially willing to disregard intelligence if it complicates his desire to court foreign despots like Putin, North Korea's Kim Jong Un or the crown prince.\n\nTrump's statement also included a Putin-esque misdirection play designed to cast doubt on the truth as well as it can be established -- that Khashoggi was murdered with the acquiescence of the Saudi crown prince.\n\n\"It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHis words could hardly have offered more absolution to the House of Saud especially since the President also recycled Saudi talking points that Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn fact the President opened his statement talking not about Saudi Arabia but Iran, reflecting how US policy in the Middle East is refracted through a prism of the administration's fixation on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Saudis are seen by the Trump administration, and the President's personal envoy and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as crucial to containing the Islamic Republic -- a policy that looks increasingly like regime change.\n\nTo maintain that bond, the administration has offered logistical support to Riyadh's air assault against Iran backed rebels in Yemen, that has triggered the world's worst humanitarian crisis that has left eight million people at risk of famine. The administration has said it will stop refueling Saudi warplanes, but the air raids are still using US and Western ammunition.\n\nThe Saudi controversy will intensify Trump's coming clash with Congress with lawmakers determined to do more than levy sanctions on 17 Saudis named by their government as being involved in the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nSeveral bills would halt all arms sales to the Saudis. House Democrats may use their new majority next year to do more to probe the Trump-Saudi relationship.\n\nThere may be pressure to declassify the CIA assessment of Khashoggi's murder and attempts to reverse Trump's policy pivot.\n\n\"It's now up to Congress to reassure the people of Yemen and the international community that the United States still stands for something more than a dollar sign,\" said Oxfam America's Humanitarian Policy Lead, Scott Paul,\n\nThere are also calls for Congress to investigate Trump's past business ties with the Saudis. The President denied any such links on Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Clare Foran, CNN", "title": "Marcia Fudge, who was considering run for House speaker, says she will back Nancy Pelosi", "description": "Rep.

Una vez m\u00e1s, enfrenta a Trump con sus agencias de inteligencia y respalda a un r\u00e9gimen que ha admitido haber matado a un cr\u00edtico p\u00fablico y miembro de la prensa.\n\nLa respuesta del Washington Post\n\n\"La respuesta del presidente Trump al brutal asesinato del periodista Jamal Kashoggi es una traici\u00f3n a los antiguos valores estadounidenses de respeto por los derechos humanos\", sostuvo el editor y presidente ejecutivo de The Washington Post, Fred Ryan, en un pronunciamiento.\n\n\"\u00c9l est\u00e1 ubicando las relaciones personales y los intereses comerciales sobre los intereses estadounidenses en su deseo por continuar haciendo negocios con el pr\u00edncipe heredero\", contin\u00fao Ryan.

Lo que est\u00e1 relacionado con una pr\u00e1ctica de la comunidad de inteligencia: las agencias les asignan un determinado nivel de confianza a sus hallazgos porque su investigaci\u00f3n no es concluyente.\n\nSi bien algunas fuentes le indicaron a CNN que la CIA evalu\u00f3 con un alto nivel confianza que el pr\u00edncipe heredero orden\u00f3 el asesinato de Khashoggi \u2013ejecutado por miembros del c\u00edrculo \u00edntimo de bin Salam\u2013 el hecho de que no llegue a una conclusi\u00f3n definitiva le da a la Casa Blanca una salida.\n\nEl comunicado de Trump y el esperado informe de la CIA ocurren siete semanas despu\u00e9s de que el el periodista Khashoggi ingresara al consulado de Arabia Saudita en Estambul, exactamente el pasado 2 de octubre para buscar documentos de matrimonio. Trump fue informado por la directora de la CIA, Gina Haspel, quien viaj\u00f3 a Turqu\u00eda para reunirse con funcionarios all\u00ed y conocer sus hallazgos. Supuestamente, Haspel tambi\u00e9n escuch\u00f3 una grabaci\u00f3n del asesinato que el gobierno turco ten\u00eda en su poder.\n\nInicialmente, Arabia Saudita insisti\u00f3 en que el reportero del diario The Washington Post sali\u00f3 de su consulado en Turqu\u00eda, pero tras unas pocas semanas en las que la historia del reino cambi\u00f3 constantemente, los funcionarios admitieron a finales de octubre que el asesinato fue premeditado y fue ejecutado por un grupo de 15 hombres de varias agencias gubernamentales e incluso algunos del c\u00edrculo de asesores m\u00e1s cercanos al pr\u00edncipe.\n\nTurqu\u00eda sostiene que Khashoggi fue atacado, golpeado y desmembrado poco despu\u00e9s de ingresar al consulado. Por su parte, los funcionarios saud\u00edes han indicado que el equipo de hombres fue enviado para convencer al periodista de que regresara a Arabia Saudita y que \u00e9l fue asesinado por error con una sobredosis para someterlo temporalmente.

The Times report, citing two people familiar with the conver\u2026 [+1590 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on multiple occasions raised with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then-chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, whether the Justice Department was progressing in investigating Hillary Clinton, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe President also wanted his previous White House counsel, Don McGahn, to ask the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton on numerous occasions, but McGahn rebuffed doing that, the source said.\n\nAnticipating the question about Clinton would be raised, Whitaker came prepared to answer with what Justice was doing on Clinton-related matters, including the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One investigations, the source said. The source added that Whitaker was trying to appease the President, but did not seem to cross any line.\n\nReached Tuesday by CNN analyst Josh Campbell -- who formerly served as an aide to Comey at the FBI -- the fired director said he was shaking his head at reports the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him, Campbell said on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said.\n\nCampbell said Comey noted that he was pleased The New York Times made clear in its story that he had not divulged classified information, a claim Trump and his allies have made.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nIn March, then-Attorney General Sessions revealed that Utah's top federal prosecutor, John Huber, was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign adviser, and claims that more should have been done to investigate Clinton's ties to a Russian nuclear energy agency, which have not been proven.\n\nAnd in January, CNN reported that the US attorney and FBI in Arkansas were investigating allegations of corruption related to the Clinton Foundation. The FBI and federal prosecutors are looking into whether donors to the foundation were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers, as well as whether tax-exempt funds were misused, the official said. A spokesman for Clinton dismissed the allegations as unfounded.\n\nWilliam Burck, a lawyer for McGahn, issued a statement following the Times report that said the President hadn't ordered prosecutions of Clinton or Comey.\n\n\"Mr. McGahn will not comment on his legal advice to the president. Like any client, the president is entitled to confidentiality. Mr. McGahn would point out, though, that the president never, to his knowledge, ordered that anyone prosecute Hillary Clinton or James Comey,\" Burck said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nWhen Trump requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President that he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, and even requesting an investigation could be a step too far, the Times reported. McGahn went on to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a demand for Trump, according to the report.\n\nTrump has long called for legal action against Clinton, his Democratic rival in 2016, over her private email use as secretary of state, and he has alleged that Comey, who he fired as FBI director last year, leaked classified information.\n\nMcGahn left the White House in October, a long-planned departure that followed a tenure marked in part by friction with the President.\n\nWhitaker, meanwhile, was tapped as acting attorney general over Rosenstein after Trump fired Sessions earlier this month. Democrats have decried Whitaker's appointment in part because of his previous comments criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which he now supervises.\n\nTrump said during his campaign that he would seek to use the presidency to direct an investigation against Clinton, and since taking office he has repeatedly railed against the Justice Department for the special counsel investigation's focus on his associates rather than investigations into his political opponents.\n\nTrump engaged in a war of words with Sessions several months before the Alabama Republican was fired, and the President said on Twitter that Sessions should investigate Democrats and \"Comey lies.\"\n\nCNN reported prior to McGahn's official exit that Trump was unnerved about the extent of McGahn's personal cooperation with Mueller's investigation -- cooperation that included some 30 hours of interviews with Mueller's team.\n\nBut McGahn's time in the White House also saw him in a central role shaping the federal judiciary and helping to shepherd Trump's picks for the Supreme Court through the Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Christina Maxouris and Brandon Griggs, CNN", "title": "An anonymous man calling himself Santa picked up the tab for Walmart customers in Vermont", "description": "They don't know his name.

Lopez was shot in the abdomen and he shot himself in the head, according to the medical examiner's daily case ledger. It's not clear which caused his death.\n\nHere is what we know about these three victims and the recollections of those they left behind.\n\nDr. Tamara O'Neal: Dedicated to helping others\n\nTamara O'Neal, known to relatives as Tammy, was an emergency room physician at Chicago's Mercy Hospital.\n\nO'Neal, 38, was shot in the hospital's parking lot immediately after she finished her shift. Police said the gunman approached her in the lot, argued with her and then shot her.\n\nThe gunman had been O'Neal's fianc\u00e9 until late September, when she called off the engagement, her father, Tom O'Neal, told CNN on Tuesday. Lopez \"couldn't accept\" that the relationship was over, her father said. The former pair had been scheduled to marry in October, he said.\n\nO'Neal's father said she was a strong faith believer and that she and Lopez were not united in that faith.\n\n\"I just thank God for the 38 years we had with her. I was thinking we'd have a lot longer,\" Tom O'Neal said. \"We were expecting being grandparents, spoiling the grandchildren.\"\n\n\"She's tremendously loved by her family. This isn't all a loss,\" he said. \"The things she did, we're going to hold on to those things.\"\n\nO'Neal took on medicine as a second career, she helped needy children get school supplies and was dedicated to church, agreeing to work much of the weekend to guarantee Sundays off, her boss recalled.\n\n\"Just the best person ever. Really,\" Dr. Patrick Connor, chairman of the hospital's emergency department, told reporters.\n\nOften treating shooting victims, Connor said O'Neal was concerned about gun violence.\n\n\"She talked about it a lot,\" he said. \"And about the incessant national tragedy that all these people are dying needlessly.\"\n\nA native of Portage, Indiana, O'Neal graduated from the University of Illinois-Chicago's emergency medicine program in 2016, he said.\n\n\"Simply one of the most fascinating, hard-working persons,\" Connor said. \"Medicine was a second career for her. ... She just started practicing here two years ago.\"\n\nO'Neal was a niece of Southern Illinois University assistant men's basketball coach Anthony Beane Sr., her father said. She was a cousin of Beane's son, SIU basketball player Darius Beane, who learned about his relative's death from his father after a game Monday night, head coach Barry Hinson said.\n\n\"I would like for our fans to keep that family and other families' members in their prayers,\" Hinson told reporters.\n\nOfficer Samuel Jimenez: 'Heroic actions'\n\nChicago Officer Samuel Jimenez was killed in the shooting on Monday.\n\nSamuel Jimenez, the slain police officer, had just become a full-fledged member of the force, having completed a probationary training period after joining the department in February 2017, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters.\n\nJimenez, 28, and his partner went to the hospital when they heard dispatch traffic about the shooting.\n\n\"They weren't assigned to that particular call, but they went,\" Johnson said, \"because that's what we do.\"\n\nJimenez is survived by a wife and three children, Johnson said. The responding officers \"saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he (the gunman) was prepared to do,\" Johnson said.\n\nA procession was held Monday night, and Chicago police posted on Twitter to pay final respects.\n\n\"Today, we mourn Chicago Police Officer Samuel Jimenez. His heroic actions saved countless lives. He ran toward danger. He ran toward those shots. He ran into fire. Selflessly,\" the department tweeted.\n\nA wake is scheduled for Sunday and Jimenez' funeral is Monday morning, police said.\n\nDayna Less: She was tenacious\n\nDayna Less, 24, was a first-year pharmacy resident training to be a pharmacist, the hospital said. She recently graduated from Purdue University and joined the hospital staff in July.\n\nShe was fatally shot by the gunman as she was getting off the elevator, Johnson said. She had \"nothing to do with\" anything related to the gunman.\n\nAs a teenager, Less had a severe headache disorder that left her largely unable to go to school, her father, Brian Less, said at a press conference Tuesday. She eventually found a doctor at Georgetown University who performed two surgeries that addressed the symptoms, he said.\n\n\"I have a picture where she traded two black eyes for a smile,\" he said. \"She came out of surgery, she was all beat up, but she had a smile for the first time in a year.\"\n\nThe experience made Dayna tenacious in her career and how she took care of herself, he said.\n\nBrian Less told the story of when his daughter went to Kenya as a pharmacy student on rotations. When she got there, the doctors in Kenya went on strike, leaving the pharmacists and the few others with an education in charge of the patients.\n\nDayna felt overwhelmed, he said, but she still wrote on her blog about her \"wins\" of the day and focused on the positive things she encountered.\n\n\"She was a positive person,\" he said. \"That's who she was.\"\n\nBrian Less said he didn't want his daughter to be remembered as a victim.\n\n\"Dayna was a very special person. She had unique gifts,\" he said, according to CNN affiliate WLS . \"She was intelligent, she was funny, she was kind, she was a good friend.\"\n\nViolence a \"serious public health issue\"\n\nMercy hospital, a member of Trinity Health, released a statement mourning O'Neal and Less as well as commenting on the importance of addressing violence in all of its forms.\n\n\"Trinity Health colleagues, nurses, physicians and clinicians are committed to combatting violence -- in all of its forms -- everywhere. Violence in all of its forms is a serious public health issue. By standing up against all violence, including workplace violence, domestic violence, gun, street and gang violence, we can be agents of changes that make our communities healthier. \""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trauma surgeons push back against NRA", "description": "Dr. Deborah Kuhls talks about her experience as a trauma surgeon treating gunshot victims as the feud between the National Rifle Association and the medical community still rages on, with the latest round coming from physicians who released an editorial sayin\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/11/20/trauma-doctors-nra-kuhls-baldwin-nr-intv.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120170520-baldwin-trauma-surgeon-kuhls-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:28:01Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

CNN has confirmed that Miniutti is the alleged victim in the arrest. Avenatti, who was released on bail the day of the arrest, has not yet been charged in the case.\n\nIn a declaration filed as part of the request for a restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court, Miniutti, 24, said she and Avenatti had been dating since October 2017 and living together since January of this year.\n\nShe described an altercation last week in which she and Avenatti began fighting about money, leading to him calling her an \"ungrateful, f***** bitch.\" Avenatti proceeded to get \"very close to me in a threatening manner that made me afraid,\" Miniutti said in the declaration.\n\nAs the altercation worsened, Miniutti alleged, Avenatti \"began forcefully hitting me in the face with pillows from the bed,\" and then grabbed her wrist and, later, her arm.\n\n\"He dragged me on the floor of the apartment towards and out of the door into the public hallway,\" Miniutti said. \"I was wearing only my underwear and t-shirt at the time, and suffered scratches to the bare skin on my side and leg.\"\n\nMiniutti said she eventually went down to the ground floor of the building, with Avenatti following. Miniutti said a friend picked her up and took Miniutti to her home, after which she called the police and gave them her statement.\n\nThe next day, Miniutti said, she returned to the building to retrieve her belongings from the apartment. As she began to gather her things, Miniutti said, Avenatti appeared, so she ran to the balcony in fear.\n\n\"A short while later, police detectives entered the apartment and told me that (Avenatti) had been arrested,\" Miniutti said in the declaration.\n\nMiniutti also said there was another occasion -- in February of this year -- when Avenatti \"acted in a physically violent manner\" toward her. He \"had been drinking,\" she said, \"and became angry at me.\"\n\n\"Respondent pushed me out of the apartment into the public hallway where I hit my head against a door across the hallway. Respondent then threw my shoes at me, striking me in the leg.\"\n\nShe also alleged that Avenatti had a history of being \"very verbally abusive and financially controlling\" toward her.\n\nAvenatti has vehemently denied the allegations against him, telling CNN he never laid a hand on Miniutti or any woman and that he expects to be fully exonerated.\n\nAvenatti's attorneys -- Evan Jenness and Richard Beada -- shared a different version of events in a statement given to police on Monday.\n\n\"Ms. Miniutti and Mr. Avenatti had an argument while in Mr. Avenatti's apartment during which Ms. Miniutti behaved in a volatile, agitated and irrational manner. However, Mr. Avenatti did not inflict any corporal injury or cause any traumatic condition upon Ms. Miniutti,\" Avenatti's attorneys said.\n\nThey also said Avenatti's statements are bolstered by witnesses, as well as surveillance video in the halls, elevator and entrance to the building. There is, however, no mention in the attorneys' statement of any video inside the apartment where the alleged incident took place.\n\nAvenatti tweeted Tuesday afternoon: \"I want the truth to be known - all of it. The truth about the alleged incident on Tues night/Wed am, as well as the truth about TMZ's completely false reporting about last Wed afternoon. I want it ALL disclosed. ASAP. As a result, I just authorized the release of all the video.\"\n\nMichael Bachner, Miniutti's lawyer, told CNN in an email Tuesday evening: \"Mareli Miniutti stands by the accuracy of her statements to the LAPD. The suggestions contained in Mr. Avenatti's counsel's letter to the LAPD are vindictive, contrary to the evidence, and unworthy of further reply.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has refused CNN's public records request to view the police report in the case, saying it is still part of the investigation.\n\nCNN has attempted multiple times to reach Miniutti but she has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nMiniutti's husband, Michael Miniutti, told CNN on Tuesday that he and his wife have been separated since January 2017, when she moved to California.\n\n\"The only thing I can say is: In Mareli's defense, she was never aggressive. She never put me in an aggressive state of mind or anything like that,\" he told CNN over the phone. \"She's a very calm, well-mannered, respectful individual. Very polite. Classy woman. And that's it. That's all I can say on her behalf.\"\n\nAsked about the alleged incident, Miniutti said: \"A man should never raise a hand to a woman.

Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone again provide a potent one-two combo, in a movie filled with nostalgic callbacks that make the most of the franchise's durable formula.\n\nNobody should have any illusions about what \"Creed II\" is. The first bout, with \"Black Panther's\" Ryan Coogler as ringmaster, was as much a remake of the Rocky films as a long-deferred sequel to them, from the training sequences to the melodrama to the stirring fanfare borrowed from Bill Conti's score.\n\nThere's a reason, though, that series piled up so many Roman numerals, even if it became increasingly ridiculous the farther it got away from the original's charming underdog tale. And Stallone (who shares script credit), his fellow writers and new director Steven Caple Jr. have capitalized on that history by layering on pieces culled from the earlier movies, \"Rocky IV\" foremost among them.\n\nIn a clever if wholly logical wrinkle, the big loser in that fight, Soviet automaton Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), paid a heavy price for his failure. Yet potential redemption resides in his son Viktor (German boxer Florian \"Big Nasty\" Munteanu), a hulking bruiser who makes his scientifically honed dad look like a wimp, raised in the kind of barren Ukrainian surroundings that have instilled the eye of the tiger.\n\nWith Adonis Creed (Jordan) advancing his ring career, a savvy promoter (Russell Hornsby) recognizes the promotable allure of a Creed-Drago marquee fight, given the tragic end Adonis' father met at Ivan's fists. For Rocky, not surprisingly, the idea of being in the corner to witness another such demolition is a prospect that fills him with dread, testing the bond between them.\n\nRead More"}, {"source":

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) When Donald Trump was running for president against Hillary Clinton, the biggest scandal from the Clinton campaign was about her emails -- specifically, that Clinton had used a personal email server to send and receive emails (including some containing classified information) during her time in the State Department, rather than official government email.\n\nThe now-President and his party turned a \"careless\" ( said the FBI ) act into an overblown scandal. Clinton was investigated twice by the FBI and twice cleared of criminal behavior, though she received a stern lecture from former FBI Director James Comey. He also told a House Oversight and Government Reform panel that the agency's investigation could not establish that she \"acted with the necessary criminal intent\" (though his decision to publicize the FBI investigation may have cost Clinton the election).\n\nDonald Trump, however, said he believed Clinton's use of personal email for official government business was such a significant violation that he made it a cornerstone of his loud and unrelenting campaign pitch to rabid followers: \"Lock her up.\"\n\nIs he going to do the same to Ivanka?\n\nIt turns out the President's daughter, who serves as a senior adviser to him, has been using her personal email for official government business.\n\nWhoops.\n\nJUST WATCHED Scaramucci on Ivanka emails: It's hypocritical Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scaramucci on Ivanka emails: It's hypocritical 01:36\n\nIvanka Trump pleaded ignorance, saying she just didn't know the rules about personal email use -- a story that's a little tough to believe, given that during the campaign her father apparently considered himself an expert on the very issue of personal email use in the White House. (Her lawyer also denies that she sent or received classified material on her private email.)\n\nIt's also another example of the President's troubling nepotism habit. If his daughter had not been adequately briefed on the rules, she should not have been doing government business for her dad.\n\nA White House spokesman tried to split hairs , arguing that Ivanka Trump didn't use a personal server housed in her home or at the Trump Organization -- as if it somehow makes her emails more secure and not less. And she used nearly identical justifications as Clinton: that she used the account \"almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" that emails related to her work with other government officials were captured in those officials' government email accounts, and that she worked with a lawyer after the fact to sift through the emails, submitting the relevant ones to the official records.\n\nThat wasn't good enough when Clinton asserted it. But apparently the rules are different for the Trumps.\n\nThis White House has been marked by a level of scandal and hypocrisy heretofore unseen in American politics. The lying and self-dealing are so pervasive that the stories about them barely stay in the headlines. There are simply too many, they come too often, and -- dangerously -- we get used to them.\n\nThe President continues to profit from his own company , which does deals with the same leaders who want American policy to favor them; those same leaders stay in the President's hotels when they visit the United States. It's so blatantly unethical, and so straight out of the corrupt authoritarian's playbook, it would be laughable -- were it not further dismantling American democratic norms by the day.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin rips Ivanka over using private email Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin rips Ivanka over using private email 02:28\n\nAnd the bad apple didn't fall far from the Trump tree. The President's daughter also actively mixed business and politics, using her nebulous position in the White House to build her brand. Though she announced in July that she was shuttering her namesake company, she had already spent months wearing (and touting) her own brand and using her position as a marketing ploy.\n\nShe says, now, that she has turned over government-related emails to the appropriate record-keepers. But the email lapse under scrutiny is from the same period in which Ivanka Trump was still profiting from her shoe and clothing line. When her entire family so cunningly uses their political status for personal monetary gain and then claims the business is separate, do we believe that she separated the political from the personal? Is it even possible to run a pure business endeavor, without political influence, when you work in the White House and when your professional brand is your job?\n\nIf this White House had any sense of ethical obligation, fundamental fairness or even self-awareness, it would agree to -- even demand -- an FBI investigation, to demonstrate that their alleged commitment to law and order isn't just a cudgel used against perceived opponents.\n\nBut of course, that is exactly what the President's crusade against \"Crooked Hillary\" was about: leverage against a hated opponent. There was nothing genuine about it then; it was just one more way for a wannabe-dictator to attack an adversary. Nothing makes this clearer than the response to Ivanka Trump's personal email usage.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nConsider, too, that a Republican Congress opened up investigation after investigation into Clinton -- her emails, Benghazi, and on and on. Those same Republican congressmen and women should be doing one of two things: holding the Trump family to the same standard and demanding an FBI investigation, or issuing a full-throated apology, recognizing that they acted out of craven self-interest to undermine an opponent rather than out of any desire to uphold the law.\n\nThey will do neither: Decency and honesty have long since absconded from the Republican Party.\n\nDemocrats, who now have a majority in Congress, shouldn't stoop to the level of the GOP and engage in petty political warfare. They should implement their agenda, which centers on actually helping people, rather than just tightening their hold on power and trying to destroy their enemies at any cost.\n\nBut there is something they should do with their newfound power, if they are to be responsible stewards of the rule of law: hold the President and his grifting family fully accountable. That starts with President Trump -- and Crooked Ivanka."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Katie Lobosco, CNN", "title": "Trump faces mounting pressure to lift tariffs on Canada, Mexico", "description": "Pressure is rising on President Donald Trump to lift his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum before signing a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement at the end of next week.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/steel-aluminum-tariffs-usmca/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181002153407-usmca-tariffs-steel-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:45:42Z", "content": "New York (CNN) Industry groups are renewing their push to convince President Donald Trump to lift his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum before signing a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement at the end of next week.

In October, a Mexican official suggested his country wouldn't sign the new agreement until Trump lifts the duties.\n\nTrudeau has indicated that the tariffs wouldn't hold up the signing of the deal.\n\n\"We're not at the point of saying that we wouldn't sign if it wasn't lifted -- although we're trying to make that case,\" Trudeau told CNN's Poppy Harlow earlier this month.\n\nHe added: \"We would much rather have genuine free trade with the United States, so we're going to continue to work, as soon as we can, to lift those tariffs.\"\n\nTrump has made it a priority to take an aggressive stance on protecting American industries from foreign countries engaging in unfair trading practices. He pushed ahead with steel and aluminum tariffs even at the cost of losing his top economic adviser Gary Cohn, who ultimately resigned in the wake of a fierce disagreement on the issue.\n\nbut argued that tariffs on Canada and Mexico are not helping to solve that problem. The Trump administration has said the duties were imposed on steel and aluminum in the interest of national security. In the letter, the industry groups said that China's unfair trade practices, including subsidizing steel and aluminum, should be addressedbut argued that tariffs on Canada and Mexico are not helping to solve that problem.\n\nThey said the tariffs \"have caused significant harm to American manufacturers, consumers and workers\" because they raise prices for things like auto parts and beer cans.\n\nFormer Republican Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, who represents the big three automakers -- Fiat Chrysler, GM and Ford -- has said the duties drive up the cost of production in the United States by $400 per vehicle.\n\nThe group, which is collectively called the American Automotive Policy Council, signed the letter sent to Lighthizer urging removal of the tariffs.\n\nThe USMCA will need to be ratified by Congress after it's signed. Democrats, who will have control of the House next year, have signaled concerns about the deal\n\nLawmakers are likely to wait for an economic impact report from the US International Trade Commission before voting. The commission has until 105 days after the signing, or mid-March, to deliver its report to Congress."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Obama on why Congress is broken", "description": "President Obama said the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate, has made it \"impossible\" to effectively govern", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/20/obama-filibuster-impossible-to-govern-orig-me.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120162843-obama-filibuster-impossible-to-govern-orig-me-00002926-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:40:13Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Trump t\u2026 [+2892 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller related to the investigation of possible collusion between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe responses from the President signify a major development in the Mueller probe following months of negotiations between the special counsel's office and Trump's legal team, and could be a sign of the end stages of the investigation.\n\nTrump told reporters before boarding Marine One to travel to Mar-a-Lago in Florida that he finished the written answers on Monday and provided them to his lawyers. \"The written answers are finished,\" Trump said. \"The written answers to the witch hunt that's been going on forever.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought Mueller would be fair, Trump said he hopes so.\n\n\"The President today answered written questions submitted by the special counsel's office,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry. The President responded in writing.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether the answers will be enough for Mueller to finish his investigation, as there could be additional questions -- and the special counsel's office could still try to pursue an in-person interview with Trump.\n\nTrump and his legal team balked at some of the questions from Mueller that covered the presidential transition and Trump's time in the White House, believing those could be off limits due to executive privilege, CNN has previously reported.\n\nThe questions also cover only issues related to the potential collusion investigation and not the probe into possible obstruction of justice.\n\n\"It has been our position from the outset that much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry,\" Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in a statement. \"This remains our position today. The President has nonetheless provided unprecedented cooperation. The special counsel has been provided with more than 30 witnesses, 1.4 million pages of material, and now the President's written responses to questions. It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion.\"\n\nNow that Trump has submitted his answers, the ball is back in Mueller's court to decide whether to pursue additional questions, follow-ups to the President's response or an in-person interview.\n\nWhen Trump's legal team agreed to answer questions about collusion, they put off decisions about answering questions related to obstruction or sitting down for an interview. And Trump suggested in a recent interview with \"Fox News Sunday\" that those could be off the table.\n\n\"I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished,\" Trump told Fox's Chris Wallace when asked if he would say no to an in-person interview or providing answers on obstruction questions.\n\nIf Trump's legal team rebuffs further inquiries from Mueller, it will be up to the special counsel to decide whether he has enough to finish writing his report or he needs an interview. Mueller could try to subpoena Trump for an interview, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker likely would need to sign off on that decision.\n\nThe big looming question over the agreement for Trump to provide the written answers related to the period during the campaign is whether that satisfies Mueller's questions about the transition and inauguration. Trump's legal team was provided a list of questions in the spring that included asking about efforts during the transition to establish a back channel to Russia and a 2017 meeting in the Seychelles involving Trump ally Erik Prince, a businessman and founder of the private security company formerly known as Blackwater."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sarah Westwood, CNN", "title": "Trump defends daughter Ivanka amid email scrutiny", "description": "President Donald Trump acknowledged Tuesday that his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump did use private email during the start of the administration, but declined to acknowledge any hypocrisy over his criticism during the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinto\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-email-defense/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181105192613-trump-ivanka-rally-cleveland-ohio-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:05:50Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump acknowledged Tuesday that his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump did use private email during the start of the administration, but declined to acknowledge any hypocrisy over his criticism during the 2016 campaign \u2026 [+1616 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump acknowledged Tuesday that his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump did use private email during the start of the administration, but declined to acknowledge any hypocrisy over his criticism during the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinton's similar practice.\n\n\"Just so you understand, early and for a little period of time, Ivanka did some emails,\" Trump told reporters on the South Lawn.\n\nIvanka Trump last year used a personal email account to discuss or relay official White House business, according to emails released by a nonpartisan watchdog group.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday the White House conducted an investigation into Ivanka Trump's email usage and that she used her personal email address for much of 2017.\n\nAccording to emails released by the watchdog group, American Oversight, the President's daughter used her personal account to email Cabinet officials, White House aides and assistants.

Here, prisoners meditate and stretch before their creative writing class with Stackable. \"It's a sacred place where you can write, and you can feel free to share your writing and trust people in a place where no one trusts anybody,\" Stackable says.

Seeing the situation day after day, Pun-Chong decided to start a shelter. \"The shelter is a very special place,\" he says. \"We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.\" Hide Caption 10 of 20\n\nPhotos: CNN Heroes: It takes action to make change New York emergency room doctor Rob Gore helped create the Kings Against Violence Initiative, an organization that hosts anti-violence programs at Kings County hospital, local schools and in the broader community.

That marks the cheapest closing price since late October 2017.\n\nThe latest deep selloff coincided with more mayhem on Wall Street . The Dow shed more than 600 points on Tuesday as fears about slowing earnings and economic growth deepen.\n\n\"In times of crises, all assets correlate,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. \"Crude has gotten caught up in the flight from equities.\"\n\nIn the span of just seven weeks, crude has gone from spiking to nosediving into a bear market . Fears of a new supply glut and weakening demand have wiped out 30% of its value since hitting a four-year high of $76 a barrel in early October.\n\nCrude has sold off by about 7% twice in the past week. The November 13 decline of 7.1% was the worst in three years.\n\nBeyond the stock market tumble, energy analysts saw few new reasons for the energy plunge.\n\n\"Oil traders are overwhelmed by bearish news,\" said Clay Seigle, managing director of oil at Genscape. \"The broad selloff in equities has traders concerned about the possibility of an economic slowdown, which could reduce demand for oil products.\"\n\nOne new development may have also helped weigh on oil prices. President Donald Trump signaled on Tuesday he won't punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nEnergy traders may be interpreting the White House comments on US-Saudi ties as a sign that the kingdom won't aggressively cut oil production to support the market. Trump has repeatedly urged Saudi Arabia and OPEC not to do anything that will lift prices.\n\n\"If we broke with them I think your oil prices would go through the roof,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday.\n\nHe also said he was \"not going to destroy the economy of our country\" over the murder of Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nOPEC is scheduled to meet next month in Vienna to weigh a potential output shift.\n\n\"You've got to think OPEC will be looking to make a sizable cut to try to reign in supplies and find a floor for prices here,\" said ClipperData's Smith.\n\nNot long ago, OPEC was under pressure to ramp up output in a bid to avoid $100 oil. Traders feared a supply shortage caused by the Trump administration's sanctions on Iran, the world's fifth biggest oil producer.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration took a softer approach on Iran than it initially signaled. Temporary waivers were granted to China, India and other buyers.\n\nBy that point, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States had already ramped up output, leaving the market with a potential glut. US production has been especially strong, driven by the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas. US output alone is expected to spike by 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018.\n\nAt the same time, the global growth worries spooking Wall Street threatens to eat into demand . The International Energy Agency warned last week of \"relatively weak\" demand for oil in Europe and advanced Asian countries as well as a \"slowdown\" in India, Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\"The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated,\" the IEA wrote."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Analysis by Nathan Hodge and David Shortell, CNN", "title": "A Russian could be the new head of Interpol and the West isn't happy", "description": "Interpol holds its general assembly this week in Dubai, and the meeting has become a new flashpoint in the ongoing confrontation between Russia and the West.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/europe/interpol-president-vote-russian-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120141849-01-alexander-prokopchuk-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:27:39Z", "content": "Moscow (CNN) Interpol holds its general assembly this week in Dubai, and the meeting has become a new flashpoint in the ongoing confrontation between Russia and the West.

And a leading candidate for the job is Alexander Prokopchuk, currently Moscow's most senior Interpol official.\n\nThat has critics in Washington and in Russia up in arms. The reason? Russia, they say, has a track record of using Interpol's systems to crack down on and pursue the Kremlin's political foes.\n\nOn Monday a bipartisan group of US senators released a letter saying the election of Prokopchuk would be \"akin to putting a fox in charge of a henhouse.\"\n\nWhile the president of Interpol is not in charge of day-to-day operations -- the secretary general holds that responsibility -- the holder of the position can influence its overall strategy.\n\nIn their letter , the senators urged the Trump administration and members of Interpol's general assembly to oppose Prokopchuk's candidacy, saying it would undermine its credibility.\n\n\"Russia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists,\" the letter said. \"Alexander Prokopchuk has been personally involved in this intimidation strategy which ultimately seeks to weaken democratic institutions and embolden Putin's authoritarian regime. If elected as president by the members of Interpol's general assembly on Wednesday, we have no doubt that Mr. Prokopchuk will further institutionalize the abuse of Interpol red notices and block ongoing efforts at meaningful reform.\"\n\nLeader needs credibility\n\nOn Tuesday, the US threw its backing behind another candidate. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo endorsed Kim Jong Yang, a South Korean police official who is currently the acting president of Interpol, for the job on a permanent basis.\n\n\"We encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world's most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that,\" Pompeo said at a news conference in Washington.\n\nAn aide to US Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee and one of the senators behind the bipartisan letter, said Tuesday that his office was working with the US Justice Department and US State Department to lobby Interpol member states against voting for Prokopchuk.\n\nLouis Shelley, a transnational crime expert and director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, called the potential election of a Russian as Interpol's president a \"catastrophe for international criminal justice.\"\n\nThe president of Interpol establishes the agency's working committees and \"has an influence on policy,\" Shelley said.\n\n\"It's not as if it's just some figurehead,\" Shelley said. \"It totally politicizes the organization and provides that Interpol becomes a political tool of an authoritarian government.\"\n\nThe potential appointment of Prokopchuk has also drawn criticism from Russia's embattled opposition. Leading Putin critic Alexei Navalny said Monday on Twitter his supporters had \"suffered from abuse of Interpol for political persecution by Russia.\"\n\nCalls for reform\n\nUS-born businessman Bill Browder also says he has firsthand knowledge of how the Russian government uses Interpol to settle political scores: He said the Russian government has issued a string of \"red notices\" in attempts to arrest and extradite him. In a press conference Tuesday, Browder said that if a Russian now becomes the head of Interpol, new rules to prevent Russian abuses must be imposed.\n\n\"Or if that's not possible, it may be time to create an international law enforcement that just consists of countries that abide by the rule of law,\" \" Browder said,\n\nPutin critic Bill Browder says Interpol has abused its position.\n\nBrowder has been the driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, which was signed into law in the US in 2012 and blocks entry into the US and freezes the assets of certain Russian government officials and businessmen accused of human rights violations. The act is named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer, who died in Russian custody in 2009.\n\nObservers say the Kremlin has made a priority of weakening or even overturning the Magnitsky Act, even as several other countries have adopted similar laws to deter corruption and human-rights violations.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the US was \"meddling\" in the election of a new Interpol chief, amid rising opposition to the possible appointment of a Russian Interior Ministry official to head the international agency.\n\nJUST WATCHED Wife of ex-Interpol chief fears for her life Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Wife of ex-Interpol chief fears for her life 03:30\n\nAsked in a conference call with reporters to comment on the letter from the US lawmakers, Peskov said: \"We haven't seen the actual letter, but we've read media reports about it. I guess this is meddling in an electoral process in way, in the election of an international organization. How can we think of it otherwise? This is a very telling move.\"\n\nThat the vacancy exists at all is itself controversial.

One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople have become sick in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has identified an additional 18 people who have become sick with the same strain of E. coli in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which is also investigating the outbreak, cautions that if you have any romaine lettuce at home, you should throw it away, even if you have eaten some and did not get sick.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday that it is \"frustrating\" that the FDA cannot tie the outbreak to a specific grower, but \"we have confidence that it's tied to romaine lettuce.\"\n\n\"Most of the romaine lettuce being harvested right now is coming from the California region, although there's some lettuce coming in from Mexico,\" he said.\n\nAll brands and types of romaine lettuce\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce, Gottlieb said. Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants also should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nA similar outbreak caused by contaminated romaine lettuce occurred in December, Gottlieb said, and affected the United States and Canada. \"The strain in 2017 is the same as the strain in this fall 2018 outbreak, and the time of year is exactly the same. So It's likely associated with end of season harvest in California,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different this year is that the FDA has higher confidence that it's romaine lettuce in both countries. \"This year, we're a month earlier, so we're earlier in the process, earlier in the throes of an outbreak,\" Gottlieb said. \"So we're able to actually get real-time information and conduct effective trace back and isolate what the source is.\"\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the US Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating the outbreak. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\n\"That's why we think it's critical to get this information out,\" Gottlieb said. \"We understand fully the impact this has, not just on the growers and the distributors but also on consumers -- consumers who are preparing meals for the holidays, who have product now that they're going to need to discard, maybe food that they've already cooked.\"\n\nHow does the US prevent foodborne illness?\n\nFoodborne illness hits one in six Americans every year, the CDC says, estimating that 48 million people get sick due to one or another of 31 pathogens. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die annually.\n\nPreventing foodborne illness in the United States is the job of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees the meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and the FDA, responsible for domestic and imported foods.\n\nWith frequent news of outbreaks, which are investigated by the CDC, many people might wonder whether foodborne illness is on the rise -- and whether safety measures across the nation adequately protect our food supply.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the CDC has investigated 21 multistate foodborne illness outbreaks this year, more than any year in the past decade.\n\n\"I think that the issue isn't that there's more unsafe food,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think what's happening is that we have better technology than ever before to link outbreaks of human illness to a common pathogen.\"\n\nIn all 50 states, the CDC has the capacity to do genomic testing on samples from infected patients (such as blood samples). It also can genetically link the identified pathogens in human illness to actual food sources.\n\nWhat is lagging is the ability to do track and trace to a single distributor or grower \"because we don't have as good a technology as we would like in our supply chain,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother recent development in protecting the US food supply is the Food Safety Modernization Act , which became law in 2011. Gottlieb said the act represents a \"paradigm shift,\" as it is based on prevention instead of reaction.\n\n\"I think food is more safe now than it's ever been. We have much more resources and additional tools to do effective surveillance.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Manu Raju and Annie Grayer, CNN", "title": "Freshmen Democrats feel the squeeze as Pelosi fight intensifies", "description": "As Gil Cisneros completed a Democratic sweep of Orange County, the incoming House freshman fielded a phone call from a person heavily invested in his victory.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/freshmen-democrats-nancy-pelosi/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120133544-cisneros-pelosi-stevens-split-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:20:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) As Gil Cisneros completed a Democratic sweep of Orange County , the incoming House freshman fielded a phone call from a person heavily invested in his victory.\n\nIt was Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe House Democratic leader congratulated her fellow California Democrat in a warm phone call for a hard-fought victory in what used to be reliably Republican terrain.\n\n\"I told her, 'Thank you very much for calling' and that was pretty much it,\" Cisneros told CNN. \"And we'll probably talk later.\"\n\nIndeed, they probably will.\n\nCisneros is one of 12 incoming freshmen Democrats who vowed on the campaign trail to back new leadership in the new Congress, distancing themselves from Pelosi whom the GOP vilified in nearly $100 million worth of ads throughout the country. Now, in their first vote, freshmen like Cisneros will be forced to choose whether to back Pelosi for speaker to be their caucus' nominee -- or stand by what they said on the campaign trail. Pelosi is virtually assured to win that vote, which will be conducted next week by secret ballot, because she only has to win the support from more than half of her caucus.\n\nBut the far more significant vote is the public one in January: On the House floor, on the first day of the new Congress when the full chamber votes to elect a speaker. If Democrats win the remaining three undecided races, they will hold 235 seats, meaning Pelosi cannot afford to lose more than 17 on the House floor, assuming all 535 members attend the vote and support a specific candidate. And on Monday, 16 Democrats signed a letter saying they were \"committed\" to voting for new leadership on the floor, including four freshmen who have won their races and one Democrat, Ben McAdams, whose Utah race has yet to be called.\n\nThat means freshmen Democrats who called for new leadership but who didn't sign the letter are now in a bind.\n\n\"Right now, I'm just focusing on talking to my constituents -- focusing on spending time with my family with Thanksgiving coming up,\" Cisneros said when asked if he'd support Pelosi on the floor. \"And then after that, I'll start talking to people about what's going to happen and how we're going to vote.\"\n\nWhile Cisneros says, \"I still believe it's time for new leadership -- it's a time to hear new voices,\" he also says he hasn't made a decision on how he'll vote on the floor.\n\nPictured above, Rep.-elect Gil Cisneros of California, at left, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi at center, and Rep.-elect Haley Steven of Michigan at right.\n\nPelosi and others make more calls\n\nOne by one, Pelosi is trying to woo freshmen Democrats and current members who may feel disenchanted by the current leadership. Roughly 45 members are making calls on Pelosi's behalf, including to incoming freshmen, according to a Democratic aide, and she is also holding face-to-face meetings and calls with key members. It appears to be having some effect.\n\nLast Friday, when Rep.-elect Haley Stevens met with Pelosi in her office suite near the House floor, the two talked at length about her priorities for the coming Congress.\n\n\"We had a very nice conversation about the needs of Michigan's 11th district -- particularly what I campaigned on,\" Stevens told CNN.\n\nAsked if she was opposed to Pelosi as speaker, Stevens said: \"I haven't said no.\"\n\nThat's a shift from the campaign trail, when Stevens said in April: \"At this time, she doesn't have my support as speaker.\"\n\nShe was even bold enough to suggest whom she would vote for instead. \"Tim Ryan of Youngstown, Ohio, is an inspiring leader,\" she said. \"I think that he would do a great job as the next speaker of the House.\"\n\nAmong the calculations facing incoming Democrats: The power Pelosi has to influence which committees they may sit on.\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey is one of the five fresh Democratic faces to sign the letter vowing to support new leadership on the floor.\n\nAsked if he were concerned that his position could hurt his chances to win spots on key committees, Van Drew said: \"I guess to be totally objective, I'd have to say yes.\"\n\nBut he added that any concerns about backlash from Pelosi or her allies wouldn't impact his ultimate vote.\n\n\"It's not a personal thing, I just think sometimes you have to do what is right,\" Van Drew told CNN. \"I think you also must do what you commit to do during a campaign. Far too often, people say one thing on a campaign and then instantly, when they're elected, they do something different. If I say something on a campaign, that's what I'm going to do when I'm elected.\"\n\nPelosi has not shied away from meeting with her freshmen Democratic critics.\n\nOne of them, incoming Democrat Max Rose of New York, said Pelosi only offered him a Coke when they meet last week.\n\n\"Just an honest opportunity for me to introduce myself and talk more,\" said Rose, who signed the anti-Pelosi letter. \"No pitch. No transactional politics.\"\n\nOther than McAdams, Van Drew and Rose, the other incoming freshmen who signed the letter include Anthony Brindisi of New York and Joe Cunningham of South Carolina.\n\nJared Golden, who won a tough race in Maine, did not sign the anti-Pelosi letter endorsed by 16 of his colleagues. And Pelosi called him immediately after he won to congratulate him.\n\nBut he is still opposed to Pelosi the floor, his spokesman told CNN.\n\n\"He won't be supporting Nancy Pelosi for speaker,\" said Jon Breed, a spokesman for Golden. \"Nothing has changed since the general election.\"\n\nAnother freshman, Jason Crow of Colorado, also promises to vote against Pelosi, despite not signing the letter.\n\n\"I won't be supporting Nancy Pelosi for Speaker,\" he said in a statement to CNN. \"We need new leadership to step up and move this country forward.\"\n\nAbigail Spanberger, the Virginia freshman who did not sign the letter , said after meeting with Pelosi last week that she is still a \"no\" and wouldn't be signing any letters.\n\n\"I've been very clear about my position and that remains the same,\" she said. \"I will be voting but I will not be voting for her.\"\n\nMikie Sherrill, who said bluntly on the campaign trail, \"I don't support Nancy Pelosi,\" also did not sign the letter.\n\nBut after the incoming freshman from New Jersey met with Pelosi last week, Sherrill repeatedly refused to say if she had the same position.\n\n\"I'm sorry I got to go,\" she said repeatedly, as she raced away from reporters.\n\nSherrill directed further inquiries to a nearby aide, who declined to comment for the record. Sherrill's office has not responded to a question seeking comment on the incoming freshman's position.\n\nOther freshmen Pelosi critics also have not responded to CNN questions after their names did not appear on the letter, including Jahana Hayes of Connecticut and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.\n\nMany freshmen evolve toward Pelosi\n\nBut a number of freshmen who distanced themselves from Pelosi are now on her side. Congresswomen-elect Katie Hill, Jennifer Wexton, Lori Trahan and Deb Haaland ran different races from different states, but their paths toward supporting Pelosi follow a similar pattern.\n\nBack in March, Hill was vague on where she stood when she told The Los Angeles Times, \"it's going to depend.\"\n\nIn August, Wexton punted the question to the audience asking, \"for how many of you is this one of your top concerns?\" In October, Wexton acknowledged a need for \"fresh eyes and leadership\" in Washington, but would not go as far as to suggest that meant she did not support Pelosi.\n\n\"I don't even know who's running,\" Wexton said.\n\nIn October, Trahan told CNN, \"I am grateful for Leader Pelosi's help as she crisscrosses the country to help get Democrats elected to Congress on November 6. I'm not making any commitments to any vote on leadership until after the election. My focus is on winning this important election.\"\n\nIn September, Haaland stated, \"I have a tremendous amount of respect\" for Pelosi but, \"I'm focused on winning my election, of course. I won't be doing anything unless I win.\"\n\nAfter winning their respective races, all four women have been unable to dodge the question and have since revealed their firm support for Pelosi.\n\nOthers acknowledge they may have no other choice.\n\nIn October, a spokesperson for Minnesota Democrat Angie Craig told the Minnesota Post that Craig was \"open to new leadership in the House and will make a decision after all candidates have announced, in order to best reflect the needs and interests of the Minnesotans she will represent.\"\n\n\"So far there's one person running and I'm certainly voting for a Democrat, so there you go,\" Craig said last week."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Bradner, CNN", "title": "Obama praises 'extraordinary' Pelosi amid leadership battle", "description": "Former President Barack Obama offered effusive praise of Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday as the Democratic leader faces opposition to her bid for House Speaker.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/barack-obama-nancy-pelosi-axe-files-podcast/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181115131155-01-obama-michigan-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:14:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Chicago (CNN) Former President Barack Obama offered effusive praise of Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday as the Democratic leader faces opposition to her bid for House Speaker.\n\n\"I think Nancy Pelosi, when the history is written, will go down as one of the most effective legislative leaders that this country's ever seen,\" Obama said at a live taping of \"The Axe Files\" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.\n\n\"The Axe Files\" is hosted by David Axelrod, Obama's former top strategist and a CNN political commentator.\n\nThe interview comes as both Barack and Michelle Obama return to the public spotlight after spending most of the first year and a half of Donald Trump's presidency off the stage.

And there is power in that story.\"\n\nObama talks guns, filibusters\n\nIn the interview, Obama also detailed his frustrations with the hurdles he faced on Capitol Hill, saying he favors abolishing the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster and advance legislation and lambasting Republicans for failing to back new gun laws.\n\nObama's comments came a day after a shooting at Mercy Hospital in Chicago in which three people and the gunman were killed.\n\nHe said the hardest day of his presidency was the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\n\"The angriest I was ever during my presidency was seeing Congress not doing anything about it. Completely unresponsive,\" Obama said.\n\nHe complained that mass shootings in the United States are followed by \"this Kabuki dance of, 'We're offering thoughts and prayers,'\" and then no action.\n\n\"The NRA and the entirety, just about, of the Republican Party, and some Democrats ... would just shut off any discussion of dealing with this public health crisis that does not exist anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nObama also said the Senate should abolish the filibuster, a move that would mean legislation requires just a simple majority of votes to pass.\n\nHe said his agenda was repeatedly stymied by Republicans because of the filibuster, and that he failed to turn Washington's gridlock into an issue that motivated voters.\n\n\"I'm the first to confess, you know, I was not able to give this message effectively,\" Obama said.\n\n\"It's just not the stuff that moved people to vote, and the other side didn't get punished for it,\" Obama said. \"We couldn't focus enough attention on the fact that the basic norms of governance that took place for prior presidents suddenly didn't hold for us.\"\n\nObama praises Beto O'Rourke's Texas Senate run\n\nObama, when asked about Beto O'Rourke, praised the Democratic congressman who shattered online fundraising records and visited all 254 of counties in Texas on the way to a closer-than-expected loss to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nHe called O'Rourke an \"impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas.\"\n\n\"What I liked most about his race was that it didn't feel constantly poll-tested,\" Obama said. \"It felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed. And that, you'd like to think, is normally how things work. Sadly it's not.\"\n\nHe also compared O'Rourke to himself.\n\n\"The reason I was able to make a connection with a sizeable portion of the country was because people had a sense that I said what I meant,\" Obama said. \"And that's a quality that, as I look at what I'm sure will be a strong field of candidates in 2020, many of whom are friends of mine and whom I deeply respect -- what I oftentimes am looking for first and foremost is, do you seem to mean it?

Completely unresponsive,\" Obama said.\n\nHe complained that mass shootings in the United States are followed by \"this Kabuki dance of, 'We're offering thoughts and prayers,'\" and then no action.\n\n\"The NRA and the entirety, just about, of the Republican Party, and some Democrats ... would just shut off any discussion of dealing with this public health crisis that does not exist anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nObama also said the Senate should abolish the filibuster, a move that would mean legislation requires just a simple majority of votes to pass.\n\nHe said his agenda was repeatedly stymied by Republicans because of the filibuster, and that he failed to turn Washington's gridlock into an issue that motivated voters.\n\n\"I'm the first to confess, you know, I was not able to give this message effectively,\" Obama said.\n\n\"It's just not the stuff that moved people to vote, and the other side didn't get punished for it,\" Obama said. \"We couldn't focus enough attention on the fact that the basic norms of governance that took place for prior presidents suddenly didn't hold for us.\"\n\nObama praises Beto O'Rourke's Texas Senate run\n\nObama, when asked about Beto O'Rourke, praised the Democratic congressman who shattered online fundraising records and visited all 254 of counties in Texas on the way to a closer-than-expected loss to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nHe called O'Rourke an \"impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas.\"\n\n\"What I liked most about his race was that it didn't feel constantly poll-tested,\" Obama said. \"It felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed. And that, you'd like to think, is normally how things work. Sadly it's not.\"\n\nHe also compared O'Rourke to himself.\n\n\"The reason I was able to make a connection with a sizeable portion of the country was because people had a sense that I said what I meant,\" Obama said. \"And that's a quality that, as I look at what I'm sure will be a strong field of candidates in 2020, many of whom are friends of mine and whom I deeply respect -- what I oftentimes am looking for first and foremost is, do you seem to mean it? Are you in this thing cause you have a strong set of convictions that you are willing to risk things for?\"\n\nWhen Axelrod pressed Obama on whether O'Rourke struck him as someone who fit that description, Obama said, \"Yes, and I think there are others. We've got a number of people who are thinking about the race who I think fall in that same category.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ahiza Garcia, CNN Business", "title": "Beyond bitcoin: the other cryptocurrencies you should know too", "description": "Bitcoin may be the most popular form of digital currency but it's far from the only one.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/tech/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-types/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181003132737-bitcoin-investors-gfx-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:03:30Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "San Francisco (CNN) Bitcoin may be the most popular form of digital currency but it's far from the only one.\n\nIn fact, about 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have emerged since the creation of bitcoin in 2009. And they fall into buckets like stable coins and tokens.\n\nCoupled with the lack of clear regulations or oversight and how new the space is, it's enough to leave any crypto newcomer completely confused.\n\nCrypto is valued by investors because it's not regulated by any central figure. It's also exchanged pseudonymously, which allows for greater privacy.\n\nWhile it was originally used for illicit transactions, it's gained wider adoption. Even companies like Overstock and Starbucks have started experimenting with how to let customers use it to shop.\n\nInvesting in crypto is still risky and volatile -- let's recall bitcoin's infamous rise in value to $20,000 late last year and its current price of under $5,000.\n\nBecause of this, knowing the core differences is worth your time.\n\nCoins vs. Tokens\n\nFirst, you'll want to know the difference between coins and tokens. Coins are essentially virtual cash used for many types of transactions. They're bought and sold over numerous different crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, bitbuy.ca and Binance. The first recorded bitcoin transaction was for two pizzas.\n\nTokens represent assets or anything that has value ascribed to it. For example, tokens can be used to represent things like the ownership of a piece of art or the number of rewards points a customer has in a company's loyalty program. They both have value and rely on blockchain technology, a digital ledger of transactions that can't be erased. But a coin is virtual money and a token is not.\n\nBitcoin and Alt Coins\n\nBitcoin was the original form of cryptocurrency -- and it's the coin others are compared to.\n\n\"Bitcoin is the mother crypto,\" said Marshall Hayner, founder of Metal Pay, an app that's much like Venmo for crypto.\n\nNot surprisingly, its emergence sparked the rise of copycats, including alternative coins like litecoin, XRP and ether.\n\nEther is used to power its own unique blockchain called Ethereum -- one of the biggest creators of smart contracts. These contracts use cryptographic code to verify and trigger transactions when certain conditions are met. For example, a smart contract could be set to pay out a certain amount of crypto at 1:00 p.m. on a specific day.\n\nAnother bitcoin alternative is XRP, which was built to make it easier for banks and payment processors to make cross-border payments. It's one of the most popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are also obscure alternatives, like dogecoin, which was created as a joke based on a viral meme of a Shiba Inu. The dog's face is displayed on the front of the virtual coin. The currency is commonly used on social media to tip users who post interesting things.\n\nDogecoin has helped many people learn about and dabble in trading cryptocurrencies because its community tends to not take itself too seriously and is very friendly to new investors.\n\nStable Coins\n\nStable coins are pegged to actual currencies like the US dollar, the euro or the British pound. That means that one dollar or pound gets you one crypto coin. These coins are designed to mimic actual currencies and tend to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTether was one of the first stable coins.\n\n\"The idea behind tether is you give a dollar and you get one tether,\" Hayner said.\n\nBut there's still risk, according to Ryan Taylor, CEO of the cryptocurrency Dash. Their value can erode over time similar to fiat currencies like the US dollar.\n\nOther recent stable coins are more transparent. For example, TrueUSD complies with some standard financial regulations and uses escrow accounts.\n\nUtility Tokens\n\nUtility tokens represent a certain service or good on a specific platform -- kind of like a gift card to a specific store. They aren't really investments but they have value.\n\nHayner likens them to casino chips: When you go to a casino, you exchange your dollars for chips and then can use those chips to play games. The chips serve a function because they allow you to do something and hold value but you have to exchange them to get actual cash.\n\nTaylor said he was skeptical of most utility tokens because they aren't the best way to interact with users. They require additional steps that make them more complicated to use and that could turn some people off.\n\nHowever, he noted that they do make it possible to transact in extremely small quantities.\n\nSecurity Tokens\n\nSecurity tokens are still relatively new. Their value is derived from real-world assets, which could include commodities like gold or oil, shares of a company or interest in a fund. These tokens are meant to be investments and because they're considered securities and subject to federal security regulations.\n\nSome fans of security tokens argue they would ensure greater accountability for companies because shares would be public and couldn't be over-issued.\n\nBoth Hayner and Taylor say these tokens are still a ways off from showing up in people's portfolios because of uncertainty around how they'd be regulated.\n\nAnd according to Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia Pacific for online trading platform Oanda, security tokens still don't provide enough of a \"consistent metric off which to base an underlying investment strategy.\"\n\nSecurity tokens, which would be regulated, also go against the very core of what crypto was meant to be -- a deregulated currency. But regulations would be a draw for investors.\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens\n\nNon-fungible tokens have a unique value or use. They can store value but no two tokens are the same.\n\nFor example, in the video game CryptoKitties, users can use ether to buy digital cats. The digital kitties can be traded and bred, but each has its own unique non-fungible token that can't be replicated -- kind of like a digital fingerprint.\n\nFuture of money?\n\nDigital currency is becoming more mainstream as companies like Starbucks and Goldman Sachs experiment with how to engage with it.\n\nIt's unclear whether crypto will be the future of money, but it's volatility isn't helping its case for wider adoption. As values continue to drop and rebound, investors continue to show caution.\n\n\"There's a lack of adoption on Wall Street,\" Innes said. \"The big banks that most people are doing business with are reticent to get involved, which I think is telling.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business", "title": "JPMorgan strategist: We're not in a bear market", "description": "The market is sinking again.

Investors are increasingly betting that the rapid economic and profit growth of the past year is about to come to an abrupt end.\n\nThat forecast prompted a freakout on Wall Street over the past two months. The Dow has shed nearly 2,500 points since early October as investors have come to grips with the gloomier outlook. Investors are fleeing former tech darlings like Apple ( AAPL ), Facebook ( FB ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), knocking the Nasdaq 15% below its all-time high.\n\n\"We are beginning to get the scent of a possible slowdown,\" Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, wrote to clients on Monday.\n\nA wide variety of forces have combined to darken the outlook. Tariffs, freight costs and wage hikes are beginning to ding record-high corporate profits. The Federal Reserve's rate hikes are raising borrowing costs -- and squeezing the credit-sensitive housing and auto markets. Investors fear the Fed will hike the United States into a recession.\n\nTaken together, the backdrop points to an end of the heady days of the past year.\n\n\"We've already begun the next bear market,\" said Cole Smead, managing director at Smead Capital, a Seattle investment firm.\n\nSmead said that a \"light switch went off\" at the end of August causing investors to rush out of the most expensive parts of the stock market.\n\n\"Big cap tech and growth darlings are absolutely getting crushed,\" he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs, on the other hand, isn't worried about an imminent bear market.\n\n\"We expect the current bull market in US equities will continue in 2019,\" David Kostin, chief US equities strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients on Tuesday.\n\nHere comes the earnings slowdown\n\nBut Kostin urged clients to take caution by trimming stock holdings and lifting cash balances.\n\nThe biggest headwind may be earnings, the central driver of stock prices. S&P 500 earnings per share will slow dramatically to 6% in 2019 and just 4% in 2020, Goldman Sachs predicts.\n\nThat's quite the reversal from the breakneck pace of earnings growth in 2018, which is estimated at 23%.\n\nDomestic economic growth may have also peaked. US GDP growth will decelerate from 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018 to 1.6% at the end of 2019, Goldman Sachs projects.\n\nSlowdown concerns have already caused economically sensitive stocks to tumble. Boeing ( BA ) is down 10% in November, while Caterpillar ( CAT ) has tumbled 22% this year. Investors have fled the most expensive pocket of the market: former leaders like Netflix, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) are all down sharply from their highs.\n\nGoldman: 43% chance of recession in three years\n\nThe good news is that many economists believe the recovery from the Great Recession will continue through at least July 2019, making it the longest expansion in modern history.\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs only sees a 10% chance of a recession in the next year, the probability rises to 43% within three years. In the past three cycles, each time the chances of a recession during the following three years reached 40%, Goldman Sachs said the economy began to contract within six to eight quarters. The firm said that suggests the next US recession will begin in the second half of 2020, echoing what Moody's Analytics economist Mark Zandi recently predicted.\n\nCalling a recession two years out is very difficult, if not impossible. Many things could change. For instance, a favorable resolution to the US-China trade war, perhaps driven by the Wall Street turmoil, could inspire a lasting rebound in the stock market and real economy alike.\n\nAnd the big wildcard is the Fed and interest rates. No one, not even the Fed, knows exactly how high interest rates need to get before they act as a brake on the economy.\n\nWill the Fed come the rescue?\n\nThankfully, the housing slowdown doesn't seem to pose the same systemic threats that it did a decade ago.\n\n\"Even if the market were to roll over, it doesn't have the capacity now to wreck the economy,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote to clients on Monday.\n\nStill, the inability of the housing market to absorb rate hikes could be a canary in the coal mine for the broader economy.\n\nInvesco's Hooper believes the Fed, responding to the looming economic slowdown and trade wars, \"is likely to take its foot off the accelerator\" in 2019.\n\nGoldman Sachs, on the other hand, thinks warming inflation will cause the Fed to hike five more times by the end of 2019.\n\nMichael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, similarly told clients on Monday that Fed officials aren't likely to come to the rescue because they're \"simply doing their jobs.\"\n\n\"We are not expecting the Fed to bail out equity market participants,\" Wilson wrote."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u062c\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062f\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0630 2000 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627", "description": "\u0639\u062b\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0634\u0647\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u062c\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 &quot;\u0644\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062c\u0639\u0629&quot;\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062f\u0641\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 2000 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0629.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/style/video/2018/11/20/v68368-fresco-erotic-leda-swan-pompeii-lon-orig-gb", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/20/images/181120165505-pompeii-fresco-tease.jpg?itok=eJwtevLO", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:32:29Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0639\u062b\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062b\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0634\u0647\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u062c\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \"\u0644\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062c\u0639\u0629\"\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062f\u0641\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u062d\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 2000 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 20 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "(CNNEspa\u00f1ol.com)", "title": "Por qu\u00e9 el Dow Jones sigue cayendo", "description": "Las acciones tecnol\u00f3gicas una vez m\u00e1s fueron golpeadas con fuerza, con el Nasdaq hundi\u00e9ndose un 2%.

standoff.\n\nThe standoff began on November 10, when dozens of migrants and refugees, who tried to reach Italy on a rubber boat, were rescued and returned to Libya by the Nivin, a cargo ship with a Panamanian flag.\n\nMany refused to leave the ship after it docked at the Libyan port city of Misrata.\n\nSome of them told CNN they would rather die than go back to Libya where they said they had been tortured. They want to be taken to a safe country.\n\nThree teenagers on board told CNN they had experienced too much abuse and violence in Libya, and were too scared to go back.\n\nIn a video taken on the cargo ship and sent to CNN, Tuha, a 16-year-old Eritrean, said he had been in Libya since 2016.\n\n\"They sold me three times. They punished me. Even I had my brother die in my hands, in Bani Walid. I saw so many things.\n\n\"How I can go down?\" he continued. \"If I go down from this boat they will kill me. They can do anything, but I will not go down... This is my decision,\" Tuha said in the video.\n\nJourney in the Mediterranean\n\nThe group of 95 refugees and migrants set out for Italy on a rubber boat on November 6.\n\nTwo teenagers told CNN they had traveled nearly 200 kilometers across the Mediterranean before they came across the Nivin.\n\nThe ship's crew promised to take them to a safe country in Europe, but brought them back to Libya instead.\n\nAccording to them, they could already see the coast of Malta and were out of Libyan waters before they were returned the port in Libya.\n\nAfter they arrived in Misrata, the Libyan authorities repeatedly tried to get the rescued migrants to leave the ship, they said.\n\nHumanitarian organizations were kept away from the area as armed Libyans moved in.\n\nThe last photo sent to CNN, by a teenager on board the ship, appears to show a man carrying a gun while standing on the port.\n\nOne teenager told CNN by phone that Libyan authorities threatened to burn the cargo ship down after they refused to leave.\n\n\"We don't want to go outside until we die here,\" Kai Dar, a South Sudanese 18-year-old, told CNN by phone.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the migrants and refugees were reportedly forced off the ship, a man who identified himself as a member of the Libyan coastguard answered one of the phones the teenagers had been using to communicate.\n\n\"Everything is ok,\" he said, though he refused to answer questions about the conditions the rescued migrants were in, or where they had been taken.\n\n\"I will chuck this phone. For now, I can't tell you any more.\"\n\nThe man gave another number for CNN to call him on later, but those calls went unanswered.\n\nLibya's Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nLast week, a small group on the Nivin agreed to leave, including a mother and infant child.\n\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) said there were 28 minors on board the ship, and that there were 77 people in total.\n\n\"For sure there are children on board, and as far as we know the authorities are trying to find a solution for the current situation,\" said Unicef Libya spokesperson Mostafa Omar, speaking on Monday.\n\nDar told CNN, some of the officials, who visited the Nivin Monday afternoon threatened to put them in prison in Malta if they refused to leave the ship.\n\nIn a statement released last week, human rights organization Amnesty International said Libyan, European and Panamanian authorities should ensure that those on board weren't forcibly taken to a Libyan detention center \"where they could face torture and other abuse.\"\n\n\"It is high time the Libyan authorities put an end to the ruthless policy of unlawfully detaining refugees and migrants. No one should be sent back to Libya to be held in inhumane conditions and face torture and other ill-treatment,\" said Heba Morayef, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa Director.\n\nDar told CNN that several people on board were already injured, after being burnt by oil from the rubber boat, they had initially traveled in.\n\nHe said they were forced to urinate in bottles, because there was no bathroom on the Nivin, though they were grateful international organizations had been delivering food and water to the ship.\n\n\"We're so tired, so tired,\" Dar said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump jabs at Dems at turkey pardon", "description": "During the annual White House Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony, President Donald Trump made a few quips about election recounts, House Democrats' subpoena threats, and the 9th Circuit court.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/20/trump-turkey-pardon-recount-democrat-subpoena-jokes-bts-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120134503-trump-turkey-pardon-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:51:13Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

S\u00edguelo en Facebook. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son suyas.\n\n(CNN) - Seg\u00fan un art\u00edculo reciente, la Tierra est\u00e1 atrapada directamente en la mira de un hurac\u00e1n c\u00f3smico. Un enjambre de casi 100 estrellas, acompa\u00f1ado por una cantidad a\u00fan mayor de materia oscura, se dirige directamente a nuestro vecindario estelar y no hay nada que podamos hacer para detenerlo; de hecho, la vanguardia ya est\u00e1 sobre nosotros. Esto suena como una pel\u00edcula taquillera de verano perfecta, protagonizada por The Rock y Chris Pratt, o tal vez Scarlett Johansson y Charlize Theron.\n\nMIRA: La V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea en 3D: el nuevo objetivo de la realidad virtual\n\nExcepto que esto es real. \u00bfPero es un peligro? Bueno, en realidad, no. De ning\u00fan modo. Pero es potencialmente incre\u00edblemente fascinante, con muchas interconexiones cient\u00edficas interesantes. \u00bfEntonces, qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo realmente?\n\nLa historia comienza en abril pasado, cuando el sat\u00e9lite Gaia anunci\u00f3 las ubicaciones y trayectorias de 2.000 millones de estrellas en las cercan\u00edas de la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea que rodea nuestro sol. Ellos hicieron p\u00fablicos los datos.\n\nLuego, los cient\u00edficos pudieron observar el conjunto de datos para ver si pod\u00edan detectar algo peculiar. En galaxias como la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea, el comportamiento m\u00e1s com\u00fan es que las estrellas orbiten el centro de la galaxia de una manera muy similar a los planetas que orbitan nuestro Sol. Sin embargo, hay algunas estrellas que exhiben un movimiento inusual. Hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o, los astr\u00f3nomos identificaron algunas \"corrientes estelares\" que pasaban por nuestro vecindario celestial.\n\nUno de ellos, llamado S1 (para referirse a la corriente n\u00famero 1), consta de casi 100 estrellas de edad y composici\u00f3n similares, orbitando la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea en una direcci\u00f3n exactamente opuesta a la de las estrellas normales. Es algo as\u00ed como un pu\u00f1ado de autos que conducen por el camino equivocado, excepto con una distancia mucho mayor entre ellos y sin posibilidad de colisi\u00f3n. Estas estrellas se extienden a lo largo de unos pocos miles de a\u00f1os luz y pasar\u00e1n a trav\u00e9s del sistema solar en el transcurso de unos pocos millones de a\u00f1os.\n\nLas galaxias enanas a menudo tienen una fracci\u00f3n desproporcionadamente grande de materia oscura. La materia oscura es una forma de materia hipot\u00e9tica y a\u00fan no descubierta que interact\u00faa solo gravitacionalmente. Los cient\u00edficos han propuesto su existencia para explicar muchos misterios astron\u00f3micos, por ejemplo, la observaci\u00f3n de que la mayor\u00eda de las galaxias giran m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido de lo que puede explicarse por las leyes conocidas de la f\u00edsica y las estrellas y el gas de los que est\u00e1n compuestas.\n\nSi bien a\u00fan no se ha observado la materia oscura, la hip\u00f3tesis de su existencia es la explicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s simple y econ\u00f3mica de los innumerables misterios astron\u00f3micos. Con un promedio de todo el universo, se cree que la materia oscura es cinco veces m\u00e1s frecuente que la masa ordinaria de estrellas, gas y planetas.\n\nMIRA: Cient\u00edficos est\u00e1n cerca de ver la materia oscura\n\nEn galaxias enanas, la fracci\u00f3n de materia oscura es a menudo m\u00e1s alta. En Fornax, una galaxia enana bien estudiada que orbita la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea, los investigadores estiman que la materia oscura es entre 10 y 100 veces mayor que la masa que se encuentra en sus estrellas.\n\nSi ese n\u00famero se mantiene para S1, la materia oscura de la corriente S1 pasar\u00e1 a trav\u00e9s de la Tierra a una velocidad mucho m\u00e1s alta que la materia oscura m\u00e1s ordinaria que orbita la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea, aproximadamente el doble de r\u00e1pido. Se cree que la materia oscura S1 est\u00e1 volando a trav\u00e9s del sistema solar a una velocidad de unos 550 km/s. Si bien estos n\u00fameros son impresionantes, son enga\u00f1osos. La materia oscura, si existe, es extremadamente difusa y no tendr\u00e1 ning\u00fan efecto perceptible en el sistema solar.\n\nDebido a que la materia oscura no se ha observado todav\u00eda, estos n\u00fameros de velocidad son especulativos, aunque est\u00e1n fuertemente respaldados por un gran cuerpo de evidencia. Sin embargo, la posibilidad de que la materia oscura de alta velocidad vuele a trav\u00e9s de la Tierra ha sugerido una oportunidad para detectarla.\n\nEn un art\u00edculo en la prestigiosa revista Physical Review D, el investigador Ciaran O'Hare y sus colaboradores calcularon las posibilidades de descubrir la materia oscura utilizando detectores de materia oscura existentes y propuestos. Consideraron dos variedades de part\u00edculas de materia oscura: un tipo muy pesado llamado WIMP (part\u00edcula masiva de interacci\u00f3n d\u00e9bil) y un tipo muy ligero llamado axi\u00f3n. Debido a que no se conoce la naturaleza \u00faltima de la materia oscura, es importante estar abierto a todas las posibilidades.\n\nEncontraron que los detectores que evaluaron podr\u00edan encontrar WIMP para ciertos rangos de la masa de part\u00edculas. Sin embargo, cuando observaron la posibilidad del axi\u00f3n, parec\u00eda que las perspectivas eran incluso mejores. Debido a su masa de luz y la manera en que un axi\u00f3n interactuar\u00eda con el detector, el aparato simplemente tiene m\u00e1s posibilidades de ver el axi\u00f3n. (Si existen axiones, por supuesto).\n\nMIRA: As\u00ed es el proyecto mexicano SAINT-EX para buscar exoplanetas en otras galaxias\n\nLos experimentos con nombres como ADMX, MADMAX y ABRACADABRA pueden o podr\u00e1n buscar las firmas de materia oscura propuestas en el documento reciente. Consisten en tecnolog\u00edas dise\u00f1adas para interactuar con los axiones en un campo magn\u00e9tico fuerte y convertirlos en microondas u ondas de radio normales que pueden detectarse f\u00e1cilmente.\n\nEs importante recordar que la corriente S1 no representa una amenaza cre\u00edble para la Tierra y la humanidad. No hay necesidad de un h\u00e9roe de acci\u00f3n para salvarnos. Sin embargo, la sinergia de la ciencia es asombrosa. Un cuidadoso cat\u00e1logo de estrellas cercanas ha abierto la perspectiva de una mejor posibilidad de encontrar e identificar la materia oscura, que es uno de los grandes misterios sin respuesta de la f\u00edsica moderna. Es un momento incre\u00edble en el que vivimos, en el que podemos estudiar esas cosas."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump promises 'steadfast' Saudi relationship", "description": "The White House has released a statement emphasizing the importance of the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia despite the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/20/trump-statement-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-death-iran-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170621115819-mohammed-bin-salman-and-trump-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:34:57Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

I was thinking we'd have a lot longer,\" the father said. \"We were expecting being grandparents, spoiling the grandchildren.\"\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nO'Neal had just finished her emergency room shift at Mercy Hospital when Lopez approached her, began arguing and shot her, officials said.\n\nGuglielmi told CNN that police believe Lopez went to the hospital with the intent to kill O'Neal, based on the amount of ammunition he was carrying, along with the 9mm handgun used in the attack. The gunman had a concealed-carry permit and bought about four weapons over the past five years, police said.\n\nPolice say Monday's shooting began in a parking lot at Mercy Hospital in Chicago.\n\nResponding police officers pursued the gunman into the hospital, exchanging gunfire with him for several minutes.\n\nLopez fired about 40 shots from his handgun, Guglielmi said, and a Chicago SWAT unit returned fire four or five times with a rifle.\n\nLopez shot and killed two others -- Chicago police Officer Samuel Jimenez and 24-year-old pharmacy resident Dayna Less, police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said. A bullet also hit the holster of a second officer, who was uninjured, Johnson said.\n\nJimenez, 28, joined the department in February 2017. He had just become a full-fledged member of the force after completing a probationary training period, Johnson told reporters.\n\nJimenez and his partner went to the hospital when they heard dispatch traffic about the shooting. \"They weren't assigned to that particular call, but they went,\" Johnson said, \"because that's what we do.\"\n\nLess was a first-year pharmacy resident training to be a pharmacist, the hospital said. She recently graduated from Purdue University and joined the hospital staff in July.\n\nLopez shot Less as she was getting off the elevator, Johnson said. She had no connection to the gunman.\n\nLess was tenacious in all things, her father said, including her career. She initially had a severe headache disorder that left her largely unable to go to school, but she eventually found a doctor who performed two surgeries that addressed the symptoms, Brian Less said.\n\n\"Dayna was a very special person. She had unique gifts,\" her father said, according to CNN affiliate WLS. \"She was intelligent, she was funny, she was kind, she was a good friend.\"\n\n'Too close for comfort'\n\nThe hospital's emergency room department reopened Tuesday afternoon, and the facility was \"functioning at near capacity,\" said Dr. Michael Davenport, the chief medical officer.\n\nMonday's shooting drew large numbers of law enforcement and emergency responders. Vehicles with flashing lights cordoned off the blocks around the medical center.\n\nWhen the gunman entered the facility, hospital worker Patricia Rinella and others barricaded themselves in a room, blocking a door with a copying machine, she told CNN affiliate WBBM\n\n\"It was too close for comfort,\" Rinella said. \"It just seemed like he was all over the place.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "Este D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias, no invites a la salmonela a tu mesa", "description": "Te explicamos c\u00f3mo preparar el pavo para evitar que contraigas salmonela por el consumo de esta y otras aves en el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/20/dia-de-accion-de-gracias-no-invites-a-la-salmonella-a-tu-mesa/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pavo-gracias-dia-accion-estados-unidos.jpg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:19:20Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Mientras las personas que viven en Estados Unidos se preparan para cocinar y consumir casi 50 millones de pavos en el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias, la seguridad alimentaria es m\u00e1s importante que nunca, debido a un brote de salmonela que persiste d\u2026 [+6029 chars]", "fulltext": "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl 77% dijo que dej\u00f3 un ave cocinada en un horno caliente o a temperatura ambiente\n\nEl 57% inform\u00f3 que siempre o algunas veces rellenaba el pavo antes de cocinarlo en lugar de hornear el relleno por separado\n\nEn una encuesta, el 90% de los encuestados lavaron aves crudas en el fregadero, eso puede propagar bacterias peligrosas\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Mientras las personas que viven en Estados Unidos se preparan para cocinar y consumir casi 50 millones de pavos en el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias, la seguridad alimentaria es m\u00e1s importante que nunca, debido a un brote de salmonela que persiste desde hace un a\u00f1o, y que se vincula a aves de corral.\n\nFuncionarios federales de salud no han identificado una sola fuente del brote de salmonela, que ya ha afectado a unas 164 personas en 35 estados.\n\nHasta el 5 de noviembre, la bacteria ha provocado 63 hospitalizaciones, y una muerte, en California.\n\nMuchos de los que se enfermaron informaron que hab\u00edan preparado o comido productos como picadillo de pavo, presas de pavo y aves enteras. Algunos ten\u00edan mascotas que com\u00edan comida para animales en base a pavo crudo; otros trabajaban en plantas de procesamiento de pavos o viv\u00edan con alguien que trabajaba en estos lugares.\n\nLEE: Disfruta del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias sin culpa con estos ocho platos tradicionales, simples y bajos en calor\u00edas\n\nEl \u00faltimo retiro fue de Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC, de Barron, Wisconsin, que sac\u00f3 del mercado m\u00e1s de 41.275 kilos de productos de pavo molido crudo que pueden estar relacionados con los casos registrados.\n\nEn Estados Unidos no hay un requisito de que los pavos u otras aves est\u00e9n libres de salmonela, incluidas las cepas resistentes a los antibi\u00f3ticos, como la que est\u00e1 relacionada con el brote, por lo que la prevenci\u00f3n recae en gran medida en los consumidores.\n\nEso significa tener conciencia de que el pavo para el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias que se vende en el mercado puede estar contaminado, dijo Jennifer Quinlan, profesora asociada del Departamento de Ciencias de la Nutrici\u00f3n en la Universidad de Drexel.\n\n\"Deben asumir que hay un pat\u00f3geno\", dijo.\n\nEl a\u00f1o pasado, justo despu\u00e9s de la temporada de vacaciones, Quinlan y sus colegas encuestaron a m\u00e1s de 1.300 consumidores sobre c\u00f3mo manipulaban el pavo. Hallaron que la mayor\u00eda no segu\u00eda pr\u00e1cticas de seguridad, a pesar de d\u00e9cadas de advertencias de salud p\u00fablica.\n\nEl 90% de los encuestados lavaron aves crudas en el fregadero, aunque eso puede propagar bacterias peligrosas. El 57% inform\u00f3 que siempre o algunas veces rellenaba el pavo antes de cocinarlo en lugar de hornear el relleno por separado, y el 77% dijo que dej\u00f3 un ave cocinada en un horno caliente o a temperatura ambiente.\n\nEstas pr\u00e1cticas pueden permitir el crecimiento no solo de la salmonela sino tambi\u00e9n de otros g\u00e9rmenes da\u00f1inos, como el Campylobacter y el Clostridium perfringens, explic\u00f3.\n\n\"Todas estas enfermedades se podr\u00edan haber prevenido. O bien hay contaminaci\u00f3n cruzada en el hogar o no hay una cocci\u00f3n completa\".\n\nOtros expertos sostienen que simplemente decirles a los consumidores que manipulen los alimentos adecuadamente es injusto e ineficaz. Los reguladores y la industria deben ser responsables de prevenir la contaminaci\u00f3n en primer lugar.\n\n\"Deber\u00edan perseguir a estas personas como a pandilleros\", dijo Carl Custer, consultor en microbiolog\u00eda de seguridad alimentaria, quien trabaj\u00f3 durante d\u00e9cadas en el Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA). \"Esta es una cepa muy virulenta\", asegur\u00f3.\n\nEste noviembre, Custer renov\u00f3 su pedido de que las cepas pat\u00f3genas de salmonela en aves de corral se declaren \"adulterantes\", lo que requerir\u00eda que USDA examine los productos y retire los que est\u00e1n contaminados con la bacteria.\n\nMIRA: Impresionante r\u00e9cord, millones de personas se desplazan por aire, mar y tierra este semana\n\nUSDA clasific\u00f3 a E. coli O157: H7 como adulterante en la carne molida despu\u00e9s del brote mortal de hamburguesas de Jack in the Box en 1993. Despu\u00e9s de eso, la tasa de infecciones por E. coli se desplom\u00f3. Desde entonces, la agencia ha clasificado seis cepas adicionales como adulterantes en ciertos productos de carne de res.\n\nSin embargo, los esfuerzos para prohibir la salmonela resistente a los medicamentos de la carne y las aves de corral se han estancado, a pesar de los a\u00f1os de demandas de los grupos de defensa del consumidor y los legisladores.\n\nEn febrero, funcionarios de USDA rechazaron una petici\u00f3n de 2014 del grupo Center for Science in the Public (CSPI) Interest para declarar que ciertas cepas de salmonela resistente a los medicamentos eran adulterantes, argumentando que el grupo no distingui\u00f3 lo suficiente entre salmonela resistente y no resistente.\n\nEn 2015, las congresistas dem\u00f3cratas Rosa DeLauro, de Connecticut, y Louise Slaughter, de Nueva York, presentaron un proyecto de ley que habr\u00eda definido a la salmonela resistente y peligrosa como adulterante y le habr\u00eda dado a USDA un nuevo poder para probar y retirar carne, aves y huevos contaminados. No fue promulgada.\n\n\"Es muy dif\u00edcil llamar la atenci\u00f3n sobre los problemas de seguridad alimentaria en este clima pol\u00edtico actual\", dijo Sarah Sorscher, subdirectora de asuntos regulatorios de CSPI.\n\nObservadores externos dijeron que hay poca voluntad pol\u00edtica para enfrentar a la industria del pavo, que asciende a casi 5.000 millones de d\u00f3lares anuales, as\u00ed como a los reguladores.\n\n\"No veo mucha motivaci\u00f3n por convertirlo en adulterante en este momento\", dijo Kirk Smith, director del Centro de Excelencia de Seguridad Alimentaria Integrada de Minnesota.\n\n\"Ser\u00eda muy poco pr\u00e1ctico y costoso convertirla en un adulterante\", agreg\u00f3. \"Se duplicar\u00eda el costo de las aves de corral\".\n\nMIRA: \u00bfC\u00f3mo se convirti\u00f3 el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias en un d\u00eda festivo?\n\nEn una declaraci\u00f3n redactada con prisa, funcionarios de USDA se negaron a nombrar p\u00fablicamente a los productores, proveedores y marcas vinculadas al brote de salmonela en pavos, diciendo que ser\u00eda \"extremadamente irresponsable e imprudente\" cuando a\u00fan no se ha identificado una fuente definitiva de la enfermedad.\n\nDebido a que la cepa del brote de salmonela se ha encontrado en plantas procesadoras de pavos, en trabajadores y en una amplia gama de productos alimenticios, se requerir\u00e1 un gran esfuerzo para detectar y erradicar la fuente, dijo Smith, el experto en seguridad alimentaria de Minnesota.\n\n\"Deber\u00eda ser un enfoque a lo largo de todo el sistema, comenzando con los controles en las granjas, hasta educar a los consumidores lo mejor que podamos\", concluy\u00f3."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Levenson, CNN", "title": "Recreational marijuana is now on sale in Massachusetts, and Pumpkin Spice Dust is on the menu", "description": "Two years after voters approved its sale, the first marijuana dispensaries opened in Massachusetts on Tuesday as people lined up to buy recreation weed.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/us/massachusetts-marijuana-sales/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120115524-01-massachusetts-marijuana-1120-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:19:06Z", "content": "(CNN) Recreational marijuana is now for sale on the East Coast.

Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia\n\nAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq's fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" Iran is considered \"the world's leading sponsor of terror.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries - and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \"enemy of the state\" and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that -- this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction - and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels -- so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\n###"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628: \u0645\u0646

Salman for the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi .\n\nThe White House has been struggling to square a widespread sense that the crown prince directed the killing with a desire for Saudi support for its foreign policy priorities and the need to manage close relationships between bin Salman, the Trump administration and members of Trump's family.\n\nIn an exclamation-mark laden statement subtitled \"America First!\" Trump said on Tuesday that \"our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\"\n\nSpeaking to the press later in the day, Trump cited the Kingdom's influence over oil prices and said, \"if we abandon Saudi it would be a terrible mistake.\" He also said he was \"not going to destroy the economy of our country\" over Khashoggi by giving up arms deals to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It's a very simple equation for me. I'm about make America great again and I'm about America first,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\" Trump said in his statement. \"In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"\n\nLess than an hour after the statement, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden to pardon two turkeys for Thanksgiving. He did not mention the journalist's murder.\n\nThe President's statement sets up a clash with lawmakers from both parties who have called for harsh measures against Saudi Arabia and expressed deep reservations about US support for the Kingdom's war in Yemen. It once again pits Trump against his intelligence agencies and bolsters a regime that has admitted to killing a vocal critic and member of the press.\n\nLawmakers noted there is a cost to ignoring \"our moral voice,\" as Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was more pointed.\n\nI'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First. I'm also pretty sure John Bolton wrote it. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) November 20, 2018\n\n\"I'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First,\" Paul tweeted.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said, \"I never thought I'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nHigh confidence\n\nWhile Riyadh has maintained that neither the crown prince nor his father knew of the killing, intelligence officials, lawmakers and analysts familiar with the country have assessed that an operation of this nature and scale could not happen without the direction and awareness of the crown prince, who controls all the country's security services.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN that an intelligence report about the murder reportedly sent to Trump on Tuesday and delivered in physical form is an assessment of all the intelligence gathered so far, but will not present a final conclusion. That's in keeping with intelligence community practice: agencies assign a confidence level to their findings because intelligence isn't conclusive.\n\nAnd though sources tell CNN that the CIA has assessed with high confidence that the prince directed Khashoggi's murder, which was conducted by members of bin Salman's inner circle, the fact that they don't make a final conclusion gives the White House an out.\n\nIndeed, Trump told reporters as he left for Thanksgiving in Florida that the CIA \"didn't make a determination ... they have nothing definitive and the fact is maybe he did, maybe he didn't.\"\n\nI never thought I'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/MQ4JsoQtqk \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 20, 2018\n\nThe Trump administration is relying on Saudi Arabia to help it achieve its goals in the Middle East on an Israeli-Palestinian deal, fighting extremism, rebuilding Syria and countering Iran, which the President mentioned in the second line of his statement to bolster the claim in his first sentence that \"The world is a very dangerous place!\"\n\nSaudi Arabia can also help ensure that US sanctions against Iranian oil, which take an estimated 1 million barrels a day off the market, don't roil international energy markets.\n\nMr. Trump bizarrely devotes the FIRST paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse IRAN of every sort of malfeasance he can think of. Perhaps we're also responsible for the California fires, because we didn't help rake the forests\u2014 just like the Finns do? \u2014 Javad Zarif (@JZarif) November 20, 2018\n\nKhashoggi's killing has drawn attention to Trump's business ties to Saudi Arabia and the relationship between bin Salman and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has assiduously courted the crown prince and arranged Trump's first overseas trip to the kingdom.\n\nDaniel Drezner, an international politics professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, told CNN that it's hard to understand why Trump isn't leaning harder on Saudi Arabia, saying that the US can exert more leverage than it is choosing to. \"The fact that they're so reticent to do it shows a real misunderstanding of the\" balance of power, he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia needs the US for military support and protection, for help in countering Iran and fighting extremists, among other things.\n\nTrump \"seems remarkably wimpish\" with respect to Saudi Arabia, Drezner said, adding that Trump might feel a kinship to the Saudi royal family. \"There's otherwise no real explanation for why he's not applying more pressure,\" Drezner said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who does Trump believe in journalist's death?

Trump, who has boasted of selling $40 million and $50 million apartments to Saudis and has seen Saudi money pour into his hotels since he was elected, claimed Tuesday that he has no financial interests with the Kingdom.\n\n\"I have no business with Saudi Arabia, couldn't care less,\" Trump said.\n\nAs outrage has grown on Capitol Hill and overseas, the President, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Bolton have stressed the need for patience and the importance of US ties with the Kingdom.\n\nPompeo briefed reporters at the State Department, defending the decision not to take strong action against Saudi Arabia for the US resident's death by saying \"there are important American interests to keep the American people safe.\"\n\nPompeo met with Turkey Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Tuesday at the State Department, where the two discussed the journalist's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, including the possibility of launching an international investigation into the case.\n\n'Laws come first'\n\n\"We have to see the outcome these investigations, but he didn't say he's against international investigation, but he emphasized that he wants to see,\" Cavusoglu said in a briefing to Turkish press.\n\nTurkey has also suggested it wants to continue its business relationship with Saudi Arabia, even while pressuring it over the murder.\n\n\"We see that West does not want to ruin their relations with Saudi Arabia because of this murder. We do not want to ruin our relations with Saudi Arabia either,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\n\"But we will not give up our principles,\" the foreign minister said. \"Laws come first for us. We believe in an international system based on law. This murder has to be revealed. Who gave the order, this or that? Does not matter. Who gave the order has to be revealed.\"\n\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey was the world's worst jailer of reporters in 2017, for the second consecutive year.\n\nPretending to do something\n\nSaudi Arabia announced last week that 11 men had been indicted for the \"rogue operation\" and that five would face the death penalty. In what appeared to be a coordinated move, the Treasury Department the same day announced sanctions against 17 Saudis over their alleged roles in the killing.\n\nAsked if Trump's statement indicated the US was putting business interests above human rights, Pompeo referred to the Treasury sanctions as \"a very strong response.\" Sen. Paul said the sanctions amounted to the administration \"pretending to do something,\" since Saudi Arabia had already sentenced some of the men to death.\n\nTrump, who derided the Saudi explanations as \"the worst cover-up ever\" in late October, made clear in his Tuesday statement that he views the killing in transactional terms.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sasse: Ending arm sales should be on the table Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sasse: Ending arm sales should be on the table 01:18\n\nCiting promised Saudi investments in the US that could generate jobs and military contracts worth billions, even as he wildly inflated their worth, Trump said that \"if we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.\"\n\nHe will likely run into headwinds from Capitol Hill, as lawmakers of both parties issued excoriating responses to his statement.\n\n\"I plan to vote against any future arms sales and appropriation to Saudi Arabia,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a statement. She added that the US should consider sanctioning the crown prince, who is known by his initials MBS, and expel the Saudi ambassador to the US.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Corker told CNN that Congress would respond with \"additional pressure\" on Saudi Arabia if the administration doesn't name the Saudi crown prince as part of its sanctions determination under the Magnitsky Act, legislation that allows for sanctions on human rights grounds.\n\n\"We are looking at ways to respond and apply additional pressure if the crown prince is not named,\" Corker said.\n\nHe's unhinged\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Graham condemned Trump's decision without naming the President. \"I fully realize we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage,\" he said. \"However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Graham told NBC's Meet the Press that a team of Saudis close to the crown prince \"don't get on two airplanes, go to Turkey and chop a guy up in a consulate who is a critic of the crown prince without the crown prince having known about it. And sanctioned it.\"\n\nGraham also said that Saudi Arabia \"will have a hard time on the world stage\" as a result of the murder. \"When it comes to the crown prince, he is irrational, he's unhinged, and I think he has done a lot of damage to the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe prince has led Saudi Arabia into a series of foreign policy misadventures that have rippled through the region. He has aggressively pursued a war in Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi rebels that have led the UN to assess the Kingdom might be guilty of possible war crimes there, as millions starve due to a Saudi-led blockade.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ...

He briefly detained the Lebanese prime minister inside Saudi Arabia and triggered a rift with Canada after an official sent one tweet about the detention of a Saudi human rights activist.\n\nThe President's statement and the CIA report on Khashoggi's killing come seven weeks after the father of four, entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to seek marriage documents. Trump had already been briefed by CIA Director Gina Haspel, who traveled to Turkey to meet with officials there about their findings and allegedly heard a recording the Turkish government had made of the killing.\n\nThe Turks have said Khashoggi was set upon, beaten and dismembered soon after he entered the consulate. After changing their story for weeks, Saudi officials said that the team was sent to convince the journalist to return to Saudi Arabia. They say he was injected with a drug that was meant to temporarily subdue the journalist, but that he was accidentally given an overdose.\n\nIt is still not clear where Khashoggi's body is."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AngelaBonachera", "title": "Descubren en Pompeya un fresco que representa una escena er\u00f3tica", "description": "La reliquia fue desenterrada el viernes en la zona de Regio V de Pompeya, la antigua ciudad destruida durante la erupci\u00f3n del Monte Vesubio en el 79 d.C..", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/20/descubren-en-pompeya-un-fresco-que-representa-una-escena-erotica/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/http_2f2fcdn-cnn-com2fcnnnext2fdam2fassets2f181120121049-pompeii-fresco-1.jpg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:56:27Z", "content": "(CNN) - Un antiguo fresco que representa una escena er\u00f3tica del mito griego \"Leda y el cisne\" se ha descubierto en el sitio arqueol\u00f3gico de Pompeya, en el centro de Italia.

Previously she was the chief of the Educational Opportunities Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department and served as director of the educational practice at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has issued a new set of proposed rules on Title IX regarding the responsibilities of primary and secondary schools, as well as universities, to address sexual assault and harassment.\n\nThe rules, issued Friday, would make schools less safe by narrowing the definition for what counts as sexual misconduct, creating barriers for students to report these incidents and limiting the responsibility of schools to respond.\n\nDeVos speaks of of her concern for sexual assault survivors, but her words ring hollow. These proposed rules illustrate that her driving concern is not that less than 10% of college students report the sexual assault and harassment they experience. It's not that school administrators are not getting those reports to know what's happening on campus and prevent further violence. It's not that students are routinely subject to sexual assault and harassment by fellow students online or at bars or fraternities. And it's not the extraordinary and lifelong pain and trauma that children experience when they are raped or harassed.\n\nNone of that is what prompted DeVos to take a full-scale detour from decades of well-reasoned law and practice and upend long-established definitions of sexual harassment. Instead, she relies on myths that she is intent on perpetuating in federal policy.\n\nHere are three of her favorites.\n\n1. \"Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes,\" DeVos said \"Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes,\" DeVos said in a 2017 speech as she decried a failed system that did not serve survivors, accused students or educational institutions.\n\nWithout mention of a single such case, DeVos decided that it's freedom of speech and expression that needs protecting over the thousands of students who have been sexually harassed and assaulted -- and despite the fact that sexual violence is not a protected form of expression.\n\nBy narrowing the long-standing definition of sexual harassment -- \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" -- to include only behavior that is \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive,\" she suggests that a 14-year-old student who feels uncomfortable due to suggestive comments by her teacher is not being harassed. These changes discourage young people who have endured sexual harassment from coming forward -- all to protect a mythical someone, somewhere, who didn't feel comfortable making a provocative comment in class.\n\n2. What happens off campus stays off campus: DeVos' proposed rules suggest the only acts of violence that impact whether students feel safe and comfortable at school happen in classrooms, hallways or school events. Under her rules, schools may not be responsible for responding to incidents of assault or harassment that take place online or at bars, fraternities, off-campus apartments or away games.\n\nSo a school could dismiss a request for a change in class schedule from a seventh-grade student who is being sexually harassed online by her classmates. Or a college student who is sexually assaulted by a classmate at an off-campus apartment or campus bar might also have his complaint summarily dismissed by the school.\n\n3. DeVos believes the greatest harm perpetrated in the campus sexual assault process is to the reputation and rights of the accused.\n\nFirst, despite the attention paid to the Duke lacrosse case and the retracted Rolling Stone story about the University of Virginia, false accusations are rare. One out of 10 campus sexual assaults are reported, and generally only 2-10% of reports of sexual assault may be false, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.\n\nThe number of false reports is miniscule in comparison to the more than 18% of all women who are sexually assaulted on campus and do not report it (and also the men, who are statistically more likely to face assault themselves than false allegations).\n\nRegardless, DeVos has taken numerous steps to protect the accused and burden survivors. By narrowing the definition of sexual harassment and where it triggers school responsibility, she gives perpetrators latitude to engage in sexual misconduct, as long as it takes place off campus or is not both severe and pervasive.\n\nShe is pushing schools to adopt standards that make it harder for survivors to prove that they have been sexually assaulted, requiring schools to allow retraumatizing and unnecessary hurdles to be imposed on survivors (such as cross-examination at a live hearing) and telling schools that the accused must be believed throughout the grievance process -- unless the survivor demonstrates otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nFor more opinion...

Adam Schiff (\"little Adam Schitt\") to the special counsel Robert Mueller (\"gone absolutely nuts.\") The myth holds that Trump is a tough guy who fights back. In fact, he is a fragile man running out of safe places to hide.\n\nLike so much about Trump, the counter-puncher theme is a clever marketing ploy used to obscure obvious flaws. In the past he promoted himself as a business titan to cover the shame of multiple massive bankruptcies. Today, as a politician, he poses as a victim when he's actually a frightened bully. No one is ever on equal footing with the President of the United States, which means that whenever he \"punches\" anyone, he lowers himself.\n\nWho does Trump fear? He fears the independent counsel, whose investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election threatens to expose the inner workings of the campaign and of Trump's opaque business empire. He fears Schiff and other House Democrats he's belittled because they will soon chair powerful committees that will launch their own investigations into Trump's administration and, perhaps, his long-hidden tax returns.\n\nThe President's insecurities all seem to revolve around his fear of being unmasked as a fraud. The tax returns, for example, would allow everyone to compare his claims to great wealth -- in 2015 he said he was worth $10 billion -- with black-and-white reality. More to the point, we could all see how he has benefited from various tax maneuvers and discover just how much corporate welfare the Trump Organization has lapped up over the years.\n\nBeyond his finances, Trump fears being revealed to be a na\u00eff who has been outplayed by others with power. In the case of the Saudi killing of American-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump seems afraid to listen to the audio evidence Turkish officials handed over to the United States. He seems to be in denial about what his brutal pals are willing to do.\n\nTrump's first overseas trip as President began with a stop in Riyadh, where he joined in a ceremonial dance and went all in with one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.\n\nThe desperation in Trump's denial, whether it has to do with Khashoggi's killing or domestic politics, can be seen in the tortured effort he makes to persuade us that what we see with our own eyes isn't true.\n\nThe results of the 2018 election are a perfect case in point. Trump's instinct brought him to frame the election as a \"tremendous success,\" even as his party lost control of the House and he became vulnerable to the opposition for the first time in his presidency.\n\nTrump likely failed to detect the nation's displeasure with him, and his party, because he is apparently afraid to go anywhere outside the parts of the country where he's sure to draw an adoring crowd. (His did make a brief trip to California after the campaign in the wake of the deadly wildfires.)\n\nThe America he saw at his rallies was whiter, more rural and less educated than America overall. Obviously wary of any place where he wouldn't be hailed as a hero, he didn't hold a single rally in the Northeast or on the West Coast. In both those regions, Republicans suffered major election losses. If timid Trump had taken the risk of going to these places, he might have had a more realistic sense of how he is faring. But information that runs counter to the narrative he prefers may make him uncomfortable.\n\nJUST WATCHED Berman: The President is a counter-puncher Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Berman: The President is a counter-puncher 02:55\n\nThe President's need for safe spaces is not just a matter of campaign strategy. In March, USA Today noted that Trump had seen less of the country than any president in 40 years. Whenever possible Trump has traveled to his own properties -- the Mar-a-Lago resort is a favorite -- where he can surround himself with sycophants, rest in his own comfy bed and tweet insults at the people he fears.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that Trump \"has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life, according to a former senior White House official.\" The unnamed official said, \"He's afraid of those situations. He's afraid people want to kill him.\"\n\nA bit of concern would be natural, but as the ultimate VIP, a president who goes to Iraq or Afghanistan, for example, should not tremble. (Obama went to both in his first 14 months in office.) But like any man who brags about how much he loves to fight, Trump long ago revealed himself to be a fearful fellow. Face to face with real combat troops he might be confronted with actual courage and feel diminished\n\nComfort is prized by our fragile-flower President, who spins fantasies of denial to avoid painful realities. His recent interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News was a frightened fantasist's tour de force. \"I did well in France,\" he says after a trip where he skipped a ceremony to honor the war dead because, he claims, fog kept his helicopter grounded and the Secret Service forbade him to travel by car. In fact, the Secret Service cannot order a president to do anything, and other heads of state made the trek to honor the dead.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

terminado, probablemente abrir\u00e1s tu refrigerador y encontrar\u00e1s toda clase de cacerolas envueltas en papel de aluminio y el agua de salvia que qued\u00f3.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que debe hacer una persona que ya ha comido mucho y no quiere desperdiciar? Aqu\u00ed es donde entra Melissa d'Arabian.\n\nD'Arabian es la ganadora de la quinta temporada de \"The Next Food Network Star\" y presenta el programa \"Ten Dollar Dinners\" en el canal Food Network.\n\nElla nos da sus cinco consejos para saber qu\u00e9 hacer con las sobras del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias.\n\n1. Congela los alimentos mientras est\u00e1n frescos\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 esperar a que tu pavo se haya pasado dos d\u00edas m\u00e1s para darte cuenta de que est\u00e1s hasta la coronilla del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias? En el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias, mientras recoges lo que qued\u00f3 de la cena, inmediatamente separa la mitad del pavo que sobr\u00f3 y gu\u00e1rdalo en bolsas para congelar peque\u00f1as, m\u00e1s o menos una taza o dos para cada porci\u00f3n, dependiendo del tama\u00f1o de tu familia. Etiqu\u00e9talas y cong\u00e9lalas, y ahora tendr\u00e1s las sobras m\u00e1s frescas posibles que se convierten en un sencillo ingrediente en el congelador a la espera de que las vuelvas a utilizar uno o dos meses despu\u00e9s en otra receta: pasta, sopa, quiches, omelettes, etc.\n\n2. \u00bfEst\u00e1s cansado del pavo? Enga\u00f1a a tus papilas gustativas\n\n\u00bfQuieres saber cu\u00e1l es mi estrategia sabatina para el pavo que todav\u00eda tengo por ah\u00ed? Opta por algo \u00e9tnico o regional con estas ideas creativas. Piensa en algo tailand\u00e9s (pad thai de pavo, por ejemplo), mexicano (taquitos de pavo), o barbacoa sure\u00f1a (s\u00e1ndwiches de pavo desmenuzado). Un perfil de sabores completamente distinto romper\u00e1 el molde del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias y te permitir\u00e1 enga\u00f1ar a tu paladar, haci\u00e9ndole pensar que tu platillo es una idea nueva y fresca y no un reciclado de sobras.\n\n3. El pavo se ha ido, pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 pasa con lo que queda? Readapta tus guarniciones\n\nTodos tenemos guarniciones que hacemos tradicionalmente, pero que nadie come tanto como esperar\u00edamos. El resultado es... \u00a1una sobrecarga de sobras! En mi casa, una de las m\u00e1s grandes culpables es la salsa de ar\u00e1ndano. \u00bfLa soluci\u00f3n? Simplemente piensa en la salsa de ar\u00e1ndanos como fruta para una tarta y util\u00edzala como usar\u00edas cualquier otra fruta. Prepara un parfait de yogur o m\u00e9zclala con rodajas de manzana para hacer una tarta de fruta o un crujiente de manzana. Otra opci\u00f3n ser\u00eda que la calientes, la viertas sobre helado de vainilla y le des el \u00faltimo toque con nueces tostadas encima para hacer un delicioso sundae.\n\nIncluso puedes calentarla y hacer una fant\u00e1stica salsa dulce (perfecta para mis taquitos de pavo que puedes ver arriba). El (no muy) famoso camote tambi\u00e9n es algo que siempre sobra .\n\nUna idea: \u00a1piensa en el desayuno! Prepara una deliciosa mantequilla compuesta de camote con jarabe de arce y s\u00edrvela con bollitos o waffles. Convierte el camote en dulce en un relleno para empanadas o \u00fasalo para preparar muffins de canela y afrecho. Del lado salado, intenta incorporar algunos de los camotes en el pur\u00e9 de papa que te sobr\u00f3 para obtener una deliciosa guarnici\u00f3n veteada de papas. (Lo s\u00e9, no te di ninguna idea para hacer algo con el relleno. Pero si te sobr\u00f3 relleno, necesitas una nueva receta. Solo digo...)\n\n4. Los ingredientes tambi\u00e9n son sobras, as\u00ed que escudri\u00f1a el refrigerador\n\nRecuerda una de mis reglas fundamentales para ahorrar d\u00f3lares en comestibles: la comida desperdiciada es la m\u00e1s costosa que puedes comprar, sin importar qu\u00e9 tan barata que la encontraste en la tienda. Por lo tanto, aseg\u00farate de revisar tu refrigerador para buscar ingredientes que ya est\u00e9n en las \u00faltimas, a fin de que puedas aprovechar todas las sobras en lugar de tirarlas. Utiliza lo que te qued\u00f3 de la crema espesa que compraste para el pur\u00e9 de papas para hacer un r\u00e1pido bud\u00edn casero de caramelo. Usa la mitad de un recipiente de crema agria para preparar la loca ensalada Jell-o de tu mam\u00e1. Encuentra una manera para utilizar la mitad restante (\u00a1esos taquitos nos rescatan una vez m\u00e1s!).\n\nUna buena estrategia general es revisar tu refrigerador cada semana (lo ideal es que lo hagas justo antes de planificar el men\u00fa o hacer las compras) y colocar a la vista en el refrigerador todos los ingredientes que \"tienes que usar\" para que no te olvides de ellos.\n\n5. Si\u00e9ntete bien con menos\n\nEn alg\u00fan momento entre Halloween y A\u00f1o Nuevo, ded\u00edcate a sacar todo lo que ya no necesites y d\u00f3nalo. Y si sientes los aprietos de la econom\u00eda ahora que vienen las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o, haz voluntariado en un refugio para indigentes, en un banco de alimentos o en un comedor comunitario. No hay nada como ayudar a aquellos que son menos afortunados que t\u00fa para que sientas agradecimiento por lo que tienes, lo que har\u00e1 que no compres de m\u00e1s (ni cocines de m\u00e1s) y mantendr\u00e1 el enfoque de las fiestas en lo que realmente importa: las personas que te rodean.\n\nY si bien es demasiado tarde como para cambiar la cantidad de comida que compraste para este a\u00f1o, quiz\u00e1 el pr\u00f3ximo, esta estrategia har\u00e1 que compres un poco menos. Pero este a\u00f1o, nos ayudar\u00e1 a sentirnos agradecidos por el simple hecho de tener sobras, incluso si no las convertimos todas en un taquito."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Seth Moulton", "title": "Nancy Pelosi should step aside", "description": "US Rep.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) On November 6, the Democratic Party came a long way toward making Congress look and think like the strong, diverse country that we hope to represent. An unprecedented number of our newly elected leaders are women. In fact, Democratic women could have almost flipped the House by themselves.\n\nSeveral have served our country in the military, with more incoming veterans in the House Democratic caucus than any year since 1997 . Some are members of the LGBTQ community, bringing the total number of LGBT members to double digits for the first time. Others are African-American, Latino and Native American.

And if we, as Democrats, are going to answer that call, we can't turn around and choose the same leadership we've had in place since 2003. Our party is changing, our country is changing and our leadership should change, too.\n\nNancy Pelosi has been a historic and groundbreaking leader of our party for 30 years. She has achieved extraordinary successes, including the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But it takes nothing away from her legacy to have an open and fair-minded discussion about whether her strong record of past leadership means she should lead our party into the future. The same is true for the rest of her leadership team.\n\nI think it's time for change. We need a speaker of the House who will harness all of the new voices in Congress to put forth a bold, progressive vision for the country -- someone who will give the great new leaders in our party a chance actually to lead.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Barry Neild", "title": "How Cesar Manrique helped save Lanzarote from too much tourism", "description": "Lanzarote in the Canary Islands is still a wild, volcanic paradise, mainly thanks to Spanish artist C\u00e9sar Manrique's even wilder creations.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/lanzarote-cesar-manrique/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F181120100643-fundacin-csar-manrique-2-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:12:33Z", "content": "(CNN) People who live in cool-looking underground lairs carved out by molten lava are usually, in Bond movies at least, hellbent on global destruction.

He warned his homeland was \"dying,\" but insisted \"good and enthusiastic people can save what's left.\"\n\nC\u00e9sar Manrique railed against mass tourism in Lanzarote. Melde Bildagentur/Ullstein Bild/Getty Images\n\nLuckily for Lanzarote, Manrique himself came to the rescue.\n\nNot only did he document the island's traditional architectural style to persuade locals to preserve it, he collaborated with its tourism authorities to create magical attractions with a unique artistic style inspired by the volcanic scenery.\n\nRelated content Can the world be saved from overtourism?\n\nA kinetic force of nature, Manrique showed few signs of slowing as he got older, but tragically died aged 73 in a car crash on Lanzarote in 1992. Even 26 years after his death his presence can be felt across the island.\n\nHe bequeathed a passion for culture that in 2017 saw the opening of the Museo Atl\u00e1ntico Lanzarote, an underwater sculpture park beneath the waves that lap the unspoiled sands of Papagayo, on the island's southern tip.\n\nFor the real C\u00e9sar Manrique experiences visitors need to get out and explore -- and following in the artist's footsteps is a great way to explore the best that Lanzarote's rugged landscape has to offer.\n\nHere's where to go:\n\nFundaci\u00f3n C\u00e9sar Manrique / C\u00e9sar Manrique Foundation\n\nCool pool: Manrique designed his own Volcano House. Courtesy Fondation Cesar Manrique\n\nThe ideal starting point is this sprawling Volcano House compound that was once Manrique's home and is now a dedicated museum and resource center exploring the artist's work.\n\nAnd what a home it was. Plunging into tunnels and underground spaces created by molten lava, Manrique cranked the funky dials up to 11 when he kitted out this ultra-cool crib.\n\nThe story goes, says Eva Acero Pegito -- a fount of Manrique knowledge who runs tours for Lanzarote-based Uniguides -- that the artist was passing an inhospitable field of basaltic lava when he spotted trees sprouting from holes.\n\n\"The best painting is nature,\" Manrique is quoted as saying. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nHe bought the barren land from a baffled farmer and immediately set to work converting the lava holes, tubes and even the trees beneath the field into the swanky pad he lived in from 1968 to 1988.\n\nThe buried spaces conceal a swimming pool and retro sci-fi chill-out rooms where he hosted guests from all over the world.\n\nChill-out spaces: A tree sprouts in the center of a relaxation room. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nHis cosmopolitan lifestyle raised a few eyebrows on the sedate island, says Acero Pegito, particularly the snug Speedo-style bathing trunks he favored when posing for poolside pics.\n\nAbove ground, his former studio now houses artworks by Manrique and others but the undisputed highlights are the widescreen windows offering views over inland Lanzarote that can hold the gaze for hours.\n\n\"He was always saying that the best painting is nature,\" says Acero Pegito.\n\nC\u00e9sar Manrique Foundation , Calle Jorge Luis Borges, 16, 35507 Tahiche, Lanzarote; +34 928 84 31 38\n\nHotel Meli\u00e1 Selinas\n\nSeventies style: Manrique creations decorate the wall of the lobby. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nProving he was as much concerned about embracing visitors to his island as he was with limiting their impact, C\u00e9sar Manrique collaborated in the design of this bold, modernist resort hotel on Lanzarote's eastern seafront.\n\nWhile tame compared to modern creations, it was a major statement back in the 1970s.\n\nThe concrete structure, now nearly completely refurbed to its former glory, is built up in tiers that lean back from a sprawling 1,800-square-meter seawater pool complex surrounded by dark volcanic rocks and bright flowers.\n\nThe hotel's central atrium is a gloriously verdant jungle. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nSome of the hotel's 270 rooms, says Guest Relations Manager Virginie Corthals, get booked out by Manrique fans making a pilgrimage.\n\nInside, an atrium drips with green vegetation that, in the four decades since the place opened, has grown into a beautiful and dense jungle.\n\nManrique's primitive bas relief sculptures depicting sea life line the lobby and the stylish restaurant, lending the communal areas a minimalist 1970s chic.\n\nHotel Meli\u00e1 Selinas , Avda.

On the other side of the cave, back out in the open air, is a swanky swimming pool under palm trees.\n\nThe pool's just for show these days, but you can imagine the wild nights here in its 1970s heyday.\n\nMirador del R\u00edo\n\nIt's hard to focus on food with a view like this at the Mirador del R\u00edo. AdamKontor/Pixabay\n\nManrique was a man who never let a good view go to waste. During military service, he was posted to a gun battery on this northerly clifftop crow's nest and fell in love with the epic panorama taking in Lanzarote's tiny, unspoilt island neighbor, La Graciosa.\n\nHe returned in 1974, with Soto and C\u00e1ceres, with the dream of building a restaurant with this mouthwatering vista on the menu. The result is straight out of the Bond Villain playbook -- an eternally cool space with a cinematic window that drinks in the wide Atlantic scenery.\n\nToday the space houses a simple bar and cafeteria, not a restaurant, but it's still a Michelin-starred feast for the eyes.\n\nMirador del R\u00edo , Carretera de Y\u00e9 S/N Har\u00eda, 35541 Lanzarote; +34 901 20 03 00\n\nRelated content How to plan the perfect trip to Spain\n\nCasa Museo C\u00e9sar Manrique / C\u00e9sar Manrique House Museum\n\nThis photoshoot-perfect house was Manrique's last home. Courtesy Fondation Cesar Manrique\n\nIt's easy to become blas\u00e9 about Lanzarote's ability to draw fresh gasps around every corner, but the descent into the inland northern town of Har\u00eda easily blasts away any complacency.\n\nAfter crossing barren highlands, the road suddenly zigzags down into what can only be described as a classic desert oasis of towering palm trees, rich greenery and whitewashed houses.\n\nIt's here that Manrique lived for the last few years of his life -- transforming old farm buildings into a photoshoot-perfect home riddled with his signature style and flamboyance.\n\nHar\u00eda resembles a desert oasis town. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nPreserved pretty much how he left it, right down to the exotic kimonos hanging in the closet and the arsenal of colognes in the bathroom, it's now a museum honoring his final years.\n\nAlthough more conventional than his underground pad, it's still astounding. There's a pool with lurid orange sun chairs, a vast bathroom, and open-plan living and dining room.\n\nCesar Manrique's studio is a glimpse into the artist's mind. Courtesy Fondation Cesar Manrique\n\nBest of all is Manrique's garden studio -- a bright space splattered with paint and cluttered with paint pots, unfinished works and other paraphernalia that reveal the inner workings of an artistic genius.\n\nTime your visit right and you might catch another true artist, 84-year-old Eulogio Concepcion Perdomo, busy in his dusty workshop just up the road from the Casa C\u00e9sar Manrique.\n\nEulogio Concepcion Perdomo -- Lanzarote's last traditional basket weaver. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nConcepcion, wearing a flat cap, leather apron and protective wrist bandages, is the last person making traditional baskets from palm fronds in the entire Canary Islands.\n\nHe recalls regular friendly conversations with his famous neighbor and was possibly one of the last people to see him alive as Manrique drove off on his fateful last journey.\n\n\"He came by and said to me, 'keep on working,'\" Concepcion recalls.\n\nCasa Museo C\u00e9sar Manrique , Calle Elvira S\u00e1nchez, 30, 35520 Har\u00eda, Lanzarote; +34 928 84 31 38\n\nRelated content 14 Spanish dishes you should try -- from churros to jam\u00f3n\n\nLa Cueva de los Verdes\n\nAn underground mirror lake is a highlight of La Cueva de los Verdes. Barry Neild/CNN\n\nEn route to forming Jameos del Agua, lava from the nearby Volc\u00e1n de La Corona also created these caverns, the highlight of which is an eye-deceiving reflection pool deep underground.\n\nOnce a hiding place from marauding invaders, the caves have no direct link to Manrique, but his friend and collaborator, Lanzarote artist Jes\u00fas Soto designed the light and sound show that makes the visit worthwhile.\n\nMonumento al Campesino\n\nWine walls: Curved windbreaks shelter vine plants by the Monumento al Campesino. Neufal54/Pixabay\n\nDriving along Lanzarote's smooth, newly surfaced roads is a real pleasure. Cycling them, unless there's a headwind, is even more so, which is why the island is a year-round training ground for pro and amateur riders.\n\nWhatever the means of transport, it quickly becomes apparent that all roads seem to lead to the Monumento Al Campesino.\n\nLooming high over a crossroads right at the heart of the island, this giant whitewashed stack of blocks and curves is Manrique's tribute to the peasants who toiled Lanzarote's black soils long before the tourists came to town.\n\nIt's very much of its era, but well cared for. There are steps up inside it, for the full immersive art experience, and nearby a small field showing the curved walls locals use to protect vines from prevailing winds.\n\nNeed more of a breather before getting back on the bike? There's also a museum paying homage to Lanzarote's farmers and restaurant serving up local dishes (if in doubt, always go for the papas arrugadas -- salted, wrinkly potatoes served with spicy mojo dipping sauce.)\n\nMonumento Al Campesino , Ctra.

Barry Neild/CNN\n\nIn the garden's wind-sheltered hollow, cacti of all shapes and sizes line pathways that twist around calming water features. Above, a traditional windmill keeps watch.\n\nIt's an incredible work of vision, not just from Manrique but also the local officials who trusted him with the time and money to go wild and create a place like nowhere else on the planet.\n\nJard\u00edn de Cactus , Av.

But this one was different.\n\nAt first Archbold thought he had bought a replica of an animation cel from the 1980s or 1990s. He thought if he removed the broken frame and cleaned it up, the picture might fetch $80 to $100.\n\nHe paid the homeless man, Adam Gillian, $20 for it.\n\nBut when he it took it out of the frame and flipped it over, Archbold discovered an old certificate of authenticity. Even more surprising: It had a copyright date of 1937. \"Bambi\" hit theaters in 1942.\n\nSuddenly Archbold realized he had an original Disney animation cel -- a hand-drawn image on a celluloid sheet -- with much more value than he had initially thought.\n\n\"When I knew it was gonna sell for a lot of money, I knew it wasn't right to take it all,\" Archbold told CNN.\n\nThat's when he vowed to give Gillian half of whatever the proceeds were.\n\nFirst, though, he needed to find him.\n\nFinding Adam\n\nArchbold sold the piece on eBay for $3,700 in Canadian dollars. But then came the hard part: Finding a man with no fixed address.\n\nThe store owner drove the streets of Edmonton, slowing down wherever he saw homeless people. Archbold documented his search on YouTube\n\nHe eventually came across someone who knew Gillian.\n\nThat man got word to Gillian, who then stopped by the store. With cameras rolling, Archbold gave him the $1,600.35 -- Gillian's share of the sale after deducting fees. He then gave him an additional $100 and bought him lunch.\n\n\"Wow, that's awesome,\" Gillian told him, looking a little bashful. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\nAdam Gillian, left, shakes hands with antique dealer Alexander Archbold.\n\nThe store owner says his own background gives him a special empathy for homeless people.\n\n\"I was homeless when I was in grade seven. I had to help pay my parents' bills so I had to sell antiques on the side,\" Archbold said.\n\nThose early years hawking wares led Archbold to his career dealing antiques. They also make him listen whenever a homeless person comes into his store and tries to sell him something.\n\n\"I go through people's basements looking for stuff they don't want anymore,\" said Archbold. \"Adam's doing the same thing. He's recycling and finding stuff.\"\n\nA journey home\n\nA week ago, Archbold set up a GoFundMe page to help Gillian get off the streets and into a hotel for the winter. The account quickly exceeded its $10,000 goal.\n\nThen members of Gillian's family, including his mother, saw news reports about his trash bin find and reached out to Archbold. The antique dealer was able to put Gillian back in contact with his family and helped him make plans to return home to Ontario.\n\nArchbold even took a day off work to help Gillian get a temporary identification card so he could take a train trip home. But when the store owner went to meet Gillian, he couldn't find him.\n\n\"I went to the hotel and I was supposed to pick him up, but he wasn't there,\" Archbold said. \"He was tracking down a friend of his who was also homeless and was giving his winter boots to him.\"\n\nArchbold eventually found Gillian and took him into several antique stores to show him what dealers look for.\n\n\"He does have a talent for it,\" he said. \"He always brought me neat stuff he found in the trash.

Bitcoin prices are down more than 15% in just the past week and have plummeted nearly 70% so far this year.\n\nBitcoin hit a peak above $19,000 in December 2017. Its is now trading at around $4,600.\n\nShares of companies with ties to the crypto market have plunged lately too, including chipmakers Nvidia ( NVDA ) and AMD ( AMD ), which make graphics cards used by bitcoin miners. Online retailer turned blockchain investor Overstock ( OSTK ) and digital payments firm Square ( SQ ) are also sharply lower. Each stock is down between 15% and 35% in just the past month.\n\nSo it seems safe to say that the bitcoin bubble has burst. Should investors start to dip their toe back in to bitcoin and other crypyto-related assets?\n\nPerhaps. Some bitcoin bulls are welcoming the recent volatility. It may be scaring away some of the momentum investors who rushed in, which means that bargain hunters can scoop up bitcoin at a more attractive price.\n\n\"Savvy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money and, as such, they will be capitalizing on the lower prices in order to build their portfolios and shore-up their positions,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory firm.\n\nGreen compared the current shakeout to what happened with the dot-com boom and subsequent bust in the late 1990s. Many internet stocks crashed and burned, but Amazon ( AMZN ) is proof positive that e-commerce turned out to be a legitimate business and not just hype.\n\n\"Financial traditionalists view cryptocurrencies the way traditional stores used to view online retailers,\" Green said. \"Crypto cynics are using this current wave of volatility to knock digital currencies. Whether it is Bitcoin, or any of the current generation of coins, or not, cryptocurrencies are here to stay.\"\n\nSEC keeping a close eye on fishy ICOs\n\nThere's also a more technical, wonky reason for why bitcoin is falling.\n\nIn the past year, bitcoin has gone through a splitting process known as a fork. The first fork created bitcoin cash -- and bitcoin cash has now recently split into two other forks as well. For the average investor, this basically just means more volatility.\n\nBut there are still some potential problems for bitcoin and the legion of other cryptos out there, such as ethereum, litecoin, ripple and stellar. Their prices have all plunged lately too.\n\nPart of the problem is a bubble mentality. Short-term investors are all trying to get rich quick with these cryptocurrencies as well as initial coin offerings or ICOs. Those are securities backed by crypto assets.\n\nBut they are incredibly risky. And the Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to crack down on ICOs that don't pass regulatory muster.\n\nJust last week, the SEC fined two companies $250,000 each for failing to follow the proper laws for registering securities. One of the firms, Paragon, is working to legalize cannabis -- proving that it's possible to combine two investing manias in one company.\n\n\"The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with Think Markets UK. \"The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path.\"\n\nRegulatory issues may be just the tip of the iceberg as well. Anthony Pompliano, a partner with crypto investing firm Morgan Creek Digital, wrote in a recent blog post that some crypto hedge funds may be forced to shut down due to the dramatic drop in prices.\n\nHe argued that many firms won't be able to raise more capital and won't be able to survive.\n\n\"The current bear market is going to go from bad to worse very quickly for both crypto funds and ICO projects. The pain ahead is something that many of these entrepreneurs and fund managers have never had to deal with,\" Pompliano wrote.\n\nBut he sees light at the end of the tunnel. Pompliano believes that the current shakeout is necessary. It will rid the market of the weak hands and leave only true crypto believers -- as opposed to traders -- left to prosper from the continued overall growth in the crypto world.\n\n\"Things will get much worse before they get better. That is okay. Remember, bear markets get rid of the tourists so that the true entrepreneurs can focus on building sustainable value,\" Pompliano wrote."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ryan Browne, CNN", "title": "US says it killed 37 militants in two Somalia airstrikes", "description": "The US military killed 37 militants in two separate airstrikes in the vicinity of Debatscile, Somalia, on Monday, according to a statement from US Africa Command, which oversees military operations on the continent.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170404153305-us-military-drone-mq-9-reaper-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:56:36Z", "content": "(CNN) The US military killed 37 militants in two separate airstrikes in the vicinity of Debatscile, Somalia, on Monday, according to a statement from US Africa Command, which oversees military operations on the continent.

Sophie was a top karting racer herself, competing against former F1 drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli until she married Jos. Anthony Kumpen, a two-time Euro NASCAR Champion, is one of Max's uncles.\n\nAfter their divorce in 2006, the Verstappens decided Sophie would look after their daughter, Victoria, while Max would live with his father on the Dutch-Belgian border so he could help him in his racing career.\n\nMax Verstappen with his father, Jos, at the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix.\n\nIn a rare interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws in 2016, Kumpen described that time as \"a very tough period.\"\n\nAt the age of four, Max was given a kart, and promptly won almost every race he entered.\n\nWhile Jos guided his son on the European karting circuit, where he became the European and world karting champion in 2012, his mother helped him stay grounded.\n\nFollowing her divorce, Sophie worked at the Public Centre for Social Welfare in Belgium, and she made a point of sharing her experiences with her superstar son, who is worth $17 million according to Quote Magazine in the Netherlands.\n\n\"I see a lot of poverty,\" Kumpen told Het Laatste Nieuws. \"I see the underbelly of society. I think it is good I can show Max...I want him to know that there is a whole different world out there besides his own. It is good to keep him grounded.\"\n\nOrange Army\n\nAlthough the now 21-year-old Max Verstappen was born and raised in Belgium, and now lives in Monaco, there was never any doubt in his mind he would eventually race under the Dutch flag.\n\nHis choice to compete for the Netherlands also made commercial sense.\n\nVerstappen has become so popular, he now has his very own \"Max Verstappen Stand\" at race venues in Belgium, Austria, Hungary and Germany, where thousands of orange-clad and beer-swigging Dutch fans come to sing and cheer on their countryman.\n\nAmazed to see so many Orange fans!

During the ceremony, Trump announced that Peas was the winner of the vote to receive a presidential pardon.\n\n\"That turkey is so lucky. I've never seen such a beautiful turkey,\" Trump said of Peas, who ruffled its feathers in front of a crowd of onlookers in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe poultry pair's journey to Washington was a veritable gravy train.\n\nPer the council, Peas and Carrots lived in their own house away from the other turkeys and were handled regularly to \"get used to people and activity,\" as it is important that they wouldn't be in a fowl mood for their big day.\n\nWeighing in at 39 and 41 pounds, respectively, Peas and Carrots hatched in late June of this year. Since then, the fluffy duo has developed a social media presence, knowing the importance of appealing to the baste.\n\nPicking who to pardon\n\nThe National Turkey Federation documented their trip from the Dakotas all the way to Washington via the warm backseat of a wood shaving-filled Suburban.\n\nGood morning from Ohio!

Peas, for instance, enjoys popcorn and the musical stylings of Brad Paisley. Carrots is more of an Elvis fan, preferring to snack on M&Ms.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the poll for a favorite turkey on the official White House account was tied 50-50 with just under 50,000 votes -- certainly within the margin of error for a recount.\n\nTrump said the vote was decided by a \"fair and open election\" -- no fowl play involved. But he teased that Carrots refused to concede and demanded a recount, although that didn't change the outcome.\n\n\"That's too bad for Carrots,\" Trump said.\n\nAlthough a president traditionally pardons one turkey, both Peas and Carrots will live out the rest of their turkey lives -- an expectancy of 10 years -- at Virginia Tech's \"Gobblers Rest\" exhibit, where they will be cared for by students and veterinarians in the university's Animal and Poultry Sciences Department.\n\nTrump poked fun by saying that House Democrats may try to ruffle some feathers and subpoena the turkeys as they live out their retirement.\n\n\"It won't be entirely a rest. Even though Peas and Carrots have received a presidential pardon, I have warned them that House Democrats are likely to issue them both subpoenas,\" Trump joked.\n\nOrigin story\n\nRumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as the Lincoln administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln's young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe competition of the delivery became national news in the 1920s when a turkey from Texas sent to President Woodrow Wilson in a White House-shaped crate battled outside the White House with a turkey from Kentucky. The Kentucky turkey emerged victorious, per the White House Historical Association\n\nThe National Turkey Federation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947 and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since President Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from them -- however, he did not spare the bird.\n\nThe first documented turkey pardon was given by President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nPardoning the turkeys didn't catch on right away. Even though President Gerald Ford pardoned President Richard Nixon, neither one of them decided to officially pardon any turkeys.\n\nTurkey pardoning became the norm in the White House in 1989 when President George H.W.

That study was based on nearly 8,000 adults.\n\n\"Sit less, move more\" is what the American Heart Association encourages all of us to do. But this simplistic guideline doesn't quite cut it, said Keith Diaz , lead author of the 2017 study and an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Department of Medicine.\n\n\"This would be like telling someone to just 'exercise' without telling them how,\" Diaz said.\n\nUssery said that \"unfortunately, right now, we don't have that optimal healthy sitting time or maximum sitting time.

They give an impression of an inflexible approach to design which is not what he's advocated in at all.\"\n\nIn that slight regret there's a lot of Rams' personality and an apparent modesty, which is effectively captured in the documentary that filmmaker Gary Hustwit has built around multiple interviews in his home in Kronberg, near Frankfurt, and by following him on the rare public events that he attended over the course of the last four years. At one of these events, Rams gracefully declines a request to sign one of his products, explaining that \"he is not a star designer.\"\n\n\"It took several months back and forth to get him to agree to do the film, because he really didn't want to have a documentary made about him initially,\" said Hustwit in a phone interview. \"But what is in the film is the real Dieter Rams. I think it was fairly easy to to get to him, because he's the same on camera or off camera. He doesn't care if the cameras are running or not. And that's a big difference from a lot of designers that I've interviewed: most of them choose their words very carefully when the cameras are rolling, but he's the same either way.\"\n\nDieter Rams was born in 1932. Credit: Gary Hustwit\n\nLess, but better\n\nThe appliances that Rams designed at Braun are functional, easy to use, and durable. Their aesthetic isn't necessarily exciting, or arresting, but rather elegant, and still very contemporary even though the earliest designs are now over 60 years old. Their rounded edges and clean lines are very reminiscent of today's Apple devices.\n\nJony Ive writes in the introduction to \"As little design as possible,\" a book on Dieter Rams published by Phaidon: \"The surfaces were without apology, bold, pure, perfectly-proportioned, coherent and effortless. (...) No part appeared to be either hidden or celebrated, just perfectly considered and completely appropriate in the hierarchy of the product's details and features. At a glance, you knew exactly what it was and exactly how to use it. (...) I was completely enchanted with it then, and I now find, with surprise, that this object resonated so deeply with me that nearly forty years on I remember my sense of it with startling clarity.\" The fact that he's talking about a juicer ( 1972's MPZ 2 Citromatic ) rather than some more sophisticated piece of technology is a testament to the universality of Rams' design principles.\n\nApple has often paid homage to Rams' designs, for example in the looks of its podcast and calculator apps. Some say that his 1958 T3 radio -- designed with Ulm Hochschule and part of MoMA's collection along with 22 more of his Braun objects -- has directly inspired the look of the iPod. \"I mean, that's 1958. Nothing looks like that in 1958. It's just in another universe and it still looks that way,\" said Hustwit.\n\nHustwit asked Rams about Ive's admiration of his work and his influence on Apple products. \"He thinks it's a compliment. He likes Jony a lot. But I think it's hard for him to judge that impact because he doesn't have a computer. He's not on the Internet. He's not interested in digital interfaces and user experience design and all these screens that we have to look at all day. There are no screens in his life, there's just an old Braun television from the 1980s and that's really the only screen in his house. It's just not something that he's interested in engaging with.\"\n\nAccording to Fanning, while the influence is evident, it is also accompanied by a kind of tension. \"A technology company like Apple relies on the principle of rapid obsolescence and releases a new iPhone every year. That runs very counter to the philosophy that Rams has developed and advocated over his career. He is much more on the side of a long lasting, durable design, things that can resist that impulse towards consumerism and wastefulness,\" he said.\n\nMeet the man who invented the emoji\n\nNo waste\n\nConsumerism is in fact a main theme of Hustwit's film, for the simple reason that it is a main theme in Rams' thoughts. In a previous interview , he even declared that \"If I had to do it over again, I would not want to be a designer.\"\n\nRams feels that he has played a role in pushing society towards materialism and away from sustainability, even though he's had a concern over the environmental impact of his products long before that became fashionable, or even rational. \"That's something he's been talking about for 40 years now. It's a huge huge part of his philosophy but I think in some ways he feels that he hasn't done enough to get people to listen, especially outside of the design world. That's one of the things he's most frustrated about and probably why he agreed to do the documentary in the first place, to reach a larger audience and find a way to get those ideas to the next generation,\" said Hustwit.\n\nGary Hustwit\n\nIntegral to his approach was designing objects that would last. His first foray into creating furniture, the 606 Universal Shelving System he made for Vitsoe in 1960, is designed to last a lifetime and adapt to different rooms and houses, moving along with its owner. It is also been in production and on sale ever since.\n\n\"He is really in large part responsible for creating the idea that design is at the heart of business. He was really one of first to say that design is integral to creating a responsible corporate approach, long before we had these jargon terms around corporate responsibility that set are pretty familiar today,\" said Fanning.\n\nBut can a man who doesn't own a computer and is not online fully grasp the extent of his own legacy? \"I don't think so, he can't really put that into context,\" said Hustwit.\n\n\"I think he doesn't have a real sense of his impact and his influence on other designers.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Melissa Vel\u00e1squez Loaiza", "title": "Disfruta del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias sin culpa con estos ocho platos tradicionales, simples y bajos en calor\u00edas", "description": "Te presentamos algunas alternativas para que empieces estas festividades comiendo saludable sin consumir tantas calor\u00edas como podr\u00edas hacerlo el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/20/disfruta-del-dia-de-accion-de-gracias-sin-culpa-con-estos-ocho-platos-tradicionales-simples-y-bajos-en-calorias/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/thanksgivinglight-lead-super-tease.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:05:09Z", "content": "(CNN) - El D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias es un momento para celebrar, y ciertamente no lo es para ayunar o hacer dieta.

Pero si vas a empezar la temporada de fiestas pensando en cuidar tu salud, hay algunos cambios que puedes hacer el D\u00eda del Pavo que te ayudar\u00e1n a aumentar tu nutrici\u00f3n y aligerar tu carga de calor\u00edas.\n\nTe presentamos algunos sustitutos saludables que pueden ayudarte a ahorrar 1.200 calor\u00edas en toda una comida.\n\nMira en este video: Cifras curiosas de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias: a los pavos no les va nada bien\n\nToma vino tinto en vez de cocteles\n\nLos cocteles pueden agregar r\u00e1pidamente calor\u00edas a trav\u00e9s de mezcladores dulces, t\u00f3nica, jugo, sodas y jarabes. Es m\u00e1s, dependiendo del coctel, las bebidas mezcladas pueden contener m\u00e1s de una bebida alcoh\u00f3lica (esto es m\u00e1s de 1,5 onzas de vodka o ginebra) que tambi\u00e9n contiene calor\u00edas.\n\nUna lata de ocho onzas de White Russian puede tener hasta 500 calor\u00edas gracias al Kahl\u00faa, vodka con crema, pero un vaso de vino de 5 onzas puede tener unas 125 calor\u00edas, o cerca de un cuarto de la cantidad. Si prefieres los cocteles altos en calor\u00edas, limita tu consumo a uno solo.\n\nZanahorias y hummus en vez de quesos y galletas\n\nUn par de galletas de multigranos con queso cheddar tiene 134 calor\u00edas, algo que no es una recarga de calor\u00edas, pero s\u00ed, si lo comparas con dos zanahorias baby y dos cucharadas soperas de humus, que tiene solo 62 calor\u00edas y 2 gramos de fibra.\n\nPuedes doblar la porci\u00f3n por pocas calor\u00edas si eliges hortalizas crudas en lugar de queso. Si prefieres consumir salsas en vez de humus, trata de sustituir el yogur griego por crema agria para disminuir las calor\u00edas y aumentar las prote\u00ednas.\n\nCarne de pavo oscura sin piel\n\nLa verdad sea dicha: la carne oscura de pavo es deliciosa y t\u00edpicamente m\u00e1s jugosa y sabrosa que la carne blanca. Adem\u00e1s, la carne oscura tiene m\u00e1s zinc y hierro que la carne blanca.\n\nNo es necesario olvidar la carne oscura este D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias. Pero deja de lado la carne y ah\u00f3rrate algunas calor\u00edas y grasa saturada. La carne oscura con piel tiene 175 calor\u00edas por cada 3 onzas servidas, que es similar al tama\u00f1o de un mazo de cartas o al rat\u00f3n de un computador.\n\nSalsa vegana de champi\u00f1ones en lugar de salsa tradicional\n\nEl pavo parece no ser \u201cpavo\u201d sin salsa, ya que la salsa le da un mejor sabor a cualquier plato. Pero hacer tu salsa con champi\u00f1ones en vez de con la salsa de carne puede darle a tu pavo un sabor delicioso a \u201cunami\u201d mientras te ahorras una gran cantidad de calor\u00edas y grasa.\n\nLa salsa tradicional tiene 63 calor\u00edas por cuarto de tasa, y la salsa vegetariana de champi\u00f1ones, solo 35.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, como la salsa de champi\u00f1ones no tiene carne, tambi\u00e9n pueden comerla los vegetarianos. Cualquier salsa que elijas, trata de usar una cuchara grande para servirte, en vez de servirte directamente del recipiente, para ayudar a controlar el tama\u00f1o de tus porciones.\n\nRelleno de granos con repollo rizado en vez de relleno tradicional\n\nRellenar es delicioso, pero usar pan blanco como ingrediente es perderse una oportunidad nutricional, ya que no ofrece la fibra y vitaminas que el pan integral. Trata de usar un relleno hecho con pan integral, avena o quinua para potenciar los nutrientes.\n\nEl relleno integral de The New York Times con repollo rizado, higueras, d\u00e1tiles y avellanas tiene siete gramos de fibra y cerca de 60 calor\u00edas menos por porci\u00f3n que el relleno tradicional. El relleno tradicional tiene cerca de 420 calor\u00edas por taza, mientras que el relleno integral con repollo y fruta deshidratada tiene 357 calor\u00edas.\n\nBatata al horno en vez de batata a la cacerola con malvaviscos\n\nLas batatas son un alimento delicioso y nutritivo que puede ayudarte a tener una piel suave, ya que son ricas en vitamina A. Sin embargo, cuando le agregas az\u00facar morena, mantequilla y malvaviscos, est\u00e1s comiendo un postre.\n\nUna porci\u00f3n de cazuela de batata confitada con malvaviscos contiene 405 calor\u00edas, 19 gramos de grasa y 32 gramos de az\u00facar. Una batata entera al horno solo tiene 120 calor\u00edas y solo 9 gramos de az\u00facar natural. Puedes incluso agregar algunos malvaviscos tostados y obtener un extra de 30 calor\u00edas.\n\nCacerola de fr\u00edjoles verdes bajos en grasa en vez de una cacerola de frijoles verdes tradicional\n\nLa cacerola tradicional de frijoles verdes es plato b\u00e1sico del D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias, pero puedes preparar una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s saludable, disponible en eatingwell.com para obtener un plato con menos calor\u00edas.\n\nSi te gusta la receta tradicional de este plato, puedes usar ingredientes m\u00e1s frescos y bajos en grasas que mejoren el beneficio del plato y el sabor. Simplemente sustituye las cebollas francesas fre\u00eddas por cebollas frescas (las puedes hornear despu\u00e9s de pasarlas por mantequilla y recubrirlas con pan rallado y harina), y usar leche condensada baja en calor\u00edas de sopa de champi\u00f1ones en vez de la versi\u00f3n regular. Tambi\u00e9n puedes sustituir la leche por leche baja en calor\u00edas, que ahorra calor\u00edas y grasas saturadas.\n\nTarta de calabaza en vez de tarta de nuez pecana\n\nNo hay necesidad de saltarse el postre, pero elegir tarta de calabaza en vez de tarta de nuez pecana puede ahorrarte unas 200 calor\u00edas.\n\nLa tarta de nuez pecana tiene 541 calor\u00edas por porci\u00f3n, y la de calabaza, 523. La tarta de manzana tambi\u00e9n es otra opci\u00f3n baja en calor\u00edas comparada con la de nuez pecana, con 363 por porci\u00f3n.\n\nSi no puedes resistirte a la tarta de nuez pecana (qui\u00e9n podr\u00eda culparte), toma una porci\u00f3n delgada, o sin corteza y c\u00f3mete solo el relleno.\n\nHacer todas estas sustituciones puede ahorrarte cerca de 1.179 calor\u00edas en Acci\u00f3n de Gracias. Esperamos que no te pierdas nada de tu cena tradicional de 2.546 calor\u00edas y disfrutes esta cena tradicional, simple y deliciosa de 1.367 calor\u00edas.\n\n- Lisa Drayer es nutricionista, escritora y colaboradora de CNN."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Kara Fox, CNN", "title": "Turkey must release pro-Kurdish opposition leader, court rules", "description": "The European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey to release the imprisoned leader of a pro-Kurdish opposition group Tuesday, ruling that detention was motivated by \"stifling pluralism.\"", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/europe/echr-selahattin-demirtas-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120145104-selahattin-demirtas-supporter-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:04:27Z", "content": "(CNN) The European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey to release the imprisoned leader of a pro-Kurdish opposition group Tuesday, ruling that detention was motivated by \"stifling pluralism.\" Selahattin Demirtas, the former co-chair of the People's Democra\u2026 [+2784 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) The European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey to release the imprisoned leader of a pro-Kurdish opposition group Tuesday, ruling that detention was motivated by \"stifling pluralism.\"\n\nSelahattin Demirtas, the former co-chair of the People's Democratic Party (HDP), was first arrested in November 2016 for alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. Demirtas was a member of the Turkish parliament at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe 45-year-old former human rights lawyer faces a series of terrorism-related charges and a combined sentence of 183 years if found guilty.\n\nDemirtas has consistently denied all charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ECHR said that it had accepted that Demirtas had been arrested and detained on \"reasonable suspicion\" of having committed a criminal offense but the grounds on which Turkey has extended his pretrial detention are not \"sufficient.\"\n\nCiting a \"tense political climate\" in Turkey that has \"created an environment capable of influencing certain decisions by the national courts,\" the ECHR said that judicial authorities had \"reacted harshly\" to Demirtas' conduct because of his position as an opposition leader and a dissenting voice.\n\nMore than two years after a failed coup attempt aimed at unseating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, authorities continue to detain and arrest people who, they say, are linked to the attempted uprising -- including members of Demirtas' party, the HDP\n\nThroughout his two-year imprisonment, Demirtas has continued to galvanize supporters and even opposed Erdogan in this year's presidential race. The HDP took more than 10% of the vote in the June 2018 election, enough for the party to enter parliament for another term.\n\nSelahattin Demirtas addresses supporters from jail during his presidential election campaign in June.\n\nErdogan's presidential win , combined with a narrowly won constitutional referendum in 2017, gave him sweeping new powers that include wide-ranging executive authority -- authority that his critics say is a blatant power grab that threatens the independence of the judiciary.\n\nSpeaking to those campaigns, the ECHR said that it was \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that Demirtas' detention \"had pursued the predominant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate, which was at the very core of the concept of a democratic society.\"\n\nThe ruling says that Turkey is to pay Demirtas 25,000 euros (approximately $28,469) in costs and damages.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Erdogan accused the ECHR of not being objective and questioned its authority.\n\n\"No matter where you go in Europe today, while supporters of terrorist organizations roam free, the citizens who love our country are being suffocated,\" Erdogan said, referencing the supporters of Fethullah Gulen , the US-based, reclusive cleric accused by Turkey of hatching the 2016 military coup attempt.\n\n\"Are you following this ECHR? Do you have a ruling on these? No country or institution that praises Gulenists has the right to speak of democracy. This isn't seeking justice, it's simply terror-loving,\" Erdogan said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Erdogan told reporters in Ankara's parliament that \"ECHR decisions are not binding for us,\" according to state-run Anadolu news agency.\n\n\"There are several decisions that they took related to terror organizations. They are all unfavorable (to us),\" Erdogan added, saying that it was up to Turkey to decide how to deal with terror-related cases.\n\n\"We'll make our counter-move and finish it off. It is not ECHR that put down terror in Turkey. Terror lasted. And it is still going on. It is the Turkish people that pays the price,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Julia Carpenter, CNN Business", "title": "What happens when women mentor men", "description": "We're used to seeing men as mentors.

We're used to seeing them mentor other men, and we're also getting used to seeing them mentor junior women. As more women enter positions of leadership, we're also seeing a growing number of senior women mentoring other women.\n\nBut there's a mentor-mentee relationship we're not as familiar with: senior women mentoring junior men.\n\n\"To be honest, most of the research looks into men being mentors to women and whether this is effective,\" says Andromachi Athanasopoulou, associate professor in organizational behavior at Queen Mary University of London. \"Far less research has looked at the opposite \u2014 a woman mentoring a man \u2014 because more men are in the leadership positions, so they are more likely to be mentors.\"\n\nBut there's something about these relationships that experts say is different, especially for the man being mentored.\n\nWhen Lori Taylor, a vice president in the risk division at Goldman Sachs, returned to work after a six-year break to raise her children, she noticed both female and male employees approaching her for advice on balancing work and home responsibilities.\n\n\"I have some men who work for me who have long hours and commutes, and I get them to think about 'Do you want to work from home one day a week?'\" she says. \"We talk a lot about flexibility and the options you can create for yourself.\"\n\nSeeing women as the mentors\n\nPart of the reason we don't see these relationships as much is because female leaders are still relatively rare. A recent study from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org shows that women aren't promoted to management as quickly as their male colleagues are. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for women to mentor junior employees of any gender.\n\nBut research also shows that because men and women are socialized differently \u2014 men to be more aggressive and assertive, women to be more submissive and nurturing \u2014 they approach mentor-mentee relationships from entirely different perspectives.\n\nWomen are \"allowed\" to ask more questions about feelings, says Valerie Schwiebert, professor of counseling at Western Carolina University and author of \"Mentoring: Creating Connected Empowered Relationships.\"\n\n\"Men, when they do their mentoring, it's very much focused on 'This is how we climb the ladder. These are the steps. Here's who you should know. Here's what you do,'\" Schwiebert says. \"There's not a lot of focus on how you feel about that, on 'What do you need? What's important to you?'\"\n\nWomen are also more likely to care about chemistry in these relationships, Athanasopoulou says. Men will mentor a junior employee with less thought about rapport or the bond. Meanwhile, women will spend more time trying to establish that trust on the front end of the relationship.\n\n\"When women speak about mentoring another person, they tend to look at mentoring as a two-way process,\" she says. Men, she says, are more likely to see it as a transaction than a relationship.\n\nSeeing men as the mentees\n\nThe messages we get about gender don't just shape how we mentor, Schwiebert says. They also change how we receive mentorship.\n\nWhile women have been socialized to nurture and \"mother\" in the workplace, men have been socialized to value promotions and other symbols of success.\n\n\"There's this expectation you should want to climb the ladder as far as you can get,\" Schwiebert says. \"It's a vulnerable place for [men] to talk about things like 'Maybe I don't want to make a lot of money. Maybe I want to stay here.'\"\n\nSchwiebert points to one example from her research, where a male school counselor was offered a promotion to an administrative position, one that would put him on track to one day being a principal or superintendent. He loved his current job, but he know he should want the step up \u2014 it meant more prestige and more power. But when he asked female mentors for their input, they helped him see the experience from another side.\n\n\"They said, 'You're so great with the students. You love them so much. If you do become a principal and agree to it, is that what you want? Do you want to go on and be administrator and make changes at the administrative level, or is your real passion working with the kids?'\" Schwiebert remembers. \"He ended up turning down that position, because his decision was he really wanted to focus on the thing he loved.\"\n\nWalking a mentee through that kind of decision making, she says, and helping him or her find the choice that's best for them \u2014 that is exactly what good mentorship is all about."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Paula Bravo Medina", "title": "Los 10 narcotraficantes m\u00e1s notorios de M\u00e9xico", "description": "Estos son los capos m\u00e1s notorios del narcotr\u00e1fico en M\u00e9xico que fueron y son perseguidos tanto por las autoridades locales como por las estadounidenses e internacionales", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/20/los-10-narcotraficantes-mas-notorios-de-mexico/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/120904082329-guillen-cartel-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:53:20Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Han sido perseguidos por las autoridades mexicanas y estadounidenses por ser l\u00edderes y miembros prominentes de los m\u00e1s grandes carteles mexicanos de las drogas.

Mira esta y otras respuestas aqu\u00ed:\n\n1. Nace una tradici\u00f3n\n\nLas comidas congeladas deben agradecerle al D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias. En 1953, alguien en la empresa Swanson calcul\u00f3 mal el n\u00famero de pavos que se necesitar\u00edan para la festividad... por 26 toneladas. A alguien con una mente de negocios se le ocurri\u00f3 una brillante idea: cortar la carne de los pavos sobrantes y empacarla con algunos acompa\u00f1amientos.\n\n2. \u00bfVas de compras?\n\nSi eres un plomero, es probable que el 'Black Friday' no puedas ir de compras fren\u00e9ticas, pues ese d\u00eda es el m\u00e1s ocupado para ellos en todo el a\u00f1o, seg\u00fan Roto-Rooter, el servicio m\u00e1s grande de plomeros de EE.UU.. Despu\u00e9s de todo, alguien debe encargarse del sistema luego de que los invitados bien alimentados \"sobrecarguen el sistema\".\n\n3. Esta es mi tierra\n\nEn EE.UU. hay cuatro lugares llamados Turkey (pavo en ingl\u00e9s): Turkey Creek en Louisiana, Turkey en Texas, Turkey en Carolina del Norte, Turkey Creek en Arizona. Adem\u00e1s, hay dos pueblos en Pensilvania que se llaman Upper Turkeyfoot (que traducir\u00eda algo como pata superior de pavo) y Lower Turkeyfoot (pata inferior de pavo).\n\n4. Un legado\n\nCuando Abraham Lincoln declar\u00f3 el D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias una festividad nacional, fue gracias a los incansables esfuerzos de una editora de revista llamada Josepha Hale, quien tambi\u00e9n fue la autora de la canci\u00f3n 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\n\n5. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice?\n\nEl sonido que hace el pavo se llama graznido.\n\n6. El p\u00e1jaro de Ben\n\nSi Ben Franklin hubiera logrado su cometido, el pavo ser\u00eda el ave nacional de EE.UU.. Seg\u00fan le escribi\u00f3 a su hija en una carta, para \u00e9l un \u00e1guila ten\u00eda \"un mal car\u00e1cter moral\". El pavo, por otra parte, era \"un ave m\u00e1s respetable\".\n\n7. Nacido en EE.UU.\n\nEl D\u00eda de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias no se celebra solo en Estados Unidos; los canadienses tambi\u00e9n lo celebran, pero en octubre.\n\n8. No culpen al ave\n\nMuchos sienten mucho sue\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de engullir la cena de Acci\u00f3n de Gracias. Pero no es culpa del pavo, que de hecho contiene menos tript\u00f3fano, un amino\u00e1cido cuya digesti\u00f3n requiere una buena cantidad de energ\u00eda. El sue\u00f1o viene porque la mayor\u00eda de personas comen de m\u00e1s en la cena, y digerir toda esa comida puede producirles sue\u00f1o.\n\n9. Hablemos de pavos\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el pavo se llama turkey en ingl\u00e9s? Es el mismo nombre de Turqu\u00eda en ingl\u00e9s, y esto es porque los p\u00e1jaros eran importados por mercaderes turcos."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "s.zaghloul", "title": "\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \"\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\" \u0644\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0633\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0628\u0627\u061f", "description": "\u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a \u0631\u062c\u0628 \u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 &quot;\u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a&quot;

But in March the company's creditors forced it to go out out of business , and the 31,000 remaining employees didnot get severance payments.\n\nSome top executives at Toys \"R\" Us received bonuses as part of the bankruptcy process. The nation's bankruptcy laws place limits on the severance payments that can be made to laid-off employees, and they give priority to repaying creditors of the bankrupt companies.\n\nHad the employees been laid off before the bankruptcy, they would have been entitled to severance pay of up to one week of pay for every year of service.\n\nThe $20 million severance fund does not come from Toys \"R\" Us.\n\nfirms and various public interest groups that The fund was set up following negotiations between the private equityfirms and various public interest groups that organized the employees , including Organization United for Respect, Private Equity Stakeholder Project and Center for Popular Democracy.\n\n\"This Fund begins to ensure the hard-working people who spent their lives building Toys 'R' Us and making children happy are not left out in the cold,\" said Marilyn Muniz, a New York-based Toys \"R\" employee for nearly 20 years.\n\nThe groups are seeking additional contributions to the fund from Vornado as well as two Toys \"R\" Us lenders, Solus and Angelo Gordon, which they blame for pushing the company to shutdown operations rather than stay in business. Angelo Gordon declined to comment.\n\nSolus issued a statement saying KKR and Bain are responsible for, \"saddling the company with crushing debt .\" It said that the lenders had provided money that had been used to pay workers' salaries, including earlier severance payments, which it said \"vastly exceed\" the severance fund set up by Bain and KKR.\n\nSolus said it is a part of a group of lenders looking into ways to possibly revive the company\n\nTracy Forbes, a former employee who lost her job, told CNN Business that she had worked for the company for 31 years, making her way up to store manager of a Babies \"R\" Us store in Tempe, Arizona. At the time of the bankruptcy filing she figured she would get about seven months of severance if her store shut down. She said she was shocked when she learned the promised severance wouldn't be paid.\n\n\"It was very difficult,\" she said. \"Here in Arizona, unemployment is only $240 a week. It's not even minimum wage. It was rough. I only got by with friends and family helping me out.\"\n\nAfter about four months she found a job as an assistant manager of a Home Goods store, which pays less than Babies \"R\" Us. She said she's kept in touch with the employees who used to work with her at Babies \"R\" Us.\n\n\"Just about everyone has found some kind of work, but it generally took three or four months,\" she said. \"Some aren't earning as much. Some of the lower-level employees have actually found better paying jobs.\"\n\nThe fund has hired attorney Kenneth Feinberg to come up with a formula to determine who gets how much money. Feinberg has made a career deciding distribution to victims of events, such as the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He has proposed that payments go to workers who had been with the company at least a year and who made between $5,000 and $110,000 in annual income.\n\n\"In order to maximize the impact of available funds, key eligibility requirements and payment parameters had to be instituted,\" said Feinberg. Payments are expected to start soon after December 15 and be completed by April.\n\nThe $20 million fund will not cover a full severance plan for the workers. The employee groups estimate that would take $75 million.\n\nThe proposed payment schedule provides at least $200 to anyone eligible for payments and as much as $12,800 to the top earning employees -- those earning more than $100,000 a year who had been with the company for more than 25 years. Those earning more than $110,000 are not eligible to receive payments from the fund.\n\nA more typical employee, one who was earning $50,000 a year with 10 years of service, would get $2,400 under the plan, or about two-and-half weeks of pay."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "How Dems can get 270 electoral votes in 2020", "description": "CNN's Harry Enten takes a look at the different paths Democrats could take to reach 270 electoral votes in the 2020 election.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/20/harry-enten-democrats-270-electoral-votes-2020-newday-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120092435-harry-enten-forecast-democrats-2020-path-electoral-vote-270-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:47:18Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) This year will be the year of the tikka masala turkey. I have planned it out, procured the special spices, found the perfectly sized bird and amassed large quantities of tenderizing ginger and garlic. My goal is simple: a perfectly cooked bird that has never known the meaning of bland or dry and against whose briny interiors taunts of tastelessness slide away.\n\nI plan this sort of route nearly every Thanksgiving. Each time, I am convinced that a new strategy (say, soaking in vinegar), a novel tactic (removing the skin), a rejuvenated arsenal of spices (you've never seen these quantities of red chili powder) will enable my victory against the turkey -- producing the delectable bird of my Thanksgiving dreams.\n\nRafia Zakaria\n\nThis proposition, in my spice-soused imagination, is perennially irresistible. Why not marry the best of America with the best of my native homeland, Pakistan? It is food as metaphor, food as the basis for a deeply felt union. I believe this, and so I try and keep trying.\n\nMy quest has a long and storied history. It began almost two decades ago, when I bought my first turkey at my first Thanksgiving. A teenage bride just arrived in Nashville (another story for another time), I was determined to participate in this most American of traditions with full fervor. My then-mother-in-law tried to tell me the turkey required protracted defrosting, at least a day before it could be cooked. I didn't like advice then (or now), and so I ignored her. That first turkey was not only bland and dry after it was cooked, it was not actually cooked until several days after Thanksgiving. All I had to show that day of gratitude was a rock solid frozen bird sitting sadly in my small apartment sink.\n\nI did not give up. A few Thanksgivings later, goaded by the cheery encouragements of supermarket specials (I am inordinately excited by these), I decided to try again. I wanted to learn from my failures, so I decided the whole bird was a bit too much for the still-tiny apartment kitchen. Chastened by experience, I bought turkey breasts instead of the whole turkey. But because they are cheap and because I love making large meals, I bought six. These, I decided, I would bake with an assortment of potatoes and onions and root vegetables. It could not go wrong, I assured myself. I added cumin, coriander, nutmeg and turmeric.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Rishi Iyengar, CNN Business", "title": "Twitter CEO sparks 'hate speech' storm", "description": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has found himself in hot water on his first trip to India, after posing with a poster many Indians found offensive.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/tech/jack-dorsey-twitter-india/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120070712-01-jack-dorsey-new-delhi-1112-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:41:29Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New Delhi (CNN Business) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has found himself in hot water on his first trip to India, after posing with a poster many Indians found offensive.\n\nTwitter user Anna Vetticad tweeted a photograph of Dorsey holding up a poster reading \"smash Brahminical patriarchy,\" a reference to the highest caste \u2014 or social group \u2014 in Hindu society.

The group picture was taken following a roundtable discussion with Indian women journalists and activists, and it drew Dorsey into a hugely sensitive issue about power structures in Indian society.\n\nTensions between higher castes like Brahmins and lower-caste Dalits \u2014 a community of people once known as the untouchables \u2014 have been escalating in recent years.Activists say the rise of Hindu nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased the oppression of lower castes.\n\nMany Indians reacted with outrage, accusing Dorsey and Twitter of \"hate speech\" that singled out one group in society.\n\n\"Tomorrow if (Dorsey) is given a poster with anti Semitic messages in a meeting will his team allow him to hold it up?\" tweeted Mohandas Pai, a former director at Indian tech firm Infosys. \"Inciting hate against any community is wrong.\"\n\nDuring Twitter CEO @jack 's visit here, he & Twitter's Legal head @vijaya took part in a round table with some of us women journalists, activists, writers & @TwitterIndia 's @amritat to discuss the Twitter experience in India. A very insightful, no-words-minced conversation \ud83d\ude0a pic.twitter.com/LqtJQEABgV\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday that the poster was a gift to Dorsey by a Dalit woman who participated in the roundtable discussion.\n\n\"The sentiments expressed on the poster do not reflect the views of Twitter as a company or Jack as the CEO, and we regret that this picture has detracted from an otherwise insightful trip to India,\" she said.\n\nDorsey spent a week in India earlier this month, his first trip to the country after what he said was a \"lifetime of wanting to experience it.\" His visit included meetings with the Dalai Lama and Modi , who has over 44 million Twitter followers.\n\nIndia is a hugely important market for Twitter ( TWTR ) and other tech giants, with more internet users than any country other than China and nearly 900 million people that are yet to come online.\n\nTwitter's legal and public policy head Vijaya Gadde, who was also at the roundtable, later apologized individually to several users.\n\n\"I'm very sorry for this,\" Gadde said, adding that the poster did not reflect the company's views. \"We took a private photo with a gift just given to us \u2014 we should have been more thoughtful. Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all.\"\n\nBut Vetticad, who first tweeted the photograph, said it was taken by a Twitter representative and emailed to participants to share if they wished.\n\nMany users also slammed Twitter's statement and Gadde's apology, saying the company should take a stance against the \"oppressive\" caste system and patriarchy.\n\nTerribly disappointing st. on behalf of Twitter. Both Brahminism & patriarchy are oppressive by nature, so why would Twitter's views not reflect giving space to marginalized voices? Calling pandering \"impartial\" is just a cop out preventing actual efforts to make this space equal \u2014 Sandhya Ramesh (@sandygrains) November 20, 2018\n\nWrong analogy Chitra ji.

Filipino opposition senator Antonio Trillanes released the draft Tuesday to reporters.\n\nBeijing claims an enormous swathe of territory in the highly contested sea, overlapping competing claims from the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia, among others.\n\nThe Philippines in the past has taken a strong line on China's behavior in the area, even taking China to an international tribunal. But under Duterte, the government has increasingly looked to build an economically beneficial relationship with Beijing.\n\nDuterte told reporters in November that China was \"already in possession\" of the sea. \"It's now in their hands. So why do we have to create frictions (and undertake) strong military activity that will prompt response from China?\" he said.\n\nProtesters holds caricatures of Xi Jinping during a protest in Manila.\n\nTrillanes and another senator, Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan, filed a resolution ahead of Xi's arrival \"demanding transparency\" and urging to see the final draft agreement before it is signed, CNN Philippines reported\n\nA 'maritime Trojan Horse'\n\nIf the deal signed is anything like the leaked draft, it demonstrates \"an agreement to maybe negotiate an agreement at some point in the future,\" said Gregory B. Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.\n\nWhat the deal does do, Poling added, is buy Duterte some time in which the administration can put the issue on the \"back burner,\" especially given that public opinion is strongly against the softer approach to the South China Sea.\n\nAn independent poll conducted in September found 84% of Filipinos oppose the Duterte administration's inaction in the face of China's intrusion in the waters claimed by the Philippines.\n\n\"Politically, I think what Duterte is doing is making it the next guy's problem,\" Poling added. \"The deal isn't going to lead to development. There is no provision that would actually allow them to pull oil and gas up from the South China Sea.\"\n\nFor Duterte, analysts said, the agreement is much more about the appearance of striking a bargain, one that could potentially bring economic benefits to the Philippines.\n\nSchoolchildren wave the flags of the Philippines and China as they line up November 20 along the route of China's President Xi Jinping's motorcade in Manila.\n\n\"He doesn't really care all that much about the South China Sea, what he wants is demonstrable economic benefits in terms of investment and loans,\" said Euan Graham, executive director of La Trobe Asia.\n\nChina would be more interested in claims of sovereignty in the disputed waters and less so in any future energy resources that could possibly come from such a deal than the Philippines, which has a rapidly growing, energy-hungry population.\n\n\"This is a drop in ocean for (China's) energy needs,\" Graham said. \"This is not about energy for China, it's about long term control over the South China Sea.\"\n\nIf Chinese rigs and state owned energy companies ever did conduct joint explorations in Philippine waters, it would be tantamount to \"inviting the maritime version of the Trojan Horse,\" Graham said.\n\n\"There's simply no prospect that this would be regarded purely as a commercial deal. They are instruments of the state and the state's and long term objective is to reinforce its sovereignty claims,\" Graham said.\n\nProtesting muscular regional policies\n\nThousands of Filipinos protested in front of the Chinese embassy in the business district of Makati on Tuesday, as Xi touched down in Manila.\n\nDemonstrators voiced opposition to the construction of Chinese maritime military bases in international waters in the South China Sea, as well as onerous loan deals to finance Chinese-led projects under Xi's ambitious, global \"one belt, one road\" infrastructure scheme, CNN Philippines reported\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence this month knocked China for loans to developing countries in the Pacific and beyond.\n\nDemonstrators carry placards bearing anti-China slogans in a protest of Chinese influence in the Asia-Pacific sphere.\n\n\"The terms of those loans are often opaque at best,\" Pence said at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, conference in Papua New Guinea. \"Projects they support are often unsustainable and of poor quality\" and \"lead to staggering debt,\" he added.\n\nFunding for 34 of 75 flagship infrastructure projects to be built in the Philippines will come from China, CNN Philippines reports\n\nPhilippines' Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno had earlier insisted that the country wouldn't fall into a debt trap through Beijing-assisted loans.\n\nThe \"Department of Finance and other agencies ... have reviewed the terms that would be the best for us. (We would not agree) if those are unreasonable terms and terms that are worse than other sources,\" he said.\n\nMeantime online, many Filipinos changed their profile pictures to images of the cartoon bear Winnie the Pooh, a symbol censored on Chinese social media for its supposed likeness to the Chinese leader.\n\nUS flexes muscle in the South China Sea\n\nThe United States has steadily ratcheted up its military presence this year in the South China Sea, leading to heightened tensions with Beijing.\n\nTo bolster its position, Beijing since 2015 has been constructing and militarizing artificial islands on reefs and shoals in the South China Sea.\n\nWhile the US routinely flies bombers in the vicinity of the South China Sea as part of its long standing \"Continuous Bomber Presence\" missions, Beijing is particularly sensitive about the presence of US military forces near areas where the Chinese government has built islands and established military facilities on disputed maritime features.\n\nIn September, a Chinese warship came within 45 yards of the destroyer USS Decatur, forcing the US vessel to maneuver to avoid a collision, and the US Navy labeled China's actions \"unsafe and unprofessional.\"\n\nPence and Xi spar at major meeting\n\nXi's visit to the Philippines capped off an unexpectedly turbulent trip for the Chinese leader, after he joined in a war of words with Pence at the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea.\n\nDivisions rapidly developed over language in the joint communique condemning \"unfair trade practices,\" which Chinese officials felt was directed at Beijing.\n\nThe heated disagreement meant no statement was issued at the end of the meeting for the first time in its 25-year history.\n\nIt was a disappointing end to the summit for Xi, who had expected to dominate due to Trump's absence and the large loans Beijing has dispensed across the Asia-Pacific region."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jessica Lack, CNN", "title": "Photographer Florian Joahn on male identity: 'I'm not afraid of creating tension'", "description": "Florian Joahn is not interested in creating \"another picture of a pretty girl in a dress.\" Instead, he's challenging what it means to be a man.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/florian-joahn-dazed-beauty/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119175922-florian-joahn-dazed-beauty-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:24:52Z", "content": "fashion Published 20th November 2018 Earlier this year, fashion photographer Florian Joahn had a creative crisis. \"There are so many images out there,\" he said, \"why would I add to that?

I am a white male, tall, my narrative just isn't that interesting.\"\n\nHe has a point; with nearly 50,000 pictures uploaded every minute on Instagram , it is not easy to be seen in the digital morass. Joahn's solution was to question his reasons for becoming a photographer. It coincided with a trip to S\u00e3o Paulo to document a transgender community for an exhibition called \"Y'all better quiet down\" (inspired by trans rights activist Sylvia Rivera) with his collaborator, stylist Jean Paul Paula. \"I realized that I was giving this group a platform they otherwise wouldn't have. That is important, not another picture of a pretty girl in a dress.\"\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nChallenging fashion conventions\n\nA quick look at the London-based photographer's Instagram feed will tell you there have been few pretty girls in dresses since then. What it does reveal is a fashion photographer with a singular language and a sinewy intellect for challenging stereotypical visions of male identity. \"I always start out by asking why would I make this image?\" he said. \"I need to have a reason.\"\n\nRelated video: Why nightclubs are better than art galleries\n\nDo commercial demands of fashion photography constrain his freedom? \"Strangely enough, no, fashion is very open, much more so than documentary.\" He cites the uncompromising Peter Lindbergh as a good example of a photographer who has successfully navigated the market forces of the fashion world. \"He redefined how women should look, his images are raw, no make-up, I didn't even know that was fashion photography when I first saw his pictures,\" he said.\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nJoahn is engagingly eloquent and refreshingly candid about the paradoxes of the fashion world. Born in 1990 in the stark industrial environs of East Germany, just as socialism was collapsing, Joahn knew he wanted to be in fashion from the age of five. \"I loved the beauty and the fantasy of it. Growing up as a gay boy in a very conservative town, I just didn't fit in.\" His introduction to photography was via the unorthodox route of producing fake IDs for his friends. \"I realized I could manipulate their faces in Photoshop and enhance their features. It made me realize a photograph is more than just representation, you can create with it.\"\n\nBroader visions of male identity\n\nAt 18, desperate to escape his sheltered upbringing, he moved to Ghana to teach. There, Joahn discovered the African narrative he had been led to believe in was nothing like reality.\n\nRelated video: Exploring Japan's 'genderless' subculture\n\n\"I came as a volunteer, but I wasn't smart or aware, how was I going to help a 40-year-old man with his own business? There is this weird white idea about Africa being an underdeveloped place, but it's just a different way of living. I lost a lot of my judgement.\"\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nHe returned to Europe and studied audiovisual art at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. Did he not want to study fashion? \"I had this bourgeois mind-set that fashion wasn't deep enough. It was only when I got accepted onto a master's program at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt that I realized my heart wasn't in it.\" However, his training in the visual arts gave him the courage to push aesthetic boundaries while also retaining a strong social message. \"Sure, I'm not afraid of creating tension,\" he said.\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nHis favorite shoot to date is one he made with the online platform Dazed Beauty depicting Alex, a black model in a Gloria Estefan wig and a tiny green dress stretched tight across his bulging muscles. \"He was great,\" said Joahn. \"Totally unafraid of his feminine side.

Click to subscribe!\n\n\"Some aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump's personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\"\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump lawyer Abbe Lowell, said something similar in a statement following the Post story. (Again, bolding is mine.)\n\n\"While transitioning into government, until the White House provided her the same guidance they had to others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" Mirijanian said.\n\nHow. Is. That. Possible.\n\nHow could Ivanka Trump have not known -- even prior to the White House providing her \"guidance\" -- that using a private email account to conduct official business was a giant no-no?\n\nAs you may remember, the central attack by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign centered on her decision to use a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. Trump insisted that Clinton was not being fully transparent about why she used a private email server for government business -- and used that as a foothold into a broader questioning of whether the former secretary of state could be trusted with the nation's top job.\n\n\"How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk,\" Trump tweeted in June 2016. A month later, he tweeted this : \"The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!\"\n\nThen there was the drama regarding the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails -- and whether she had broken any laws regarding the transmission of classified information by using a private account. Months after announcing the FBI would not press charges against Clinton, then-FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress indicating the investigation had been re-opened due to emails found on a laptop owned by former New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has blamed the Comey email announcement for her loss. \"There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\" Clinton told donors shortly after her defeat . \"Our analysis is that Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\"\n\nWhether you buy that explanation from Clinton is actually beside the point. The point is this: It is literally impossible to believe, after everything that transpired during the 2016 campaign regarding Clinton's use of a private email to conduct government business, that Ivanka Trump was simply unaware that what she was doing wasn't allowed. It's just not possible.\n\nTeam Ivanka was quick to note that the two situations weren't -- and aren't -- exactly the same. Again, Mirijanian:\n\n\"To address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump's personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"\n\nWhich, OK. Clinton did delete a large chunk of the emails she sent from her private account after someone working for her did a broad canvas of all the emails she had sent and determined that they were entirely personal and therefore could be deleted without sharing them with investigators. (Roughly 50% of the emails on Clinton's private server were deleted, while 44% were turned over to investigators.)\n\nAnd sure, there are -- at least on the surface -- some specific differences between what Clinton did and what Ivanka did. But man, in the big picture it's pretty damn similar.\n\nThe Mirijanian statement misses the point. It's stretched credulity well beyond snapping to think that Ivanka was simply blissfully unaware that what she was doing in using her private email account was totally on the up and up. No sentient being -- and certainly not one working at the top levels of government who also happens to be the eldest daughter of the President of the United States -- could have lived through the 2016 campaign and not understood this basic equation: Private emails for government business = bad.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether what Ivanka Trump did merits an official investigation -- although I strongly suspect the Democratic House will be taking a hard look come January. But what is quite clear in all of this is that Ivanka absolutely had to have known better."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "C\u00e1psulas de aceite de pescado y de vitamina D no protegen contra el c\u00e1ncer o males card\u00edacos", "description": "Para reducir el riesgo de c\u00e1ncer y enfermedades del coraz\u00f3n, hay otras estrategias cient\u00edficamente probadas, indicaron los expertos.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/20/capsulas-de-aceite-de-pescado-y-de-vitamina-d-no-protegen-contra-el-cancer-o-males-cardiacos/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/180511101807-prescription-pill-bottles-full-169.jpg?quality=100&strip=info&w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:18:04Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Un estudio, que gener\u00f3 mucha expectativa, concluy\u00f3 que ni la vitamina D ni los suplementos de aceite de pescado previenen el c\u00e1ncer o problemas card\u00edacos graves en personas mayores sanas.

Los resultados de la investigaci\u00f3n se presentaron en la \u00faltima conferencia de la American Heart Association.\n\nLos investigadores definieron los males card\u00edacos graves como el \u00edndice combinado de ataques card\u00edacos, apoplej\u00eda y muertes relacionadas con el coraz\u00f3n.\n\nAunque se han publicado cientos de estudios sobre estos suplementos a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, el nuevo ensayo cl\u00ednico, un proyecto financiado por el Gobierno federal que involucra a casi 26.000 personas, es el examen m\u00e1s exhaustivo y definitivo hasta la fecha, dijo el doctor Clifford Rosen, cient\u00edfico principal del Maine Medical Center Research Institute, quien no particip\u00f3 en la investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nLEE: \u00bfQu\u00e9 es la vitamina D?, \u00bfqu\u00e9 alimentos la tienen?, y todo lo que necesitas saber\n\nLos m\u00e9dicos han mostrado mucho inter\u00e9s en conocer el verdadero valor de estos suplementos, por su enorme popularidad entre los pacientes. Un estudio de 2017 encontr\u00f3 que el 26% de los estadounidenses de 60 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s consume suplementos de vitamina D, mientras que el 22% toma pastillas que contienen \u00e1cidos grasos omega 3, un ingrediente clave del aceite de pescado.\n\nEl nuevo estudio tambi\u00e9n sugiere que no hay raz\u00f3n para que la gente se someta a an\u00e1lisis de sangre rutinarios para detectar los niveles de vitamina D, agreg\u00f3 Rosen, quien escribi\u00f3 uno de los art\u00edculos que acompa\u00f1aron al estudio (ambos fueron publicados en el New England Journal of Medicine). Esto se debe a que, seg\u00fan la investigaci\u00f3n, los niveles de vitamina D de los pacientes no marcaban ninguna diferencia en su riesgo de c\u00e1ncer o problemas card\u00edacos graves, asegur\u00f3 Rosen.\n\nIncluso las personas que comenzaron el estudio con una clara deficiencia de vitamina D no obtuvieron ning\u00fan beneficio al tomar 2.000 unidades diarias de este nutriente, una o dos de las p\u00edldoras de vitamina D que normalmente se venden en las tiendas.\n\nUna historia reciente de Kaiser Health News report\u00f3 que las pruebas de vitamina D se han convertido en un gran negocio para los laboratorios comerciales, y un enorme gasto para los contribuyentes. Los m\u00e9dicos ordenaron m\u00e1s de 10 millones de pruebas de vitamina D para pacientes de Medicare en 2016, un aumento de 547% desde 2007, a un costo de 365 millones de d\u00f3lares.\n\n\"Es hora de acabar con esto\", dijo Rosen sobre las pruebas de vitamina D. \"No tienen justificaci\u00f3n\".\n\nLa doctora JoAnn Manson, autora principal del estudio, est\u00e1 de acuerdo en que los resultados no apoyan la evaluaci\u00f3n de personas sanas para detectar deficiencia de vitamina D.\n\nPero Manson no ve su estudio como algo completamente negativo. La investigadora dice que su equipo no encontr\u00f3 efectos secundarios graves por tomar aceite de pescado o suplementos de vitamina D.\n\n\"Si ya est\u00e1 tomando aceite de pescado o vitamina D, nuestros resultados no proporcionar\u00edan una raz\u00f3n clara para dejar de hacerlo\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 Manson.\n\nManson agreg\u00f3 que un an\u00e1lisis m\u00e1s profundo de los datos sugiri\u00f3 posibles beneficios.\n\nLEE: Los ni\u00f1os en la antigua Roma ten\u00edan deficiencia de vitamina D, seg\u00fan un estudio\n\nCuando los investigadores se fijaron en los ataques card\u00edacos, en lugar de la tasa combinada de todos los problemas card\u00edacos graves, vieron que el aceite de pescado parec\u00eda reducir estos ataques en un 28%, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Manson. En cuanto a la vitamina D, pareci\u00f3 reducir las muertes por c\u00e1ncer, aunque no los diagn\u00f3sticos de c\u00e1ncer, en un 25%.\n\nPero dividir los datos en segmentos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, con menos pacientes en cada grupo, puede producir resultados poco confiables, indic\u00f3 el doctor Barnett Kramer, director de la Divisi\u00f3n de Prevenci\u00f3n del C\u00e1ncer del National Cancer Institute. Los v\u00ednculos entre el aceite de pescado y los ataques cardiacos, y la vitamina D y la muerte por c\u00e1ncer, podr\u00edan ser cosa del azar, dijo Kramer.\n\nLos expertos est\u00e1n de acuerdo en que la vitamina D es importante para la salud de los huesos. Pero los investigadores no informaron de su efecto sobre los huesos en esta investigaci\u00f3n. En cambio, observaron \u00e1reas donde los beneficios de la vitamina D no han sido definitivamente probados, como el c\u00e1ncer y la enfermedad card\u00edaca. Aunque los estudios preliminares han sugerido que la vitamina D puede prevenir la enfermedad card\u00edaca y el c\u00e1ncer, estudios m\u00e1s rigurosos han cuestionado esos hallazgos.\n\nManson y sus colegas planean publicar datos sobre los efectos de los suplementos en otras \u00e1reas de la salud en los pr\u00f3ximos meses, incluyendo la diabetes, la memoria y el funcionamiento de la mente, las enfermedades autoinmunes, las infecciones respiratorias y la depresi\u00f3n.\n\nPara reducir su riesgo de c\u00e1ncer y enfermedades del coraz\u00f3n, los consumidores pueden seguir otras estrategias cient\u00edficamente probadas.\n\n\"La gente debe continuar enfoc\u00e1ndose en los factores conocidos para reducir el c\u00e1ncer y las enfermedades card\u00edacas: comer bien, hacer ejercicio, no fumar, controlar la presi\u00f3n arterial alta, y tomar estatinas si est\u00e1 en alto riesgo\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 el doctor Alex Krist, profesor de Medicina Familiar y Salud Ppoblacional de la Virginia Commonwealth University."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business", "title": "Campbell makes its case to quash a takeover plot, but still can't sell enough soup", "description": "Campbell Soup wants shareholders to believe it knows what's best for the company.

But as it fends off attacks from an activist investor trying to upend management, Campbell is still struggling to sell a key product: Soup.\n\nThe company has been embroiled in a battle with Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point for control. Campbell said Tuesday that soup sales fell by 6% in the three months ending in October, not including sales from Pacific Foods. Ready-to-serve and condensed soups dragged overall soup sales down, offsetting growth in broth sales.\n\nThe company expects US soup sales to decline next year, as well.\n\nCampbell ( CPB ) blamed the declines on competition from other soup makers and an increase in promotional spending.\n\nIt's part of a trend for Campbell, which has been having a hard time selling its signature soup. Loeb has noticed. Third Point laid out a plan to improve Campbell last month, pointing out where it believes the company has fallen short.\n\nOn Tuesday, Campbell said it's pleased with the company's progress.\n\n\"During the quarter we started to see improved trends in US soup,\" interim CEO Keith McLoughlin said in a statement, adding that V8 sales have been growing and that Campbell's snack business is performing well. Net sales for the quarter grew 25% to $2.7 billion thanks to the company's acquisition of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods.\n\nThe company conducted a full operational review last summer in the wake of poor sales and the abrupt departure of its former CEO. At its conclusion, the company decided to sell its fresh and international businesses and focus on snacks, meals and beverages to improve the company.\n\n\"We are on track with our plans and are encouraged by the progress we are making,\" McLoughlin said on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a call discussing the earnings, Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said the company has received \"significant buyer interest\" for Campbell Fresh and the international business. McLoughlin added that the company has been actively searching for a permanent CEO, and it expects to find one by the end of the year.\n\nShareholders seemed to agree with the rosy take: the company's stock jumped about 7% on the results.\n\nTuesday's earnings come at an important time for the company. Next week, shareholders will vote on whether to keep the company's current leadership in place, or accept Third Point's plan to replace 5 of the 12 board members.\n\nThird Point points to Campbell's recent poor performance as evidence that the current leadership isn't working. Campbell's core products \"seem tired and out-of-date,\" Third Point has said, adding that the company has failed to innovate flavors for its classic products, and still uses \"hard-to-pronounce and obscure sounding ingredients\" like hydrolyzed soy protein and glutamate in those products.

It's also a prime opportunity for bad actors to scam consumers.\n\nHundreds of malicious Black Friday apps and websites will be looking to steal personal data and credit card information this year in the United States and United Kingdom, according to a new report from cybersecurity company RiskIQ.\n\nCybercriminals create fake mobile apps and landing pages with realistic branding, especially around major holidays and events like Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. They want to convince consumers to download bad apps or visit bogus sites and ultimately \"phish\" for sensitive data.\n\nA scam circulating on popular messaging platform WhatsApp ahead of Black Friday promises 99%-off discounts on Amazon.com. On Twitter, Amazon's official help account wrote : \"Please don't share your order/account/personal details in such websites.\"\n\nConsumers are especially vulnerable when shopping on smartphones.\n\nMobile browsers have a much shorter address field, and consumers may not see the full URL on their phone. This makes it harder to spot a scam.\n\nAccording to marketing firm Criteo , over 40% of all sales in November and December 2017 were made on mobile phones, and the trend is only expected to grow.\n\nSteve Ginty, senior product manager at RiskIQ, says to check that the website has a valid \"HTTPS\" connection with a lock symbol, not \"HTTP,\" which is vulnerable to attacks.\n\nUsers should also be careful when downloading apps. Bogus holiday deal apps made by scammers can fool users into typing in their credit card information, while other apps feature malware that can steal personal data or lock a smartphone until the user pays a ransom fee.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ's recent report, 5.5% out of the 4,324 Black Friday-related apps on global app stores are deemed malicious and unsafe, and 4.6% of Cyber Monday apps are malicious. The firm recommends scrutinizing who developed the app, and only downloading apps from official app stores like Apple and Google.\n\nYair Levy, a cybersecutity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University, says to only shop with retailers you trust.\n\n\"Don't try to look for offers that are too good to be true. At the end of the day, that's what they are,\" he said.\n\nLevy also suggests having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track purchases and identify fraudulent activity.\n\nShoppers should be wary of email deals, too. Phishing emails can look similar to those sent by top retailers, and consumers should ignore or delete these emails, no matter how good a deal seems. Cybersecurity company BullGuard says the aim of these fraudsters is to get consumers to click on a link within the email, and enter their personal information.\n\nSome experts anticipate more scam activity this holiday season than last year.\n\n\"Every year we see this growing significantly,\" said Levy. \"Why? Because it becomes more successful. Every year more people shop online.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "En lugar de comediante, la Asociaci\u00f3n de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca tendr\u00e1 a un historiador como orador", "description": "La cena anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca sol\u00eda tener a un comediante como orador.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nBut I also worried about what the night's headliner, a professional comedian, would say about us. Over the last six decades some of America's best-known entertainers -- Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Paula Poundstone, Jay Leno, Wanda Sykes, and many more -- have taken the mic just steps from the commander in chief. I can't I say I looked forward to President Obama (and his team) being made fun of in public. Neither, I imagine, did President Nixon's staff, or President Reagan's, or President Bush's. But if you're the president, getting roasted once a year comes with the territory. It's tradition.\n\nOr at least, it was tradition. On Monday, after complaints from the Trump administration, the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) announced that its headliner for April 27, 2019, will be historian Ron Chernow.\n\nChernow's biographies are many things: well written; best-selling; hefty enough to cause serious injury even in paperback. But funny? No. Subversive? Not unless you're a long-dead detractor of Ulysses S. Grant. After years of pushing the envelope, the WHCA has decided to play it safe.\n\nIt's a terrible choice. Not for comedy, which is doing just fine, but for democracy, which is in trouble. The Correspondents' Dinner bills itself as a celebration of the First Amendment. But the 2019 dinner is shaping up to be a capitulation -- a surrender to a president's unprecedented attack on the free press.\n\nLet's get a few things straight. First, the decision to not invite a comedian didn't come because President Trump skipped the dinner in 2017. I was in the room that year when the commander in chief and his staff were no-shows. The WHCA surely would have preferred that the President show up. But when he didn't, they invited comedian Hasan Minhaj anyway, and it went well enough that they extended a similar invitation to Michelle Wolf the following year.\n\nWhich brings us to a second important point: While the White House didn't like Wolf's 2018 performance, the \"outrage\" that followed wasn't genuine. After all, President Trump has mocked a disabled reporter. He once joked that a woman was too ugly for him to sexually assault. If you work for someone like that, there's just no way you can credibly claim to be offended by something, Wolf said.\n\nAnd to claim that these jabs were only made at the expense of Republicans would be to call on a revisionist version of comedic history. Those in the press surely remember Joel McHale joking about Nancy Pelosi getting plastic surgery in 2014, or Larry Wilmore going after Don Lemon's journalistic abilities two years later. There was nothing fundamentally new about Wolf's tone. What was new was the Trump White House's response.\n\nThat shouldn't surprise anyone. More than any past president, Democratic or Republican, Trump is seemingly terrified by the idea of being publicly disrespected -- especially by those he holds in low regard. He loses his temper when African-American women journalists ask him tough questions. (Most recently he snapped at CNN reporter Abby Phillips when she asked him about the Mueller investigation, calling her question \"stupid.\") His administration tried to pull CNN correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass because of his alleged lack of \"decorum.\" He's live-tweeted his criticism of Alec Baldwin's impression of him on SNL.\n\nHard-hitting questions from journalists are different than hard-hitting jokes from comedians. But they both require the same bedrock freedom: the freedom to express oneself, even (and perhaps especially) when it makes powerful people uncomfortable.\n\nThat's why the WHCA's decision to nix a comedian next year is so disastrous. Whether intentional or not, it sends the message that the Correspondents' Association is only committed to protecting free speech if it doesn't make those in power uneasy. By treating an obviously bad-faith controversy as legitimate, the WHCA has given the White House incentive to manufacture even more bad-faith controversies going forward. And in abandoning core values in response to President Trump's unfair attacks, they've invited even more unfair attacks in the months and years ahead.\n\nI don't agree with Wolf when she says that the media is \"complicit\" in the President's unprecedented attacks on democracy. In my experience, the WHCA and its members are very good at their jobs and take their roles quite seriously. They're trying to make the best choices in a political environment that offers few good ones.\n\nStill, this was a bad mistake, and the WHCA needs to start fixing it right away. It's too late to disinvite Mr. Chernow and replace him with a comedian, but how about bringing in some extra special guests who are truly champions of the First Amendment -- local and national investigative journalists whose reporting has held powerful people to account over the past year?\n\nMeanwhile, reporters and editors have to think hard about how they're going to cover a president who attacks the press with unprecedented frequency. Are they willing to insist on accuracy, even if sometimes means giving up access? Will they allow their coverage to be manipulated by those in power, or will they exercise their unbiased judgment without bowing to political pressure? The independence the WHCA frequently trumpets won't be on display at the 2019 Correspondents' Dinner -- but it's not too late for the other 364 days of the year.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFinally, those of us who aren't reporters, but who care about truth in a world of alternative facts, need to accept something. The White House press corps, while well-intentioned, has not yet figured out how to adapt to a president who lies regularly and truly does not care about freedom of the press.\n\nWe should be rooting for White House reporters to hold our leaders accountable. Democracy will be much better off if they succeed. But if they come up short, there are local papers, investigative journalists, and emerging digital outlets that are stepping up. We should be supporting them, too. Because the best way to defend the First Amendment isn't just to celebrate it; it's to exercise it.\n\nOn that note, Washington's been long overdue for a political comedy festival. I hear there's not much happening the night of April 27."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Paula Bravo Medina", "title": "#FacebookDown: Reportan ca\u00edda de la red social a nivel mundial", "description": "\u00bfNo te funciona Facebook?

Sin embargo, el almirante retirado no asumi\u00f3 ninguna posici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, en las que compitieron Clinton y Trump.\n\nMcRaven sirvi\u00f3 en el Ej\u00e9rcito de EE.UU. cuando el presidente Barack Obama estaba en el cargo, lo que lo har\u00eda tan \u201cpartidario\u201d del expresidente como cualquier otro que hoy \u201crespalde\u201d a Trump solo por vestir el uniforme.\n\nTras la entrevista de Trump en Fox, McRaven le aclar\u00f3 a CNN: \u201cNo apoy\u00e9 a Hillary Clinton ni ninguna otra persona. Soy fan\u00e1tico del presidente Obama y del presidente George W. Bush, para quienes trabaj\u00e9\u201d.\n\nEl crimen de McRaven, en lo que respecta a Trump, es haber defendido p\u00fablicamente al exdirector de la CIA, John Brennan, en agosto pasado, cuando el presidente revoc\u00f3 la autorizaci\u00f3n de seguridad del funcionario de inteligencia por criticarlo.\n\nMcRaven tambi\u00e9n ha defendido a la prensa, de la que Trump se burla usualmente calific\u00e1ndola como \u201cel enemigo del pueblo\u201d. Durante un discurso en Texas el a\u00f1o pasado, McRaven sostuvo: \u201cEste drama puede ser la mayor amenaza para la democracia que he visto en mi vida\u201d.\n\nEn la entrevista de este domingo, Trump continu\u00f3 con sus afirmaciones falsas. Seg\u00fan \u00e9l, Bin Laden estaba \u201cviviendo en Pakist\u00e1n, justo al lado de la academia militar, todos en Pakist\u00e1n sab\u00edan que \u00e9l estaba all\u00ed\u201d.\n\nUna declaraci\u00f3n que es un completo disparate. Cuando estaba investigando para un libro sobre la persecuci\u00f3n a Bin Laden, habl\u00e9 con decenas de funcionarios clave del Gobierno, de inteligencia y del Ej\u00e9rcito involucrados en la operaci\u00f3n y todos aseguraron que los pakistan\u00edes no ten\u00edan ni idea de que el l\u00edder de al Qaeda estaba viviendo en la ciudad de Abbottabad, donde fue encontrado.\n\nDurante la noche de la operaci\u00f3n contra Bin Laden, los oficiales estadounidenses espiaron las comunicaciones de los principales funcionarios paquistan\u00edes, quienes estaban completamente sorprendidos por la noticia de que Bin Laden viv\u00eda en Abbottabad.\n\nSin embargo, Trump dijo en la entrevista de este domingo: \u201c\u00bfNo habr\u00eda sido mejor si atrapamos a Osama bin Laden mucho antes?\u201d. Sus palabras representan una espantosa calumnia contra las decenas de hombres y mujeres en la CIA que dedicaron toda su carrera a encontrar a Bin Laden antes y despu\u00e9s del 11 de septiembre.\n\nEl hecho es que encontrar a Osama bin Laden tom\u00f3 una d\u00e9cada despu\u00e9s de los ataques en Nueva York porque \u00e9l no usaba ninguna forma de comunicaci\u00f3n electr\u00f3nica. Por el contrario, depend\u00eda de los mensajes entregados a mano por sus mensajeros de confianza. Como resultado, incluso los altos l\u00edderes de al Qaeda desconoc\u00edan d\u00f3nde se escond\u00eda.\n\nEl tema de la b\u00fasqueda de Bin Laden puede ser algo irritante para Trump porque la cuenta regresiva final para la operaci\u00f3n ocurri\u00f3 durante la Cena de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca en 2011, cuando Obama critic\u00f3 sin piedad a Trump por su afici\u00f3n a difundir teor\u00edas de conspiraci\u00f3n, tales como la llamada conspiraci\u00f3n del nacimiento del expresidente, que afirmaba que Obama no era un ciudadano del pa\u00eds.\n\nCuando Obama tom\u00f3 un receso del ensayo de su discurso para la Cena de Corresponsales, llam\u00f3 a McRaven para un chequeo del estado final sobre la operaci\u00f3n.\n\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 piensas de la inteligencia?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 Obama. La inteligencia de que Bin Laden viv\u00eda en Abbottabad fue completamente circunstancial.\n\n\u201cBueno, si \u00e9l est\u00e1 all\u00ed, vamos a atraparlo. Si no lo est\u00e1, no lo lograremos\u201d, respondi\u00f3 McRaven.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Exactamente! Es un 50-50\u201d, replic\u00f3 Obama, de acuerdo con el informe de mi libro sobre la b\u00fasqueda de Bin Laden.\n\nEl entonces presidente concluy\u00f3 la llamada diciendo: \u201cNo podr\u00eda confiar m\u00e1s en ti de que lo que lo hago. Buena fortuna para ti y tus fuerzas. Por favor, transm\u00edteles mi agradecimiento personal por su servicio y el mensaje de que personalmente seguir\u00e9 esta misi\u00f3n muy de cerca\u201d.\n\nLa operaci\u00f3n contra Bin Laden fue, por supuesto, un \u00e9xito. No solo fue asesinado el l\u00edder de al Qaeda, sino que tambi\u00e9n se recuperaron miles de documentos importantes sobre esta organizaci\u00f3n terrorista.

And no one wants to feel like a wet dog for long.\n\nThankfully, Dock & Bay has paved the way for all unplanned swimming activities with its compact, fun-colored microfiber towel that comes in an easy-to-tote bag and promises to dry three times faster than a cotton towel.\n\nIt's rare for a towel to create this level of excitement.\n\nA shoe without bulk\n\nHigh style without the bulk. The Nisolo x Huckberry Travel Derby is a lightweight shoe that folds flat. Courtesy Nisolo\n\nUntil now, gents have largely been missing out on the whole easily packable shoes thing. Sneaks, boots and brogues all come with their share of bulk, and not every trip calls for donning flip-flops daily.\n\nEnter the Nisolo x Huckberry Travel Derby, the footwear brand's answer to the foldable ballet flat.\n\nApart from looking good enough to wear out for aperitivo in Milan and cool enough to wear dancing on cobblestone streets in Cuba, the derby weighs less than 1 pound (three times lighter than the average shoe, according to Nisolo) because it's made with an XL Extralight sole.\n\nPlus, it folds down nearly flat, making packing a breeze. Guys will no longer be able to blame lack of suitcase space for lack of style.\n\nRelated content 15 hotels that go all-out for Christmas\n\nThe ace of adapters\n\nWhen it comes to global converters, Flight 001's 5-in-1 Universal Travel Adapter easily outdoes the others.\n\nThere's no trial and error when testing which plug is the right one or struggling when a flick of the switch doesn't release the right prongs on push-to-change chargers. No, this is a \"For Dummies\" global adapter in the best way possible.\n\nEach side of the box in which this genius converter comes is color-coded to match its corresponding piece and lists which plug works in each country or region. The fact that it comes as a puzzle just adds to its appeal.\n\nAn upgrade from the first four-piece iteration, the five-piece adds two USB ports, meaning two things can be charged at once so travelers aren't left deciding whose device is more deserving of the juice.\n\nAn eating experience to remember\n\nDealing with a traveler who's dead set on minimizing stuff? Give them an opportunity to eat on your dime instead.\n\nMore than just a meal, a gift card from Eatwith means the fortunate globetrotting giftee could soon be learning to make homemade pasta from an Italian in Rome or tasting their way through Catalan cuisine based on seasonal market ingredients in Barcelona.\n\nIt's the kind of gift that would literally be worth writing home about. Also the kind that might invite envious salivation.\n\nAn in-flight face saver\n\nWho doesn't need a facial pick-me-up after a long flight? Elemis\n\nIt's not like travelers try to look haggard post-flight, but the overwhelming majority fall victim anyway.\n\nThat's because the recirculated plane air's main function (besides providing oxygen, of course) seems to be to sap skin's precious moisture. And it's that general dehydration that serves up the haven't-slept-in-days look.\n\nElemis, however, has an answer.\n\nThe beauty brand's award-winning Superfood Facial Oil is made of highly concentrated plant-based superfoods that hydrate and nourish to give skin a glow.\n\nTravelers embarking on romantic rendezvous will be endlessly grateful when that long-awaited airport meeting goes much better than planned.\n\nRelated content 10 of the best Christmas markets in Europe\n\nA big -- but still small enough-- carry-on\n\nSometimes a carry-on isn't quite enough for a big trip, but when checked bag fees start climbing into the $100 range, it sort of has to be enough.\n\nFortunately for travelers prone to overpack, Away has stretched the boundaries of what on-board luggage can be with its Bigger Carry-On.\n\nThe suitcase can still pass the \"Does your carry-on fit in here?\" test for major international airlines, though smaller planes may require checking it.\n\nWhat's more, with a USB charging port and a removable battery pack, the carry-on eliminates grumbling when all charging stations are mobbed, without introducing cause for any additional tie-ups during TSA checks because of said battery pack.\n\nIn this case, size definitely matters.\n\nA jewelry case worth its weight in gold\n\nThis compact jewelry case from Mejuri keeps everything tangle-free. Tyler Hayward/Mejuri\n\nNo traveler has time for untying necklace knots.\n\nMejuri has easily rendered the infuriating experience outmoded with its Travel Case. Made by the jewelry brand and its enlisted experts in jewelry case making (a pretty good pairing, we'd say), the thoughtful jewelry holder has separate sections for necklaces, designated holes to secure earrings and a row for holding rings.\n\nIt's handcrafted in grain leather with an anti-tarnish suede lining and spans just 4 x 4 x 1.4 inches once closed, making it easy to tuck into anything. Bonus? There's still ample space for collecting any new jewels along the way.\n\nA lustworthy luggage tag\n\nChances are your savvy traveler has outgrown the airline-provided paper labels for their luggage.\n\nBut if they haven't yet gotten hip to the personalized luggage tag game, bring them over to the sophisticated side with a monogrammed bag tag from The Daily Edited.\n\nMade from 100% nappa leather and gold hardware, the tag instantly ups the traveler's stylish factor, and the free monogramming for up to five letters makes for an added bonus. The tag comes in black, pale pink, taupe and ink navy, with a secured place to store address info.\n\nNow people can find their luggage without pulling three of the wrong black bags off the carousel first.\n\nA history of the world, in maps\n\nTravelers and maps go together almost like peanut butter and jelly.\n\nThat's why the Smithsonian's just-released \"History of the World Map by Map\" makes a prime gift for adventurers interested in how the world became the world.\n\nTelling the story the way a cartographer would, the book charts how major global events and explorations traced patterns on land and oceans, and outlines how discoveries and conquests -- from the first human migrations to communism -- yielded the world now traveled.\n\nTravelers keen to do so will nerd out on the knowledge.\n\nThings that make you go boom\n\nBose's compact SoundLink Micro Bluetooth speaker packs a punch. Bose\n\nMusic often makes a moment, and being on the road shouldn't eliminate the option for tunes.\n\nEnsuring those tunes are heard as intended, Bose's SoundLink Micro Bluetooth speaker packs a punch with its palm-sized self, and proves camping, beaching and wandering are all perfectly good opportunities to kick up the good vibes with music.\n\nIt's waterproof and comes with a tear-resistant silicone strap, so it can easily go where the traveler does.\n\nThe custom-designed transducer in this speaker gives it a much bigger, bolder sound than its portable speaker counterparts.\n\nPlaying cards that do double duty\n\nLet's face it -- anything that can become a game is usually more fun. And now, thanks to Lingo, playing cards can also mean learning to say \"la cuenta, por favor\" in Spanish.\n\nTurning a full deck of cards into 54 translation essentials in selected languages, Lingo has made idle time playing Casino or Go Fish on European trains a learning opportunity.\n\nTravelers guarding their hand will also be practicing how to say \"enchant\u00e9\" to the cutie they plan to meet in Paris.\n\nOmni-power in miniature\n\nSecond to unwrapping a trip itself in a nicely packaged box with a bow, the ability to keep their multiple devices powered up might just be travelers' next greatest gift.\n\nThis tiny device saver from Anker taps PowerIQ high-speed charging technology to allow for two quick phone charges on the go. At little more than 4 inches long, the PowerCore 5000 is easy to transport and promises to come through on all-day excursions when electricity isn't readily available.\n\nAs long as adventurers in possession of this compact portable charger can remember to charge it up before heading out, they'll be in business.\n\nA practical packable backpack\n\nPocket-sized when folded into its compact carry case, the Sea to Sky Pack opens out to 20 x 11 inches. Courtesy The Pacific Northwest Company\n\nHere's one for the outdoor enthusiasts out there.\n\nPacific Northwest has drummed up a daypack backpack that can go anywhere and do anything.\n\nPocket-sized when folded into its compact carry case, the Sea to Sky Pack opens out to 20 x 11 inches and has a capacity of 24 liters. Empty, the pack weighs just 5.5 ounces -- about the same as a baseball -- making it easy to roam with and not feel weighed down.\n\nExtra-outdoorsy features such as the reflective front zipper, sternum strap and safety whistle mean this backpack will help its user get into whatever adventures they fancy.\n\nHeadphones with cool factor\n\nAnything touted as \"for the dope\" is probably worth giving.\n\nAnd any headphones created by music artist and entrepreneur will.i.am probably have a good sense of A-grade sound.\n\nThe i.am+ Buttons wireless Bluetooth earphones promise immersive sound and a perfect fit. The earphones feature machined metal disc earpieces designed to resemble vinyl records.\n\nEach set comes with small, medium and large interchangeable ear pads. The one-piece pad works for casual listening, while the two-piece ear pad shuts out ambient noise, further improving the sound quality.\n\nTravelers can \"wear their music\" the way will.i.am would.\n\nFrom $79.99 on Amazon\n\nA Nomatic for the nomadic\n\nIf ever there were a bag for a stylish secret agent, the Nomatic 40L Travel Bag would be it.\n\nFirst off, the bag can be a backpack or a duffel thanks to its innovative strap system that takes only a switch of the straps to shift. From there, separate compartments for shoes, another for socks and underwear, plus laptop and tablet compartments allow for everything to have its place.\n\nBut the carry-on size bag doesn't stop there. It has a removable laundry bag that can be hung on a door handle during the trip and repacked separately from unworn duds, a waterproof bottle pocket to eliminate the effects of spills, an RFID safe pocket and power cord management slots.\n\nFor even more extras, accessories include a vacuum bag solution for packing more and a shirt organizer for keeping shirts folded tight and wrinkle free.\n\nThey're calling it \"the most functional travel bag ever,\" and it's hard to argue.\n\nA cute answer to emergencies\n\nAptly named Pinch Provisions has packed essentials into one 3.5-inch pouch. Courtesy Pinch Provisions\n\nNo amount of planning can guarantee a perfect trip, but a smart traveler at least preps for the inevitable such as buttons popping off of dresses or scraped knees from scaling ruins.\n\nAptly named Pinch Provisions has packed the essentials for getting out of a pinch into one 3.5-inch pouch. Stocked with stain remover, a button and thread, a safety pin, bandage and earring backs, the Minimergency Kit may be the next best thing to bringing your mom along on a trip.\n\nNow in six colors of fashionable velvet, problem solving never looked so good.\n\nPrime-time projection\n\nHuddling around a tiny smartphone screen to watch something when you're on the go is so pass\u00e9. It's all about projectors now.\n\nAnd Anker's soda-can sized Nebula Capsule puts a full cinematic experience in the palm of travelers' hands. The device projects vivid picture onto surfaces up to 100 inches away for up to four hours on a single charge. The Capsule Control app allows for control directly from the phone, and the Nebula's cylindrical shape means an omnidirectional speaker for super sound.\n\nCamping tents, Airbnb ceilings and hostel rooftops can all officially be considered theaters.\n\nA lens to level-up photos\n\nMoment's Wide Lens ups the ante on smartphone photography. Courtesy Moment\n\nIf National Geographic cosigns a smartphone lens, it's likely one worth scoping out.\n\nOn NatGeo's radar for best smartphone lenses, Moment's Wide Lens has elevated the experience of capturing travel moments without the clunk of a DSLR.\n\nThe lens add-on made from cinema quality glass allows smartphones to capture 2x more picture -- more of the scene and more people for photos that deliver more when it comes to quality and clarity.\n\nThe lens works with Moment's Photo Case for the phone, which maintains alignment with minimal fuss. There's also space on the case to add a wrist strap, which makes for easy wear between shots.\n\nThis will turn ordinary travelers into savvy mobile photographers.\n\nA toiletry bag that does more\n\nIll-designed toiletry bags don't do anyone any good, so get the traveler on your list a kit with all the fixings.\n\nThis unisex one from L.L. Bean in khaki waxed canvas almost looks too nice for storing toiletries, but the nylon interior assures spills won't spoil the bag.\n\nStore smaller products in zippered pouches both in plastic and mesh, and bigger items, such as a toothbrush and case, hair brush and shampoos, in larger storage spaces where they can be kept upright.\n\nThe bag hangs for easy towel rack storage, too, and there's a removable mirror and shower caddy to further up the kit's convenience.\n\nA travel-anywhere hotspot\n\nTravel may be about disconnecting, but the wanderer should at least be able to reconnect when ready. That's where Skyroam Solis comes in.\n\nThe portable WiFi and power charging device for international travel offers internet access nearly anywhere in more than 130 countries. Once on, the hotspot automatically finds the best local signal, and its virtual SIM tech means users don't have to change their own SIM cards to connect in other countries.\n\nDay passes for $9 allow the traveler unlimited data for up to five devices and the ability to connect at their leisure, skipping days when they know they won't need it.\n\nGoodbye dodgy internet caf\u00e9s and too-high fees for shoddy connections that can't even facilitate FaceTime.\n\nNot your grandma's compression socks\n\nCompression Socks from VIM & VIGR bring style to a practical gift. Courtesy VIM & VIGR\n\nThere's something to be said about arriving at a destination with ankles the same size as they were before takeoff.\n\nFor some people, long flights are synonymous with swelling, and the compression socks usually reserved for combating that problem aren't always of the most attractive ilk.\n\nBut VIM & VIGR has changed all that. The company's compression socks come in stylish stripe patterns or argyle and could easily be mistaken for a designer sock from traditional brands. The socks apply therapeutic pressure that starts at the ankle to improve circulation, which can also help stave off fatigue.\n\nThis will do wonders for those running-to-catch-connecting-flights moments.\n\nParavel's shape-shifting carry-on\n\nThis may look like a standard carry-on, but it's actually the traveler's new and chic best friend.\n\nParavel's Stowaway, a throwback to vintage grips but with more modern materials, conveniently accommodates the traveler who loves to shop.\n\nThe classic collapsible case can be stored flat and packed into another bag, and then, when the marketplace haul needs a home, unfold it, slide the solid sides into place and fill it with loot. It's also helpful to grab and go for mini excursions within bigger trips instead of dragging everything along.\n\nCotton canvas keeps the Italian-made Stowaway light and easy to clean, and the leather trimmings keep it luxe and easy to love.

Courtesy Trtl\n\nIt may look like a cozy scarf, but it's actually what might be the most ingenious travel pillow that's yet been made.\n\nThanks to some science, some sleep experts and some ergonomic design sensibilities, Trtl has created what feels a lot like a hammock for your neck. They took an internal neck support system, wrapped it in cuddly fleece and added Velcro to make the whole thing stay comfortably in place.\n\nPlus, the pillow is smaller than the average travel pillow, so it packs small.

His arrest is causing \"significant damage\" to the reputation of Japanese corporations, he added.\n\nClosed culture\n\nExperts have linked many of the problems to poor corporate oversight and the country's cloistered business culture, pointing out that many companies are run by tight-knit cabals of executives who have worked for the same employer their entire careers.\n\n\"Japanese companies are very closed. They're like a family,\" said Parissa Haghirian, a professor in international management at Tokyo's Sophia University.\n\nThat means there is often little outside influence to bring to light behavior that is unethical or illegal, especially among senior executives.\n\n\"They've spent so long with the same people in the same firm, they kind of make up their own rules,\" Haghirian said.\n\nEmployees at Japanese firms often climb the ranks by showing loyalty and are discouraged from flagging suspicious activity or behavior, experts say. Workers can be reluctant to rock the boat and will often try to cover up mistakes rather than that report them.\n\n'Skeletons popping out'\n\nJapanese authorities are aware of these issues. The stock exchange has been prodding companies to improve oversight by bringing in external board members.\n\n\"The result was a wave of skeletons popping out of hidden drawers,\" said Martin Schulz, a senior research fellow at the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo.\n\nFactory employees work on a car assembly line at Renault-Nissan.\n\nHe said he views the steady flow of scandals as part of the process of Japan gradually cleaning up its act.\n\nNissan said it launched its internal investigation into Ghosn after a whistleblower report, suggesting the company's corporate governance may have worked as it should in this case.\n\n\"It shows that even the high and mighty are not above the law,\" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. But he cautioned that whistleblowers in Japan are often harassed into silence or not taken seriously.\n\n\"There is still a lot of rot at the core of corporate culture in Japan,\" he said.\n\nForeign leaders 'a last resort'\n\nWhat's unusual about Ghosn's arrest is a high-profile foreign executive has been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThat's a reversal of what happened at Olympus ( OCPNY ) in 2011, when the electronics firm's CEO at the time, Michael Woodford, blew the whistle on accounting fraud by Japanese colleagues.\n\nIt's rare for Japanese companies to appoint CEOs from overseas.\n\n\"Foreigners are only appointed as a last resort,\" said George Olcott, a guest professor at Keio University who has sat on the board of several big Japanese companies.\n\nGhosn is credited with executing a stunning turnaround at Nissan after he arrived in 1999 when the automaker's future was hanging in the balance.\n\nMany of Japan's recent corporate scandals have centered around managers trying to cover up mistakes. At Kobe Steel, managers falsified data to make it look as though substandard products met quality standards.\n\nThe allegations against Ghosn instead concern his pay and whether he reported all of it properly. That touches on the sensitive subject of foreign executives demanding much higher salaries in Japan than their local counterparts earn.\n\n\"There's a sense they're only there to make hay while the sun shines, and to take the money and run when things go badly,\" Olcott said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628... \u0647\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062a\u061f", "description": "\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0641\u0642 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0630\u0627\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0648\u0645\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0634 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u064a\u0629. \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u201c\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0648\u0641\u0635\u0644.\u201d", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/travel/video/2018/11/20/v68357-tr-201118-lugaimat", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/20/images/cover.jpg?itok=vXAItQ-D", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:20:10Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u062a\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0645\u0648\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0629\u060c \u0623\u0648 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0641\u0642 \u0623\u0646 \u0645\u0630\u0627\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0648\u0645\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0634 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u064a\u0629. \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0646\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u201c\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0648\u0641\u0635\u0644.\u201d\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 20 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "America travels for Thanksgiving", "description": "Millions of Americans are traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday, increasing the potential for traffic jams and long lines at the nation's airports.

Adem\u00e1s, Rep\u00fablica Dominicana es uno de los seis pa\u00edses del Caribe y Am\u00e9rica Latina que mantiene todas restricciones, sin importar las circunstancias.\n\nEl art\u00edculo 37 de la Constituci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds, que tambi\u00e9n proh\u00edbe la pena de muerte bajo todas las circunstancias, reza: \u201cEl derecho a la vida es inviolable desde la concepci\u00f3n hasta la muerte\".\n\nSin embargo, solo porque los abortos est\u00e9n prohibidos no significa que no ocurran. De hecho, el Instituto Guttmacher ha reportado que la incidencia de abortos no es menos frecuente \u2013aunque s\u00ed m\u00e1s insegura\u2013 cuando est\u00e1n restringidos. De hecho, la organizaci\u00f3n encontr\u00f3 que en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe \u2013donde el 97% de las mujeres y ni\u00f1as en edad reproductiva vive en un lugar con leyes restrictivas sobre la interrupci\u00f3n del embarazo\u2013 la tasa de abortos ha aumentado 9 puntos porcentuales entre principios de la d\u00e9cada de 1990 y 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s.\n\nEn un pa\u00eds donde el Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica y Asistencia Social reporta que casi la mitad de los embarazos son indeseados o no planeados, la falta de opciones seguras y legales para el aborto tiene consecuencias reales, revel\u00f3 el informe.\n\n\u201cLas mujeres y las ni\u00f1as en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana siempre han desafiado la prohibici\u00f3n contra el aborto, pero se han visto obligadas a arriesgar su salud y sus vidas para interrumpir clandestinamente los embarazos\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Margaret Wurth, autora del informe e investigadora principal de Derechos de la Mujer en Human Rights Watch.\n\nEllas han intentado remedios caseros para abortar, han bebido t\u00e9s especiales y se han negado alimentos o agua. Han tomado medicinas que no deben consumirse durante el embarazo, han ingerido o insertado otras p\u00edldoras para interrumpir sus embarazos y han tratado de hacerse da\u00f1o a s\u00ed mismas. Una mujer report\u00f3 haber usado un bloque de concreto para golpear su vientre.\n\n\u201cEl miedo lo impregna todo\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch entrevist\u00f3 a 167 personas para este informe. Se incluyeron 50 mujeres y ni\u00f1as que tuvieron embarazos no planeados o no deseados y docenas de otras personas, como proveedores de servicios de salud, profesionales de servicios sociales y otros funcionarios.\n\nLas mujeres con recursos que desean interrumpir sus embarazos tienen la opci\u00f3n de viajar fuera del pa\u00eds o, con la ayuda de sus conexiones, organizar abortos a trav\u00e9s de proveedores seguros y clandestinos. Pero, aquellas que son pobres o viven en zonas rurales del pa\u00eds no tienen estas alternativas, indic\u00f3 Wurth. Y solo les quedan dos opciones: tener beb\u00e9s que no quieren o arregl\u00e1rselas ellas mismas para interrumpir sus embarazos. Las ni\u00f1as adolescentes, que suelen carecer de acceso a la anticoncepci\u00f3n y la informaci\u00f3n, son especialmente vulnerables, se\u00f1al\u00f3 la autora.\n\nY a esa realidad hay que sumarle el art\u00edculo 317 del C\u00f3digo Penal de Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, que amenaza con penas de prisi\u00f3n cuando se trata del aborto. Las mujeres y las ni\u00f1as que se autoinducen abortos o dan su consentimiento para interrumpir sus embarazos, as\u00ed como los proveedores m\u00e9dicos que lo hacen clandestinamente, corren el riesgo de pasar tiempo en la c\u00e1rcel.\n\nAhora, en la pr\u00e1ctica, aunque los abortos son ilegales incluso para salvar la vida de una mujer o de una ni\u00f1a, la ONU informa que \u201clos principios generales de la legislaci\u00f3n penal permiten que se realicen abortos por esta raz\u00f3n en las condiciones de necesidad\".\n\nPero esta excepci\u00f3n no ayuda a todas las mujeres o ni\u00f1as que sientan la necesidad un aborto.\n\nLos juicios y detenciones por este motivo son inusuales, pero el temor a ambos persiste, lo que por lo general impide que las personas busquen u ofrezcan ayuda, explic\u00f3 Wurth. Es m\u00e1s, las mujeres que han tenido abortos espont\u00e1neos, destac\u00f3 la autora, admiten haber sentido miedo de ingresar a un hospitales porque podr\u00edan ser acusadas falsamente de haberse inducido un aborto.\n\n\u201cLas penas crean un miedo que lo impregna todo\u201d, dijo Wurth. Y eso significa que las mujeres y las ni\u00f1as creen que \u201cir al hospital y decir \u2018tuve un aborto\u2019 equivale a \u2018voy a ir a la c\u00e1rcel\u2019\u201d.\n\nEl resultado es que complicaciones como un sangrado intenso o dolores no son atendidas y en el peor de los casos llevan a la muerte. Un \u00fatero perforado o tejidos que quedan dentro de \u00e9l y conducen a la sepsis son dos ejemplos de lo que puede salir terriblemente mal.\n\nIncluso con el miedo a ser detenidas, \u201cse estima que hay 25.000 hospitalizaciones por aborto y aborto espont\u00e1neo cada a\u00f1o en el sistema de salud, muchas son mujeres que necesitan atenci\u00f3n tras un aborto clandestino\u201d, destac\u00f3 el reporte.\n\nEsta cifra provino del doctor Jos\u00e9 Mord\u00e1n, jefe del Departamento de Salud Familiar en el Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica, a trav\u00e9s de un un correo electr\u00f3nico que envi\u00f3 este mes a Human Rights Watch, indic\u00f3 el informe. El funcionario tambi\u00e9n dijo que por lo menos el 8% de las muertes maternas en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana se deben a abortos ilegales o abortos involuntarios.\n\nAlgunas de las ni\u00f1as y mujeres que buscaron ayuda m\u00e9dica tras presentar complicaciones hablaron con Human Rights Watch sobre c\u00f3mo fueron maltratadas y agredidas por prestadores de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. Hablaron de insultos, de que se les negaron medicamentos para el dolor e incluso las sometieron a procedimientos quir\u00fargicos sin anestesia.\n\nPero en el pa\u00eds tambi\u00e9n hay personas que ponen a sus pacientes sobre las leyes, seg\u00fan el informe. \u201cA veces tienes las manos atadas. No sabes qu\u00e9 hacer. Tienes la ley que te dice que no puedes [hacer un aborto]\u201d, expres\u00f3 un m\u00e9dico a investigadores de Human Rights Watch. \u201cPero no funciona as\u00ed... Mi trabajo es preservar la vida de la mujer. Si tengo que violar la ley, lo har\u00e9\u201d, complet\u00f3.\n\nUn punto de partida\n\nUna encuesta en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, realizada por una organizaci\u00f3n de investigaci\u00f3n, muestra que el 79% de los encuestados cree que el aborto debe ser despenalizado en ciertos casos. Y los manifestantes, exigiendo el cambio, salieron a las calles en julio.\n\nUna coalici\u00f3n de grupos, ginecobstetras, el Ministerio de Salud e incluso el presidente Danilo Medina apoyan la legalizaci\u00f3n del aborto en tres circunstancias, sostuvo Wurth: cuando la vida de una mujer o ni\u00f1a est\u00e1 en peligro, cuando el embarazo es resultado de una violaci\u00f3n o incesto, y cuando el embarazo es inviable y el feto no sobrevivir\u00e1 fuera del \u00fatero.\n\nMedina ha cuestionado el C\u00f3digo Penal varias veces, impulsando la despenalizaci\u00f3n en estas tres circunstancias. En una carta al presidente del Senado, enviada de 2016, y que Human Rights Watch obtuvo, el mandatario calific\u00f3 estas excepciones de \u201ccircunstancias extremas, terribles, pero que ocurren en la vida cotidiana, y que nosotros, como representantes leg\u00edtimos del pueblo, debemos responder de acuerdo con la Constituci\u00f3n y con nuestros valores\u201d.\n\nSin embargo, hasta ahora, las leyes permanecen sin cambios. Depende del Congreso Nacional promulgar este tipo de reforma y \u200b\u200bWurth espera que as\u00ed sea. Otros pa\u00edses, como Irlanda, este a\u00f1o, y Chile, el a\u00f1o pasado, han atenuado las restricciones al aborto. Y el Instituto Guttmacher informa que 27 pa\u00edses, entre 2000 y 2017, reformaron sus leyes para aumentar el acceso legal al aborto.\n\n\u201cSer\u00eda un punto de partida\u201d, dijo Wurth. \"No hay lugar en la democracia moderna para una prohibici\u00f3n del aborto\u201d."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Scaramucci on Ivanka emails: It's hypocritical", "description": "Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci reacts to news that Ivanka Trump used her personal email for official White House business.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/20/anthony-scaramucci-ivanka-trump-personal-email-newday-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120074103-anthony-scaramucci-newday-11-20-2018-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:00:25Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Then line the box with a folded kitchen towel to keep the pie from sliding around.\n\n\"Once you lay the pie in the box, wedge a couple of ice packs -- wrapped in plastic bags, to absorb moisture -- around the pie to keep it in place and cool while you're in transit,\" she says. \"Most pumpkin pies are fine at room temperature but the cooler your pie is, the firmer and more stable your filling will be while you're on the road.\n\n\"You'll have to carry the box of pie through security, and once on the plane, store it beneath the seat in front of you -- the pie is likely to get flattened by someone else's bag if you put it in the overhead compartment.\"\n\nRelated content How to tell family you're staying at a hotel for the holidays\n\nOur Thanksgiving guide to flying\n\nCheck your flight status.

I'm going to come back!\n\n\"By the way,\" she finished. \"Dallara (car manufacturer) built a very good chassis.\"\n\n'No fear of paralysis'\n\nVan Amersfoort Racing team principal Frits van Amersfoort has told the BBC that \"everything is working and everything is in order\" following the procedure.\n\n\"Paralysis was the main fear,\" he explained. \"That's why the operation had to be done quite quickly because there was a danger it [her spinal cord] could be damaged.\n\n\"We are extremely happy that she is now recovering and that everything went extremely well. There's no fear of paralysis whatsoever.\"\n\nPhotos: F1's most signifcant accidents Fernando Alonso's spectacular crash at Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix reignited the debate around driver safety, specifically the new \"halo.\" Built around the cockpit to protect drivers from debris, it appeared to come to the rescue of Charles Leclerc as Alonso's airborne car bounced off it and over him. Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents It was the second serious incident Alonso has been involved in in as many years, although his crash at the 2016 was arguably worse. After colliding with Esteban Gutierrez, Alonso's car hit the wall at 200mph, flipping through the air before coming to rest upside down. \"I'm lucky to be here and thankful to be here,\" Alonso said after the crash. Hide Caption 2 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, San Marino 1994 \u2013 Ayrton Senna's death during the 1994 San Marino GP, the day after fellow driver Roland Ratzenberger was killed in qualifying, shocked the world. A three-time world champion, the Brazilian is still regarded as one of the greatest drivers ever. Senna's death resulted in widespread changes, including limiting engine size and power and raised cockpits sides to offer drivers more protection. Suspension also changed to prevent wheels from becoming disconnected from the front wing. Hide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Jules Bianchi, Suzuka 2014 \u2013 Jules Bianchi's death in 2015 -- nine months after his crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix -- was the first in Formula One since Senna's. On a sodden Suzuka track, Bianchi lost control of his car and smashed into a recovery vehicle dealing with an earlier crash involving driver Adrian Sutil. As a result of the incident, F1 changed regulations for drainage on tracks and how vehicles would respond to crashes. Hide Caption 4 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Niki Lauda, N\u00fcrburgring 1976 \u2013 Three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda suffered extensive burns to his head and inhaled toxic fumes that damaged his lungs following a crash at N\u00fcrburgring in 1976. The incident took place at a point on the 22.8 km circuit that was almost impossible to access and Lauda had to be pulled from the wreckage by four fellow drivers. After the crash, the N\u00fcrburgring was removed from the F1 calendar for the following season. Hide Caption 5 of 6 Photos: F1's most signifcant accidents Thirteen drivers, Spa-Francorchamps 1998 \u2013 If the first corner in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix seemed hectic, it pales in comparison to that of the 1998 edition. In yet another Spa deluge and with the drivers barely visible on TV through the rain, 13 drivers spun out in the opening seconds. The race restarted more than an hour later and featured 18 of the 22 drivers as teams were then allowed spare cars, a rule that has since been abolished. Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nDespite the terrifying incident, Van Amersfoort said he was \"quite sure\" Floersch would return to racing \"after some time.\"\n\n\"Luckily enough winter is now beginning so she will have time to recover and I am quite sure that she will be back.\n\n\"That's what the racing blood always does -- coming back because this is the sport we all love.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Asylum seekers describe journey to US", "description": "CNN's Gary Tuchman speaks with immigrants waiting for a decision on their fate after having crossed the US border seeking asylum.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/06/20/asylum-seekers-immigrants-us-border-tuchman-dnt-ac.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180619221818-asylum-seeker-tuchman-dnt-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:13:40Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

He is the author of \"Thinking Like a Terrorist: Insights of a Former FBI Undercover Agent\" and co-writer of the feature film \"Imperium.\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"There are old demons which are coming back to the surface,\" French President Emmanuel Macron warned during a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, reminding us that the ethnic nationalism that sparked devastating global wars in the 20th century remains a threat of potentially monstrous proportions.\n\nMany saw this cautionary statement as a rebuke to US President Donald Trump, who has embraced openly nativist policies and recently declared himself a nationalist. But Macron's remarks spoke to a larger issue of our dangerous misunderstanding of the dynamics of far-right violence.\n\nWhen white supremacists and far-right militia groups commit acts of violence in the United States, the Justice Department calls them domestic terrorists. Academic studies in 2012 and in 2017, respectively, show these groups have attacked and killed as many or more Americans than any other terrorist movements in recent years. Yet the FBI considers them a secondary threat to \"homegrown violent extremists,\" by which it generally means Muslim Americans \"inspired\" by foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\nThe truth is we don't know the full extent of the racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic far-right violence in the US because the government's hate crime statistics are based upon voluntary information. In 2017, of the 16,149 police departments that participate in hate crime reporting, only 2,040 reported hate crimes.\n\nEven without that data, there are indications of the problem's scope. Justice Department victim surveys conducted between 2004-2015 estimated there were approximately 250,000 hate crimes in the US each year. And yet the Justice Department prosecuted only 27 hate-crimes defendants in 2016. The Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan law and policy institute, published a report last month documenting the multitude of criminal statutes the Justice Department has available to investigate and prosecute far-right terrorism, but too often chooses not to as a matter of policy and practice.\n\nTreating far-right violence as a purely domestic issue deprioritizes these crimes on the national security agenda. It also ignores the international reach of militant white supremacist groups, and obscures the greater threat posed when governments become enthralled with exclusionary nationalism, which mobilizes popular support by stigmatizing groups of \"others\" -- often identified by race, religion or ethnicity -- as national enemies.\n\nFirst, many of the ideologies, philosophies and theologies that underpin the white supremacist movement in the United States did not originate in this country. American white supremacists are influenced by British Israelism, a 19th century interpretation of Christianity that cast Anglo-Saxons as the true Israelites of the Bible; ancient Norse and Icelandic religions; and German National Socialism, which gave Nazis their name, among others. These ideologies justified the horrors of colonialism, slavery, exclusionary immigration policies, racial segregation and state-sanctioned discrimination.\n\nLikewise, discriminatory policies implemented in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Jim Crow laws and exclusionary immigration practices, influenced the development of European fascism. Many prominent Americans supported the Nazis' rise to power in Germany, and many more lobbied to keep us out of the European war under the banner of the America First Committee, using a vocabulary Trump would later adopt. In a different context, the United States likewise supported the racist apartheid government of South Africa until Congress imposed sanctions in 1986.\n\nJUST WATCHED Extremist attacks on the rise in the US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Extremist attacks on the rise in the US 02:37\n\nAmerican far-right militants continue to communicate and network with like-minded groups abroad, just as they always have. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement began in Britain in the 1970s and spread around the world, remaining one of the more violent of the white supremacist subcultures -- including in the United States. More recently, after members of a California white nationalist fight club called the Rise Above Movement attacked protesters at far-right rallies in Huntington Beach, Berkeley, and Charlottesville in 2017, they left the US for a tour of Europe to celebrate Hitler's birthday and meet with fascist groups in Germany, Italy and Ukraine. Other Americans have traveled to fight in the Ukrainian civil war with the neo-Nazi-affiliated Azov Battalion.\n\nAnd the feedback loop goes both ways. White supremacist groups abroad have been influenced by American white supremacists. A Nebraska man was the leading supplier of Nazi propaganda into Germany for decades starting in the 1970s. The British man who killed a member of Parliament, Jo Cox, in 2016 was a \"longtime supporter \" of the National Alliance, an American neo-Nazi group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. And, most recently, a CNN investigation exposed links between US and South African hate groups.\n\nWe can expect these cross-border associations and the persistent levels of violence coming from these groups to continue, as they have for decades. What Macron warned about, however, is the exponentially deadlier outcomes that are produced when government leaders sanction this hatred and violence and leverage it to gain power.\n\nIn Europe, nativist and neo-fascist parties have won electoral victories exploiting anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Police and intelligence officials have been accused of inattention to, if not sympathy with, violent groups engaging in racist or nativist political violence in the streets.\n\nWe have begun to see this phenomenon in the US as well, with a series of far-right protests across the country resulting in little law enforcement intervention and few arrests, while President Trump declared there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the deadly Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" rally. White supremacists and their sympathizers are no longer in the shadows; they are running for political office.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Fomenting fear of enemy invasions and subversion and scapegoating the weakest among us won't make us a stronger nation, but a weaker one. Our leaders need to take heed to Macron's admonition that \"nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism\" -- rather than an expression of it."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "CNN Business Before the Bell - CNN", "description": "CNN CNN Business Before the Bell CNN CNN's Christine Romans has the day's top business headlines before the opening bell on Wall Street on Tuesday, November 20.

It insists arrangements relating to Gibraltar, a small British territory on the southern tip of Spain, should be discussed separately.\n\nSpain would not back the deal until the issue is clarified, Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said after discussions with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and EU ambassadors.\n\nSpain has long claimed sovereignty over Gibraltar, which has been a British territory since 1713. But Gibraltarians, who voted almost unanimously to remain in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, are fiercely loyal to Britain and have resisted Spanish claims.\n\nThe draft Brexit deal must be agreed on at an EU summit on November 25.

Ghosn todav\u00eda tiene que responder a las acusaciones.\n\nSu detenci\u00f3n ha provocado una crisis que abarca varios continentes. \u00c9l es el eje de una poderosa alianza entre Nissan, Renault y Mitsubishi, que juntos fabrican uno de cada nueve autos que se venden en el mundo.\n\nLas acusaciones contra Ghosn\n\nNissan dijo el lunes que hab\u00eda realizado una investigaci\u00f3n de cuatro meses sobre Ghosn, de 64 a\u00f1os, y otro miembro de la junta despu\u00e9s de recibir una denuncia an\u00f3nima.\n\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda descubri\u00f3 que Ghosn y otro miembro de la junta, Greg Kelly, hab\u00edan reportado menos de lo que Ghosn estaba ganando en los reportes presentados ante la bolsa de valores de Tokio.\n\nLos fiscales dicen que los dos hombres presuntamente colaboraron para reportar el ingreso de Ghosn a la baja por unos 5.000 millones de yenes (44 millones de d\u00f3lares) durante un periodo de cinco a\u00f1os que concluy\u00f3 en marzo de 2015. La pena m\u00e1xima en Jap\u00f3n por presentar un reporte financiero falso es de hasta 10 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n y una multa de 10 millones de yenes (89.000 d\u00f3lares).\n\nNissan dijo que tambi\u00e9n hab\u00eda descubierto \"varios actos m\u00e1s de conducta inapropiada significativos\", incluyendo el uso personal de activos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda y la mala utilizaci\u00f3n del presupuesto de la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nCNN no ha podido contactar a Ghosn, Kelly o sus representantes en busca de comentarios sobre las acusaciones.\n\nNissan, Mitsubishi y Renault, en acci\u00f3n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de su detenci\u00f3n, todo parece indicar que Ghosn ser\u00e1 destituido de sus cargos al frente de Nissan, Mitsubishi y Renault.\n\nEl director ejecutivo de Nissan Hiroto Saikawa dijo que en la compa\u00f1\u00eda habr\u00e1 una reuni\u00f3n el lunes para destituir a Ghosn y Kelly de la junta directiva.\n\nMitsubishi dijo que puso en marcha una investigaci\u00f3n interna y que pedir\u00e1 a la junta de directivos que \"destituya pronto\" a Ghosn como presidente.\n\nRenault dijo que su junta directiva se reunir\u00e1 el martes por la noche para discutir la administraci\u00f3n de la compa\u00f1\u00eda tras el arresto de Ghosn.\n\nLas acciones de las tres compa\u00f1\u00edas se desplomaron. Renault cerr\u00f3 con p\u00e9rdidas de m\u00e1s de 8% el lunes. En Tokio, las acciones de Nissan cayeron 5,5% el martes, mientras que las de Mitsubishi cayeron 7%.\n\nAlianza en peligro\n\nGhosn es el arquitecto de una alianza estrat\u00e9gica entre las tres automotrices. La sociedad ha permitido a las compa\u00f1\u00edas competir mejor frente a potencias de la industria automotriz como Volkswagen, Toyota y General Motors.\n\nNissan, Renault y Mitsubishi est\u00e1n bien integradas. Muchos de los principales ejecutivos en la alianza le reportan a tres directores ejecutivos distintos, pero Ghosn es la pieza que une todo.\n\n\"\u00c9l era la alianza\", dijo Rebecca Lindland, analista de autos senior en Cox Automotive. \"\u00c9l era el genio creativo detr\u00e1s de todo esto y estableci\u00f3 los par\u00e1metros para administrar estas empresas muy dispares\".\n\nTras la noticia bomba de Ghosn, hay preocupaciones de que la alianza pueda terminarse. Mucho depende de si las tres compa\u00f1\u00edas pueden ponerse de acuerdo sobre c\u00f3mo manejar las acusaciones en contra de Ghosn y acordar un remplazo. Por ahora, dicen que est\u00e1n comprometidas con la alianza.\n\nLas automotrices podr\u00edan tener problemas para competir solas en caso de que se rompa la alianza. La industria automotriz est\u00e1 bajo una intensa presi\u00f3n para desarrollar autos el\u00e9ctricos y veh\u00edculos aut\u00f3nomos para el mercado masivo.\n\nEl caso especial de Francia\n\nLa detenci\u00f3n de Ghosn podr\u00eda tener un significado especial para Francia. El gobierno franc\u00e9s posee el 15% de las acciones de Renault.\n\n\"Hoy, el se\u00f1or Ghosn claramente no puede liderar la compa\u00f1\u00eda\", dijo el martes el ministro de Finanzas franc\u00e9s, Bruno Le Maire.\n\nLe Maire le dijo a la radio France Info que le pedir\u00eda a los representantes de Renault establecer un nuevo liderazgo temporal en la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nLa noticia domin\u00f3 la cobertura de los medios en el pa\u00eds. Cuatro de los principales diarios de Francia llevaba a Ghosn en sus portadas el martes con titulares como \"Icono ca\u00eddo\" y \"La ca\u00edda del emperador Carlos Ghosn\".\n\nYoko Wakatsuki, Jethro Mullen, Charles Riley, Saskya Vandoorne, Daniel Shane y Chris Isidore contribuyeron con este reporte."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Japan to host first PGA Tour event in 2019", "description": "Japan is set to host its first ever PGA Tour event after signing a six-year deal with fashion website Zozotown.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/golf/pga-tour-japan-zozo-championship-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120104226-yusaku-maezawa-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:24:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Japan is set to host its first ever PGA Tour event after signing a six-year deal with fashion website Zozotown.\n\n\"I think this will be the first PGA Tour sponsor that is going to the moon,\" said the company's billionaire founder Yusaku Maezawa, who in September announced he was the first customer to pay for a trip around the moon on Elon Musk's SpaceX craft.\n\nThe business side of golf\n\nThe business side of golf 22:30\n\nThe business side of golf\n\n\"I haven't decided who I will take to the moon with me yet,\" he said. \"I would like to talk to many people with an open mind.\"\n\nIt seems fitting, then, for Maezawa to describe the coup as a \"moonshot\" for Japanese golf, adding that he was \"extremely honored\" to be approached by the PGA Tour.\n\n\"When the PGA first approached us to discuss about this tournament, I was surprised because the PGA Tour has a long history and we are a newer company,\" Maezawa explained.\n\n\"[We] would like to make it as exciting of an event as possible.\"\n\n'A dream'\n\nThe Zozo Championship will make its debut as a FedEx Cup event in the 2019-20 season with a total prize purse of $9.75 million.\n\nTo be played between October 24 and 27 at Narashino Country Club in Chiba, the tournament will replace Malaysia's CIMB Classic on the PGA Tour's Asian swing.\n\nThe 78-strong field will consist of 60 PGA Tour professionals, seven players from the Japan Golf Tour Organization, the top three from the 2019 Bridgestone Invitational and eight sponsor exemptions.\n\nJapan's top-ranked professional golfer, five-time PGA Tour winner Hideki Matsuyama, said he hoped to join Maezawa on his new adventures, both on earth and in space.\n\n\"I don't know whether he will ask me, but I would love to go (to the moon),\" Matsuyama joked.\n\n\"There's a lot of differences between the JGTO and PGA,\" he added. \"So hopefully, the fans will get to enjoy them through their own eyes, not through television.\"\n\nPhotos: The best photos from Le Golf National Alex Noren of Europe celebrates with his teammates after winning his match on the 18th green.

But as the appetite for ocean travel rapidly grows, there's been growing concern about its environmental impact.\n\nFish scraps might be part of the solution, according to a Norwegian cruise operator.\n\nHurtigruten , known for its trips through Norway's fjords and to the Arctic, will power a fleet of ships partly through liquified biogas -- which is produced as dead fish and other organic waste decompose, the company said in a press release.\n\nHigh-sulfur fuel favored by the shipping industry has been found to produce sulfur oxides, a contributor to the acidification of seas and rain. Concern over the issue led to the International Maritime Organization to set a 0.5% sulfur limit on marine fuel by 2020.\n\n2017 report by German environmental association Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) found that a midsize cruise ship can use well over 100 tons of fuel a day, producing as much particulate as a million cars.\n\nEmission free goal\n\nThe 125-year-old Norwegian company, which operates 17 ships, plans on at least six of its ships to be operating on a combination of biogas, liquified natural gas and large battery packs by 2021.\n\n\"While competitors are running on cheap, polluting heavy fuel oil, our ships will literally be powered by nature,\" Hurtigruten Chief Executive Officer Daniel Skjeldam said in a statement.\n\nRelated content 15 biggest cruise ships in the world\n\n\"Biogas is the greenest fuel in shipping and will be a huge advantage for the environment. We would love other cruise companies to follow,\" he added.\n\nThe company is taking other steps to boost its green credentials: it has ordered three new hybrid-powered cruise liners, has banned single-use plastics from all its ships and plans on becoming carbon neutral."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "s.zaghloul", "title": "\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u0627:

vaccination were a contributing factor, according to the Buncombe County Health Department, which has been monitoring the situation since the end of October.\n\nThe school is closed for Thanksgiving break and could not be reached for comment.\n\nThough North Carolina requires vaccination for all children attending schools, the state permits both medical and religious exemptions. Still, vaccination rates in the state outperformed national figures in 2013 and 2014, according to publicly available information.\n\nDr. Jennifer Mullendore, the Buncombe County medical director, said that last year, the Asheville Waldorf kindergarten class had the highest percentage of religious exemptions in the county and among the highest in the state. The state as a whole sees about 1.2% religious exemptions among children enrolled in kindergarten, she said.\n\nMullendore said the figures from last year are the latest because data has not been gathered and analyzed for the current school year.\n\nIsolation and quarantine\n\nTo monitor the situation at Asheville Waldorf, the health department has requested that the school continue to send it information about any new cases, she said. Meanwhile, the school is requiring anyone who has the disease to stay home, while classmates of someone contagious (though not yet sick) must remain at home for 21 days.\n\n\"The reason for that is it can take 21 days for the time somebody is exposed to chickenpox for them to actually develop the signs and symptoms of chickenpox,\" Mullendore said. \"We don't want to have to keep those kids at home. If the child gets one dose of the chickenpox vaccine, they can return to school immediately.\"\n\nChildren whose parents provide evidence of immunity, such as blood work or a doctor's statement, can also return to school, she said.\n\nThis 21-day quarantine is \"our last resort in terms of containing and stopping the spread of the illness so that we don't see more cases and so nobody ends up with a complication,\" Mullendore said. No complications and no hospitalizations have been reported, she added.\n\n\"We can't predict who is going to end up with complications,\" she said. \"There are case reports of previously healthy children ending up in hospital because of chickenpox -- or dying because of chickenpox.\"\n\nMost parents do not hesitate to vaccinate\n\n\"The vaccine for chickenpox and all vaccines out there are safe and effective,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPew survey that found Most Americans agree that vaccines are safe for healthy children.\n\nAnother Pew Research Center survey in 2017 showed that a solid majority of Americans, 88%, believe that the benefits of vaccinating their children against measles, mumps and rubella outweigh the risks. By contrast, 10% believe that the risks of the MMR vaccine, specifically, outweigh the benefits.\n\nWhile the majority of all major religious groups say the MMR vaccine should be required for healthy schoolchildren, white evangelical Protestants tend to express less support for requiring the MMR vaccine. People who have no religious affiliation similarly express less support for the vaccine, according to Pew.\n\nRecently, an outbreak of measles was reported in New York among the orthodox Jewish community, with origins in Israel.\n\nMullendore said that what's happening at Asheville Waldorf \"demonstrates what happens when we have a population that is not immunized, that has not gotten the vaccine. It offers an opportunity for the infection to get into that community and spread easily.\n\n\"I have vaccinated my child,\" she noted."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Sherisse Pham, CNN Business", "title": "JD.com CEO shifts away from core business after US arrest", "description": "Chinese billionaire Richard Liu is pivoting away from JD.com's core business, months after he was arrested in the United States on suspicion of rape.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/tech/jd-earnings-richard-liu/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180904092315-01-richard-liu-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:10:39Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) One of China's top tech billionaires is shifting away from managing his company's core business, a few months after being arrested in the United States on suspicion of rape.\n\nRichard Liu, the founder and chief executive of Chinese e-commerce company JD.com, said he will have a new focus going forward, handing responsibility for the company's main business to other executives.\n\n\"For me, personally, I will focus more on new businesses,\" Liu said on an earnings call this week. \"For mature businesses, our team can handle that.\"\n\nThe businessman, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, was arrested in Minneapolis in late August following a rape allegation, police said .

But if you're kicking off the holiday season with your health in mind, there are a few smart switches you can make on Turkey Day that will help boost your nutrition and lighten your calorie load.\n\nBelow are some savvy substitutions that can help you save nearly 1,200 calories for the entire meal.\n\nRed wine instead of White Russian\n\nCalories in cocktails can add up quickly, thanks to sugary mixers, tonic, juice, soda and syrups. What's more, depending on the pour, mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol (that is, more than 1.5 ounces of vodka or gin), which also boosts calories.\n\nAn 8-ounce White Russian can top 500 calories, thanks to Kahl\u00faa, vodka and heavy cream, but a 5-ounce glass of red wine has about 125 calories, or about a quarter of the amount. If you prefer the higher-calorie cocktails, limit yourself to one.\n\nCarrots and hummus instead of cheese and crackers\n\nA couple of multigrain crackers with cheddar cheese has 134 calories -- not calorie overload, but compare that with two baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus, which has only 62 calories, plus 2 grams of fiber.\n\nYou can have double the portion for fewer calories if you choose crudit\u00e9 over cheese. If you prefer dips to hummus, try substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream to shave calories and boost protein.\n\nDark-meat turkey without skin instead of with skin\n\nTruth be told, dark-meat turkey is delicious and is typically juicier and more flavorful than white meat. Plus, dark meat delivers more zinc and iron than white meat.\n\nThere's no need to forgo dark meat this Thanksgiving. But skip the skin to save some calories and saturated fat. Dark meat with skin is 175 calories per 3-ounce serving, and without skin is 147 calories. For portion control, keep your serving to 3 ounces, which is similar in size to a deck of cards or a computer mouse.\n\nVegan mushroom gravy instead of traditional gravy\n\nTurkey may not seem like \"turkey\" without gravy, as the sauce gives a flavor upgrade to any dish. But making your gravy with mushrooms instead of meat drippings. can give your bird a savory \"umami\" flavor while saving a significant amount of calories and fat.\n\nTraditional gravy is 63 calories per quarter-cup, and vegan mushroom gravy is only 35 calories. And here's another bonus to mushroom gravy: Because it is meatless, it's suitable for vegan guests. Whatever gravy you choose, try using a tablespoon when serving yourself, instead of pouring from a gravy boat, to help control your portion size.\n\nWhole-grain stuffing with kale instead of traditional stuffing\n\nStuffing is delicious, but using white bread as an ingredient is a missed nutritional opportunity, as it doesn't offer the fiber and vitamins that whole-grain bread does. Try a stuffing made with whole wheat bread, oats or quinoa to boost the nutrients.\n\nThe New York Times' whole-grain stuffing with kale, figs, dates and hazelnuts has 7 grams of fiber and about 60 fewer calories per serving than a traditional stuffing. Traditional stuffing is about 420 calories per cup, while whole-grain stuffing with kale and dried fruit is 357 calories.\n\nBaked sweet potato instead of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows\n\nSweet potatoes are nutritious and delicious and can help you achieve smooth, glowing skin, as they are loaded with vitamin A. However, when you add brown sugar, butter and marshmallows, you're pretty much eating dessert.\n\nOne serving of candied sweet potato casserole with marshmallows packs 405 calories, 19 grams of fat and 32 grams of sugar. A whole baked sweet potato has only 130 calories and only 9 grams of natural sugar. You can even add some toasted marshmallows for an extra 30 calories.\n\nLow-fat green bean casserole instead of traditional green bean casserole\n\nTraditional green bean casserole is a Thanksgiving staple that is about 24 calories per cup, but the healthier eatingwell.com version with breadcrumbs instead of French fried onions has only 188 calories per cup.\n\nIf you like the traditional green bean casserole recipe, you can use fresher, lower-fat ingredients that will improve the healthfulness of the dish and the flavor. Simply substitute the French fried onions with fresh onions (you can bake them after soaking them in buttermilk and coating with breadcrumbs and flour), and use low-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular version. You can also substitute low-fat milk (like 1%) for whole milk, which saves calories and saturated fat.\n\nPumpkin pie instead of pecan pie\n\nThere's no need to skip dessert, but by choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie, you can save over 200 calories. Pecan pie is about 541 calories per slice, and pumpkin is 323 calories. Apple pie is another lower-calorie choice compared with pecan, at 363 calories per slice. If you can't resist pecan pie (and who could blame you), take a thin slice, or go crustless and eat only the filling. And hold off on the whipped cream!\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMake all these substitutes, and your total calorie savings is 1,179.

In particular, the exit polls showed that in those three states Trump not only faced surging opposition from college-educated white women, but also suffered notable attrition among the blue-collar white women who were critical to his success there last time.\n\nThose exit poll results reinforce the evidence from the elections themselves, in which Democrats held a Senate seat and won the governorship in each state, while also gaining a net of five House seats in Pennsylvania and Michigan combined. All of those results have cemented a quick consensus among many Democratic strategists that those three states, which Trump carried by a combined 80,000 votes in 2016, represent the weakest link in his Electoral College majority.\n\n\"The quickest way to win again is to get those three states back into the Democratic fold, and I think we've already seen tremendous evidence they are ready to come,\" says Tad Devine, who helped to manage Electoral College strategy for Democratic presidential nominees from Michael Dukakis to Al Gore and served as a top adviser to Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\nSince World War II, the results of midterm elections have not consistently predicted the outcome of presidential contests two years later. Poor showings by the president's party in the midterm elections of 1958, 1966, 1974, 1978 and 2006 did foreshadow a switch in control of the White House in the next presidential election. But first-term presidents rebounded to win re-election after significant midterm losses in 1946 (Harry Truman), 1954 (Dwight Eisenhower), 1982 (Ronald Reagan), 1994 (Bill Clinton) and 2010 (Barack Obama).\n\nBut strategists in both parties believe midterm results can signal shifts in the political currents within individual states. And those changes can influence each side's calculations about the most promising path to amassing the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the White House.\n\nThe widespread Democratic gains earlier this month, especially in the House, buoyed the party's hopes of ousting Trump in two years. But they also ignited an immediate debate about whether the most promising option was to recapture the Rust Belt states that Trump flipped in 2016 or target Sun Belt states where Democrats notched clear gains in 2018, even while falling short in the governors' races in Georgia and Florida and the US Senate race in Texas.\n\nFresh insights on that question emerge in new data from the exit poll provided by Edison Research, which conducts surveys for the National Election Pool, a consortium of news organizations that includes CNN.\n\nThe Election Day exit poll asked voters whether they approved or disapproved of Trump's job performance. At CNN's request, Edison analyzed Trump's job approval in the key swing states along lines of race, gender and education.\n\nThose results pointed toward clear opportunities for Democrats in the potential 2020 Sun Belt battlegrounds. But they also left little doubt that Trump is most exposed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Those were the three states he dislodged from what I termed the \"blue wall,\" the 18 states that had voted Democratic in all six presidential elections from 1992 through 2012.\n\nA close balance in the Sun Belt\n\nIn the key Sun Belt states where exit polls were conducted this month, Trump's approval rating consistently hovered right around the critical 50% mark. That ranged from a high of 52% in Georgia and Arizona to 51% in Florida, 49% in Texas and 48% in Nevada.\n\nIn all these states, Trump demonstrated overwhelming strength among his core constituency of white men without college degrees: His approval among them, according to the exit polls, ranged from 67% in Arizona to 69% in Florida and Nevada to 76% in Texas and fully 80% in Georgia. His numbers among white women without college degrees across the Sun Belt were only slightly less imposing: Those ranged from just under 3 in 5 approval in Nevada, Arizona and Texas to two-thirds in Florida and over 4 in 5 in Georgia.\n\nAmong college-educated white men, Trump maintained imposing margins in Florida, Georgia and Texas, but they divided about in half over his performance in the Southwest battlegrounds (Arizona and Nevada).\n\nAmong college-educated white women, the pattern was similar, with one twist. Trump was competitive in Texas and Georgia (where these women split about evenly over his performance). But he faced more widespread resistance again in Arizona and Nevada, this time joined by Florida; about 3 in 5 of them disapproved in each state.\n\nAmong minorities, Trump faced disapproval ratings exceeding 60% among nonwhite voters both with and without college degrees in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, states where Hispanics dominate the minority population; in Georgia, where most minorities are African-American, Trump faced a minority disapproval rating of almost 80%. In Florida, where both groups are present, he faced disapproval from just over 3 in 5 nonwhites with degrees and fully 7 in 10 of those without, though the Republican US Senate and governor candidates showed surprising resilience with Hispanics in the state.\n\nThe narrow overall verdict on Trump's first two years suggests that all of these Sun Belt states could be competitive in 2020. But the results do raise red flags for each side. Nevada was one of the Hillary Clinton-won states Trump's camp hoped to target in 2020, but both the election results (Democrats elected a governor and senator) and the exit poll findings (with his weakness among college-educated white men and women and limited support among Hispanics) suggest that will be a very tough climb for him. And while there was no exit poll in Colorado, the Democrats' strong showing there, particularly in the white-collar Denver suburbs, sends the same message (as well as pinpointing staunchly pro-Trump Republican Sen. Cory Gardner as perhaps the GOP's most endangered incumbent in 2020).\n\nDemocrats will face a choice of resources\n\nOn the other hand, Trump's overwhelming support among non-college white men and women in Texas, Georgia and Florida underscores the challenge for Democrats of winning those states in a presidential year, when working-class whites usually turn out in higher numbers.\n\nDemocratic strategists are insistent that Florida remains a \"coin flip\" between the parties (particularly after a US Senate race decided for Republican Rick Scott by about 10,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast). But based on these patterns, the party will likely face a more intense debate than previously about how much time and money to invest in the Sunshine State.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke's sweep of Texas' metropolitan areas in his unexpectedly strong showing against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz showed Democrats a viable pathway to competing in the state. And if O'Rourke is on the ballot again in 2020 -- whether in either slot on the Democratic presidential ticket or in another Senate race, against Republican Sen. John Cornyn -- the state may look more attractive to Democrats at the presidential level.\n\n\"If he's back on the ticket, any presidential candidate is going to invest in Texas,\" predicts Austin-based Democratic consultant James Aldrete.\n\nBut if O'Rourke himself isn't the nominee or vice president, it remains unclear whether any other presidential candidate could commit to the enormous television advertising that would be required to seriously contest the state. \"If you are going to come into that with real resources, that could be worth a half-dozen other states,\" notes Devine.\n\nBeyond Florida, the Sun Belt states that emerged from the 2018 results as the most widely agreed-on targets for Democrats are likely Arizona and North Carolina. Though an exit poll was not conducted in North Carolina, the election results there showed continuing Democratic strength in suburban areas. But the results also suggest Democrats may face the same 2020 headwind as in Georgia, Texas and Florida: little erosion for Trump in the blue-collar and rural communities that powered his victory last time. Arizona may be the most promising new Sun Belt opportunity of all, with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema's US Senate win over Rep. Martha McSally providing clear evidence that white-collar suburbanites there moved away from the GOP even more than their counterparts in Texas or Georgia. Maricopa County, surrounding Phoenix, was the largest US county that Trump carried in 2016, but Sinema won it by about 60,000 votes.\n\nA new shine on the Rust Belt\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown celebrates his campaign victory at the Hyatt Regency on November 6, 2018 in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAcross the Rust Belt, with one glaring exception, the evidence from 2018 looks more consistently encouraging for Democrats. Generally, Trump's overall approval rating in the exit polls across the key Rust Belt states was slightly lower than in the Sun Belt states.\n\nIn Minnesota, the Midwestern state Republicans most hoped to flip to Trump in 2020, the results and the exit polls offer him little encouragement. Democrats won two Senate seats (including a special election) and the governorship, and the exit poll put Trump's approval at just 45%.\n\nConversely, the most daunting Rust Belt results for Democrats came in Ohio. Though Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a potential 2020 contender, won re-election, his margin was narrower than expected and Republicans comfortably held the governor's mansion. In the exit poll, 52% of Ohio voters approved of Trump's performance. And while college-educated white women tilted slightly away from him (with 52% of them disapproving), he retained very strong numbers there among non-college white men (67% approval), college-educated white men (62%) and non-college white women (59%).\n\nBut, if anything, Trump's continued Ohio strength among those groups only underscored his more precarious position with them in the other key Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I think Ohio is much more of a core red state than the other three,\" says John Brabender, a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist. \"The other ones are at their hearts blue states that will sometimes vote Republican. And it better be an awfully good year.\"\n\nIn the exit poll, Trump's approval rating among voters stood at only 44% in Michigan, 45% in Pennsylvania and 47% in Wisconsin. In each state the share of voters who strongly disapproved of his performance exceeded the share that strongly approved by at least 15 percentage points, a daunting margin.\n\nAcross the three states, key demographic groups also reacted to Trump in similar ways. Among white men without college degrees, Trump remained strong, drawing positive job marks from 70% of them in Pennsylvania, 65% in Michigan and a somewhat more equivocal 57% in Wisconsin. He remained relatively solid, though somewhat diminished, among college-educated white men as well, winning approval from nearly 3 in 5 in Wisconsin, just over half in Michigan and just under half in Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublicans lost support from Rust Belt women\n\nBut Trump showed conspicuous weakness with women across all three states. His disapproval ratings among college-educated white women reached 69% in Pennsylvania, 67% in Michigan and 64% in Wisconsin.\n\nPerhaps even more ominously, his disapproval rating in the three states among white women without college degrees spiked to between 46% and 48%, considerably more than in any other battleground state. His approval rating with them in each state stood at just 51% to 53%. That was closer to his unsteady position with those women in Democratic-leaning Minnesota (where they divided about equally over his performance), than in more reliably Republican Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nIn most places, Democrats were frustrated by their inability to recover more ground with working-class white women (56% of them voted Republican in House races, according to the exit poll). But in the three states where those women will likely matter most in 2020, they displayed clear second thoughts about Trump.\n\nBrabender says these reactions capture \"the paradox\" of Trump's style: While his iconoclastic and often belligerent language convinces many working-class voters, especially men, that he's committed to shaking up the system on their behalf, it also alienates more moderate voters, especially women. \"The paradox is that what the others see as evidence this is going to be a different type of president, among some of the more moderate voters, particularly women, they have problems with that tone,\" he says.\n\nBecause African-Americans compose the preponderance of the minority population in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Trump's approval rating among nonwhite voters is also lower there than in most of the Sun Belt states.\n\nAll these patterns loom over the upcoming Democratic presidential primary.\n\nTwo types of Democrats to challenge Trump\n\nSens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker attend the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in Hart Building on September 4, 2018.\n\nOne of the core choices Democrats will face in picking their 2020 nominee is whether to nominate a candidate best suited to mobilize younger and nonwhite voters who don't usually turn out, or one most effective at reassuring center-right whites who usually vote Republican but have recoiled from Trump on personal and cultural grounds. (The first group could include Sen. Kamala Harris of California, O'Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; the second Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg and an array of current and former governors.) That debate carries a clear geographic implication: \"Mobilization\" candidates are probably best positioned to compete in the Sun Belt, while \"reassurance\" candidates may be more effective in the Rust Belt.\n\nThe 2018 results leave both paths open to Democrats -- and indeed they indicate that Democrats must compete on both fronts, because they are not guaranteed success on either. When Trump himself is on the ballot -- and able to create contrasts, particularly around cultural and racial issues, with a Democratic nominee -- Democrats may struggle to hold the ground they regained earlier this month with working-class whites in the big Rust Belt battlegrounds.\n\nEven so, the clearest signal from this month's results may be a variation on the old dictum from the legendary Ohio State football coach, Woody Hayes. Stressing a straightforward running game over a flashier passing attack, Hayes famously declared that the best route to victory on the football field was \"three yards and a cloud of dust.\"\n\nFor all the glitter of their new Sun Belt opportunities, Democrats eyeing the cracks in Trump's armor that emerged this month in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania may likewise conclude that the surest path to success in 2020 will be \"three states and a cloud of dust.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Clare Foran and Manu Raju, CNN", "title": "Understanding the math Nancy Pelosi faces in the race for House speaker", "description": "Does Nancy Pelosi have the votes?", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-math-votes/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181107181658-pelosi-1107-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:03:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "That's the question looming over the race to determine who will be the next speaker in the new Democrat-led House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi and her allies have steadfastly insisted that she has the support to be elected speaker. But a rebellious faction of House Democrats are pressing ahead with their attempt to derail her leadership bid and are also projecting confidence that they will prevail.\n\nHouse Democrats will hold a vote the week after Thanksgiving to select their nominee for speaker by a majority vote, which Pelosi is expected to easily win.\n\nThe more complicated math will come in January when the new session of Congress arrives in Washington and the full House holds a vote on the floor for Speaker. That's when Pelosi will have a higher hurdle to clear.\n\nHow Pelosi opponents could pose a threat to getting 218 votes\n\nTo be elected speaker, a candidate needs to win a majority of members who vote for a specific person on the House floor. That amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes \"present.\"\n\nIn the new Congress, Democrats will hold at least 232 seats. But there are still three undecided House races and Democrats could pick up additional seats.\n\nIf Democrats end up with a total of 233 seats, for example, Pelosi could afford to lose up to but not more than 15 votes if she has to reach 218 -- an outright majority of the full House of Representatives.\n\nIn that scenario, the current opposition to Pelosi could indeed pose a threat.\n\nIn addition to the Democrats who signed the letter, there are at least two other Democrats who are saying they plan to vote against Pelosi on the floor, but did not sign the letter.\n\nPelosi could win with fewer than 218 votes\n\nSeventeen or eighteen votes is more than Pelosi can afford to lose if she has to reach a 218 majority and Democrats ultimately hold 233 seats in the chamber.\n\nBut it's possible for Pelosi to win the gavel with fewer than 218 votes --- and it's not clear yet how hardened the opposition is to her bid for speaker, even among the Democrats who have already come out against her.\n\nHere's how Pelosi can win with fewer than 218 votes: To become speaker, a person needs to receive an absolute majority of all votes cast for a particular individual during the full floor vote. If someone votes \"present,\" that doesn't count as part of the total that determines what constitutes a majority and would instead lower the threshold to reach a majority. If someone is absent or if there is a vacancy that would also lower the majority threshold that Pelosi needs to reach.\n\nFor example, if three Democrats vote \"present\" rather than voting for someone besides Pelosi, that would change the pool of overall votes from 435 (the total number of members in the House of Representatives) to 432 -- assuming that all members of the House participate in the vote. That, in turn, would lower the majority threshold below 218.\n\nThere's precedent for this: It happened in 2015 when John Boehner won the title of House speaker with only 216 votes, and with Newt Gingrich, who won in 1997 with 216 votes.\n\nPelosi's opponents don't have a clear alternative\n\nIt's also possible that Pelosi could sway or convince some of the Democrats who have pledged to vote against her to drop their opposition. A lot could change between now and January when the final vote takes place -- and, crucially, there is still no viable alternative to Pelosi since no other Democrat has entered the race to challenger her.\n\nRep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio has said she is considering it, but has yet to make a final decision. Notably, her name did not appear on the letter of Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi in the speakers' race released Monday.\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, responded to the release of the letter by issuing a statement saying that \"Leader Pelosi remains confident in her support among Members and Members-elect.\" Hammill also noted that 94 percent of the caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nCould Republicans get Pelosi across the finish line?\n\nAnother potential wild card: It's also possible that Republicans could cross party lines to cast a vote for Pelosi.\n\nRep. Tom Reed, a Republican from New York, has said he would be open to voting for Pelosi under certain conditions -- specifically if she were to endorse a bipartisan package of rules changes that would make it easier to push legislation and weaken the power of the leadership to dictate the agenda on the House floor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fueled speculation that Republicans might vote for Pelosi over the weekend, tweeting \"I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win!\" Trump tagged Reed in the tweet.\n\nFor her part, Pelosi has insisted that she will win the speakership on the strength of Democratic votes alone."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Kate Bennett, CNN", "title": "Michelle Obama's not-so-quiet return to the limelight", "description": "When Michelle Obama left the White House in January 2017, she did what most former first ladies often do -- she ditched us for a while.

But now she's back, on a revolutionary, arena-filling book tour, and she's got plenty to say.\n\nAfter eight years of living in what she once called the \"fishbowl,\" Obama retreated and began to re-learn life in the real world, away from the 18-acre compound on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nShe and husband, former President Barack Obama, didn't geographically go all that far. Their home, which they reportedly purchased for $8.1 million in 2017 , is less than three miles from the White House. But for Michelle Obama, just being able to make toast and sit outside makes it feel much farther away.\n\n\"Here I am in my new home, just me and (our dogs) Bo and Sunny, and I do a simple thing. I go downstairs and open the cabinet in my own kitchen -- which you don't do in the White House because there's always somebody there going, 'Let me get that. What do you want?' . . . and I made myself toast,\" Obama told Oprah Winfrey in a recent interview in Elle magazine\n\n\"And then I took my toast, and I walked out into my backyard. There were dogs barking in the distance, and I realized Bo and Sunny had really never heard neighbor dogs. They're like, 'What's that?' And I'm like, 'Yep, we're in the real world now, fellas,' \" she said.\n\nIt's mundane, really, making toast and hearing dogs bark. But it's the normalcy of Michelle Obama's life that she recognized people had been missing. She may have roared back onto the public stage this past week with the launch of her memoir, \"Becoming,\" but her return to the public eye reminds just how relatable Obama was and remains.\n\n\"It's difficult to put your finger on what makes someone likable,\" says Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\" \"I think it's because she's self-deprecating, and she has an easy smile. There are so many great photos of her in the White House, and on the road talking to young girls who came from lower-income homes like hers and hear the obvious joy she felt just simply being around them. That's special, and it cannot be manufactured.\"\n\nFinding her new path\n\nJUST WATCHED Michelle Obama starts book tour with Oprah Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Michelle Obama starts book tour with Oprah 02:01\n\nObama has been a periphery presence since she left the White House. She made headlines in February for the book deal, not that she signed one, that was expected, but that she and Barack Obama scored a whopping payday, reportedly in the neighborhood of $60 million -- $30 million each.\n\nShe was also vocal in the midterm campaign season, most recently encouraging people to get out and vote . She became a co-chair for a non-profit organization called, \"When We All Vote.\"\n\n\"Democracy doesn't wait for you to be bothered,\" said Obama at a Las Vegas speech in September. \"It moves on as it rightly should, and therefore, the people who vote determine the direction of the country, determine the mood, the tone, and the people who stay out don't get a say. And I want every American to feel the power of that choice.\"\n\nIt was a tiptoe of sorts around the elephant in the room. Many former presidents and first ladies follow the unwritten rule not to talk badly about the current president, and for a while there, Obama skirted naming names. But once she hit the book tour circuit, Obama took the gloves off, spilling her feelings about the anger she felt toward President Donald Trump\n\n\"What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls?\" she wrote. \"Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him.\"\n\nObama's feelings about Trump were perhaps not all that surprising, considering the divisiveness of the political dialogue during the presidential campaign, but it was her revelatory personal stories that served as a gentle reminder of just how open Obama was when she was first lady.\n\nShe wrote that she struggled with fertility, suffered a miscarriage and only got pregnant with her two daughters when she used in vitro fertilization. She said her marriage, while \"phenomenal,\" needed lots of care, including marriage counseling. She talked about needing to nurture her own feelings before she could fix anyone else's and that she and Barack Obama were \"finding each other again,\" after the fast-pace of the White House.\n\nShe talked about being a young African-American woman in Chicago, and how she often felt like the odd-one-out, both in her family, and at Princeton University, the sense of isolation and loneliness sometimes overwhelming.\n\n\"I didn't come into (being first lady) with a blank slate,\" she said during a speaking engagement several weeks before the book came out. \"I had big jobs. I went to Princeton. I went to Harvard. I am a lawyer. But as Barack's ascent got faster and higher, I had to figure out and balance marriage and balance becoming a spouse. I've learned that you can have it all, but not all at the same time.\"\n\nFinding that balance was vital because the Obama tenure marked a historic turning point -- having an African-American family in the White House.\n\n\"The line in her book about identifying more with 'the struggles of Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King' than with Eleanor Roosevelt says it all,\" says Brower. \"Michelle Obama is groundbreaking as the first African-American first lady. She was the ancestor of slaves.\"\n\n\"It's incredible to think that she lived in a house built by slaves -- which she talked about. The African-American residence staff, especially the butlers, had tears in their eyes when the Obamas moved in. They never thought they would see the day when they would be serving an African-American first family. That is simply remarkable given this country's history.\"\n\nLessons learned\n\nJUST WATCHED Obama: Melania turned down my offer for help Replay More Videos ...

Those strange details about what it was really like to live in the White House sound like the juiciest bits of gossip when Obama disclosed them this past week, during her myriad talk show appearances, interviews and book tour stops -- like that the first family must pay for their own food in the White House, something Obama didn't know until she got there.\n\n\"It's crazy because you don't know it, and most people don't know what it's like to live in the White House,\" Obama told ABC's Jimmy Kimmel during a recent appearance . \"Rent is free, staff is free. We shouldn't be mooching off of the taxpayers.\"\n\nAnd that she worked a few deals with her Secret Service detail from time to time just so she could get out and go to a mall, or a quick shopping trip for the pets.\n\n\"After Bo expertly disemboweled or shredded every last dog toy bought for him by the staff who did our regular shopping, I personally escorted him over to PetSmart in Alexandria one morning,\" writes Obama in \"Becoming.\" \"And for a short while, I enjoyed glorious anonymity while browsing for better chew toys as Bo -- who was as delighted by the novelty of the outing as I was -- loafed next to me on a leash.\"\n\n\"Michelle became America's mom. She really did. In a 'I've got your back' kind of way,\" Alyssa Mastromonaco, who served as deputy chief of staff in the Obama administration, told CNN. \"She wasn't really partisan. She wanted all the children to be healthy and happy and wanted the White House, which she considered a very special place, to be open to all the children, and I think no matter what people got that about her.\"\n\nThat Michelle Obama resonated with Americans -- and that she seemed to not be bothered by her detractors -- is what makes her book tour nostalgic. Obama might not pop up again for a while after her book becomes old news, and one place we will never see again will be the White House.\n\nBut politics appears out of the question.\n\n\"Let me very clear: It will never happen,\" Valerie Jarrett told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Monday. \"She has committed her life to public service. And she's going to use her incredible platform to be a force for good, but not in politics.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "jaafar", "title": "\u0647\u0644 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u0624 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0632\u062c\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u061f", "description": "\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639 314 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064078 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0646\u062f\u060c &quot;\u0643\u064a\u0646\u063a \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0646&quot;\u060c \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0632\u062c\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u0641\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/travel/video/2018/11/20/v68348-bangkok-tallest-building-new-skywalk", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/20/images/bangkok-tallest-building-new-skywalk.jpg?itok=YHFIFldR", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:01:25Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639 314 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064078 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0646\u062f\u060c \"\u0643\u064a\u0646\u063a \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0643\u0648\u0646\"\u060c \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0632\u062c\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u0641\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u0645\u062a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 20 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AJ Willingham, CNN", "title": "5 things to know for November 20: Gun attacks, Ivanka Trump, immigration, wildfires", "description": "Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/us/five-things-november-20-trnd/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120181838-police-chicago-mercy-hospital-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:12Z", "content": "Get '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Here's what else you need to know to. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here .)\n\n1. Gun violence\n\nA week that's supposed to be about peace and togetherness instead began with multiple tragedies. In Chicago, three people are dead after a man opened fire at Mercy Hospital ; one victim was an emergency room physician who'd been romantically involved with the gunman, who also died. Also last night, several people in Denver were injured and one was killed in a shooting near Coors Field; police are hunting for a suspect. Other fatal shootings occurred in Philadelphia, where four were found dead in a basement, and at a suburban St. Louis business, where a woman was assaulted and fatally wounded. Aside from the sheer volume of the incidents, Monday's shootings also reflect a continued rise of so-called \"soft target\" attacks , like those on a Pittsburgh synagogue and a California bar.\n\n2. Ivanka Trump\n\nA new email controversy is hitting the White House. According to emails obtained by a nonpartisan watchdog group, Ivanka Trump used a personal email account last year to discuss or relay official White House business . Of course, this calls to mind the attention paid to Hillary Clinton's email habits during her time as Secretary of State, which became a rallying cry for President Trump's 2016 election campaign. The investigation into Ivanka Trump's emails began last year when the watchdog group, American Oversight, sued several agencies to obtain records of the first daughter's government correspondence.\n\n3. Nissan\n\nThe auto industry was rocked yesterday when Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, one of its most high-profile executives , was arrested in Japan. It turns out, an internal investigation revealed \"significant acts of misconduct\" over many years by him and another top exec. Nissan said it had been investigating Ghosn, a 40-year veteran of the auto industry, and another board member for months following a whistleblower report. As you can imagine, some major businesses were plunged into uncertainty following the news. Nissan is part of a powerful alliance of automakers that also includes Renault and Mitsubishi, and together they're responsible for more than 10% of all cars sold around the world. Ghosn's fate will have a huge impact on the companies' futures.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn arrested in Japan Replay More Videos ...

Immigration\n\nImmigration\n\nPresident Trump's ongoing attempts to ban, turn away, incarcerate or otherwise dissuade asylum-seekers at the southern border just hit a huge road block. A federal judge yesterday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from denying asylum claims to immigrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally. Previously, Trump had said he wanted to keep such migrants from applying for asylum, a legal course of action for non-citizens that can be pursued once a person actually arrives at the US border. \"Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" wrote US District Judge Jon Tigar in issuing the monthlong order in San Francisco.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why Trump isn't talking about caravan Replay More Videos ...

California wildfires\n\nThe Camp Fire in California is still burning, still destroying , still killing -- but the area can expect a small respite soon in the form of much-needed rain. Four to 6 inches is expected later this week, which should help a little bit in dissipating the smothering heat and smog from the fire. However, in a cruel irony, since most of the vegetation in the area has been incinerated, the rain will fall on bare earth and put the region at risk of mudslides. As if things weren't awful enough, it's also worth a note that because of the massive fires, smoke, smog and debris, three Northern California cities -- San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento -- have topped the list of the world's most polluted cities\n\nJUST WATCHED Many still unaccounted for in California fires Replay More Videos ...

Fees per bike for domestic U.S. flights range from $75 on Southwest Airlines, to $150 on United, American, and Delta.

Se trata del Tren Maya que recorrer\u00e1 los estados del sur del pa\u00eds para atraer m\u00e1s turismo en la zona. Ser\u00e1n 1.500 kil\u00f3metros de v\u00edas, seg\u00fan dijo el propio AMLO el pasado 13 de agosto.\n\nMIRA: \u00bfEs viable el proyecto del Tren Maya de L\u00f3pez Obrador para M\u00e9xico? No todos est\u00e1n convencidos\n\n\"Mucho de las obras que se van a hacer son pasos de fauna, obras inducidas, precisamente esperando los resultados de la encuesta\", dijo este lunes el pr\u00f3ximo titular del Fonatur, Rogelio Jim\u00e9nez-Pons.\n\nEl presidente electo, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, tuvo una reuni\u00f3n en M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, con funcionarios propuestos y los gobernadores del sureste para hablar sobre la obra, que \u00e9l mismo ha dicho ser\u00e1 sometida a consulta nacional, como ocurri\u00f3 con el Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de M\u00e9xico (NAIM).\n\nEn una conferencia de prensa, Mauricio Vila, gobernador de la entidad, indic\u00f3 que el monto presupuestal inicial para la obra es de 6.000 millones de pesos (294,8 millones de d\u00f3lares) y que la partida inicial ya fue solicitada a la Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda.\n\nEn la consulta por el NAIM, que termin\u00f3 a favor de la opci\u00f3n propuesta por AMLO de rehabilitar el actual aeropuerto de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico y el de Toluca, en el Estado de M\u00e9xico, y construir dos pistas en la base militar de Santa Luc\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n en ese estado, se denunciaron intentos de hackeo a la aplicaci\u00f3n, aceptaron que hubo personas que votaron m\u00e1s de una vez y que hubo problemas t\u00e9cnicos que afectaron el buen funcionamiento de la votaci\u00f3n.\n\nSobre esto, Jes\u00fas Ram\u00edrez Cuevas, futuro coordinador de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social de la Presidencia de AMLO y quien es el vocero de la consulta, reconoci\u00f3 que en efecto hubo algunos problemas t\u00e9cnicos que permitieron que se votara varias veces en diferentes puestos.\n\nRam\u00edrez Cuevas neg\u00f3 que los votos duplicados afectaran el resultado de la consulta, pues estos son \"totalmente marginales\", seg\u00fan le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \"Es marginal completamente esta situaci\u00f3n, no afecta para nada ni la credibilidad ni el resultado\". Adem\u00e1s, dijo que es tomaron medidas para controlar los problemas t\u00e9cnicos.\n\nEn entrevista con Despierta Loret este martes, Jim\u00e9nez Pons dijo que se rectificar\u00e1n estos inconvenientes de votos duplicados para la consulta del Tren Maya.\n\nEl Tren Maya, un ambicioso proyecto\n\nSeg\u00fan dijo Jim\u00e9nez Pons en entrevista con el programa Despierta Loret, la administraci\u00f3n conf\u00eda en que el proyecto est\u00e9 en operaci\u00f3n en cuatro a\u00f1os.\n\nA\u00f1adi\u00f3 que es importante someter el tema a consulta, para ratificar el apoyo al proyecto. En el caso que sea negativo el resultado, \"cosa que yo dudo\", le dijo al programa, se rehabilitar\u00eda un plan previo que hay para un tren que va \"de Palenque a Valladolid, pasando por Campeche y M\u00e9rida\".\n\nEl asunto de la financiaci\u00f3n del proyecto no ha gustado a ciertos sectores del turismo en la regi\u00f3n.

We removed the post and permanently disabled the account belonging to the person who posted this to Facebook,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"We're always improving the methods we use to identify content that breaks our policies, including doubling our safety and security team to more than 30,000 and investing in technology,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nHowever, CNN found that Voice of America (VOA) published a report detailing the auction for marriage of a 16-year-old girl in South Sudan on November 6 -- three days before Facebook removed the post.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with the removal process at Facebook, the social network was unaware of VOA's report and did not remove the post until a local media report in a Kenyan publication came to its attention on November 9.\n\nFacebook's responsibility to uphold women's rights\n\nOtim from Plan International told CNN that offering payments is part of the country's culture, but that in this case it \"was taken to another level because of technology.\"\n\nThe South Sudanese National Alliance for Women Lawyers (NAWL) told CNN that the auction was not posted by her family, but that was done by someone from the community instead, and that the family benefited from the bidding war.\n\n\"A few of our colleagues were able to get in touch with the mother (of the bride) and she was not happy about it,\" said Suzy Natana, a lawyer at NAWL.\n\nShe added that the marriage took place on November 3 2018, according to locals the association spoke with.\n\nNatana said that this is the highest bride price that has been reported in the region. She added that NAWL is against the process of bidding because \"it makes you more of a commodity instead of a human being.\"\n\n\"Violations against women in South Sudan are a continuing issue, but for Facebook to allow their platform to enhance these violations is a problem,\" said Judy Gitau, Equality Now's regional coordinator for Africa.\n\nShe told CNN that Facebook has a responsibility to uphold women's rights, and added: \"They ought to put in place more human resources to monitor their platform to ensure that women's rights, and indeed the rights of all people, are protected.\"\n\nCall on government to investigate officials\n\nPlan International has also called on the South Sudanese government to investigate and suspend any officials involved in the bridal auction.\n\n\"Child marriage is a serious violation of human rights and a form of violence against girls,\" Otim from the group said in a statement.\n\n\"It can have profound consequences on a child's survival, health, education, development and well-being and is often carried out against their will and best interests.\"\n\nOtim told CNN the solution for preventing child marriages is to try and keep girls in school, but admits it \"requires a lot of effort to change\" the culture.\n\nThe United Nations' agency, which aids the world's needy children, says that the country's high levels of poverty, instability and gender gap fuel child marriage -- with both girls and their families feeling it can help them escape poverty."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Olympic great Mo Farah to run in 2019 London Marathon", "description": "British distance runner Mo Farah is set to compete at the London Marathon for the third time next year.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/sport/mo-farah-london-marathon-2019-scli-gbr-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120095159-mo-farah-london-marathon-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:34:52Z", "content": "(CNN) Mo Farah, Britain's most successful distance runner, is set to compete at the London Marathon next year.

End of a business legend: The arrest of Carlos Ghosn in Japan on Monday is forcing three major automakers to make tough decisions about their leadership.\n\nGhosn, the chairman of Nissan ( NSANY ) Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ) and Renault ( RNSDF ), was detained by Japanese authorities after an investigation by Nissan revealed \"significant acts of misconduct\" over many years.\n\nNissan said the misconduct included significantly under-reporting his compensation and misusing company assets. Ghosn is yet to respond to the allegations.\n\nGhosn is credited with rescuing Nissan and Renault, and stitching together three automakers into a global alliance. But he's now likely to be ousted as chair of all three.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that he would meet with representatives from Renault on Tuesday to discuss appointing interim management because Ghosn is \"no longer capable of leading the group.\"\n\nThe French government owns 15% of Renault. Ghosn also serves as CEO at the carmaker.\n\nNissan's board will meet Thursday to remove Ghosn from his position. Mitsubishi has also asked its board of directors to \"promptly remove\" Ghosn as chairman.\n\nShares in Renault dropped another 3.5% on Tuesday after getting rocked in the previous trading session. Nissan stock shed 5.5% in Tokyo and shares in Mitsubishi declined nearly 7%.\n\n2. Down goes bitcoin: The price of bitcoin has plunged 15% over the past 24 hours, at one point reaching a low of $4,200.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently cracked down on \"initial coin offerings,\" and sales of crypto mining equipment appear to have slowed.\n\nBitcoin prices are now roughly 75% below record levels set a year ago at the height of a bubble.\n\n3.

Campbell management says it knows the company best and can put it back on the right track.\n\nThe struggling 149-year-old company has faced a slew of problems including poor sales, an ill-fated acquisition of Bolthouse and the abrupt departure of its CEO this year.\n\nIf Campbell has a strong quarter, management could use the good results to bolster its case.

It could also snuff out the risk of new wildfires for the rest of the year.\n\nNow the bad news: Flash flooding, mudslides and rivers of debris could hit cities already devastated by the wildfire.\n\nA flash flood watch is in effect Wednesday through Friday for the Camp Fire area, where 3 to 6 inches of rain are expected.\n\nThe rain will end \"fire concerns for the winter,\" said Robert Baruffaldi, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service's Sacramento office.\n\nBut it could also make conditions treacherous for firefighters battling the Camp Fire, which has charred more than 152,250 acres and was only 75% contained as of Tuesday.\n\nThe inferno has already killed 81 people and destroyed 12,900 homes. And with hundreds of residents still unaccounted for, authorities fear the death toll could rise. Statewide, 84 people have died in the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles.\n\nRain could impede the search for victims\n\nAuthorities are scrambling to find 870 people who are unaccounted for in Butte County. That number keeps fluctuating as more residents are found.\n\nBut with heavy rain on the way, searchers feel a greater sense of urgency in finding the remains of Camp Fire victims.\n\nCrews search for human remains in Paradise, California.\n\n\"What we're looking at here is potentially remains, or cremains -- it's kind of a cremated remains state,\" said Brian Ferreira, rescue squad officer for California Task Force 4\n\nWhen the rain comes, \"It's going to consolidate the material and make it more dense. And it's going to present much more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's going to make a difficult task ... that much more difficult.\"\n\nFerreira said it's possible some remains could be washed away. If that happens, \"it's out of our hands at that point. We're going to go as hard as we can, as long as we can, until we can't go anymore. That's what's going to happen.\"\n\nButte County is keeping a list of the people who are unaccounted for because of the Camp Fire. Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea urged those who see their own names or the names of loved ones found safe to contact the sheriff's office.\n\nOfficials lifted evacuation orders and warnings for several more areas Tuesday, but cautioned residents \"to take steps to ensure they have food, water and fuel for their vehicles.\"\n\nEvacuees could endure flooding\n\nAcross Butte County, residents were bracing for a possible deluge.\n\nJennifer Debrunner is staying at the Butte County Fairgrounds in a motor home loaned by a stranger. She told CNN affiliate KCRA that her family covered everything they own with a tarp.\n\nDebrunner said she knows the rain will bring \"a lot of mud, a lot of cold\" to the area. But this Thanksgiving week, Debrunner said she's grateful her family has a borrowed RV.\n\nCady Machado has been camping out in a Walmart parking lot with her husband and 9-month-old baby.\n\nDue to the expected rain, Machado told CNN affiliate KTXL , she's sending her child to her sister's in Arizona.\n\nAs for herself and her husband?\n\n\"There's a nice bridge with my name on it to go underneath where I won't get flooded out with my husband,\" she told KTXL.\n\nThe Red Cross and other aid groups have opened additional shelters for people and pets in the area, KCRA reported.\n\n\"We want to make sure those people who are staying in tents know that these spaces are available for them so they can get out of the elements,\" said Shawn Boyd with the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.\n\nAsh flows expected in Paradise\n\nThe first bout of heavy rain is expected to hit Butte County on Wednesday, bringing about an inch to Paradise -- a town virtually wiped out by the Camp Fire.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Baruffaldi said the rain could cause ash flows , or a slurry of ash swept away by rainwater.\n\nHere is the latest thinking on the upcoming multi-day rainfall event (Wednesday through Saturday). Of particular interest are the burn scar areas where ash and debris flows are possible if precipitation is heavy enough. #CAwx #CampFire pic.twitter.com/rJJdyNE1TD \u2014 NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) November 20, 2018\n\nA second rain system arriving Thursday night will likely bring 1.5 inches of rain to Paradise and up to 4 inches in places of higher elevation, Baruffaldi said. That means mudflows are a real threat\n\nSouthern California is in danger, too\n\nRain also is expected in Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire is burning west of Los Angeles. As of Tuesday afternoon, the blaze had killed three people and torched more than 96,000 acres\n\nThe Woolsey burn area is expected to get less than an inch of rain. But it's still at risk of mudslides and minor debris flow from Wednesday to Thursday, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.\n\nMudslides are more likely in the Woolsey Fire area because fires in the southern part of the state tend to destroy vegetation roots, Baruffaldi said.\n\nOfficials in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were urging residents to prepare for the rain. Fire departments in both counties are making an emergency supply of sandbags available to the public at fire stations.\n\nWildfires lead to widespread health concerns\n\nEven Californians who never saw the flames could be affected by the wildfires' health hazards.\n\nSmoke from the Camp Fire hangs heavy in parts of the state, forcing schools to close and shutting down some public transportation.\n\nThe air quality is so bad that San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento became the world's three \"most polluted cities\" on Friday, according to Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites, worse than hot spots in China and India."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Hailey Baldwin ya lleva el apellido de Justin Bieber... al menos en Instagram", "description": "Hace unos d\u00edas, Justin Bieber publico una foto con su prometida Hailey Baldwin con el mensaje: \"Mi esposa es incre\u00edble\".

Tigar of the US District Court for the Northern District of California said that a policy announced November 9 barring asylum for immigrants who enter outside a legal check point '\"irreconcilably conflicts\" with immigration law and the \"expressed intent of Congress.\"\n\n\"Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\" Tigar wrote, adding that asylum seekers would be put at \"increased risk of violence and other harms at the border\" if the administration's rule is allowed to go into effect.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department slammed the ruling and the lawsuit, calling them both \"absurd.\"\n\n\"Our asylum system is broken, and it is being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year. ... It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,\" Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldeman and Justice Department spokesman Steven Stafford said in a statement.\n\nThe temporary restraining order is effective nationwide and will remain in effect until December 19, when the judge has scheduled another hearing, or further order of the court.\n\nThe order is the latest setback for the administration that has sought to crack down on what it says are flaws in the immigration system, and it is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups who argued it is illegal to block someone based on how they entered the country.\n\nNow a key question looms: What impact will the judge's decision have in the coming days at the US-Mexico border, where Trump has deployed thousands of troops as large groups of migrants seeking asylum head toward the United States?\n\nMore than 2,000 Central American migrants arrived in the border city of Tijuana in recent days, and about 3,000 more migrants are estimated to be in Mexicali, Mexico, another border city about 100 miles away, UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Francesca Fontanini said.\n\nIn recent days, administration officials have maintained that there is a crisis at the border and that abuses in asylum claims forced them implement new measures.\n\nImmigrant rights groups, who argue the administration is creating a crisis at the border to score political points, praised the judge's ruling.\n\n\"This is a critical step in fighting back against President Trump's war on asylum seekers,\" said Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn their lawsuit, immigrants advocates argued it was illegal to block someone from seeking asylum based on how they entered the country, and that the Trump administration also violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not providing public notice or comment on its new asylum rule.\n\n\"This ban is illegal, will put people's lives in danger and raises the alarm about President Trump's disregard for separation of powers,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project and the lead attorney in the case.\n\n\"There is no justifiable reason to flatly deny people the right to apply for asylum, and we cannot send them back to danger based on the manner of their entry,\" he said.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security argued that the President has the right to suspend entry by individuals into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest.\n\n\"As the Supreme Court affirmed this summer, Congress has given the President broad authority to limit or even stop the entry of aliens into this country. Further, asylum is a discretionary benefit given by the Executive Branch only when legal conditions are met and a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,\" Waldman and Stafford said in the joint statement from the departments. \"It is lawful and appropriate that this discretionary benefit not be given to those who violate a lawful and tailored presidential proclamation aimed at controlling immigration in the national interest.\n\nFollowing the ruling, some top Democrats called on the Trump administration to work with Congress on immigration reforms.\n\n\"Once again, the courts have been forced to step in and preserve the rule of law. No one, including the President, can rewrite the nation's immigration laws on their own,\" Reps. Jerrod Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, said in a joint statement.\n\nEarlier this month, the President issued a proclamation referring to \"large, organized groups\" who were traveling through Mexico and \"reportedly intend to enter the United States unlawfully or without proper documentation and to seek asylum.\"\n\nIt said that those seeking entry can only do so temporarily at recognized ports of entry to allow for \"orderly processing\" and denied entry to those at any other location along the southern border.\n\n\"But aliens who enter the United States unlawfully through the southern border in contravention of this proclamation will be ineligible to be granted asylum,\" the President wrote.\n\n\"The arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States,\" the proclamation read."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "m.nadi", "title": "\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062a

Depictions of Greek mythologies have been found all over Pompeii.\n\nThe relic was unearthed Friday in the Regio V area of Pompeii, the ancient city destroyed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79.\n\nPictures from the excavation show the vivid color of the painting is still visible, some 2,000 years after it was buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash. In the painting, Queen Leda is portrayed sitting on a chair, draped in a golden cloak with the swan god in her lap.\n\nA fresco depicting the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan at the Pompeii archeological site. Credit: Courtesy Parco Archeologico di Pompei\n\n\"This painting, compared with others of Pompeii in the Roman world, is characterized by a pronounced sensuality,\" said Pompeii archaeological park director, Massimo Osanna, in an official video . \"It's presenting Leda welcoming the swan into her lap.\"\n\nThat Leda is depicted as \"welcoming\" the swan, as Osanna put it, is a noteworthy feature of this newly unearthed fresco. Throughout the ages, different interpretations of the myth in art and poetry have cast the encounter as either consensual or as rape\n\nOsanna also said the work is significant because Leda's eyes appear to follow the viewer.\n\nAccording to the Pompeii archaeological park website , the fresco was discovered in the bedroom of a house during work to stabilize the excavation site. A neighboring corridor was previously found to contain another ancient fresco -- one showing the Roman fertility god, Priapus, weighing his giant phallus.\n\nBronze Age discovery: Is this Britain's Pompeii?\n\nAlong with other erotic works of classical mythology, the scene of \"Leda and the Swan\" was popular among first-century Pompeiians, according to the park's website\n\nArcheologists have discovered various depictions in Pompeii houses, or domus, and in ruins of other ancient Roman towns destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. However, these often feature Leda standing, rather than seated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 22 The \"Apollo and Venus\" painting by 16th-century Dutch master Otto van Veen (1556-1629) was discovered in the closet of an art gallery in Iowa, and is likely worth over $4 million.\n\n\n\nScroll through the gallery for other examples of lost and found artworks. Credit: Duane Tinkey/DSM Magazine\n\n\"Leda and the Swan\" is an important story in classical mythology, as Leda is said to have given birth to offspring who feature in several prominent Greek myths.

No te preocupes, aqu\u00ed tienes todo lo que necesitas saber para convertirte en un experto.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el brexit?\n\nGran Breta\u00f1a + salida (exit)= brexit. Es la idea (una vez impensable) de que los brit\u00e1nicos abandonen la Uni\u00f3n Europea. Pero en un resultado sorprendente, el Reino Unido vot\u00f3 para hacer precisamente eso en un refer\u00e9ndum en junio de 2016.\n\nLEE: 5 claves del acuerdo del brexit para la salida de Reino Unido de la Uni\u00f3n Europea\n\nDesde entonces, ha habido conversaciones, disputas, se\u00f1alar con el dedo y amenazas, como en un divorcio t\u00edpico.\n\nPero el Reino Unido y la UE finalmente podr\u00edan haber llegado a un acuerdo en el que puedan concretar su divisi\u00f3n.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo impacta el brexit al resto del mundo?\n\nSi eres una naci\u00f3n europea: tienes mucho que perder, en muchos frentes. Poco menos de la mitad de las exportaciones del Reino Unido van a la UE. Poco m\u00e1s de la mitad de sus importaciones provienen de las otras 27 naciones del bloque. Todo eso es ahora parte de una (dolorosa) renegociaci\u00f3n. Ahora piensa en la diplomacia: cuando Europa hizo algo \u00fatil en ese frente, el Reino Unido, una potencia militar seria, ha estado a menudo en el asiento del conductor. Por lo tanto, la UE est\u00e1 perdiendo un peso pesado.\n\nSi eres Estados Unidos: el mundo ya es lo suficientemente peligroso y vol\u00e1til. Algunos en Estados Unidos pueden preocuparse de que el desmoronamiento de la uni\u00f3n, un aliado vital, desatar\u00e1 m\u00e1s inestabilidad. El Reino Unido tambi\u00e9n es el s\u00e9ptimo socio comercial m\u00e1s grande de Estados Unidos.\n\nSi eres cualquier otra naci\u00f3n: el Reino Unido es la quinta econom\u00eda nacional m\u00e1s grande del mundo. Piensa en el efecto que tendr\u00e1 brexit en los mercados mundiales. Incluso si no se derrumban, la incertidumbre es suficientemente grave. Los mercados, ya ves, aman la estabilidad. Y mercados inestables = malas noticias potenciales para la econom\u00eda de tu pa\u00eds.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1l es la diferencia entre Inglaterra, Gran Breta\u00f1a y el Reino Unido?\n\nA veces los usamos indistintamente (e incorrectamente). Entonces, aqu\u00ed hay una r\u00e1pida lecci\u00f3n de geograf\u00eda.\n\nEl Reino Unido no es un solo pa\u00eds sino un pa\u00eds de pa\u00edses. Se compone de cuatro naciones:\n\nInglaterra\n\nEscocia\n\nGales\n\nIrlanda del Norte\n\nGran Breta\u00f1a es la isla que posee Inglaterra, Escocia y Gales.\n\nE Inglaterra es el m\u00e1s grande. Es la parte m\u00e1s poblada del Reino Unido y tiene su capital, Londres.\n\n\u00bfY qu\u00e9 es la Uni\u00f3n Europea?\n\nLa Uni\u00f3n Europea es un bloque de 28 pa\u00edses que decidieron que ser\u00eda genial si sus ciudadanos pudieran ir de vacaciones y comerciar entre ellos sin preocuparse por toda la burocracia.\n\nSus ra\u00edces se remontan al per\u00edodo posterior a la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Tras seis a\u00f1os de lucha, Europa fue diezmada. Las econom\u00edas estaban en coma. Los viejos enemigos ten\u00edan que aceptar el hecho de que necesitaban vivir juntos (como Francia y su antiguo ocupante, Alemania). As\u00ed, poco a poco, los pa\u00edses comenzaron a formar alianzas.\n\nPara la d\u00e9cada de 1990 ten\u00edamos la Uni\u00f3n Europea moderna. Representa a 500 millones de personas.\n\nLa idea es: si est\u00e1s vinculado econ\u00f3micamente, es menos probable que pelees y pelees.\n\nSuena a una gran idea. Entonces, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el problema con la UE?\n\nSuena como un matrimonio feliz. Pero ya sabes c\u00f3mo es eso. Cuando los eventos mundiales entran, estos pa\u00edses reaccionan de manera diferente. Pelean por c\u00f3mo tratar con los refugiados que llegan a sus costas. No pueden ponerse de acuerdo sobre asuntos financieros. Est\u00e1n enojados porque algunos de ellos tienen que juntarse m\u00e1s que otros para rescatar a pa\u00edses que son gestionados terriblemente. Y esto ha dado lugar a partidos anti-UE en toda Europa.\n\n\u00bfAlguna vez ha salido un pa\u00eds de la UE?\n\nNing\u00fan pa\u00eds lo ha hecho, pero s\u00ed la isla m\u00e1s grande del mundo. Groenlandia, que es parte de Dinamarca, fue parte de la UE hasta que se fue en 1985. (El resto de Dinamarca se qued\u00f3).\n\nEl Reino Unido ser\u00e1 el primer pa\u00eds de buena fe en irse. Sin embargo, Grecia ha pensado seriamente en ello. Eso ser\u00eda Grexit (una historia diferente).\n\nPero piensa en el precedente que est\u00e1 por establecerse. Cuando el Reino Unido se vaya, otros pa\u00edses de la UE tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan comenzar a mirar la puerta de salida. Eso significa que la UE podr\u00eda desmoronarse lentamente. Y eso podr\u00eda tener enormes consecuencias para la econom\u00eda y la estabilidad. (\u00bfRecuerdas cuando hablamos de por qu\u00e9 surgi\u00f3 la UE?).\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando ahora? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vuelve el brexit a las noticias?\n\nHan estado tratando de forjar un acuerdo de divorcio, ya que el Reino Unido pronto estar\u00e1 fuera del bloque comercial de la UE. La idea de que el Reino Unido salga de la UE sin un futuro acuerdo comercial asusta a los empresarios brit\u00e1nicos y de toda Europa. Las negociaciones han sido duras. As\u00ed que ahora, despu\u00e9s de m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os de discusiones, han llegado a esto: un borrador de acuerdo (de 585 p\u00e1ginas) que establece c\u00f3mo el Reino Unido dejar\u00e1 la UE el viernes 29 de marzo de 2019.\n\nSin embargo, Reino Unido permanecer\u00e1 dentro del mercado \u00fanico de la UE y seguir\u00e1 estando sujeto a las leyes y regulaciones de la UE hasta finales de 2020. Eso dar\u00e1 a todos el tiempo suficiente para concretar un futuro acuerdo comercial. S\u00ed, probablemente dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s de lo mismo.\n\nPor lo tanto, esencialmente el Reino Unido permanecer\u00e1 en la UE durante otros dos a\u00f1os.\n\nY otra cosa importante: el acuerdo garantiza la protecci\u00f3n de m\u00e1s de tres millones de ciudadanos de la UE en el Reino Unido y m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de ciudadanos del Reino Unido en los pa\u00edses de la UE para continuar viviendo, trabajando o estudiando como lo hacen actualmente.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1l es uno de los mayores puntos de fricci\u00f3n?\n\nLa frontera \"dura\" de Irlanda. En este momento, la frontera entre la Rep\u00fablica de Irlanda e Irlanda del Norte est\u00e1 abierta. La gente (y el comercio) se mueven entre las dos naciones con facilidad. Hay temores que podr\u00edan cambiar en un divorcio brexit. La Rep\u00fablica de Irlanda est\u00e1 en la UE. Pero Irlanda del Norte, que es parte del Reino Unido, no estar\u00e1 en el bloque comercial de la UE despu\u00e9s de la divisi\u00f3n.\n\nNormalmente, eso requerir\u00eda una \"frontera dura\", con puntos de control, cruces de frontera y otra infraestructura. Ello podr\u00eda desacelerar seriamente el comercio y otras actividades econ\u00f3micas.\n\n\u00bfHabr\u00e1 una nueva votaci\u00f3n sobre el refer\u00e9ndum?\n\nAlgunos brit\u00e1nicos importantes como el exprimer ministro Tony Blair han estado pidiendo esto, pero no, no hay ning\u00fan plan al respecto. La primera ministra brit\u00e1nica, Theresa May, cerr\u00f3 de golpe la puerta a esa idea y dijo que una nueva votaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda una \"traici\u00f3n grave\" a la democracia. Este borrador de acuerdo ser\u00e1 votado por los parlamentos del Reino Unido y la UE. Eso es todo.\n\n\u00bfPasar\u00e1 este acuerdo ambos parlamentos?\n\nNo lo sabemos. El acuerdo est\u00e1 siendo atacado desde todos los bandos en el Reino Unido. Despu\u00e9s de que May presentara el borrador del acuerdo brexit al Parlamento, dos ministros principales del gobierno renunciaron (adem\u00e1s de otros dos que renunciaron en el verano). Otros quieren que May renuncie. Los funcionarios de la UE celebrar\u00e1n una reuni\u00f3n del Consejo Europeo el 25 de noviembre para finalizar y formalizar el acuerdo. A\u00fan no est\u00e1 claro cu\u00e1ndo votar\u00e1 el Parlamento brit\u00e1nico."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "jaafar", "title": "\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0629.. \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0646\u0629 \u064a\u064f\u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0642\u0637\u0631", "description": "\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064014 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0638\u0647\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0649 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0637\u0631.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/style/video/2018/11/20/v68340-damien-hirst-fetus-sculptures-qatar-hospital", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/20/images/damien-hirst-fetus-sculptures-qatar-hospital.jpg?h=9e2d0aa1&itok=fSgE4Usm", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:01:24Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064014 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0638\u0647\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u062a\u0627\u062a \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0641\u0649 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0637\u0631.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 20 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Wayne Drash, CNN", "title": "Consumer group warns of 'dangerous' slime products and other hazardous toys", "description": "A consumer advocacy group is warning parents of what it calls \"dangerously high\" levels of a chemical called boron in popular slime toys marketed to children -- although an expert disputed the findings and said the warning is overblown.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/health/trouble-in-toyland-report/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119170351-02-slime-toy-111918-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T09:00:26Z", "content": "(CNN) A consumer advocacy group is warning parents of what it calls \"dangerously high\" levels of a chemical called boron in popular slime toys marketed to children -- although an expert disputed the findings and said the warning is overblown.

The \"Trouble in Toyland\" safety survey was published Tuesday ahead of the major holiday shopping season.\n\nThe group noted \"toys are safer than ever before,\" but that more work needs to be done to make them safer. PIRG's report highlighted the potential hazards of slime, toys with possible choking hazards and ones that could violate children's privacy by sharing data.\n\n\"With hundreds of new toys hitting the market every year, our survey of only 40 toys suggests there may be other potentially dangerous toys slipping through existing protections or worthy of further investigation,\" the group said.\n\nThe group singled out six popular slime products for what it described as containing \"dangerously high boron content.\" Boron is a nonmetallic element, and compounds of it, such as borax, have been used in products for decades, ranging from detergents to roach poison. The US PIRG Education Fund said it found that \"significant concentrations of boron, as high as 4,700 parts per million (ppm) in popular slime toys.\"\n\n\"Young kids are known to put everything in their mouths and when it comes to slime that could have serious consequences,\" said Adam Garber, the lead author of the report. \"These high levels of boron can cause nausea, vomiting and long term reproductive health issues. Parents should closely monitor their kids when playing with this toy and call poison control if any is eaten.\"\n\nGarber added, \"We should protect children by ensuring every package has appropriate labels moving forward and determine health-based standards to ensure children don't end up in the emergency room from their holiday gift.\"\n\nThe United States does not have established standards on limits for boron in products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says exposure to large amounts of boron -- about 30 grams of boric acid -- \"over short periods of time can affect the stomach, intestines, liver, kidney, and brain and can eventually lead to death.\" Fatal doses for children are estimated to be 5 to 6 grams, according to the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nPIRG noted the European Union has a limit of 300 ppm for boron and that there should be a \"full-fledged investigation to determine if limits should be established\" in the US. \"Policymakers should continue to evaluate new threats, such as boron, and ensure the Consumer Product Safety Commission has the funding and authority to protect the public,\" the report said.\n\nHowever, Rick Sachleben, a member of the American Chemical Society who has experience with boron, said it's important to distinguish the fact that \"all forms of boron are not equally toxic.\" He said sodium borate, the known component used in slime, has \"very low toxicity.\"\n\n\"You'd almost have to do something beyond reason to make it toxic,\" he said, adding that a child would need to eat \"multiple containers\" before it reached toxic levels.\n\n\"The health risks are relatively low and can be controlled by telling your kid: 'If you eat the slime, I'm not going to buy you any more,\" Sachleben said.\n\nSachleben wasn't the only one to take issue with the PIRG report.\n\nWonder Workshop CEO Vikas Gupta told CNN that information about his company's product in the report was categorically false. The PIRG report, citing an investigation by the Mozilla Foundation, said Wonder Workshop's Dash robot \"shares your information with third parties.\"\n\n\"That is absolutely incorrect,\" Gupta said. \"We don't collect any personal identifiable information from children, and we do not share any information from the apps or the software or robots to any third-party ever. None of that happens.\"\n\nAmazon, which had its Amazon Fire HD Kids Edition cited for its possible sharing of data, said the product is in full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. \"We do not share children's data with third parties,\" Amazon said in a written statement.\n\nThe report also said another popular toy -- the Hatchimals Fabula Forest; Hatching Egg with Interactive Tigrette -- had \"no choking hazard label\" in its listing on Walmart.com, although the photograph of the product has a choking warning on the front of the box.\n\nGarber said that wasn't good enough, that the \"law requires online sites to provide warning labels directly on the site, not just on pictures or on the packaging, so parents are warned prior to purchase.\"\n\nAccording to PIRG, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled more than 40 children's products in the last year, totaling more than 2.7 million units.\n\nBalloons cause more choking deaths among children than any other toy, according to the PIRG report. The group found three balloon packages that are either marketed to young children or are not labeled properly with choking hazard warnings.\n\nThe six slime products mentioned in the report were:\n\n-- Kangaroos Original Super Cool Slime, which was found to contain \"4700 ppm boron concentration. The EU limit is 300 ppm.\"\n\n-- Kidsco Glow in The Dark Slime with \"4600 ppm boron concentration.\"\n\n-- Toysmith Jupiter Juice Slime with \"1900 ppm boron concentration.\"\n\n-- iBaseToy Fluffy Slime with \"1500 ppm boron concentration.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n-- Haniex Soft Magic Crystal Slime with \"1400 ppm boron concentration.\"\n\n-- Meland Fluffy Slime with \"1100 ppm boron concentration.\"\n\nGarber said 5 grams of boron could prove fatal for a child, although \"health impacts with boron appear at much lower levels\" than that. He acknowledged \"you'd likely have to ingest multiple containers to reach the fatal level\" of boron, but he doesn't believe that should be the standard.\n\n\"After talking to a number of public health experts on this issue,\" Garber said, \"they agreed that these levels warranted a warning and further investigation on setting standards.\"\n\nCNN reached out to the makers of the slime products but did not hear back. The chemist, Sachleben, said he wasn't too concerned. \"I wouldn't put this high on my priority of things to worry about,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "abelhaik", "title": "\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629.. \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646", "description": "\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0623\u0628\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0625\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0630 \u0634\u0631\u0643\u062a\u064a \u0631\u064a\u0646\u0648 \u0648\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0625\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/business/video/2018/11/20/v68339-carlos-ghosn-nissan-rise-fall", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/20/images/GettyImages-1059133394.jpg?itok=salZevWg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:49:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646 \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0623\u0628\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0625\u0646\u0642\u0627\u0630 \u0634\u0631\u0643\u062a\u064a \u0631\u064a\u0646\u0648 \u0648\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0625\u0633\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 20 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Charles Riley, CNN Business", "title": "France: Carlos Ghosn can't continue to lead Renault", "description": "The French government is moving to install an interim leader at Renault following the arrest of CEO and Chairman Carlos Ghosn in Japan on Monday.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/business/france-renault-carlos-ghosn/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119205535-07-carlos-ghosn-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T08:45:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "London (CNN Business) Renault appointed an acting chief executive on Tuesday but stopped short of removing Carlos Ghosn as CEO and chairman following his arrest on suspicion of financial misconduct in Japan.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it would elevate chief operating officer Thierry Bollor\u00e9 on an interim basis, giving him the same powers that Ghosn enjoys as CEO. It said independent director Philippe Lagayette would chair board meetings \"during this period.\"\n\nGhosn was detained by Japanese authorities on Monday after an internal investigation at Nissan, where he is also chairman, revealed \"significant acts of misconduct\" over many years.\n\nThe Japanese carmaker accused Ghosn of significantly under-reporting his compensation and misusing company assets. Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Tuesday that the industry veteran had failed to properly disclose homes provided by Nissan in four countries.\n\nNHK also said that prosecutors suspect Ghosn may have pocketed money that was meant for other executives at Nissan ( NSANY ).\n\nGhosn has not yet responded to the allegations.\n\n\"At this stage, the Board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr. Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities,\" Renault said in its statement, adding it was asking Nissan to share all information related to the investigation into Ghosn.\n\nPrior to the announcement, analysts said it was unlikely that Ghosn would be able hold onto his positions at Renault or Nissan, in which the French carmaker owns a 43% stake.\n\nShares in both companies were punished this week, reflecting concerns that the scandal could fracture the global auto alliance that Ghosn forged over the past two decades.\n\nNissan's board will meet Thursday, and it is expected to remove Ghosn from his position. Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ), the third member of the alliance, has asked its board of directors to \"promptly remove\" Ghosn as chairman.\n\nThe three companies make up an unusual global alliance that employs 470,000 people, operates 122 plants and sold over 10 million vehicles in 2017. It would not exist without Ghosn, who is known in the industry as a skilled turnaround expert and savvy politician.\n\n'Le cost killer'\n\nGhosn started his career at Michelin before rising through the ranks at Renault. He orchestrated a major restructuring of the struggling French carmaker, returning it to profitability and earning himself the nickname \"Le cost killer.\"\n\nThe Brazilian-born executive joined Nissan in 1999 when it formed an alliance with Renault, but he kept his responsibilities at Renault ( RNSDF ) as part of an unusual arrangement. Ghosn is also credited with executing a stunning turnaround at Nissan and was named its chief executive in 2001.\n\nJUST WATCHED Carlos Ghosn's rise and fall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Carlos Ghosn's rise and fall 01:38\n\nHe was made CEO of Renault in 2005, becoming the first executive to run two Fortune Global 500 companies simultaneously. Mitsubishi joined the alliance in 2016, when Nissan took a controlling stake in the smaller Japanese carmaker.\n\nThe companies are linked through a complicated series of equity stakes. Nissan and Renault own pieces of each other, but Nissan's stake in its French partner does not come with voting rights. Nissan also has a 34% stake in Mitsubishi. Politics is a factor: The French state maintains 15% ownership in Renault.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier Tuesday that he would meet with representatives from Renault to discuss appointing interim management because Ghosn is \"no longer capable of leading the group.\"\n\nFuture of the alliance\n\nGhosn's latest project was to deepen ties between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi. The alliance structure, which allows the companies to pool resources and share costs, has been explored by other carmakers in recent years.\n\nMany top executives in the alliance report to three separate CEOs \u2014 but Ghosn held it all together. The big question now is whether the alliance can survive without him.\n\nGhosn told the Financial Times in June that the alliance he forged was \"irreversible.\"\n\n\"We created a lot of synergies, and scale is the name of the game. But I respect that some stakeholders are saying, 'Hey, wait a minute, what's gonna happen after you're gone?' \" he told the newspaper.\n\nThe carmakers could struggle to compete on their own should the alliance break up. The auto industry is under intense pressure to develop mass-market electric cars and autonomous vehicles. Tech companies are eager to beat them to the punch.\n\nThe governments of France and Japan appear determined to keep it alive. They issued a joint statement on Tuesday reaffirming their support for the alliance and calling it \"one of the greatest symbols of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.\""}, {"source": {"id":

The following is an edited excerpt from her forthcoming book \" Design for Children: Play, Ride, Learn, Eat, Create, Sit, Sleep .\" November 20 is United Nations' Universal Children's Day.\n\nAnyone who has spent time around kids knows that child-rearing and aestheticism are often at odds. The required gadgetry seems to grow more elaborate with each passing year, offering an ever-growing number of bells and whistles to clutter our homes and test our sanity. With people now waiting longer to have children -- and having fewer when they do -- retailers are capitalizing on a population of devoted parents with deeper pockets.\n\nPhilosopher Alain de Botton's assertion that \"all designed objects are propaganda for a way of life\" seems all the more relevant when designing for children, as the things we surround them with shape their perception of the world. Thankfully, history is littered with designers -- often parents themselves -- who rejected the notion that the stuff of childhood needs to be garish and disposable.\n\nHere are eight examples of toys and objects that both children and parents would welcome into their homes.\n\nIsetta Pedal Car, 1957\n\nIsetta Pedal Car (1957) by Velam Credit: \u00a9 www.voitureapedales.com /www.dauxdom.wixsite.com/le-palais-de-la-vap\n\nThis unusual pedal car is based on the Isetta, the iconic but short-lived bubble car born during the micro-car craze that swept Europe during the 1950s. The Isetta's signature shape, bizarre space-saving front door and single-seat occupancy made the vehicle instantly recognizable.\n\nOriginally designed in Italy, the Isetta was licensed to a number of companies across Europe, including Velam in France. More pod-like than the original, the Velam version earned the nickname the \"yoghurt pot.\" While this pint-sized pedal car lacks some of the original's notable features, it perfectly captures the Isetta's quirky and distinctive form.\n\nKaleidoscope House, 2001\n\nKaleidoscope House (2001) by Laurie Simmons and Peter Wheelwright, Bozart Toys Credit: \u00a9 Laurie Simmons\n\nArtist Laurie Simmons first gained recognition in the 1970s for a series of photographs shot from within a vintage doll's house. When Bozart Toys founder and former private art dealer, Larry Mangel, commissioned her to design a doll's house of her own, she teamed up with architect Peter Wheelwright to create the Kaleidoscope House.\n\nFar from your typical doll's dwelling, the Kaleidoscope House was a tiny shrine to contemporary art, accessorized with miniature designer furniture. An art collection by many of Simmons' friends -- Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger included -- was also provided.\n\nMonkey, 1951\n\nMonkey (1951) by Kay Bojesen, Kay Bojesen Denmark Credit: \u00a9 KayBojesen Denmark\n\nTrained as a silversmith under the famed Georg Jensen, Kay Bojesen was among the first designers to embrace functionalism in Danish crafts. The birth of his son, Otto, in 1919, inspired Bojesen to create playthings reminiscent of those his own father had made for him.\n\nMaintaining that his designs should be round, soft and feel good in the hand, Bojesen sought to create animals with soul and a sense of humor. Originally conceived as a coat hook, Bojesen's monkey exemplified the designer's belief that the lines of design should \"smile.\" Able to hang from either his hands or feet, this charming simian quickly swung to design fame.\n\nIO Bunk Pod, 2013\n\nIO Bunk Pod (2013) by Mina Panic, IO Kids Design Credit: \u00a9 KarlAnderson\n\nThere is a touch of Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" in the award-winning IO Bunk Pod, created by Mina Panic for her company, IO Kids Design. The bed can transform into two single beds, a combined bed and desk unit, or even separate bed and desk pieces.\n\nIts ability to evolve as a child grows makes it a sustainable piece of furniture that can adapt to the changing needs of the family. Drawing on the utility, clean lines and craftsmanship of Scandinavian design, IO Bunk Pod comprises a minimal number of parts, making it easy to assemble.\n\nSeries E Classroom Chair, 1971\n\nSeries E Classroom Chair (1971) by Robin Day, Hille Credit: \u00a9 Hille\n\nCharged with designing a low-cost, mass-produced, stacking chair that would meet virtually every seating requirement, British designer Robin Day conceived the now classic Polypropylene chair. First produced in 1962, the Polyprop (as it is commonly known) was injection-molded from the then-new thermoplastic, polypropylene, a material which proved to be cheaper, lighter and more durable than other plastics.\n\nDay's 1962 design was both visually sophisticated and structurally ingenious, making it a landmark of modern furniture design. Its success led the designer to release several variations, including Series E (pictured), which came in five sizes and had a lifting hole in its back.\n\nBlockitecture, 2013\n\nBlockitecture (2013) by James Paulius, Areaware Credit: \u00a9 Areaware\n\nWhen James Paulius, then a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, set out to create a toy for his university's annual Metaproject design challenge, he found inspiration in one of Brutalism's most far-out architectural designs: Moshe Safdie's Habitat 67. Built in Montreal for Expo 67, Safdie's condominium comprised dozens of prefabricated modular units, piled into a seemingly haphazard construction.\n\nSimilarly, Paulius's winning Metaproject entry consists of a series of hexagonal, window-laden blocks. The shapes of the blocks enable them to be assembled into interesting formations of sky-high verticals and cantilevered horizontals, defying the boundaries often imposed by more traditional cubic blocks.\n\nCradle, 1936\n\nCradle (1936) by Jean Prouv\u00e9 Credit: \u00a9 Tajan\n\nCelebrated French designer Jean Prouv\u00e9's furniture is known for its novel approach to both materials and construction. Striving for the most efficient design, he drew inspiration from the new technologies of the day, namely those used within the automotive and aeronautical industries, often imbuing his objects with a futuristic look.\n\nThis mobile bassinet displays his signature use of metal in its rib cage-like construction, and borrows from early aviation design, with rubber wheels that resemble an airplane's landing gear. While Prouv\u00e9 was a proponent of mass production, this interwar cradle was commissioned for the daughter of Prouv\u00e9's collaborator and friend, Marcel Lods.\n\nPlay Kitchen, 2014\n\nPlay Kitchen (2014) by Mia Dela, Sebra Interior Credit: \u00a9 Sebra Interior Aps\n\nWhen designer Mia Dela gave birth to her first son, she found herself surrounded by a world of unappealing pastel and plastic. Wanting more aesthetic and ecologically conscious options, she founded the child-centric Sebra Interior in 2004. Producing textiles, lighting, furniture and toys from natural materials, such as wood, wool and organic cotton, Dela's creations feature subtle color palettes and appealing design elements.\n\nHer Play Kitchen, made of birch with metal detailing, has a refined, curved shape that makes it appear more like a piece of contemporary furniture than a toy. Its oven, hotplates and a removable sink invite active play cooking, cake baking -- and easy cleaning."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Bard Wilkinson, CNN", "title": "Police attack Papua New Guinea parliament in APEC pay dispute", "description": "A group of police officers \"stormed\" Papua New Guinea's parliament on Tuesday over unpaid wages, damaging the building and reportedly assaulting staff, only days after international leaders attended a summit in the Pacific island nation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/asia/png-police-parliament-assault-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181120142632-papua-new-guinea-parliament-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T06:37:25Z", "content": "(CNN) A group of police officers \"stormed\" Papua New Guinea's parliament on Tuesday over unpaid wages, damaging the building and reportedly assaulting staff, only days after international leaders attended a summit in the Pacific island nation.

He's said he knows more about ISIS than the generals do.\n\nThe President's latest spat with an admired military figure i s with retired Adm. William McRaven, the architect of the daring special forces raid into Pakistan that killed al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in 2011, acting on CIA intelligence.\n\nThis controversy, like the President's past run-ins with military heroes, was set off by Trump's perception that he was being unfairly attacked, apparently by a politically motivated critic.\n\nWhen asked on Fox News Sunday about McRaven's warnings that Trump's claim that the media is the enemy of the people endangered democracy, the President lashed out, accusing McRaven of being a Clinton backer and in the camp of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Of course, we should have captured Osama bin Laden long before we did,\" Trump said, dumping on the military planners behind one of the most dangerous and audacious special forces operations in recent military history.\n\nHis response was characteristic for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it reflected his obsession with his predecessor and apparent belief that anyone who worked in a past administration -- even as a nonpartisan military officer -- is somehow suspect.\n\nSecond, it underlined how the President sees almost every issue through a prism of how it affects his image and prestige. Trump's first instinct when criticized is not to move on or shrug it off, even in deference to a great soldier's sacrifice, but to see the critique as a motivated by political animosity.\n\nThe episode is a reminder of how the President tramples protocols as a matter of course in his normal daily rituals. The idea that any other recent commander in chief would take a shot at a military hero like McRaven, who is respected across partisan lines in Washington, is unthinkable.\n\nThe clash also shows that when the President thinks he has been attacked -- by McRaven, a senior former intelligence chief, or a former prisoner of war like the late Sen. John McCain -- nothing is off limits.\n\n'Appalling and disgusting'\n\nFor someone like McRaven, who spent a long career serving presidents of both parties and stifling partisan impulses, Trump's tongue lashing must have come as a harsh blow -- even though he himself had criticized the President.\n\n\"The President shifted from the question, which was about freedom of the press, to insulting a retired four-star,\" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who is a CNN military analyst.\n\n\"It was just really appalling and disgusting that the President would describe him in that way,\" Hertling said on CNN.\n\nMcRaven made clear in a statement to CNN that he had not backed Clinton in 2016, though he said he did admire the leadership of Obama and former President George W. Bush, whom he also served in a senior role.\n\nWhile Trump's words may strike many people as inappropriate, he had learned early in the 2016 Republican primary that he does not pay a political price for such comments.\n\nMany political observers predicted that Trump's attack on McCain, who he said was not a war hero because the then-Navy pilot had been captured in Vietnam, would spell the end of his White House hopes. But instead Trump went from strength to strength.\n\nSimilarly, his insults thrown at the parents of slain Muslim US soldier Humayun Khan, who had criticized him from the stage of the Democratic National Convention two years ago, did not stall his White House run.\n\nIn a sign of how times have changed, the official GOP Twitter account, which in a past era might have been looked to for unquestioning support of a military hero, on Monday endorsed Trump's comments about McRaven.\n\nIn a tweet, the Republican Party said McRaven had been on Clinton's shortlist for vice president in 2016 and had been critical of the President.\n\n\"He's hardly a non-political figure,\" the tweet said.\n\nA more difficult question is whether the President's behavior is damaging his credibility as the commander in chief, who at any moment could be charged with sending troops to fight, and possibly die, in a national crisis.\n\nLeon Panetta, the CIA director and defense secretary under Obama, issued a strongly worded statement putting that issue in play on Monday.\n\n\"The President's statement criticizing McRaven for not getting Bin Laden sooner is patently ridiculous,\" Panetta said. \"It demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate, and undermines the President's own standing as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nGiven that the military is required by tradition and constitutional role to fall in behind the nation's civilian leadership, there is unlikely to be any public condemnation of Trump's criticism from serving officers.\n\nFormer officers often seek to avoid being publicly drawn into the fray too, though they are more free to hint at feelings percolating inside the military.\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who lost his job as commander of US forces in Afghanistan after he and some of his colleagues were quoted mocking Vice President Joe Biden and other civilian officials in 2010, said on CNN's \"Newsroom\" on Monday that soldiers in the field need confidence in their commander in chief and what he stands for.\n\n\"We have certain things we want and demand of leaders,\" McChrystal said.\n\n\"And to a degree, there has to be a confidence in the leader's basic core values. We have to be able to believe in enough of what that leader represents to feel comfortable following them, sometimes to our deaths.\"\n\nAwkward moments\n\nThe controversy with McRaven, Trump's criticism of Khan's parents and his swipes at McCain are not the only awkward moments he has had as commander in chief. He was accused of not being sufficiently sympathetic in a 2017 telephone call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who had been killed in action in Niger.\n\nHis recent order of troops to the southern US border to deal with a migrant caravan that has yet to arrive has been blasted as a political stunt by critics. Earlier this month, Trump did not attend a ceremony honoring US troops killed in World War I outside Paris, citing the poor weather that had grounded his helicopter. He said in the Fox News interview that he should have gone to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day when he returned. He has also yet to visit troops in a war zone, as his predecessors often did around national holidays like Thanksgiving. But he did attend the transfer of the remains of a service member killed in Yemen early in his presidency.\n\nTrump frequently argues that no one has been more pro-military than he, and claims to have pulled the nation's armed forces out of a funding crisis.\n\nAnd in many ways, he has honored his promises to be pro-military.\n\nHe secured a massive $700 billion spending bill that will mean new fleets of ships, planes, submarines, missiles and helicopters and the largest pay increase for military personnel in eight years, though his claim that it is the first wage hike for the troops in a decade is false.\n\nTrump's affection for the military is emotional and political. He seems to see the troops as embodying qualities of power and masculinity he admires.\n\nIt's no coincidence that he has packed his administration with former generals. To hear him tell it, it often seemed as though he picked Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary because of his nickname, \"Mad Dog.\"\n\nTrump has often lauded hard-charging World War II Gen. George Patton as a hero. It may be no coincidence that the classic Hollywood biopic about the war hero opens with a rasping speech from star George C. Scott, who delivers an almost Trumpian monologue before a huge American flag.\n\n\"Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,\" Scott says.\n\nTrump attended New York Military Academy as a young man, where he was taught, according to biographer Michael D'Antonio, that \"life is about survival\" and he showed on the sports field that he would do anything to win."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Susannah Cullinane", "title": "Fatal shootings mark beginning of holiday week", "description": "Thanksgiving week got off to a violent start Monday, with fatal shootings in four states.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/us/thanksgiving-shootings/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119194105-colorado-shooting-11-19-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:58:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Thanksgiving week got off to a violent start Monday with four fatal shootings across the US in a matter of hours.\n\nAttacks in a Chicago hospital, on a Denver street, at a suburban St. Louis business and in a Philadelphia basement left 10 people dead -- including one of the gunmen -- and at least four people wounded.\n\nA gunman killed 3 at a Chicago hospital\n\nA police officer, a doctor and a pharmacy resident were killed after a Monday afternoon shooting at Chicago's Mercy Hospital\n\nThe gunman, who had been in a relationship with the one of slain hospital employees, also died, police said.\n\nIt's not clear if he died from police gunfire or a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe gunman approached one of the female victims -- a hospital employee -- around 3:30 p.m. in the hospital's parking lot, and an argument ensued.

So, if I loaf about during the day, they are watching me,\" he says with a chuckle.\n\nHenderson's family has farmed in Besters, a cattle district of rolling grassland hills and acacia trees, for five generations.\n\n\"History is complicated in South Africa,\" I remark to him. \"Our forebears took land from people. If not always directly, it was certainly helped by the legislation of the previous government. What do you think of that part of your legacy?\"\n\n\"We can't ignore that. I don't think commercial farmers should atone for all the sins of apartheid that were committed,\" he says.\n\nIn Besters, the farmers are grappling hands-on with one of South Africa's most challenging historical problems.\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress came to power in South Africa in 1994, one of the key dilemmas they faced was the so-called land question.\n\nThe policy of pushing non-white South Africans off the land to the benefit of whites officially began with the 1913 Native Lands Act, though in reality the practice stretches back centuries.\n\nThe act limited black ownership to just 7% of the land. The vast majority of viable land was allotted to whites.\n\n71-year-old Wilson Shabalala's land claim was finally granted, only to see the government official in charge of the transfer take the farm for himself.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa recently described the Lands Act as South Africa's \"original sin.\"\n\n\"In my own family it happened twice, where land was taken, we were moved from where my parents had grown up owning land, working the land, they were moved and dropped into an arid place with no compensation whatsoever,\" said Ramaphosa in an exclusive interview with CNN.\n\n\"As it is now, the poverty that we have in South Africa, in part, has been given rise to by people not having assets.\"\n\nThis racist geography was accelerated during the apartheid years, when legislation codified the nationalist party's aims to keep races physically separated. Blacks and mixed-race South Africans were removed from cities and pushed into townships or homelands -- land allotted to non-whites, according to their ethnic identity.\n\nThey had to have a passbook, a kind of internal passport, to travel to designated white areas.\n\nIn Ladysmith, the nearest town to Besters, the \"black spots\" in town were erased in the 1970s, the non-white families forced out to a township called Ezakheni, some 15 miles away.\n\nWith the advent of democracy, land redistribution was, in theory, a top priority. But the South African government's efforts have been beset by problems.\n\nThe farmers in Besters didn't wait for them to rectify the past.\n\nIn our district I have seven neighbors and they are all different colors ... there's place in the sun for us all. Roland Henderson, farmer\n\nMore than a decade ago, the commercial farmers in Besters held hundreds of meetings with the local community. As a result, with the help of government money, they have redistributed almost half of their district's land.\n\n\"It's complicated and there are many layers of history and many layers of conflict, but if you put everybody around a table and you talk to each other openly and honestly, you can find each other,\" says Henderson.\n\nEmerging farmers like Ndizane Khosa have used their new land to raise cattle, chickens and sheep, and access to capital has allowed them to pull their families out of poverty.\n\nFarmers like Ndizane Khosa have used their new land to pull their families out of poverty.\n\n\"When we were growing up we had no idea how this farming worked, but our grandkids have the opportunity to learn properly now. I can pass that knowledge to them,\" Khosa says.\n\n\"In our district I have seven neighbors and they are all different colors, but we live happily together and there's place in the sun for us all,\" says Henderson.\n\nThe success of land redistribution in Besters is the anomaly, not the norm.\n\nExhaustive studies show that the ANC-led government has failed to execute its policy of land restitution and redistribution because of corruption, mismanagement and a lack of will. The vast majority of private land -- farmland included -- is owned by whites.\n\n\"A lot is at stake,\" said Ramaphosa. \"You could even say that the stability of the country is at stake. And I am not fond of failing at anything. And this issue we will not fail on.\"\n\nThe ANC, pushed by an insurgent opposition party on the left, has resolved to amend the constitution to explicitly allow land redistribution without compensation. It is a highly contentious move that is working through a parliamentary process.\n\nHenderson's agreement to hand over some of his property is an anomaly rather than the norm.\n\nWhile Henderson, Khosa and the other farmers of Besters managed to broker a negotiated future for the land in their rural slice of South Africa, they are facing new pressures to take sides in the land debate.\n\nThey say the extremes could scupper the experiment of a democratic South Africa.\n\n\"We are getting drowned out by the rhetoric and by the noise of the politicians and the noise of others,\" says Henderson on the balcony of his farmhouse. \"It is difficult to galvanize the middle, because we tend to be more silent than the extremes. The middle needs to have their voice heard.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Motez Bishara, CNN", "title": "'He's 'a freak athlete': The unlikely NFL journey of an Aussie rugby giant", "description": "From the Australian Rugby League to the NFL in five months.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/sport/nfl-jordan-mailata-philadelphia-eagles-intl-spt/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181106140930-01-jordan-mailata-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:18:10Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "London (CNN) It's difficult to describe just how improbable Jordan Mailata's journey to the NFL has been.\n\nA year ago, the 21-year-old former Australian Rugby League player tried on a football helmet and pads for the very first time. By April, he was drafted as an offensive lineman by the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThat's like a guy picking up a guitar and showing enough promise to join Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band on tour.\n\nMind you, that guy is 6-foot 8-inches tall, weighs 346 pounds and is \"a freak athlete,\" as one NFL executive put it.\n\nLast month Mailata was in London, standing in the halls of Wembley Stadium in disbelief after an Eagles win against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\"I think about where I was a year ago, and it's just funny that everything in my life has changed since then,\" he tells CNN Sport.\n\nAlthough he is yet to play a down this season, Mailata's trip to London was made even more surreal by his recovery from a dangerous heart condition four years ago.\n\nAt 17, Mailata fainted during rugby workouts and needed emergency surgeries to repair the upper and lower chambers of his heart.\n\nThe Aussie took a year off before making a comeback with the South Sydney Rabbitohs. \"I tore it up, knocking the life out of them,\" Mailata told the NFL Network.\n\nHe wasn't kidding.\n\nHis now legendary highlight reel repeatedly shows three or four men required to drag him down on the rugby field -- and features one unfortunate player who had more than his soul crushed by a Mailata tackle.\n\n\n\nR\n\nEAD: Does the NFL locker room policy need to change?\n\n'Definitely not normal'\n\nThose clips reached NFL executives and earned Mailata a tryout for the NFL's recently launched International Pathway Program.\n\nConsidering his parents immigrated to Australia from Samoa -- a tiny island whose prolific NFL lineage includes late Hall-of-Famer Junior Seau and Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota -- it's no surprise Mailata had the itch for American football.\n\nHe was soon shipped to the IMG Institute in Florida to join four other hopefuls. Their arduous training -- 12 hours a day, seven days a week -- was filmed for the NFL Networks show \"Undrafted,\" which previously followed Carolina Panthers defensive end Efe Obada.\n\n\"It's definitely not normal,\" Mailata said of his experience on the docuseries, an emerging art form in all levels of the sport. \"We still did our thing even though the cameras were on us, but it's just weird, it's a different feeling.\"\n\nMailata was magnetic on screen and electric during the NFL combine workouts, boasting a 40-yard dash of 5.12 seconds, a vertical leap of 28 inches, and 22 bench presses of 225 pounds.\n\nUnderstanding the nuances game took a little more time.\n\n\"My knowledge of the NFL is very limited, I've only watched a few games and highlights,\" Mailata admitted on \"Undiscovered.\"\n\n\"It's like going into it blindfolded. Everything is new, it's a big mystery.\"\n\nWhen asked what position he would like to play, Mailata recalled the Oscar-nominated film \"The Blind Side\" and suggested left tackle -- the prized offensive line role occupied by the film's hero, former NFLer Michael Oher.\n\nBy April, Mailata's script would have its own Hollywood ending. He was picked in the seventh round of the NFL draft by the Eagles.\n\nIt's not often you see a man that size burst into tears, but emotions got the better of Mailata after the call from Eagles' general manager Howie Roseman.\n\n\"I'm just feeling every single emotion that I've been wanting to feel for the past three or four months,\" he said, using a friend's T-shirt to wipe away tears before standing on the podium at the NFL draft in Dallas.\n\n'I'm all in'\n\nHalfway through his first season, Mailata is realizing that there's more to the NFL than blocking a pass rush.\n\nWhat surprises him the most about the league?\n\n\"How much of a business it is,\" he says, cryptically. \"It's a business at the end of the day.\"\n\nAs a drafted player, Mailata signed a four-year deal worth more than $2.5 million, according to overthecap.com, though only his signing bonus of $89,392 was guaranteed. He will need to keep his spot on the Eagles to see the rest of the money.\n\nBut unlike fellow Aussie Jarryd Hayne, who lasted just the 2015 season with the San Francisco 49ers before returning to rugby, Mailata is committed.\n\n\"I'm all in,\" he says. \"I wouldn't be here if I wasn't going to give this a good shot.\"\n\nAlthough he is seen more as a long-term project, there is a chance Mailata will see some action this season because of injuries to Philly's offensive line.\n\nThere has even been discussion of using him as a running back in short-down situations to show off some of his rugby skills -- something Twitter fans have been clamoring for.\n\nHand it off to Jordan Mailata and let him bodyslam/drag the entire Cowboys defense down the field until he reaches the end zone. \u2014 jklmNATop (@jklmNATop) November 12, 2018\n\nMailata has some company from Down Under on the Eagles, with Aussie rules convert Cameron Johnston leading the team's punting game -- part of a wave of Australians taking over the position in college and the pros.\n\nBoth rugby and the NFL share an all-for-one mentality in the locker room, Mailata says, though gridiron comes with a whole new set of responsibilities.\n\n\"The comradeship is still the same, but it's different in terms of the stresses that come with the game,\" he explains, noting different position meetings and playbooks that separate offensive and defensive players.\n\n\"It sounds weird, but it makes sense when you're in it.\"\n\nOne way Mailata relieves pressure is by playing the guitar and singing, which he displayed with surprising ability on \"Undiscovered.\"\n\n\"I grew up (with it) in church, my family is very musically gifted,\" he says. \"I used to be a musician before I was ever an athlete.\"\n\nThe way things are going, Mailata may want to keep his off-season free, just in case Springsteen comes calling."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trying to right historical injustices", "description": "The country is locked in a controversial debate about land redistribution to try and right historical injustices.

Only 40% of missions sent to the Red Planet by any agency have been successful.\n\nPart of this is due to the thin Martian atmosphere, which is only 1% of Earth's, so there's nothing to slow down something trying to land on the surface.\n\nThe United States is the only country to have missions that survived landing on Mars. NASA has been flying past, orbiting, landing and roving over Mars since 1965.\n\nJUST WATCHED NASA launches mission to study Mars Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NASA launches mission to study Mars 01:43\n\n'Once out of reach, now conceivable'\n\nThe geologic diversity that makes Jezero Crater interesting to scientists also makes it a challenge for the rover's entry, descent and landing.\n\nNASA said as well as its river delta and small crater impacts, the site contains numerous boulders and rocks to the east, cliffs to the west and depressions filled with aeolian bedforms (wind-derived ripples in sand that could trap a rover) in several locations.\n\n\"The Mars community has long coveted the scientific value of sites such as Jezero Crater, and a previous mission contemplated going there, but the challenges with safely landing were considered prohibitive,\" said Ken Farley, project scientist for Mars 2020 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\n\"But what was once out of reach is now conceivable, thanks to the 2020 engineering team and advances in Mars entry, descent and landing technologies.\"\n\nWhen the landing site search began, mission engineers already had refined the landing system such that they were able to reduce the Mars 2020 landing zone to an area 50 percent smaller than that for the landing of NASA's Curiosity rover at Gale Crater in 2012.\n\nSky crane\n\nNASA has added a new capability called Terrain Relative Navigation, which will enable the \"sky crane\" descent stage, the rocket-powered system that carries the rover down to the surface, to avoid hazardous areas.\n\n\"Nothing has been more difficult in robotic planetary exploration than landing on Mars,\" said Zurbuchen.\n\n\"The Mars 2020 engineering team has done a tremendous amount of work to prepare us for this decision. The team will continue its work to truly understand the TRN system and the risks involved, and we will review the findings independently to reassure we have maximized our chances for success.\"\n\nOn November 26, NASA's Mars InSight lander will touch down on the Red Planet at 3 p.m. EST, the first time in six years a new mission will land on Mars.\n\nInSight, or Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is going to explore a part of Mars that we know the least about: its deep interior.

His fate is now in the hands of Japanese prosecutors and the directors of three of the world's top car companies.\n\nGhosn \u2014 the chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors \u2014 was detained Monday by Japanese authorities after an internal investigation at Nissan revealed \"significant acts of misconduct.\"\n\nIt was a stunning turn for one of the biggest names in the global auto industry who is credited with turning around the businesses at both Nissan and Renault . Shares in the companies plunged on the news.\n\nMore details are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks about Ghosn's alleged wrongdoing. Nissan said it includes significantly under-reporting his compensation and misusing company assets. Ghosn is yet to respond to the allegations.\n\nHis arrest has unleashed a corporate crisis that spans continents. He's the linchpin of a powerful alliance between Nissan ( NSANY ), Renault ( RNSDF ) and Mitsubishi ( MMTOF ), which together make one of every nine cars sold around the world.\n\nThe allegations against Ghosn\n\nNissan said Monday that it carried out a months-long investigation into Ghosn, 64, and another board member after receiving a whistleblower report.\n\nThe company found that Ghosn and the other board member, Greg Kelly, had been misreporting Ghosn's earnings in filings to the Tokyo stock exchange.\n\nProsecutors said the two men allegedly collaborated to under-report Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) over a five-year period ending in March 2015. The maximum punishment in Japan for filing a false financial statement is up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 10 million yen ($89,000).\n\nNissan said it also uncovered \"numerous other significant acts of misconduct,\" including the personal use of company assets and misuse of the company budget.\n\nAccording to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, Nissan provided Ghosn with homes in Rio De Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam. He allegedly paid only a portion of the rent and did not declare the benefit.\n\nNHK also reported that prosecutors suspect Ghosn may have pocketed money meant for other Nissan executives.\n\nCNN hasn't so far been able to reach Ghosn, Kelly or their representatives for comment on the allegations.\n\nNissan, Mitsubishi and Renault call board meetings\n\nFollowing his arrest, Ghosn seems all but certain to be ousted from his leadership roles at Nissan, Mitsubishi and Renault.\n\nNissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the company will meet Thursday to remove Ghosn and Kelly from the board.\n\nMitsubishi said it is starting an internal investigation and will ask the board of directors to \"promptly remove\" Ghosn as chairman.\n\nRenault on Tuesday appointed its chief operating officer as acting CEO , but it stopped short of removing Ghosn. In addition, Renault said an independent director would chair board meetings \"during this period.\"\n\nStocks in all three companies tanked. Renault closed down more than 8% in Paris on Monday, and fell another 2% on Tuesday. In Tokyo, Nissan fell 5.5% Tuesday while Mitsubishi dropped nearly 7%.\n\nAccording to NHK, prosecutors in Tokyo are considering whether to bring criminal charges against Nissan. The carmaker told CNN it was aware of the reports, but declined to comment further.\n\nAlliance in doubt\n\nGhosn is the architect of a strategic alliance between the three automakers. The partnership has allowed the companies to better compete against auto industry powerhouses such as Volkswagen ( VLKAF ), Toyota ( TM ) and General Motors ( GM ).\n\nNissan, Renault and Mitsubishi are well integrated. Many top executives in the alliance report to three separate CEOs \u2014 but Ghosn held it all together.\n\n\"He was the alliance,\" said Rebecca Lindland, senior auto analyst for Cox Automotive. \"He was the creative genius behind all of this, and set the parameters to run these fairly disparate companies.\"\n\nThe three carmakers share ownership, too. Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. Mitsubishi got on board in 2016, when Nissan purchased 34% of its stock.\n\nAfter the bombshell of Ghosn's alleged misconduct, there are concerns the alliance could falter . Much hinges on whether the three companies can agree on how to handle the allegations against him and settle on a replacement. For now, they say they are committed to the alliance.\n\nThe carmakers could struggle to compete solo should the alliance break up. The auto industry is under intense pressure to develop mass-market electric cars and autonomous vehicles. Tech companies are eager to beat them to the punch.\n\nFrance's stake\n\nGhosn's arrest has particular significance for France. The French government owns 15% of Renault.\n\n\"Today, Mr. Ghosn clearly cannot lead the company,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday.\n\nLe Maire told radio station France Info that he would be asking Renault representatives to put in place new temporary leadership for the company.\n\nThe story dominated newspaper coverage in the country. Four of France's top dailies put Ghosn on their front pages Tuesday under headlines like 'A fallen icon' and 'The fall of emperor Carlos Ghosn.'\n\nUS links\n\nThere's a chance American authorities could get involved, too.\n\nThough Nissan and Renault are foreign companies, their shares trade indirectly on US exchanges as American depositary receipts, or ADRs. To sell this type of security, banks buy up stock in foreign companies and then issue certificates that track the companies' share prices. US investors can trade the certificates like other securities.\n\nThat could provide an opening for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to get involved, according to David Chase, a former SEC prosecutor.\n\nIf Ghosn's alleged misconduct affected Nissan or Renault's financial statements relied upon by US investors \u2014 or if his behavior exposes internal compliance problems \u2014 it could be the basis for a lawsuit, Chase said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u064a\u0631\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649

You can sign up for free right here.\n\nWhite House backs down\n\nThis CNN.com story was rewritten several times on Monday. The first headline was \"CNN asks for emergency hearing after Trump threatens to revoke Jim Acosta's credentials again.\" But then the headline became \"White House backs down from legal fight, restores Acosta's press pass.\"\n\nYes, things are back to normal now, to the extent anything is normal in the Trump White House. The lawsuit is over... So here's what happened...\n\nMonday's developments\n\n-- Sarah Sanders and Bill Shine sent a letter to Acosta around 3 p.m. and said his hard pass had been \"restored.\" They called this a \"final determination.\"\n\n-- \"As a result,\" CNN said, \"our lawsuit is no longer necessary.\" A couple hours later the network's lawyers filed papers to drop the lawsuit.\n\n-- This resolution avoided a long and costly legal battle, and also avoided establishing any new case law...\n\n-- David Gergen on \"AC360:\" \"I think this has been a significant victory for CNN and for the country...\"\n\n-- Sanders and Shine notified Acosta and the rest of the press corps of new \"rules\" governing presidential pressers...\n\nWhat are these \"rules?\"\n\nThe letter from Sanders and Shine asserted that reporters may only ask \"a single question\" at a press conference. Follow-ups will only be permitted \"at the discretion of the President or other White House officials.\" And reporters must \"physically surrender\" the mic when directed. Violations of \"any\" of these rules \"may result in suspension or revocation.\" Sounds serious! But is it?\n\nReporters have not agreed to the \"rules\"\n\nTo be clear: The press corps has not agreed to any new set of \"rules.\" The correspondents' association said it had \"no role\" in crafting what the White House sent out.\n\nThis is a key quote from the association's statement: \"For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions. We fully expect this tradition will continue.\"\n\nIndeed. But the obvious concern is that the \"rules\" could have a chilling effect on the press. Could discourage reporters from challenging Trump to actually answer their questions.\n\nOr... Is all of this irrelevant? Maybe the White House is just trying to save face after an embarrassing loss to CNN. Maybe no one will remember this skirmish in a few weeks.\n\nI was full of questions. So I asked three of the smartest people I know. Three people who have been dealing with the president and the press for years. And they gave me three different answers. Are these rules \"real?\" Will they be enforced?\n\nThe first person said no: \"Ain't ever going to happen.\" This person told me not to fall for it. Trump lost in court, it's over.\n\nThe second person said yes: \"Only a matter of time.\" They predicted that Trump would try to expel another reporter, citing the \"rules\" as a pretext. It all depends on his mood swings.\n\nAnd the third smart person? \"I don't know.\" They said no one knows. They lamented the fact that Trump's aides are trying to impose order on pressers when 1) Trump is the most disorderly person at pressers and 2) the events hardly ever take place, anyway...\n\nThe \"rules\" make Hannity feel powerful\n\nSean Hannity celebrated the \"rules\" and read all four bullet points aloud. This dust-up \"may have ultimately made it easier to kick out people,\" Hannity said, excitedly. Reporters will have to abide \"if they want to stay in the White House.\" He also played a montage of Acosta's so-called \"lowlights.\" You see, Acosta being back at work means Acosta is back to being a hate object on \"Hannity.\" And on Lou Dobbs' show too... Dobbs and \"Diamond & Silk\" heralded the I could hear it in his voice Monday night. Shadow press secretarycelebrated the \"rules\" and read all four bullet points aloud. This dust-up \"may have ultimately made it easier to kick out people,\" Hannity said, excitedly. Reporters will have to abide \"if they want to stay in the White House.\" He also played a montage of Acosta's so-called \"lowlights.\" You see, Acosta being back at work means Acosta is back to being a hate object on \"Hannity.\" And on' show too... Dobbs and \"Diamond & Silk\" heralded the \"rules\" on Monday night...\n\nI wonder how Fox's White House reporters feel about this anti-journalism bluster from Hannity and Dobbs...\n\nWhat insiders are saying\n\nErik Wemple -- The Washington Post's worried about the chilling effect: \"Will reporters run afoul of these new rules? Will they ask two questions when they're allotted only one? Such technicalities may be beside the point: Reporters will be THINKING about those rules and the hassles that come along with violating them.\"\n\nMatt Pearce of the L.A. Times -- I'm thinking the same thingof the L.A. Times tweeted: \"This looks like they're creating rules that are very easy to break and are likely to go unenforced until the government decides they want to make an example of somebody...\"\n\nScott Nover spoke with several First Amendment advocates who are -- The Atlantic'sspoke with several First Amendment advocates who are concerned about the \"rule\" talk...\n\n-- The Post's Glenn Kessler tweeted: \"It would require WH reporters to cooperate, but every time the president fails to answer a question, or dodges it, the next reporter should note that he did not answer the question and restate it. Only way to beat the WH at its silly game.\"\n\nMy four takeaways\n\n1. Trump almost never holds full-fledged press conferences. So these \"rules\" almost never apply anyway. Will he start holding frequent pressers?\n\n2. Most of the reporters at the Nov. 7 press conference asked followups. Some of them asked several followups. And Trump reveled in all of it. (Which takes me back to #1!)\n\n3. Trump and co. want to provoke fights with the media, but they don't want to lose in court again. Will they really risk another loss by banning another reporter?\n\n4. Something much, much bigger is going on. It's Trump's assault on truth. Trying to blacklist Acosta is just one small part of that. Trump calls real news \"fake,\" he calls fake news \"real,\" he insists on being the only reliable source for his fans. This is happening every day. This is the real overarching challenge of the Trump years...\n\nThe Trump effect on the WHCA Dinner\n\nWith Trump likely to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner for a third straight year, the association is shaking things up.

But for travelers, nothing's certain but death, taxes and hikes to airline baggage fees.\n\n2018 has been the first major year since 2013 to see a rash of baggage fee hikes among airlines. In August, both JetBlue Airways and United Airlines raised checked baggage fees on domestic U.S. flights by $5, with the first checked bag costing $30 -- up from $25 -- for flights in North America, Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nAir Canada and WestJet immediately followed with similar changes and, within weeks, competitors American Airlines and Delta Air Lines announced changes that paralleled these, also upping bag fees by $5\n\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics, the U.S. airline industry collected $2.4 billion in the first six months of 2018, up 7% from the same period a year earlier, and is on track to total more than $5 billion for the year.\n\nBaggage fees are big business, a business thriving at the expense of consumers who squint at the fine print while packing the night before a trip, only to find that they'll need to be ready to pay more at the airport.\n\nThankfully airlines typically have a webpage featuring the details of what (and what isn't \u2014 looking at you, sports parachutes and scuba air tanks) allowed as checked luggage, and any fees or packaging details that may be associated. Delta 's is one of the most comprehensive, even volunteering information on how to check a Christmas tree (\"adequately packaged with the root ball or cut base and all branches wrapped and secured using a burlap type material,\" in case you were wondering).\n\nHere are the details on the most common categories of extra baggage when you travel\n\nMusical Instruments\n\nViolins can come on board with you, but cellos may need their own seat. Jernej Furman / EyeEm\n\nSmall musical instruments like violins and wind instruments may be carried on the plane as cabin baggage, but do protect them with a hard-shell case.\n\nIt's the larger instruments that require special accommodations, and in most cases airlines understand the value these items have for a guest, as well as their fragility.\n\nThus, guitars and cellos may be able to travel in the cabin with you, as airlines often offer the option to purchase an extra seat for these with more than 72 hours advance notice, and provided your itinerary includes aircraft capable of safely fitting the instruments.\n\nMany major international airlines, like British Airways , even allow travelers who have purchased seats for their instruments to board the aircraft early and secure the instrument in place.\n\nRelated content The world's most luxurious airport hotels\n\nSporting Equipment\n\nThe most common sporting items checked as baggage include golf clubs, surfboards, bicycles, skis and snowboard gear, but don't be too shocked if you spot another traveler waltzing up to check-in desks with bags of all shapes and sizes.\n\nAirlines will accept appropriately packaged and protected items as wide-ranging as spearguns, javelins, snowshoes, scuba gear, and, in some cases, even entire kayaks. And if your bocce balls, collapsible hiking poles, and sturdy footwear for a vacation hiking through Italy's Cinque Terre region all fit in a bag within the airline's standard weight and size allowances for checked bags, there'll be no charge to check it.\n\nWhen it comes to figuring out fees, surfers have it easiest thanks to the work of the Wave Tribe surf gear company, which compiles an annual listing of surfboard boardbag fees.\n\nOn it, airlines like Qantas, Singapore Airlines and KLM rank as \"surfer friendly bros\" for charging below $100, while others, including Emirates and Thai Airways, are derided as \"Daddy Warbucks\" airlines for charging over $200 per boardbag.\n\nThe worst offender, according to Wave Tribe, is Qatar Airways, with blindingly steep sports equipment fees that begin at $350 and rise to $1,750 per piece, depending not on weight but arbitrarily on itinerary.\n\nRelated content Airfare hacks: 5 ways to fly for less\n\nThere's good news for golfers and skiers, however; golf clubs and ski/snowboard gear are welcomed complimentary on both U.S. domestic and international flights with major carriers, provided the cases aren't well outside the airline's published baggage size allowances.\n\nAs a standard, that means ski, snowboard, or golf gear bags shouldn't be larger than 75 x 29.5 x 25.5 inches or weigh more than 50 lbs (or you'll face excess weight fees).\n\nBicycles, although common, aren't without their challenges and fees. Airlines require bicycles to have their pedals and other projecting pieces removed or folded, and the handlebars turned parallel with the frame before packing it into a cardboard bike box or hard-shell bike case.\n\nFees per bike for domestic U.S. flights range from $75 on Southwest Airlines, to $150 on United, American, and Delta. On international flights, bike cases are often allowed as part of the complimentary checked baggage allowance with advance notice, as on British Airways\n\nLeslie Byxbee, public relations and social manager for Virgin Atlantic, tells CNN Travel that the airline has seen a bit of everything checked as luggage on the airline's long-haul flights from London to the Caribbean, but sports equipment like scuba and cricket gear is by far the most popular.\n\nCheck out the new upgrades and features coming to airplane cabins in the next few years.\n\nByxbee notes that the \"most surprising piece of luggage,\" a horse saddle box, was checked at Antigua. \"It looks like a small fiber-board drum, and is the trunk that the saddle and grooming supplies for a horse or two horses would be transported in. No, we do not accept horses as checked baggage!\"\n\nOn the other side of the world, Air Tahiti is eager to fly scuba divers (and their gear) to the many islands of the archipelago. Divers should of course follow scuba decompression practice of waiting until 24 hours after a dive to fly, but when that time has passed, remember to show a scuba certification card at Air Tahiti check-in to take advantage of the airline's extra 11-lb bonus for divers . This is in addition to the already generous complimentary checked baggage allowance of 50 lbs per person.\n\nAnother airline that loves to delight travelers through waiving bag fees is JetBlue, which has promoted seasonal routes by lifting charges for sports items like surfboards and bicycles.\n\nBicycles can be packed, but you will have to remove some parts. Dimitri Otis/Getty\n\nMorgan Johnston, JetBlue's manager of corporate communications, shares with CNN Travel that the airline is preparing for the December launch of flights to Colorado ski destination Steamboat Springs, but that travelers packing up to hit the powder won't need to worry about extra fees: \"The most popular [checked sports items] would likely to be snow skis or golf clubs, but both are accepted as standard baggage without additional service charge.\"\n\nPerhaps the most liberal when it comes to sports equipment is Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, since the carrier's focus on Pacific Northwest travel also means catering to guests seeking to enjoy the region's outdoor pursuits.\n\nThey are the only U.S. airline allowing kayaks as checked baggage, with the exception of on their smaller SkyWest- or Horizon Air-operated flights. Other airlines restrict kayaks to only the folding sort, which aren't the best choice for a kayaking tour of Washington's San Juan Islands or an Alaskan kayak-fishing expedition.\n\nEverything else\n\nIf you want to go to Alaska, feel free to bring wine back with you -- provided you're flying Alaska Airlines. ValentynVolkov/Getty\n\nFor some airlines, the realm of baggage fees is an avenue for creative promotions, and oenophiles with travel booked on Alaska Airlines will be happy to learn that the carrier recently expanded their popular \" Wine Flies Free \" program, which allows passengers to check for free a case of wine (up to 12 bottles) from vineyards in the states of Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and now, California.\n\n\"The bottom line is that we fly to the country's best wine regions, and are eager to share these great varietals with our guests by making it easy to bring a case back home,\" Bobbie Egan, Alaska Airlines director of external communications, tells CNN Travel.\n\nFor airlines not as wine-friendly as Alaska Airlines, and for everything else, call your airline more than 72 hours ahead of your flight or, even better, before you book the ticket, with concerns or special baggage requests."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Samantha Beech and Ben Westcott, CNN", "title": "Three arrested in Australia after 'ISIS-inspired' terror plot foiled", "description": "Three men arrested in Melbourne Tuesday were suspected of planning a terrorist attack in a public place \"inspired by ISIS,\" Australian police said.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/19/australia/australia-isis-terrorism-arrest-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171216192657-australian-federal-police-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:20:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Police in Australia said they have foiled a terror plot \"inspired by ISIS\" in which assailants were planning to target a prominent public places in Melbourne, a city still reeling from a deadly attack two weeks ago.\n\nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said Tuesday that three people had been arrested in connection with the plot.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) This week, we will once again be treated to the awkward spectacle of the President pardoning a turkey while confused-looking children look on. Of late, that ceremony has been accompanied by a raft of opinion pieces suggesting the President should consider granting clemency to some humans, as well. I've written a few of those myself.\n\nAfter years of fruitlessly making that same argument, a more worthwhile observation might be this: The process used to choose which turkey might be pardoned is far more rational, efficient and effective than the one used to evaluate clemency for humans. In particular, the turkey-choosing process features four attributes sorely missing from the human one.\n\nFirst, it occurs regularly. Turkeys are pardoned every year, not just in the waning days of an administration. Second, decisions are made by objective specialists with the current chairman of the National Turkey Federation, or NTF, responsible for managing a thorough selection process . Typically, the NTF head will familiarize dozens of birds with human contact and saturate them with loud music before making a final choice. Third, there are defined criteria. The finalists are selected based on their willingness to be handled, their health and their natural good looks. Fourth, attention is paid to making sure they thrive after their grant of clemency. After the ceremony, they are sent to Virginia Tech's \"Gobbler's Rest\" exhibit, where they are well cared for.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the process of giving clemency to humans. For the past seven years I have worked with my students to prepare and file petitions on behalf of deserving clients, and have found that the procedure through which clemency is granted is irregular, run largely by biased generalists, devoid of consistent, meaningful criteria, and it does little to ensure success of individuals after their release.\n\nBoth pardons, which restore various rights taken away by the criminal conviction and are usually granted after a sentence is completed, and commutations, which shorten a sentence being served, go through the same bureaucratic maze. The first steps are within the Office of the Pardon Attorney, a division of the Department of Justice.\n\nThat, of course, is a part of the problem -- the DOJ, after all, is the entity that prosecutes these individuals in the first place. Within that office, staff members evaluate cases and provide a report to the pardon attorney, who decides on a recommendation after seeking out the opinion of the very US attorney's office that prosecuted the case.\n\nThe Pardon Attorney's recommendation doesn't go to the President. Instead, it is routed to an aide to the deputy attorney general, who makes his or her own recommendation to the DAG. At this stage, the heart of the problem with the clemency process comes into view. The DAG, after all, is neither a specialist nor objective; in fact, he or she is the direct supervisor of and closely allied with the United States attorneys in the field, whose offices chose to pursue the challenged convictions and sentences in the first place. Moreover, the deputy attorney general has myriad duties, which effectively bars the development of lasting expertise in this small part of his or her portfolio.\n\nFrom there, a staff member for the White House counsel evaluates the case and makes yet another recommendation to his or her boss. And, of course, that boss is both a generalist with a plethora of other duties and a conflict; this time, the tendency to protect the President from risk, something that is inherent in any use of the pardon power.\n\nAnd then the President decides whether clemency should be granted. When he or she grants a commutation, the release may be immediate. As with other returning citizens, there are often inadequate resources available to ensure successful re-entry into the community, and whatever was learned in the clemency process may have no impact on the abrupt adjustment to free society.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhat's missing is all the things that make the turkey process work. It's irregular, as inattention by any one of the numerous sequential evaluators stops the whole thing. And instead of objective specialists, we have decisions being made by the deputy attorney general, who is neither objective nor a specialist. The criteria are poorly articulated and currently issued by the stiflingly conflicted DOJ . And finally, there is little to no connection between the process and what comes after, as prison gives way to freedom.\n\nIs there a better way? Sure. Just take the process out of the DOJ and put it in the hands of a board, as most states do, and then have that board make regular recommendations pursuant to consistent criteria while monitoring outcomes.\n\nIf we did that, the clemency process would finally be at least as functional as the one that informs a silly holiday tradition.

William McRaven as a \"Hillary Clinton fan\" and backer of former President Barack Obama in a Sunday interview with Fox News.\n\nThe comments drew sharp criticism from former officials, rumbles of dissatisfaction from veterans and veiled expressions of concern that Trump -- or the highly charged political atmosphere under his administration -- may be nudging the strictly nonpartisan military into the arena of politics.\n\nEven as presidential defenders such as his counselor Kellyanne Conway argued that \"no president has shown greater respect for the military and the veterans,\" or funded it as generously, Trump's dig at McRaven underscored a more ambiguous track record on the armed services.\n\n'Unforced errors'\n\nThe President has insulted war heroes, prisoners of war, Gold Star families and, some critics say, tried to use the troops to score political points. He's directed 5% cuts at Veterans Affairs, which for some time he left in the control of non-veterans who happened to be members of his Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's neglected to visit combat zones, unlike other presidents, suggested troops' midterm election ballots not be counted, passed up Veterans Day ceremonies other leaders made time to attend and repeatedly said he knows more about military issues than generals do.\n\n\"These unnecessary unforced errors, when you attack people like Adm. McRaven and (the late Sen. John) McCain, it shows a lack of respect that's just baffling,\" said Melissa Bryant, chief policy officer at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and a veteran of the Iraq War.\n\nBut James Carafano, a vice president of foreign and defense policy at the Heritage Foundation, says any complaints about Trump's treatment of the military are just about partisanship.\n\n\"I don't think it's really an issue,\" said Carafano, who served in the military for 25 years. \"I think it's a partisan issue masquerading as a civil military issue.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump has yet to visit any US troops in combat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump has yet to visit any US troops in combat 03:34\n\nThe code and culture of the military bar active-duty officials from criticizing the commander in chief, and the emphasis on the importance of an apolitical service is underscored by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which states any officers who use \"contemptuous words\" about the President could face punishment.\n\nThat hasn't precluded serving officers from carefully making the distinction between military policy versus politics.\n\n\"We do have a very strong, nonpartisan, apolitical ethos in the US military,\" Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said at a conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sunday. He was responding to a question about the use of troops on the southern border to counter a group of Central American migrants headed to the US to seek asylum.\n\nThe deployment was widely seen as a campaign ploy, particularly after Trump stopped raising the issue as frequently after the midterms. \"We don't participate in politics, and we're very careful ... to stay in our lane and address the military dimension of the problem and not comment on policy,\" Dunford said.\n\nVeterans vote\n\nSome current and former military officials have made pointed remarks, though. Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of Central Command, Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of Special Operations Command, and McRaven have all praised the media -- a frequent Trump target -- and commented on the importance of a free press.\n\nSo far, veterans are sticking by the President and his party, at least at the ballot box.\n\nCNN's exit polls show that 60% of veterans backed Trump in 2016 and 63% supported Republicans in that year's ongressional races, while 36% backed Democrats. In 2018, the percentage of veterans backing Republicans fell to 58%, while 41% gave their votes to Democrats.\n\nEven so, Trump, on edge about contested Florida races in the midterm elections, tweeted to say that absentee ballots -- many of which are cast by troops, their dependents and contractors deployed overseas -- should not be counted.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBryant, at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, acknowledges Trump's successes on the military, including funding that Defense Secretary James Mattis described in March as \"the largest military budget in history\" and programs for veterans like a new GI Bill.\n\nBut she and other veterans said there's frustration that the President is quick to claim credit for successes and happy to bask in the reflection of the military's luster -- as when he floated the idea of a military parade in Washington -- but doesn't follow through on tough issues.\n\nThat includes addressing some of the long-term troubles inside the VA. Problems in implementing an expanded GI Bill have meant that thousands of veterans are facing eviction or don't have the money for gas, groceries or schooling because the VA is months late with payments. Thousands are suffering, said Bryant, listing the GI Bill disaster alongside a crisis in veteran suicide, housing, health care and support for female veterans as areas that need better leadership.\n\nBy the way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at American Cemetery in pouring rain! Little reported-Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2018\n\n\"These are things he needs to address, and he's never there to address the hard problems,\" Bryant said of the President. \"He's there only when he wants to tout achievements, and frankly they're not his alone -- advocates and lawmakers have been working for years on these issues.\"\n\nOn top of that, she added, \"there's the disrespectful angle.\"\n\n\"There's not visiting troops overseas, not once,\" she said, referring to combat postings such as Afghanistan or Iraq. \"He skipped the Paris cemetery when other leaders of the world made it\" for a ceremony to honor World War I dead, Bryant noted. Trump later said Secret Service had decided he couldn't attend because of weather and traffic issues.\n\nJUST WATCHED Critics slam Trump for skipping veterans event Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Critics slam Trump for skipping veterans event 02:17\n\nTrump also skipped out of a Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony at Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the river from the White House, though VA Secretary Robert Wilkie was there. The President told Fox News on Sunday that he had made a mistake in skipping the event.\n\nAnd then, Bryant says, Trump \"seems to have a trend of going after war heroes -- McRaven, McCain -- people who are viewed in the military space and more broadly as thought leaders, all because they criticize him. That's what's troubling.\"\n\nThe President's habit of belittling military expertise and military heroes was on display during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he said McCain was \"not a war hero\" because he'd been captured during the Vietnam War. Trump received several draft deferments during the war, one for bone spurs in his heels. The then-candidate also mocked the Pakistani-American family of a US soldier who had died in the Iraq War. And he said he knew more than \"the generals\" about the terror group ISIS or about \"offense and defense than they will ever understand. Believe me.\"\n\n'I ignore it'\n\nOnce in the White House, Trump refused to issue a statement about McCain's death a few months ago or use the word \"hero,\" settling instead for a brief tweet. He has publicly contradicted Mattis in tweets -- announcing in August that military exercises with South Korea would not continue a day after Mattis had indicated they would.\n\nAnd in an October interview with \"60 Minutes,\" the President returned to his claims that he's more of an expert on military issues than Pentagon staff, saying he knows more about the NATO than Mattis, who he described as \"sort of a Democrat.\"\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal told CNN there's \"a certain honesty to what's happening now.\" He noted that \"The President didn't go to Arlington Cemetery for Veterans Day, and maybe that's honest, because if you really don't care, it would be dishonest to pretend that you do.\"\n\nCarafano of the Heritage Foundation says the public should treat Trump's words the way the President himself does.\n\n\"We've seen him say terrible things about something to one person and then turn around the next day and say wonderful things about that same person. That's just how he expresses himself,\" Carafano said.\n\n\"You cannot craft a policy listening to the President's comments and tweeting. When he says something about an individual in the military, he doesn't see it as saying something about the military in general.\" Carafano added. \"I ignore it.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Curt Devine and Drew Griffin, CNN Investigates", "title": "Federal Air Marshals accused of more than 200 gun mishaps", "description": "When a passenger found a federal air marshal's loaded service weapon in the bathroom during a trans-Atlantic flight last year, the blunder became headline news.

It sparked public outrage, prompted an investigation and led to calls for reform.\n\nBut the misplaced gun debacle was hardly an isolated incident, according to documents recently obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration's Office of Inspection has documented more than 200 cases of air marshals allegedly misusing firearms or misbehaving with guns between roughly 2005 and 2017, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe cases ranged from seemingly mundane issues, such as improper storage of weapons, to situations in which air marshals allegedly jeopardized public safety.\n\nIn 19 of the cases, air marshals allegedly fired their weapons accidentally. For example, the documents state that in 2017 an agent based in Charlotte, North Carolina, \"unintentionally discharged a personally owned firearm resulting in a gunshot wound to his right foot.\"\n\nA 2013 case described an air marshal mistakenly firing his weapon inside a hotel room and damaging a television in an adjoining room.\n\nMore than 70 of the incidents relate to lost, misplaced or stolen weapons. At least three of those cases involved air marshals forgetting their firearms in airplane bathrooms. Two others involved weapons misplaced in airports.\n\nOn one occasion, an air marshal allegedly left his gun inside a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Totowa, New Jersey. In another, an investigation was launched after police found a \"range bag\" containing a gun box and ammunition in a school park.\n\nAt least 13 of the cases involved alcohol, including a 2012 case in which an armed air marshal allegedly flew on a plane while drunk and another in 2014 in which an agent was accused of being intoxicated during a firearms training session.\n\nThe TSA touts federal air marshals as elite officers who receive extensive firearms training that surpasses the standards within many other law enforcement agencies. In a statement to CNN, Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for the air marshals, said the cases involved less than 1% of its workforce.\n\n\"All reports of misconduct are taken seriously and fully investigated. When those investigations validate any misconduct, TSA takes swift disciplinary actions,\" said Kelly, who added, \"we are proud of the highly skilled and trained Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who keep our skies safe every day.\"\n\nThe documents from TSA's Office of Inspection, which audits and inspects TSA operations, do not stipulate whether the allegations of misconduct were substantiated, or whether the air marshals involved were disciplined. The records also did not identify the employees by name.\n\nTSA has investigated 35 incidents in which air marshals were alleged to have unintentionally or inappropriately discharged or brandished weapons between 2007 and 2017. Of those, 27 incidents were substantiated and resulted in disciplinary action, while eight were cleared with no action taken.\n\nTSA did not share the number and outcome of investigations of other types of alleged misconduct involving firearms described in the documents.\n\nHow the cases compare to rates of misconduct with firearms within other law enforcement agencies is unclear because the total number of air marshals is classified. However, former air marshals say any mishap with a firearm is unacceptable because of the unique sensitivity of aviation security.\n\n\"When you're in an airport around thousands of people or in an airplane that's essentially a small tube 30,000 feet in the air, you have to be incredibly accurate. You can't make mistakes,\" said Henry Preston, a former air marshal and training instructor who retired in 2014.\n\nPreston and four other former air marshals reached by CNN said they observed inconsistencies in \"recurrent training\" during their time with the Federal Air Marshal Service, such as disagreements among instructors on how to enforce marksmanship and safety standards.\n\nAir marshals are required to undergo recurrent training that includes quarterly marksmanship evaluations and annual off-range safety courses, but a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found the air marshal service did not have complete and timely data on the extent to which its officers completed that training. Kelly, the air marshal spokesman, said TSA has implemented the GAO's recommendations on how to better evaluate air marshal training.\n\nThree of the cases in the documents obtained by CNN related to misconduct during firearms training.\n\nIn 2013, for example, an air marshal instructor \"committed egregious safety violations\" by allegedly throwing a handful of expired simulation ammunition into an open fire during a training exercise, according to the records. The ammunition exploded and flying debris hit one staff member in the face, the documents state.\n\nDaniel Kowal, a current supervisory air marshal and section chief at the agency's training facility near Atlantic City, New Jersey, said that while any case of misconduct is embarrassing, the Federal Air Marshal Service prides itself on rigorous firearms training and strives for zero errors.\n\n\"When we hear incidents like this, we immediately convene a panel to address them and we look at what was the underlying cause, what happened, if and when the training failed, how and why did it fail, and how do we plug that gap,\" Kowal said.\n\nIn addition to recurrent training, all air marshals must first go through a 16-week training course that starts with basic law enforcement techniques, taught in New Mexico, and ends with more advanced weapons-handling and other skills taught at the Atlantic City facility, where CNN observed training in action.\n\nKowal said air marshals must achieve a minimum marksmanship score of 255 out of 300, which he described as the highest firearms qualification standard in federal law enforcement, and he said air marshals have an average individual score of about 283.\n\nBrian Borek, who represents air marshals as agency president at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told CNN some field offices do an excellent job with recurrent training, while disparities exist at others because of limitations on size, resources and personnel. He said that doesn't make them less effective, \"just different and limited.\"\n\n\"These challenges are not unique to FAMS agency, however. This exists at all large-scale organizations. This in no way translates to the readiness or skill set of air marshals. They are the best in the world,\" Borek said.\n\nThe incidents of misconduct with firearms adds to a history of controversies that have plagued the Federal Air Marshal Service. Several former air marshals reached by CNN said that in addition to inconsistencies in recurrent training, grueling hours, low morale and even alcoholism affect the mission-readiness of many air marshals.\n\n\"There are systemic problems within the culture that affect the men and women doing the job,\" said Clay Biles, a former air marshal who wrote a book about the agency, titled \"Unsecure Skies.\"\n\nIn 2012, a commissioned study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine of Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School found that 75% of air marshals flying domestic missions were sleep-deficient. The study stated air marshals suffering from fatigue have increased risk of \"self-injury\" and \"greater incidence of serious errors.\"\n\nIn 2015, CNN reported that 10 federal air marshals had killed themselves since 2002, and representatives of the Air Marshal Association said job stress contributed to those deaths. At least two of the cases in the TSA Office of Inspection documents obtained by CNN involved alleged suicides by air marshals.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April that the TSA has had to monitor whether air marshals show up for their flights sober. The TSA said its Office of Inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure mission readiness.\n\nSome government reports have indicated money spent on some air marshal programs would be more effective in funding other forms of aviation security. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that the air marshal service's \"contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable.\"\n\nA document obtained by CNN in August showed a TSA proposal to reduce the federal air marshal program that would save the agency nearly $39 million per year.\n\nJohn Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University who has assessed the efficiencies of various forms of aviation security, argues that the costs of air marshals outweigh their benefits. He recommends training and arming more pilots to resist hijackers and adding secondary cockpit barriers.\n\nReferring to air marshals, Mueller said, \"They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them. There are much less expensive security measures, which could replace them and save lots of money.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "(CNNEspa\u00f1ol.com)", "title": "Ivanka Trump us\u00f3 una cuenta personal para correos electr\u00f3nicos sobre asuntos del gobierno", "description": "El uso de Ivanka Trump de una cuenta de correo electr\u00f3nico privada traer\u00e1 comparaciones a la ex secretaria de Estado Hillary Clinton, cuyo uso de un servidor de correo electr\u00f3nico privado en lugar de una cuenta de correo electr\u00f3nico del gobierno durante su ti\u2026", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/19/ivanka-trump-uso-una-cuenta-personal-para-correos-electronicos-sobre-asuntos-del-gobierno/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/180802093438-01-ivanka-trump-08022018-super-tease.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:40:02Z", "content": "(CNN) - El a\u00f1o pasado, Ivanka Trump us\u00f3 a menudo una cuenta de correo electr\u00f3nico personal para discutir o transmitir asuntos oficiales de la Casa Blanca, seg\u00fan correos electr\u00f3nicos publicados el lunes por un grupo de vigilancia no partidista.

And he got the President to divulge new details about the written answers he has prepared for special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThroughout the nearly 30-minute interview, which aired on Sunday, Trump made a series of statements that require fact-checking or additional context. Here are five key examples.\n\nTrump says he didn't know Whitaker's anti-Mueller views\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: You have already made at least one big change, naming Matt Whitaker as your acting -- attorney general.\n\nTRUMP: Yes\n\nWALLACE: He has a long record of speaking out against the Special Counsel and his probe... Did you know, before you appointed him, that he had that record and was so critical of Robert Mueller?\n\nTRUMP: I did not know that. I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\n\nFact-check:\n\nWith this answer, Trump drew a line in the sand, stating unequivocally that he never knew about Whitaker's With this answer, Trump drew a line in the sand, stating unequivocally that he never knew about Whitaker's well-documented public criticism of Mueller and his ongoing investigation. This denial is difficult to take at face value. The entire reason Trump spent more than a year lashing out at Sessions was over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. It's hard to imagine that, given how much vitriol he spewed at Sessions over his recusal, Trump wouldn't make sure his new attorney general shared his views on Mueller.\n\nOn top of that, CNN previously reported that people close to Whitaker advised him that he could draw Trump's attention by ramping up his television appearances. In 2017, Whitaker was a CNN legal contributor, and criticized Mueller on CNN programming, before he joined the Justice Department. It's unclear whether this press strategy worked -- but Trump is an avid consumer of CNN and cable news.\n\nAlso, Trump's response could come into play in the future if House Democrats, who are already scrutinizing Whitaker, subpoena Whitaker to testify under oath about his appointment to the top job.\n\nTrump whitewashed Whitaker's attacks against Mueller\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: And when you found that out?\n\nTRUMP: I don't think it had any effect. If you look at those statements -- those statements that can -- they really can be viewed really either way, but I don't think will have anything...\n\nFact-check:\n\nTrump claimed that Whitaker's past statements about Mueller \"can be viewed really either way.\" Which statements is the President reading? It's difficult to look at Whitaker's comments, either individually or in total, as anything other than strong and consistent opposition to the Mueller investigation.\n\nWith this misleading claim, Trump is painting Whitaker as an even-handed overseer for Mueller. This whitewashes Whitaker's comments, which were solidly in the anti-Mueller camp.\n\nHe shared an article that called on Trump not to cooperate with the \"Mueller lynch mob.\" And he dismissed the notorious Trump Tower meeting as an ordinary political move\u2014 despite the consensus that such a meeting with foreign citizens would be anything but routine.\n\nWhitaker has echoed Trump's oft-repeated talking points: there was no collusion and no obstruction. And in a CNN op-ed last year, Whitaker publicly urged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to block Mueller from investigating Trump's personal finances.\n\nTrump brought back the Peter Strzok conspiracy\n\nTranscript:\n\nTRUMP: From the day I announced. I was looked at as a candidate with nothing, no proof, with phony people like McCabe and Strzok and his lover -- you had Lisa Page, his lover. These people were looking at me, they wanted an insurance policy just in case I won or Hillary lost, and this was the insurance policy.\n\nFact-check:\n\nTrump resurrected one of his favorite attacks against what he calls the \"deep state,\" criticizing former FBI agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who was an FBI lawyer. The now-infamous duo was involved in an extramarital affair and were both involved in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and, to a lesser degree, the early stages of the Russia investigation.\n\nDuring their affair in 2016, Strzok and Page texted on government phones, and many of those messages have since been publicly released by House Republicans. One of those messages mentioned an \"insurance policy\" while alluding to the possibility Trump would become president.\n\nTrump and his allies claimed this is a smoking gun, proving that anti-Trump forces in the FBI hatched a plan to falsely launch the Russia investigation and undermine Trump if he ever won.\n\nThe Department of Justice's internal watchdog did an investigation and didn't find any evidence supporting the anti-Trump conspiracy. The 568-page report also provided Strzok's explanation of the \"insurance policy\" text: He was saying that the FBI should aggressively probe early hints of Trump-Russia collusion, even though Trump trailed in the polls and seemed unlikely to win.\n\nTrump claims he wrote his answers to Mueller\n\nTranscript:\n\nWALLACE: Your team is preparing written answers to questions about --\n\nTRUMP: No, no, no, not my team. I'm preparing written answers. My -- I -- I'm the one that does the answering.\n\nYes, are they writing them out?\n\nWALLACE: Yes.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. They're writing what I tell them to write.\n\nFact-check:\n\nCNN reported that Trump spent much of last week working with his lawyers on Mueller's questions. And in the Fox News interview, Trump claimed that he personally dictated the responses. There's no way to check this without seeing the answers, and they are still secret.\n\nBut we already have some insight into how Trump might answer Mueller's questions if given the chance, thanks to Bob Woodward's bombshell book \"Fear: Trump in the White House.\"\n\nIn the book, Woodward describes how Trump's then-lawyer John Dowd sat the President down for a practice-run, to answer questions he might get during an in-person interview with Mueller. Woodward reported that the sessions turned into a disaster, with Trump launching into a verbal assault against former FBI Director James Comey and repeating several falsehoods.\n\nTrump points to Article II as obstruction defense\n\nTranscript\n\nTRUMP: Well there was no obstruction of justice.\n\nWALLACE: I -- I'm -- let me -- if i might, sir, just ask\u2014\n\nTRUMP: I think they'd probably agree with me.\n\nWALLACE: If I may ask the question\u2014\n\nTRUMP: And all you have to do is look at Article II.\n\nFact-check:\n\nAsked by Wallace if the answers he's submitting to Mueller address obstruction of justice, Trump interjects to say there was no obstruction of justice, adding, \"All you have to do is look at Article II.\"\n\nTrump is referencing Article II of the US Constitution, and echoing a theory that his lawyers put forward earlier this year. CNN has reported that Trump's lawyers believe he didn't obstruct justice by firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 because he can fire anyone he wants thanks to his Article II powers. They detailed this legal argument in a letter to Mueller sent in January, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe letter represents the view of Trump's lawyers on this question, not the final, litigated answer. This is part of an underlying theory from Trump's legal team that he has extraordinary powers as the President, including that executive privilege prevents him from answering questions about the transition period. It's worth pointing out that these legal theories have not been fully-tested in the courts."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "(CNNEspa\u00f1ol.com)", "title": "Tiroteo en Denver deja varios heridos", "description": "Una persona fue declarada muerta en el lugar y al menos otras tres fueron transportadas a un centro m\u00e9dico.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/19/tiroteo-en-denver-deja-varios-heridos/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/181119194105-colorado-shooting-11-19-super-169.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:55:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - Al menos cuatro personas recibieron disparos en el centro de Denver, seg\u00fan el portavoz del Denver Health Medical Center, Simon Crittle.\n\nUna persona fue declarada muerta en el lugar y al menos otras tres fueron transportadas al Denver Health Medical Center, dijo Crittle.\n\nShooting Update: The injuries suffered by the three victims transported to the hospital are believed to be non-life threatening.
