They predict the wildfires won't be out until the end of the month\n\nPeople in these areas should minimize the amount of time they spend outside, experts say\n\nExposure to wildfire smoke in the short term can irritate your eyes, your sinuses and your throat. It can make you cough or wheeze, give you a headache and stress your heart, even if you are generally healthy.\n\nFor children, who breathe faster and tend to take in more of the polluted air than adults, this can be especially aggravating to still-developing lungs. For the elderly, who typically have more chronic conditions than younger adults, the wildfires can exacerbate those conditions. People with heart or lung disease , as well as pregnant women , are also vulnerable to the health problems the smoke can bring.\n\nParticle pollution in the smoke is what puts your health most at risk. Fires burn trees but also destroy homes and businesses; the Camp Fire has destroyed more than 10,500 homes. In those structures are chemicals, plastics, pesticides, metals and other hazardous materials that add to this tiny pollution.\n\nThe pollution is so tiny -- 1/20th of a width of a human hair -- that it can travel past your body's usual defenses , and instead of getting breathed out, it can embed in your lungs, causing serious irritation.\n\n\"What's in the smoke from wildfires is, milligram per milligram, more toxic than tobacco smoke, although I certainly don't advocate smoking cigarettes, either,\" said Matt Kadlec, a senior toxicologist with the Washington Department of Ecology who has been studying the impact of smoke from wildfires. \"The nice thing about the lungs is, at least in healthy people, most of that pollution gets cleared out eventually. It might take about a month or so if you are healthy. If you have COPD or some other chronic respiratory illness, it can take longer.\"\n\nThe other problem is that these tiny particles can go into circulation in your body.\n\n\"We don't know enough long-term what the impact is if they get into your vessel walls, if it maybe can lead to early heart disease,\" said Dr. Brian Christman, a volunteer national spokesman for the American Lung Association and professor and vice chairman for clinical affairs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nChristman said research shows that exposure to smoke from wildfires can cause thousands of excess deaths a year and can lead to more hospital admissions for respiratory problems and cardiovascular issues.\n\n\"Definitely limit your time outside, and if you do have to go outside, the air tends to be a little better when it's cooler in the morning and gets worse during the day, but stay inside as much as you can,\" Christman said. \"With the air quality numbers we are seeing right now, even normal healthy people are going to have trouble.\"\n\nThere are other things you can do to minimize the impact of this smoke on your health.\n\nKeeping doors and windows closed helps , but the tiny particles can get into even well-sealed homes. To cut down on pollution, run central air conditioning if you have it, but keep the fresh-air intake closed and make sure the filter is clean. Also use a high-efficiency (HEPA) air-cleaning filter, but make sure you don't use one that makes ozone.\n\nWashington Department of Ecology spokesman Andy Wineke said when that state's wildfires were bad this year, the agency advised people who couldn't get an air purifier with a HEPA filter to attach a standard furnace filter to a box fan to help clean the air.\n\nDo not burn candles, fry or broil meat or even vacuum, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. All these activities can increase indoor air pollution.\n\nIf you have to go outside , use an N95 or P100 respirator, available in most hardware stores. Other dust masks and bandanas don't work with this kind of pollution.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMake sure the mask seals tightly to your face, because a gap means pollution can get in. The EPA says the masks don't work well for men with beards, because a good seal isn't possible with facial hair. If it's making it hard to breathe, talk to your doctor about using one.\n\nIn your car, make sure to keep the windows up and turn your air conditioner to the setting that recirculates air to reduce your exposure.\n\nWhen the smoke clears, the EPA suggests airing out your home to reduce indoor pollution.\n\nBecause the number of fires has grown over the years, scientists say they will continue to study their impact on human health.\n\n\"I'm afraid the consequence of climate change mean that we are going to see more of these fires,\" Christman said. \"This is going to be a growing concern for more of us in the future.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Nathaniel Meyersohn and Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN", "title": "Victoria's Secret CEO resigns", "description": "Victoria's Secret CEO Jan Singer has resigned amid a sales slump and competition from young companies challenging the brand's grip on the lingerie industry.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/business/victorias-secret-ceo-l-brands/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119171330-01-victorias-secret-111918-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:50:29Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN Business) Victoria's Secret CEO Jan Singer has resigned amid a sales slump and competition from young companies challenging the brand's grip on the lingerie industry.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported Singer's departure last week.

A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there's nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us. This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie, starring The Rock and Chris Pratt, or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.\n\nExcept this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it's potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections. So, what is really going on?\n\nThe story starts last April, when the Gaia satellite announced the locations and trajectories of 2 billion stars in the vicinity of the Milky Way surrounding our sun. They released the data to the public.\n\nScientists were then able to look at the data set to see if they could spot anything peculiar. In galaxies like the Milky Way, the most common behavior is that the stars orbit the center of the galaxy in a manner broadly similar to the planets orbiting our sun. However, there are some stars that exhibit unusual motion. About a year ago, astronomers identified some \"stellar streams\" passing through our celestial neighborhood.\n\nOne of them, called S1 (for stream 1), consists of nearly 100 stars of similar age and composition, orbiting the Milky Way in a direction exactly opposite that of normal stars. It's kind of like a handful of cars driving the wrong way down the highway, except with a much greater distance between them and with no likelihood of a collision. These stars are spread out over a few thousand light years and they will pass through the solar system's neighborhood over the course of a few million years.\n\nAstronomers identified S1 as being part of the remnants of a dwarf galaxy that collided with the Milky Way and was consumed in an epic episode of cosmic cannibalism. Dwarf galaxies are very small, typically about 1% the mass of the Milky Way. They can orbit larger galaxies and collide with the bigger galaxy, adding their mass to the parent. This is what appears to have happened in the case of S1, although the process has taken probably a billion years.\n\nDwarf galaxies often have a disproportionately large fraction of dark matter. Dark matter is a hypothetical and still-undiscovered form of matter that interacts only gravitationally. Scientists have proposed its existence to explain many astronomical mysteries, for example the observation that most galaxies rotate faster than can be explained by the known laws of physics and the stars and gas of which they are composed.\n\nWhile dark matter has not yet been observed, hypothesizing its existence is the simplest and most economical explanation for myriad astronomical mysteries. Averaged over the entire universe, dark matter is thought to be five times more prevalent than the ordinary mass of stars and gas and planets.\n\nIn dwarf galaxies, the fraction of dark matter is often higher. In Fornax, a well-studied dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, researchers estimate that the dark matter is between 10 and 100 times greater than the mass found in its stars.\n\nIf that number holds for S1, the dark matter of the S1 stream is passing through the Earth at a much higher velocity than the more ordinary dark matter that orbits the Milky Way -- about twice as fast. It is thought that S1 dark matter is flying through the solar system at a speed of about 550 km/s, or about 1.2 million mph. While these numbers are impressive, they are misleading. Dark matter, if it exists, is extremely diffuse and it will have no discernible effect on the solar system.\n\nBecause dark matter hasn't been observed yet, these velocity numbers are speculative, although they are strongly supported by a very large body of evidence. However, the prospect of high velocity dark matter flying through the Earth has suggested an opportunity to detect it.\n\nIn a paper in the prestigious journal Physical Review D, researcher Ciaran O'Hare and his collaborators calculated the possibilities of discovering dark matter using both existing and proposed dark matter detectors. They considered two varieties of dark matter particles: a very heavy kind called a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) and a very light kind called an axion. Because the ultimate nature of dark matter is not known, it is important to be open to all possibilities.\n\nThey found that the detectors they evaluated could find WIMPs for certain ranges of the particle mass. However, when they looked at the axion possibility, it appeared the prospects were even better. Because of its light mass and the manner in which an axion would interact with the detector, the apparatus simply has a better chance of seeing the axion. (If axions exist, of course.)\n\nExperiments with names like ADMX MADMAX and ABRACADABRA are able or will be able to search for the signatures of dark matter proposed in the recent paper. They consist of technologies that are designed to interact with axions in a strong magnetic field and convert them to ordinary microwaves or radio waves that can be easily detected.\n\nFor more opinion...

There is no need for an action hero to save us. However, the synergy of science is staggering. A careful catalog of nearby stars has opened the prospect of a better possibility of finding and identifying dark matter, which is one of the great unanswered mysteries of modern physics. It's an amazing time we live in, in which we can study such things.\n\nI'm excited."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Katelyn Polantz, CNN", "title": "Mueller argues Whitaker appointment has no impact in ongoing subpoena fight", "description": "The appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker two weeks ago should have no effect on an ongoing court challenge that questions the constitutionality of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment, the Justice Department argued in a new court fi\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/politics/mueller-whitaker-appointment/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180831102829-06-robert-mueller-lead-image-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:24:34Z", "content": "(CNN) The appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker two weeks ago should have no effect on an ongoing court challenge that questions the constitutionality of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment, the Justice Department argued in a new co\u2026 [+2432 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) The appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker two weeks ago should have no effect on an ongoing court challenge that questions the constitutionality of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment, the Justice Department argued in a new court filing Monday.\n\n\"The President's designation of Acting Attorney General Matthew G.

They never got an official alert to evacuate, but they had 15 minutes to grab what they could.\n\nShe managed to rescue her cat, Twila. The family's other cat, an orange tabby named Ember, is still missing.\n\nThe high school student is grateful she escaped safely to Chico, but there was one thing she wished she had taken.\n\n\"I wish I grabbed my guitar,\" Smalley said. \"I would play it every day, so I was sad when I didn't have that anymore. I did however grab my camera, my computer, and a box full of my Polaroid pictures.\"\n\nPhotography holds a special place in Smalley's heart, especially during a time when she and her community have lost almost everything.

They had moved to Paradise seven months ago and were still unpacking.\n\n\"One thing we learned is having all our important documents and photos on hard drives. They happened to be all in one location,\" Clunies-Ross told CNN. \"That's what saved that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the family's clothes and their toiletries were already packed, left from a trip to Oregon the week before. Having some essentials ready gave Clunies-Ross the time to pack her medications.\n\nWhen she got to her closet, she started at her clothes. She didn't know what to take or how to pack them. She left them hanging there.\n\n\"I think in crisis you don't have the brain power to make any sense of anything. Even if there was a list you had, I don't think it would make sense of the time,\" she said.\n\nClunies-Ross is a nurse midwife and an emergency provider, yet she lost her calm while in a 15-minute frenzy to grab whatever she could. \"I couldn't save my life if I had to. I was just on the verge of losing it,\" she said.\n\nShe had sent her husband and two children on their way in the other car, as she was on call at the hospital, she said. She still hadn't received an alert to evacuate.\n\nThe 39-year-old made several trips to her car and noticed the fire was spreading quickly. A fire had appeared in her front lawn and the next time she looked, a man came out of nowhere and put it out for her.\n\nA few framed photos, her daughter's stuffed bunny and some of her husband's favorite vintage T-shirts also made it out.\n\nTheir home, made of cedar, didn't make it. \"It looks like a house was never there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad I have my family,\" she said. \"At the same time, nothing else really matters in the mix of it all. Money can buy any of those things.\"\n\nPrized journals, family pets and two favorite books\n\nKim Stanwood Terranova was at her Malibu home and business when the first wildfire alerts started coming in late at night.\n\nLiving there for more than 25 years, she's had experience with wildfires and wanted to wait for more updates on where the Woolsey Fire was heading. Her friend from the Red Cross told her she should start getting ready to go. Nervous, her 20-year-old daughter pleaded for them to pack.\n\nShe gathered her passport and important documents and told her daughter they'd pack up a few things and assess the situation in the morning.\n\nIn the middle of the night, more alerts came -- the fire was coming at the 10-acre property from two directions, she said.\n\nStanwood Terranova's house was more than a home -- it was also her business and a retreat center she called a \"sacred place.\" She's a licensed spiritual counselor.\n\nShe sent her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend on their way and spent one hour going through the house and property. She opened the property's gates so firefighters could enter, packed items and she blessed each room of the house.\n\nStanwood Terranova stood in front of her library, asking herself what she couldn't live without. She took her two favorite books that she teaches from, each one filled with notes in the margins. Right above those, she reached for the many journals she's kept over the past 20 to 30 years, as well as the ones she wrote for her two children.\n\nShe took her computers, the start of the book she's been writing and all her business contacts.\n\nShe forgot to take any clothes with her, having to purchase some after she evacuated. She left a \"beautiful necklace sitting on the counter,\" but said she didn't care.\n\nHer two bull mastiffs, Brando and Juliet, were the first thing she loaded in the car and then came whatever else there was room for. Otherwise there wasn't much. \"I truly thought I was coming home,\" she said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., she evacuated for Ojai.\n\nShe later found out her home and business were destroyed by the fire. Her godson took a photo of it when he saw her property on TV.\n\n\"I feel more blessed that I know what happened to my house,\" she said. \"I'm nervous to pull up and deal with that level of emotions but at least I know.\"\n\nA change of clothes, medications and a guitar\n\nTwo shirts, a pair of pants, a pair of shorts and the shoes on his feet are what Phil Bartek grabbed in the short time he had to leave.\n\nBartek never received an alert to evacuate Paradise. He only had 15 minutes to leave.\n\nA caddy holding his medications and his guitar also came with him. He managed to find and save his cat, Kobe, before heading out.\n\nThe 63-year-old grabbed what he could, but he knew he had another stop to make: his granddaughter's school. He managed to save her family's dog, LC, from their home after that.\n\nBartek wishes he would have remembered to grab his wedding rings. The retiree is engaged and the wedding is set for February. The homemade wedding decorations were lost in the fire, as was his entire house.\n\nBartek described the scene outside as he evacuated as \"Armageddon. Sky was dark, burning embers falling from the sky, wind blowing, people driving like maniacs on the wrong side of the road and on sidewalks and bike paths,\" he said.\n\nIt was one of the scariest moments he said he's ever experienced."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Donna Borak, CNN", "title": "War of words: Trump and Xi spar over trade ahead of Argentina meeting", "description": "The United States and China were preparing to hold high-level trade negotiations in Washington until an escalating war of words between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping prompted Chinese negotiators to cancel their plans.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/politics/us-china-washington-trade-talks/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181102151622-02-trump-xi-china-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:19:43Z", "content": "Washington (CNN Politics) The United States and China were preparing to hold high-level trade negotiations in Washington until an escalating war of words between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this weekend prompted Chinese negot\u2026 [+5389 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN Politics) The United States and China were preparing to hold high-level trade negotiations in Washington until an escalating war of words between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this weekend prompted Chinese negotiators to cancel their plans.\n\nNow, Trump and Xi are heading for a showdown over trade at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina , a month before US tariffs on imports are set to balloon to 25% on January 1.\n\nThe collapse of preliminary meetings ahead of the G20 leaves the two leaders without the extensive staff-negotiated draft agreements typical of most international talks, and in part reflects Xi's conviction that after months of tit-for-tat tariff announcements, a deal can only be struck with Trump himself.\n\n\"The level of uncertainty is unprecedented,\" said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council. \"The probability of coming to, if you will, a clean, comprehensive agreement has declined considerably.\"\n\nA delegation from Beijing, which had been due to arrive in the US after Thanksgiving, canceled plans on Sunday, a move first reported by the South China Morning Post and confirmed by CNN.\n\nThat move came after the Chinese delegation postponed a trip to Washington last week, according to Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"They have continued to suspend the decision on whether or not to come, and therefore, the chances of Vice Premier Liu He coming are slim to none,\" Brilliant said.\n\nThe upcoming Argentina meeting is the only imminent opportunity for a direct encounter between Trump and Xi before the January 1 deadline.\n\n\"The stake are pretty high,\" Brilliant added. \"There's still a big gap between the two sides. Now we'll see how much their personal relationship will come into play because the market wants another signal about where this relationship is going.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the White House and Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nAsked about the cancellation at a briefing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the economic teams of both countries remain in close contact following a phone conversation between Trump and Xi two weeks ago. He declined to provide any further details on any events tied to the upcoming G20 meeting.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared to throw the ball into Beijing's court, echoing a position taken by others in the administration as well\n\n\"On a trade deal, you never know,\" Conway said. \"That's up to China, as well.\"\n\nShe added that Trump would move ahead with his threat to impose another round of tariffs on an additional $267 billion in goods if no agreement can be reached.\n\n\"I don't know why people don't take him seriously because he obviously went ahead and put the tariffs on and thinks that we should not have a $500 billion trade deficit with China,\" Conway said.\n\nThe tariffs, which are paid by American importers, are designed to shift pricing power to US producers on a wide array of goods and components, but have drawn complaints from small businesses worried that higher prices will dampen demand. It's also spurred concerns about renewed inflation, just as the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates in December.\n\nOptimism flared last week after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross floated the possibility that negotiators would meet in Washington ahead of the leaders meeting.

Johnson said. The gunman's first victim was a woman with whom he had had a relationship, Johnson said.\n\nThe gunman, Juan Lopez, 32, also died, police said. It is unclear whether he died from police gunfire or a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Johnson said.\n\nMercy Hospital named its employees killed in the shooting as Tamara O'Neal, 38, an emergency room physician, and pharmacy resident Dayna Less, 25, a recent graduate of Purdue University.\n\nThe hospital paid tribute to police and security staff, saying it was \"deeply saddened by the tragedy.\"\n\n\"Every shooting in America is a tragedy, and it is especially senseless when a shooting occurs in the healing space of a hospital,\" it said in a statement.\n\nChicago police identified the deceased officer as Samuel Jimenez, a father of three.

As they started arguing, a friend of the woman attempted to intervene.\n\nThe gunman lifted his shirt and revealed a handgun, prompting the friend to flee. Two 911 calls in rapid succession reported an assault and then gunshots, Johnson said.\n\nWhen officers responded to the scene, the gunman opened fire on them before they could exit their vehicle. Officers followed him into the hospital and exchanged gunfire with him, Johnson said.\n\nDuring the shootout, Jimenez was fatally wounded along with a hospital employee as she exited an elevator.\n\nThe officers \"saved a lot of lives because we just don't know how much damage he was prepared to do,\" Johnson said.\n\n'I don't even have words'\n\nPolice secured the hospital and patients are safe, the hospital said.\n\nChicago police say Monday's shooting began in a parking lot at Mercy Hospital.\n\nThe shooting drew large numbers of law enforcement and emergency responders. Vehicles with flashing lights cordoned off the blocks around the medical center.\n\nWitness Steven White told CNN he was in the emergency room when he saw the shooter firing at police.\n\n\"We heard some shots so we all ran to the emergency window; we see this guy out there, military style, shooting at the police -- pow, pow, pow,\" he said.\n\nWhen White looked outside he said he saw a person lying on the ground by the main entrance. The shooter turned around and opened fire again before running inside that entrance.\n\n\"I don't even have words to say how I was feeling,\" White said. \"It's sad, you can't even come to the hospital for treatment.\"\n\nAt least 15 medic units were sent to Mercy Hospital, Chicago Fire Department public information officer Larry Merritt said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois thanked law enforcement members for their response.\n\n\"My heart is with Mercy Hospital in Chicago tonight.

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) Holidays often provoke stress, especially in families strained by emotional tensions, economic challenges, or grief. After the 2016 election, however, that stress metastasized into a full-on cultural disorder: American Thanksgiving Anxiety.\n\nAlthough I'm pretty sure I'm the first to name it, there is real evidence of such a disorder. Social scientists Keith Chen and Ryne Rohla discovered that Americans significantly shortened Thanksgiving dinners in recent years, especially when spending the holiday with relatives of the opposite political party. Democrats celebrating Thanksgiving in Republican areas spent 20-40 minutes less time over the meal; Republicans visiting Democratic relations reduced holiday visits by 50-70 minutes.\n\nThanksgiving has become polarized. We only want to feast with our own tribe.\n\nIn the last year while speaking about my book \"Grateful,\" I've had conversations across the country about gratefulness, especially about the power of giving thanks to renew a divided country. \"We can celebrate together,\" I remind listeners, \"food, the bounty of the earth, the gifts of life and work, the pleasure of relationships ... and the call to serve others as we have been served.\"\n\nAudiences cheer this vision. After each speech, however, at least one person has stood up, launched into a tale of a relative ruining Thanksgiving by pontificating on politics, and asked: \"What can I do about Thanksgiving dinner?\"\n\nWith this question, dozens nod their heads in recognition, clearly worried about their own divided families at Thanksgiving.\n\nThis worried the researchers. \"Some people don't see losing dinner with relatives as a particularly large cost,\" commented Rohla . \"I've talked to people who are, 'Well, so what?' Personally I think it is concerning. To me it's a symptom of a broader decline in the social fabric of the United States.\"\n\nSo, what can we do about Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nFirst, if it is too hard to spend Thanksgiving with your MAGA-cap-wearing uncle or your sister in her \"She Persisted\" T-shirt, don't. But if you opt out, be sure you don't mope at home over a frozen meal watching football. Instead, volunteer. Serve dinner at a homeless shelter. Attend a religious service. Visit a cancer ward or a senior center. Invite international students to your house and make them a Thanksgiving meal. Do something on Thanksgiving that strengthens ties between people, even if it is hard to do with your own relatives. Reaching out to strangers can be the first step toward reaching out again to your own kin.\n\nSecond, if you must spend the holiday with a politically divided family, you can do some things to lessen anxiety, whether you are the host or a guest.\n\nIf you are the host, much of what happens at the dinner depends on what you do to make your guests -- all your guests -- feel safe and valued. Don't assume people will get along. Even if they don't fight about Donald Trump, they may well fight about other things that used to be less controversial -- like football or the weather. Be proactive about potential conflicts. Provide \"Rules for a Nonpartisan Thanksgiving\" at each seat. Make them funny: no throwing food; no fights over dark or light meat or jellied versus whole-berry cranberry sauce; no flipping between FOX and MSNBC during dinner.\n\nHosts can also encourage meaningful talk in ways that respect others. Have guests write down what they are grateful for, put the slips in a jar, and then have people draw papers and read the thanks of others out loud. Offer a \"menu\" of conversation starters. Ask each person to share a memory of a favorite Thanksgiving. Good memories remind people of meaningful family moments and may put present tensions in a broader context.\n\nJUST WATCHED History of the White House turkey pardon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH History of the White House turkey pardon 01:39\n\nIf you are brave, have your guests address politics directly. Ask those gathered when they've last had a meal with someone of a different political party or felt truly grateful for different opinions and perspectives. If you are a Republican, have a story ready from your own life about what you appreciate and what you've learned from your Democratic relatives (and the opposite for those of you who are Democrats).\n\nIf you are a guest, remember that you are responsible for your own behavior. If you have a good relationship with the host, call in advance and let him or her know you are feeling anxious about the visit. Ask your mother to say something to Uncle Joe before dinner -- to go easy on politics, to keep the conversation away from divisive topics, to remember that kindness is an important part of being family. Prepare strategies for maintaining your cool. Have a \"text-a-friend\" ready. Use bathroom breaks tactically. Deflect controversy with jokes. Take a long walk after dinner. Put your therapist on speed-dial. Bring the greatest dessert ever as a gift; if you contribute good food, it is harder for people to get mad at you. If you decide to engage a political concern, do so with both facts and humor.\n\nAbove all, have appropriate expectations. You aren't going to convert anybody over Thanksgiving dinner, but you might start a new conversation with an estranged relative that could continue into the future.\n\nFor more opinion...

But they might feel a little heartburn on the return trip home Saturday and Sunday, given the traffic congestion and dicey conditions in the forecast.\n\nAnd if you plan on playing the traditional touch football in New York's Central Park, you might need your parka.\n\nHere's the forecast for the long Thanksgiving holiday:\n\nWednesday\n\nMost of the country will be under dominant high pressure, bringing sunny skies from the Southeastern coast to the Central Plains.\n\nDon't blame the weather for your delays Wednesday. The thousands of extra people who don't fly very often likely are the ones who will slow down departure times.\n\n\u2022 NORTHEAST: A clipper will bring some snow across the interior Northeast. Behind this system will be the coldest air since last season (more about this later).\n\nOn Wednesday evening, some snow showers could develop around New York, but the biggest concern could be strong winds moving into the city, delaying flights. Airports in Boston and Philadelphia also may be affected, with wind gusts from 30 to 35 mph Wednesday afternoon and evening.\n\n\u2022 WEST COAST: There will be a few trouble spots. Major airports such as San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Oregon, will see low clouds and rain affecting departure and arrival traffic.\n\nAlong the California coast, Highway 1 and US 101 will have rain. Interstate 5 through the Central Valley will have showers. And snow is likely on Interstate 80 through the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThanksgiving\n\nDecent weather and the fact many folks have already headed out make this perhaps the best day to travel during the holiday week. However, if you are watching a certain parade at Herald Square in Manhattan, wear your long johns and maybe five other layers.\n\n\u2022 NORTHEAST: It's going to be a brutally cold day in the Northeast. Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington will all likely see their coldest Thanksgiving morning in nearly a century.\n\nNew York may even see its coldest low temperature for the holiday since weather records have been kept in Central Park. In 1901 and 1876, the low got down to 19 degrees Fahrenheit on Thanksgiving. The low in Thursday's forecast now is hovering at 17 F right before sunrise.\n\nGusty winds of up to 30 mph will lead to wind chills in the single digits for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nBoston won't escape the big chill either. It hasn't been forecast to be this cold there on Thanksgiving since 1901 and 1872. In both those years, the temperature got down to 19 F.\n\nThe wind chill will make it feel even colder. Boston will struggle to make it to 20 F on Thursday, with 35-mph winds creating a wind chill of minus 5 to 10 degrees.\n\nWind chill advisories are already posted for parts of upstate New York and New England, with Thanksgiving shaping up to be the coldest on record for many in the region.\n\nDon't expect the temperature to get above freezing -- except if you live in Washington, where it might warm up to 34 F.\n\n\u2022 SOUTHEAST: The region also will see below-average temperatures but nothing unreasonable. There will be some cloud cover or even a few showers along the Gulf Coast and across Florida.\n\n\u2022 MIDSECTION: The Plains and the Midwest will remain blustery. Some cloud cover will begin to move east throughout the day for the Plains.\n\n\u2022 THE WEST: The West Coast storm system moves inland. Rain spreads down the coast to Los Angeles and snow settles into the mountains west. It's a welcome sign if you are expecting to do a little Thanksgiving skiing.\n\nFriday\n\nYou might want to stay inside and consider those online black Friday deals this year.\n\n\u2022 SOUTHEAST: You can remain dry if you do your shopping early, but by evening the South is looking soggier.\n\n\u2022 NORTHEAST: Remember the coldest air of the season mentioned earlier? Friday morning lows will be even colder. The good news is the high temperature will climb a little higher than it did Thursday and the winds will have died down a little.\n\n\u2022 MIDSECTION: That rainy weather will be scattered like your leftover buffet, from Minneapolis down to New Orleans, starting midday.\n\n\u2022 WEST: Did I mention powder skiing? Seriously, you might want to consider waxing your board or skis before Friday. Rain continues for the West Coast, from Seattle to San Francisco.\n\nSaturday\n\nChoosing to fly Saturday? You are smart to avoid the Sunday crowds, but you are going to have to deal with some weather in the East.\n\n\u2022 SOUTHEAST: Have you ever heard of the wedge? It is a weather pattern that makes Atlanta feel like Seattle -- but only colder. The low clouds and light rain will likely contribute to delays at the nation's busiest airport.\n\nThis pattern can also make driving treacherous across the Appalachians. An icy wintry mix is possible for the mountains Saturday, from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania.\n\n\u2022 NORTHEAST: The timing is uncertain, but precipitation, most likely in the form of rain, will affect the region, leading to some moderate delays at the major airports and compounding delays already seen across the South.\n\n\u2022 MIDSECTION: Rain remains, with snow in the upper, upper Midwest (almost Canada).\n\n\u2022 WEST: Snow lingers in the Rockies, with leftovers for a little apr\u00e8s-ski. There are also some showers still in Northern California, but most of the West Coast just stays cloudy with less precipitation.\n\nSunday\n\nYou are stuffed and tired, and now you have to travel home. The forecast is still days out and could easily change, so take the following with a grain of salt.\n\n\u2022 NORTHEAST: It is never good when you start off the day with delays. That might just happen Sunday morning. Northeast metro areas could see rain early and throughout the day. Most of the wintry precipitation should stay sequestered farther north into Maine.\n\n\u2022 SOUTH: It looks like the misery of Saturday's rain will have subsided, but the residual hangover may still have some effect on travel. Low clouds could be an issue in the early morning.\n\n\u2022 MIDSECTION: A low exits the Rockies and brings snowy conditions from light snow in the front range, across Kansas. Most of Missouri stays on the warmer side, with rain mostly in places such as St. Louis.\n\n\u2022 WEST: It finally dries out, so you might be able to get a sunny ski session in before battling the roadways. The drive up and down the West Coast will be tremendously better than it was Wednesday.\n\nAll in all, the weather this week is much better than in previous years so most of you won't be able to use it as an excuse. Don't think you're going to be able to get out of turkey and turmoil with your in-laws."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Noelle Ike", "title": "Protect all your online information with one easy-to-use app", "description": "Protect your online information from cyber attacks with Windscribe's VPN, now on sale for just $59.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/cnn-underscored/windescribe-vpn-shop/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119164436-windscribe1100-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:49:46Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "CNN, CNN", "title": "CNN10 - 11/20/18", "description": "On our last show before Thanksgiving, we're updating you on Midterm Election results, an impact crater in Greenland, and the work to make biomass a power source.", "url": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/services/podcasting/studentnews/rss/~3/s0IDSI2pK6E/ten-1120.cnn_2346261_ios_1240.mp4", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:49:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Caroline Kelly, CNN", "title": "Founder of the women's march calls for co-chairs to step down", "description": "The founder of the Women's March is calling for the movement's current co-chairs to step down for allowing bigotry into their mission.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/politics/womens-march-founder-calls-leaders-to-resign/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180929080028-linda-sarsour-womens-march-kavanaugh-newday-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:47:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) The founder of the Women's March is calling for the movement's current co-chairs to step down for allowing bigotry into their mission.\n\nTeresa Shook, a lawyer and educator who founded the Women's March movement, accused the group's current co-chairs -- Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour and Carmen Perez -- of associating with bigoted outside groups and tarnishing the Women's March's initial goals in a post on her Facebook page Monday.\n\nThe co-chairs \"have steered the Movement away from its true course.

Democrats have won 232 seats heading into the 116th Congress; of the three uncalled races, they lead in one of them. Assume, then, that Democrats enter next January with 233 seats. Pelosi would need 218 -- a simple majority of the House -- to be elected speaker. If those 16 vote against her -- and no Republican votes for her, Pelosi has 217 votes -- one short of what she needs. One important caveat: Ben McAdams of Utah signed the letter but is currently trailing in his bid to come to Congress. So at the moment, that's 15 \"not Nancy\" votes, which is one fewer than the anti-Pelosi forces need to keep her from a majority. (CNN has a great tracker on who is against Pelosi and who is thinking about being against her.)\n\nWhat's fascinating about all of this is how truly unconcerned -- at least outwardly -- the would-be speaker seems. In a massive profile of Pelosi by Robert Draper that published on The New York Times website on Monday, Pelosi said this about those who have questioned her plan on how to lead the Democratic caucus next year:\n\n\"In terms of subpoena power, you have to handle it with care. Yes, on the left there is a Pound of Flesh Club, and they just want to do to them what they did to us.\" She shook her head emphatically. \"That's not who we are. Go get somebody else if that's who you want.\"\n\nThat last sentence is particularly striking: \"Go get somebody else if that's what you want.\"\n\nIt's also a nod to the fact that the anti-Pelosi crowd doesn't have a candidate to be, well, for. The only person considering the race is Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, although she has given no indication of where she is leaning. If Fudge says no, it's very hard to imagine any other Democrat challenging Pelosi.\n\nBut, her detractors would argue, that is beside the point. Because, unlike past failed insurrections against Pelosi, they aren't trying to beat her in the Democratic caucus vote -- where Pelosi will need only a simple majority of the 232 or 233 Democrats elected to the House. They are trying to beat her in the floor vote for speaker. And they're right that there is a difference there.\n\nIn 2010, following Democrats' loss of the House, North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler challenged Pelosi in the caucus vote. He got 43 votes; she got the other 150. In 2016, after Democrats failed to re-take the House majority, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan took on Pelosi. She won 134-63, a sign that there was a growing group willing to oppose Pelosi, but that that bloc wasn't nearly big enough to beat her.\n\nThis time around, the anti-Pelosi crowd is ceding the fact that they can't beat her in a caucus vote -- especially with no candidate. Instead, what they are trying to do is rob Pelosi of the simple majority she needs on the House floor, forcing her to either win over doubters on a second (or more) ballot or bow out. (A third option -- winning the speakership with the help of Republican votes, as President Donald Trump has suggested -- is a non-starter for Pelosi, who has said she will win with Democratic votes alone.)\n\nWe've seen something like this before -- except on the Republican side. After the 2014 election, conservatives opposed to John Boehner's speakership vowed they could keep him from a simple majority. All told, 25 Republicans voted against Boehner on the floor. That was less than the 29 defections he could afford. What's interesting about that vote is that six of the 25 Republicans voted \"present\" rather than vote for someone other than Boehner. Doing so lowered by six the number Boehner needed for a simple majority.\n\nWhich brings me back to Pelosi. It's not yet clear how many -- if any -- of her 16 detractors might consider voting \"present\" rather than voting for someone other than Pelosi. But if any did, it would reduce the number of votes Pelosi would need to win. Let's say, for example, six Democrats voted \"present.\" That would lower her \"win\" number to 215. Get it?

Nonpartisan polls taken within three weeks of the 2018 election were far more accurate t han the average poll since 1998.\n\nThe biggest test of 2018 was the battle for control of the House. There are two different ways to poll House races.\n\nThe most familiar is the generic congressional ballot, which usually asks voters to say whether they will vote for the Democratic or Republican candidates in their districts. From 1998 to 2016, the difference between the average generic ballot poll and the House national vote was 3.8 points. This year (with some votes still to be counted) it looks like it's going to be only 2.8 points, which is a full point closer to the result than the average.\n\nThe other way to poll House races is by individual district. Those polls fared just as well. Nonpartisan House polls have historically missed the mark by an average of 5.9 points. This year it was just 4.9 points. Again, that means the average district poll was a full point closer to the result than usual.\n\nThat increase in accuracy was driven in large part by the Siena College/New York Times polls , whose surveys made up the bulk of district level polling and had an average absolute error of just about 3 points. That's nearly 3 points better than average, which is off the charts good.\n\nStatewide polling also had a strong year, although it should be noted that Senate and governors' polling did pick fewer winners than usual.\n\nThe average poll in the Senate was off by only 4.2 points. The average Senate poll historically has been off by 5.2 points, which means this year's polls were a point better than average. Likewise, the average governor's poll had an error rate of 4.4 points. That's 0.7 point more accurate than the average governor's poll since 1998.\n\nBut there were also a number of cases where the polling had one candidate winning but the other candidate won the election. This year nonpartisan Senate polls called the correct winner 77% of the time, compared with 84% historically. Governor polls saw a nearly identical 76% of races called correctly, compared with 84% historically.\n\nWhy the difference? Much of it has to do with a lot of races forecast to be close this year. Over 20% of pre-election polls for the Senate and governor's races had margins of 2 points or less. Historically that's under 20%.\n\nYou can see that when you look at the averages in some of the individual states. The average poll in the Florida governor's race was off by 4.4 points, which isn't any larger than the average for gubernatorial polls this year. It just so happened that the race was tight and the polling error was enough to tilt the winner from Democrat Andrew Gillum in the polling to Republican Ron DeSantis in the results. The same thing occurred in the Senate race, where the average poll was better than average (just 3 points off), but the race was close enough for a polling error to flip it from Democrat Bill Nelson to Republican Rick Scott.\n\nThe fact that there were so many close Senate races was the big reason why my final Senate forecast had Republicans winning more races than just in states where they led in the polling average. History suggested Democrats wouldn't hold all of their small leads.\n\nThis wasn't a big problem on the House side, where the leader in 83% of district polling ended up winning the race. That's better than the 80% historical average.\n\nNow, you might be wondering if the polling misses this year were more likely to benefit Democrats or Republicans. Obviously, even if polling errors were smaller than average, it would be bad if one side benefited from them.\n\nThere were some states where the polls were biased. The polls were once again too favorable to Democratic candidates in Midwestern states like Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, though not in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. And like in 2016, the polls were too favorable to Democrats in Florida and Republicans in Nevada. Repeated patterns of bias in the polling is somewhat worrying.\n\nUnlike 2016, this year the errors tended to cancel each other out, as one would hope they would.\n\nThe average governor and Senate polls were about a point more favorable to the Democrats than the result. The average generic congressional ballot and House district polls were less than a point more favorable to Republicans than the actual result.\n\nOverall, the average poll was about 0.5 point more favorable to Democrats than the final result. In only one other cycle since 1998 did the polling have less of a bias toward either the Democrats or Republicans. In other words, 2018 polls were solid and without bias compared with the average cycle.\n\nI should point out that the accuracy of polling this year does not mean we're undergoing some sort of polling renaissance, where the polls will be awesome from now on. In 2020, the polls may be more inaccurate than they were this year.\n\nThe predictiveness of polling in 2018, though, does reaffirm that polling isn't becoming more inaccurate. As long as we recognize that polls are tools and aren't going to be perfect, they remain the best way outside of an election to understand how the public is feeling about the country."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Christina Maxouris and Brandon Griggs, CNN", "title": "When this high school volleyball team lost everything in the California fires, their opponents bought them new uniforms", "description": "The girls' volleyball team at Paradise Adventist Academy in Northern California made the state semifinals.

Some of the players had lost everything in the devastating wildfires -- including their volleyball jerseys -- and their match against Forest Lake Christian School suddenly felt less important.\n\n\"There were two or three (girls) that didn't have anything, they lost everything in the fire,\" Paradise volleyball coach Jason Eyer said. \"And four or five more didn't have their jersey or their shoes. More than half of the team lost something they needed for that night.\"\n\nWhen Eyer surveyed the players and their families about the November 10 semifinal game, the response was unanimous: They wanted to play.\n\n\"It was really good to have something normal in our lives to bring us together and bring our community together,\" said Paradise player Quincey Carter. So the team and its fans agreed to make the 80-mile trip south to Auburn, California, for the game.\n\nThere was just one other problem. Many of the players no longer had proper jerseys or equipment. Some were planning to play in T-shirts with makeshift jersey numbers written on them with Sharpies.\n\nSo when they arrived at Forest Lake Christian, they got a big surprise: An array of brand-new Paradise jerseys, along with kneepads, food and thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nIt started with three bins\n\nWhen he learned that Paradise would still be coming to play, Forest Lake Christian Athletic Director LaRon Gordon wasted no time. He set up a meeting with school administrators to see what they could do to help.\n\nFirst, they called the California Interscholastic Federation and persuaded them to waive the fans' entrance fee for the game. Then they contacted everyone they knew and asked for donations.\n\nThe Forest Lake Christian School volleyball team.\n\n\"We got out and called our friends, community, got on social media,\" Gordon said. \"And we set up three little bins outside the school (for donations).\"\n\nBy the next day, the bins were overflowing.\n\n\"The whole front of the school was jam-packed full of donations,\" he said. \"You couldn't even walk into the school from the front. You can't imagine it.\"\n\nThe night before the game, Gordon had another idea. He called a close friend and located a company that agreed to work overnight to make jerseys for the Paradise team.\n\n'A sense of hope'\n\nWhen the Paradise Adventist Academy team arrived at the gym they found their 12 new uniforms.\n\n\"We saw the jerseys with socks and kneepads and shorts and there were bags with jerseys and shoes,\" said Carter, the Paradise player. \"We don't even know how they pulled that together so quickly. It was just a feeling of overwhelming love.\"\n\nDonated new jerseys greeted each Paradise player, along with kneepads and other items.\n\nCarter said many Paradise fans drove more than two hours to watch them play, filling the gym with the largest crowd of the season.\n\nParadise lost. But their night wasn't over.\n\n\"At the end of the match they handed every girl on the team an envelope of $300 worth of gift cards for places for them to buy clothes,\" Eyer said. \"And they presented me with a box of gift cards and cash with over $10,000 for the families at the school.\"\n\nEyer said everything about that night made a difference to him and his devastated community.\n\n\"It might seem like a little thing, but these people had nothing but their clothes on their back,\" he said. \"We have now been helped in so many ways. The girls and I have talked about how when we get that opportunity ... it would be our turn to give back and try to pass (on) this generous spirit and sense of community.\"\n\nGordon, the Forest Lake coach, said he never could have predicted how quickly his community came together to help their less fortunate rivals.\n\n\"One of the biggest things it taught me is that we're there for each other in times of need,\" he said. \"It could have been me, it could have been our school.

The S&P 500 is trading about 9% below the record high it notched in late September. It would have to decline 20% from that all-time high to officially qualify for bear market status.\n\nBut under the hood, the bull market looks under siege. Morgan Stanley noted that more than 40% of the S&P 500 stocks are down at least 20%.\n\nOne of the big fears is that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates more rapidly than the economy can handle. Credit-sensitive parts of the economy, especially autos and housing , have already begun to slow. Wilson wrote that the Fed isn't likely to \"bail out\" investors by backing down from rate hikes.\n\nTellingly, the stock market is no longer reflexively bouncing back from declines. In 2018, the S&P 500 has averaged a slight decline on days when the prior weekly return was negative, according to Morgan Stanley. That hasn't happened since 2002.\n\n\"The only years the Buy the Dip hasn't worked was during bear markets, or the beginning of one,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nInvestors have dumped individual stocks too, even after companies reported better-than-expected results. That's not a healthy sign.\n\n\"In our view, when stocks sell off on good news, that's a bear market,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nGoldman Sachs: Buy stocks\n\nOf course, many on Wall Street believe this is just a mild a correction as the markets adjust to a slower growth environment. The US economy continues to enjoy a stronger performance than much of the rest of the world. And corporate profits are projected to grow solidly next year, even if it's at a slower pace.\n\nGoldman Sachs is continuing to urge clients to buy US stocks even though the Wall Street firm believes domestic GDP growth will slow to 2.5% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020.\n\nDavid Kostin, the Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, wrote in a report published late Friday that the S&P 500 will probably end this year at 2850. That's nearly 6% above today's level.\n\nNeuberger Berman reminded clients on Monday that market corrections have \"rarely\" gone on to become all-out bear markets absent a recession within 12 months.\n\n\"Volatility is not the same as a sustained bear market,\" wrote Erik Knutzen, the firm's multi-asset chief investment officer.\n\nNot a repeat of 2008\n\nThe good news is that not even the bears are calling for a repeat of the 2008-2009 meltdown that wiped out more than half the S&P 500's value.\n\nIn fact, Wilson previously argued this would be a short-term market downturn, known as a \"cyclical\" bear market. He said it would occur within a \"secular\" bull market, or one that lasts for a long period of time.\n\nOn Monday, Wilson said there's likely \"limited\" risk to the downside for the S&P 500 because valuations have already come down meaningfully. And it also helps that hedge funds and other active investors have reined in risk significantly.\n\nStill, Wilson urged clients not to get trapped by fleeting market rebounds.\n\n\"This is a bear market\" he wrote, \"and should be traded as such -- i.e. sell rallies rather than buy dips.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "This is how Black Friday began", "description": "A term coined in 1869 has become an annual event for retailers.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/cnnmoney/2016/11/23/black-friday-history-cnnmoney.cnnmoney", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161123163458-history-of-black-friday-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:16:25Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Weill is founder and chairman of NAF, a national network of education, business and community leaders working to ensure high school students are college, career and future ready. He previously served as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nToday, there are more job openings \u2014 roughly 7 million \u2014 than unemployed Americans. In other words, there's enough room in the workforce for every person who wants to join it. Yet more than half of firms in a recent Business Roundtable survey , \"believe that skills shortages are problematic or very problematic for both their company and their industry.\"\n\nThankfully, Congress recently passed the bipartisan Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act , which will direct $1.2 billion to workforce training programs. President Reagan first signed it in 1984, but this latest version includes some important changes. It aims to prepare students for technical careers by ramping up math and science education. And it devotes more resources to students in vulnerable populations, including low-income and traditionally underserved students. Most importantly, it encourages states' education systems to form \"sector partnerships\" with multiple employers and report on their partnership plans.\n\nThe Perkins Act is a huge step in the right direction. But federal dollars won't close the skills gap without help from the private sector. Businesses need to invest more time and resources in workforce development by offering technical training and internships to kids when it really matters: in high school. Companies play an essential role in preparing America's young people for opportunities in a competitive global marketplace. By the time kids reach college, it's often too late.\n\nCapital One has hired high school interns since 2014. These young people have amazed executives with their innovative ideas. One intern created an app to hail the company shuttle bus so it would stop running empty and wasting fuel. Another cut down cafeteria lines by suggesting the firm put cafeteria debit on company ID cards.\n\nVerizon has had similar success with hiring interns. For the last 10 years, Verizon and NAF, a nonprofit I founded almost 40 years ago , have partnered to expose students to career opportunities and learn about STEM fields through local academies across the country.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "CNN 10 - November 20, 2018", "description": "November 20, 2018", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/cnn10/ten-content-tues/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:55:39Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Story highlights This page includes the show Transcript\n\nNovember 20, 2018\n\nOn our last show before the Thanksgiving break, we're giving you an updated look of the balance of power in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, as Midterm Election results continue to come in.

I have a love-hate relationship with the game.\n\nI love the competition and strategy of the game but often hate the politics -- on and off the field.\n\nI love the the savagery of the game but can't tolerate boorish behavior in and around the game that denigrates and devalues women\n\nBut wow, do I love the beauty of a quarterback's tight spiral pass plucked out of the air by a Jerry Rice-like receiver; the power of a Jerome Bettis-like running back pushing through the end zone, the gnarly scrimmages across the offensive and defensive lines. But then, it depresses me that players risk their lives and their bodies for a game that has failed to put their safety first.\n\nIn football, the most magical part of the game doesn't even happen on the field. Not for me. I love the way football -- pre-President Trump -- has always made fast friends of strangers from all walks of life, women and men, who would otherwise never speak a word to each other.\n\nIt's no secret that the former secretary of state also loves football. Recently, Rice was rumored to be under consideration for the Cleveland Browns head coaching position when ESPN's Adam Schefter reported, somewhat facetiously, that Rice's name was on the Browns' wish list\n\n\"She [Rice] could be come the first woman ever to interview for a head coaching position ... everyone knows she would be an extremely long shot to get the job.\"\n\nRice's name has been tossed around by sports insiders for years. We know she's a lifelong Browns fan. Back in 2002, President George W. Bush said she wanted to be NFL commissioner after then-commissioner Paul Tagliabue stepped down. In hindsight, I always thought Rice would have been a smarter choice than Roger Goodell, who became commissioner in 2006. In 2013, Rice was the only woman selected as one of 13 members of the first College Football Playoff selection committee.\n\nInitially, I loved the idea of Rice getting into the game as a coach. A huge win for women, who no question have the intellect and mentality to lead a team. It's the opportunities that have been lacking\n\nThe NFL saw its first female coach in 2015: Jennifer Welter with the Arizona Cardinals. She started as summer intern and was hired part-time as assistant coach. Then came Kathryn Smith , hired in 2016 by the Buffalo Bills. Smith was the league's first female full-time coach, working on game plans and playbooks. She lasted a year. This season, there is Katie Sowers , hired full time by the San Francisco 49ers. The college game hasn't fared much better; Callie Brownson , the first female Division I college assistant coach, was hired at Dartmouth in 2018.\n\nThere has never been a woman as a head coach in any male professional sport. But now that women are making small inroads into the NFL coaching pipeline, it remains to be seen if they will get the support every coach must have to make it to the top job, or, be sidelined.\n\nRice herself isn't taking the coaching rumors seriously. But she's serious about women coaching.\n\n\"I love my Browns -- and I know they will hire an experienced coach to take us to the next level. On a more serious note, I do hope that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches... But experience counts -- and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches,\" Rice posted on her Facebook page.\n\nJUST WATCHED Female kicker makes college football history Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Female kicker makes college football history 02:00\n\nKudos to Rice for turning an idea many took as joke into a frank discussion about women's equality. And for keeping her sense of humor.\n\nTruthfully, I was insulted by all the Coach Condi talk. The job would be a huge step down for a woman like Rice. The Browns are perennial losers and one of the worst NFL teams . Come on, man!\n\nHere's a woman who sat on the National Security Council as director of Soviet and East European Affairs -- in the Cold War '80s. She was George W. Bush's national security adviser, then his secretary of state for four years. She's brokered Middle East peace deals and ceasefires, stared down drug lords and terrorists, expanded democracy around the globe.\n\nIt's ridiculous, and the epitome of chauvinism, to question whether a women of her caliber could handle leading a team of 53 men in tights to win football games.\n\nLet's not sell ourselves short in our eagerness for women's equality. Why take baby steps in situations when we've proven we can lead, compete and win on elite levels?\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nNext time we talk professional sports jobs for Condi, or any successful, powerful woman, let's start with Commissioner, General Manager, Team Owner, President.\n\nThere are plenty of smart, talented women waiting to fill those coaching and front-office spots.

As anecdotal evidence that women have to prove themselves even more than men to earn a job promotion, her story is hard to beat.\n\nLooking deeper, it's more complex than outright sexism. Strickland herself dismissed suggestions her career had ever been stymied by being treated differently to her male colleagues. Her explanation for why her intellect and achievements had not been recognised by promotion to full professor? \"I never applied.\"\n\nThat she had to add a Nobel Prize to her CV before she considered applying for her promotion is likely to resonate among women. Many sense they need to do more than their male counterparts to prove their worth in the workplace.\n\nBut is there any statistical evidence that women need higher credentials than men to be promoted and recognised in their own profession?\n\nMuch research on gender gaps focuses on comparing absolute outcomes. This doesn't help with this specific question. We need a way to directly compare men and women on the same rung of the career ladder.\n\nTo do this, I borrowed a methodology from productivity and efficiency analysis called stochastic frontier analysis. My findings: women have up to one-and-a-half year's extra education, and nearly a full year's extra workforce experience, than what is required for their job.\n\nMeasuring capabilities\n\nThis technique begins by measuring the overall capabilities of each worker. This is captured by their qualifications, years of experience, cognitive ability, language proficiency, health and traits that are shown to enhance productivity such as conscientiousness.\n\nNext, each worker's bundle of capabilities are benchmarked against workers at a similar rung on the career ladder. This position is captured by their workplace seniority, earnings and other entitlements (such as paid parental leave and flexible work arrangements).\n\nIt is then possible to identify those workers who possess a higher bundle of capabilities than the minimum required to reach their current position on the career ladder.\n\nThe Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey provides a broad sample of about 5,000 workers to study.\n\nComparing everyone else to the \"most economical\" performers -- those who have achieved their position with the lowest capabilities to their name -- I found women \"over-invest\" more than men in their skills and capabilities.\n\nMen over-invest by up to 4%. Women by up to 11% -- equivalent to a year-and-a-half extra education and nearly a full year's extra workforce experience.\n\nThese figures, using stochastic frontier methodology, avoid the distortions arising from simpler statistical methods like averages. We're looking at a distribution curve for capability \"overinvestment\" -- a curve that is not neatly symmetrical. At one end of the curve are the \"most economical\" performers. At the other end, in the tail of the curve, are the workers who are furthest away from the minimum requirement and have over-accumulated\n\nUncovering implicit biases\n\nThis technique allows us to test what factors are driving women's greater accumulation of credentials. Tellingly, this over-investment isn't directly connected to children and care responsibilities. Nor is it due to women's lower confidence, a hypothesis that I tested by including a variable called \"achievement motivation\".\n\nExisting evidence steers us towards implicit biases woven throughout workplace dynamics that create higher hurdles for women to clear along the career ladder.\n\nFor instance, analysis using Australian Census data finds women earn less from their university degrees, even when comparing men and women within the same high-earning discipline such as law, economics, dentistry and medicine. Survey data also reveals that women, when they do ask for a promotion, do not receive the same outcomes as men.\n\nInternalising higher hurdles\n\nThis body of research, and Strickland's story, is consistent with women tuning into -- and possibly internalising -- the need to jump higher hurdles.\n\nIt explains why women hold back from applying for a job until they are certain of fulfilling the criteria -- a behaviour much less apparent among men.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOrganisations need to more rigorously scrutinise whether their systems for assessing the merits of their male and female applicants are truly fair and equitable.\n\nFailing to recognise each person's capability isn't just a loss for the individual. All of society potentially loses out.\n\nTake the case of Carol Greider. On the same day that American molecular biologist was jointly awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) rejected her application for funding to pursue her research on cancer cells that won her the Nobel Prize. The NIH grants committee deemed her work \"not worthy of discussion\".\n\nIf we are to fully benefit from society's entire pool of knowledge and talent, that's the sort of blindness we need to correct."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN Business", "title": "Why investors shouldn't lose sleep over inflation", "description": "Inflation is bad news for investors.

And he holds both those titles at Renault, the French auto giant. Shares of both companies plunged on the loss of their visionary leader.\n\nWhen CEOs grab too much power, accountability and responsibility sometimes go out the window.\n\nThat lack of oversight can lead to fraud, such as with the demise of Enron under Kenneth Lay or Tyco under Dennis Kozlowski.\n\n\"You need checks and balances,\" said Ralph Walkling, founder of the Raj & Kamla Gupta Governance Institute at Drexel University.\n\n\"The board's primary job is to hire and fire the CEO. And the board is run by the chairman. When those two roles are combined, it can present an awkward situation,\" said Walkling.\n\nWhistleblower complaint\n\nOver his 40-year career, Ghosn became one of the most influential executives in the auto industry. He was the architect behind the global alliance of Nissan, Renault and Japan's Mitsubishi. The three companies employ nearly half a million people in almost 200 countries.\n\nNissan said on Monday that following a whistleblower complaint it launched an investigation that found Ghosn and board member Greg Kelly had been underreporting Ghosn's compensation. \"Numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets,\" Nissan said.\n\nNissan and Renault boss Carlos Ghosn was arrested on Monday in Tokoyo over allegations of underreporting his compensation. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\"Ultimate power can ultimately corrupt,\" said Bill Klepper, a management professor at Columbia University.\n\nNissan acknowledged that problem on Monday.\n\n\"Some things should be corrected like over-concentration of power and corporate governance,\" Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said during a press conference.\n\nBoards have long been pressured to break up the CEO and chairman roles. Keeping the roles together is tantamount to asking the president of the United States to also serve as the chief justice of the Supreme Court. The balance of power is slanted.\n\n\"If someone doesn't feel accountable, they may engage in inappropriate acts. They feel invulnerable,\" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\n'Undetected flaws'\n\nPlenty of corporate leaders have successfully held both titles. These powerful CEOs have been aided by the naming of respected lead independent directors charged with providing oversight.\n\nFor instance, Jamie Dimon is widely credited with steering JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) through the financial crisis. Dimon, chairman and CEO for a dozen years, has turned JPMorgan into the biggest and perhaps most successful American big bank.\n\nWith Jeff Bezos as chairman and CEO, Amazon ( AMZN ) has become the most dominant company in Corporate America, and Bezos became the world's richest person\n\n\"Some imperial CEOs can lead very successfully,\" said Walkling.\n\nBut he cautioned that the downside is also higher when there is that much power concentrated in one individual.\n\n\"The problem is if there are undetected flaws in your leader and you come upon allegations of misconduct, the company takes a hard fall,\" said Walkling.\n\nAnd a series of scandals at Facebook ( FB ) has led to calls for chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to relinquish some of his vast power . Zuckerberg has the majority of voting power at Facebook.\n\nImperial CEOs are less common\n\nEven though Zuckerberg has resisted calls to separate his roles at Facebook, the trend in Corporate America is moving in that direction, albeit slowly.\n\nFifty-three percent of S&P 500 companies currently have separate CEO and chairs, according to management consulting firm Korn/Ferry. That's up from 42% in 2011 and 26% in 2001.\n\nJust 7% of S&P 500 companies that named a new CEO in 2017 combined the CEO and chair titles, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. That's down from 30% in 2010.\n\nDespite its stumbles under Immelt, GE ( GE ) still has not done so. Immelt's immediate replacement John Flannery served as both chairman and CEO. Ditto for Larry Culp, who took over on October 1.\n\n\"A good CEO shouldn't fear a separate chair,\" Elson said. \"They should welcome it.\"\n\n-- CNN's Jethro Mullen and Daniel Shane contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "First East Coast commercial marijuana stores to open", "description": "Massachusetts has approved the sale of recreational marijuana for those aged 21 and older at two stores.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/11/19/massachusetts-recreational-marijuana-orig-vstan-bdk.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119142405-marijuana-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:48:40Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

As we approach the X-ray machines, my child and I go into guerrilla traveling mode.\n\nI've packed almost everything we need into my hiking backpack, the contents of which I lay out on the conveyer belt: the computer with Sesame Street episodes, a snack bag including two 8-ounce milk boxes (I alert security officials to the milk, which doesn't violate the 3-ounce liquid rule because it's for a small child) and jackets, belts and shoes.\n\nI carry her through the security screening machine -- she cries when I try to get her to walk -- and we wait for our things to clear security. A security official waves a magic wand over the milk. We get dressed, pack, buy expensive water and get to our gate on time.\n\nYou, too, can survive your flight and earn brownie points from childless travelers. As families head to the airport for holiday travel, here are a few of my family's travel-tested suggestions to have a better trip.\n\nDon't be that parent\n\nPlease decide now that you will not be that overindulgent, coddling parent who thinks her child is more important than everyone else on the flight. It's not true. Please don't act like it by changing a diaper on the tray table (it's happened) or handing squeezable yogurt to a child who will squirt it at his neighbor.\n\nDecide you won't ignore your child, either. Your pre-children travels with a Starbucks candy coffee and a crisp new magazine are over. You do not get to read a book or have a glass of wine while your child runs into the drink cart. Your goal is to get your family safely from Point A to Point B with the least amount of disruption to other passengers.\n\nStart preparing now\n\nA week before our departure, I make packing lists for my child and for me split into carry-on and checked baggage. (I check as much as I can.) Then I see if I can actually carry it all because I know I'll be carrying everything that isn't checked at some point. See my printable packing list\n\nEverything on the carry-on list must be useful for the flight -- snacks, diapers, entertainment, change of clothes and vomit bag -- or hard to replace like my driver's license. I assume a huge flight delay without access to drink or food, a potty accident and a vomit incident. I don't pack anything that can make a mess.\n\nHeading to the airport\n\nPrint your boarding passes at home. And don't head to the airport without calling your airline to see if the flight is on time. It could be a sunny day at home and storms halfway across the country have delayed your flight. Want to clear security and hear that news?\n\nHead to the airport early. You can nurse or change diapers anywhere but you can't race through an airport with an infant to catch your flight. Now that my child can walk, we still get there early. I always check my luggage as soon as I can, curbside if possible.\n\nGet a gate-check tag for your stroller at the gate (although some airlines now make you check it with your luggage). Don't assume there will be a pre-boarding announcement for people who need it. Ask. But if you can fit everything under the seats in front of you, wait to board until the plane is almost full. Why put your kid in a confined space until you have to? Change the diaper or go potty right before you board.\n\nRelated content Airline etiquette in the not-so-friendly skies\n\nFlying with baby\n\nWhen I first flew with my daughter after she turned 3 months, I dressed her in the cutest, pinkest one-piece footie outfit ever. (Footed means no socks or shoes to lose in flight.) I introduced her to every flight attendant I met. \"It's her first flight!\"\n\nIt paid off. The first class flight attendants handed us three bottles of water after meeting her. They also told me which bathroom had a changing table (if any) and let us get up to change her diaper when the seat belt sign was on (FAA: There was no turbulence).\n\nBreastfeed, bottle feed or use a pacifier on takeoff and landing. It helps their poor little ears. And if you're breastfeeding, wear dependable breastfeeding shirts and pack a good shawl or blanket to cover yourself up. And when all else fails, your child is more important than showing your boob. Also remember to bring enough food to deal with the hungries that always hit breast-feeding mamas hard.\n\nBeyond baby\n\nNow my daughter carries her own backpack, which contains a sweatshirt, change of clothes, a few toys and an empty water bottle. My backpack has the snacks, books, her favorite shows on my computer and a coloring book. I place wipes and extra vomit bags in the seat pocket in front of me, just in case. We make a bathroom visit before I take off her shoes (so she doesn't kick anyone). Then we start our fun afternoon of eating, drawing and watching movies. (Only if she's engrossed in a movie or asleep do I pull out a magazine.)\n\nIf you have older kids, you are not off the hook. They tend to regress during flight, whining about things they know how to handle at home. Sometimes they didn't get enough sleep before an early morning flight or their ears hurt or you let them have too much sugar. Dial back your expectations and ensure they have enough to eat and whatever electronic gadget they need for entertainment. Older children have even been known to cuddle.\n\nWhen it all falls apart\n\nWhen your kid is screaming or peeing through diapers or vomiting all over you, it's hard to believe you will survive. Yet I've had both of the scenarios listed above happen on one flight, and I am still alive. What counts is that you make an effort to limit the damage.\n\nIf your child is a screamer, apologize to the people around you in advance and hand out earplugs (one friend packs them for every trip). Buy seat neighbors drinks or expensive airline cheese plates."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Pelosi fighting to return as Speaker", "description": "CNN's Tom Foreman takes a look at the different scenarios and challenges Nancy Pelosi may be facing in the run-up to the vote for House Speaker.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/19/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-challenges-tom-foreman-pkg-nr-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119142755-nancy-pelosi-house-speaker-challenges-tom-foreman-pkg-nr-vpx-00001524-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:39:55Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

He then spent a further $305,000 refurbishing them.\n\nBut he failed to secure permission to use the cannon, the Mayor of London's office said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn 2015, Theresa May -- now Prime Minister but at the time the minister in charge of policing -- refused to authorize their use, a move that was seen as a snub to Johnson. For the past four years, the cannon have been languishing unused in storage.\n\nThe mayor's office said Monday that the vehicles were sold to scrap metal yard Reclamations (Ollerton) Ltd. in the north of England.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Clare Foran, CNN", "title": "Clyburn won't face challenger in leadership bid after DeGette drops out of race", "description": "Rep.

The news was first reported by CNBC\n\nThis summer, shareholders from both companies gave the green light for Disney to purchase most of Fox's assets for $71.3 billion. Disney is getting the company's movie studio, which includes franchises like \"Avatar\" and \"X-Men,\" along with cable channels like FX and National Geographic.\n\nDisney won antitrust approval from US regulators in June, but it had to sell off 22 of Fox's regional sports networks as a condition of that approval. The fate of those networks is still not entirely clear.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Commission also approved the deal . EU regulators required Disney to divest its interest in Europe in channels including History, H2, Crime & Investigation, Blaze and Lifetime.\n\nDisney says China did not attach any conditions to its approval.\n\nSome US-China analysts had speculated that China could slow walk its approval of the Disney-Fox deal to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States over trade. But the mere size of the acquisition, and the fact that it's not in a strategically important sector for China, made the prospect unlikely.\n\nDisney says it still needs approval from a few other regulators.

CNN Business spoke with Sandbrook twice in late 2016 after Trump was elected and once more in early 2017 after the inauguration.\n\nSandbrook voted for Trump. And at the time, he was optimistic that the President would make getting an infrastructure bill through Congress a priority. Nearly two years later and we're still waiting.\n\nAnd that's hurt the stock of US Concrete ( USCR ), which initially went from about $50 a share right before Election Day 2016 to a high of more than $85 a little more than a year later. Shares have since tumbled to around $35.\n\nDemocrats controlling House may boost chances of infrastructure bill\n\nBut Sandbrook said he's feeling good again, adding that people within the Trump administration and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress think infrastructure will be a hot topic in the coming months.\n\n\"I am encouraged by what I am hearing so far from the administration, Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats as well as Republican leaders in the Senate like Mitch McConnell,\" Sandbrook recently told CNN Business.\n\n\"I'm more optimistic now than I would have been with a Republican House,\" he added.\n\nStill, the lack of a big splashy infrastructure deal so far has hurt shares of many construction companies that were expected to be big winners of any legislation that led to more spending on fixing bridges, tunnels and highways.\n\nUS Concrete CEO Bill Sandbrook is optimistic that Democrats and Republicans will work together on an infrastructure bill.\n\nAfter all, both President Trump and his challenger Hillary Clinton talked on the campaign trail about the need for more infrastructure investments.\n\nThat's a big reason why shares of Martin Marietta ( MLM ), Vulcan Materials ( VMC ) and Eagle Materials ( EXP ) have experienced similar sharp runups and drops as US Concrete.\n\nSandbrook said he's hopeful though that now that President Trump has cut taxes, he might be looking to move on to tackling an infrastructure bill. Of course, the key question is how to fund it.\n\nSandbrook thinks Republicans would likely balk at any possible Democratic plans to roll back some of the tax cuts on more affluent Americans. But he thinks the two parties could find a common ground with a gas tax, for example.\n\nAnd he added that the recent wildfires in California, which some suspect may have been started by electrical power failures, are yet another example of why the United States must spend more on infrastructure beyond roads and bridges.\n\nInfrastructure isn't just roads and bridges\n\nEven if Congress and President Trump are unable to make headway on an infrastructure bill between now and the 2020 general election, Sandbrook is still hopeful that there will be a lot of demand for concrete and other building supplies.\n\nHe said that less than 20% of his company's overall sales are tied to infrastructure spending. The remainder is dedicated to things like office buildings, apartments and corporate data centers.\n\nSan Francisco is one of the company's biggest markets and the company spends a lot on making earthquake-resistant concrete.\n\nAnd Sandbrook is even optimistic that it can get a boost from Amazon's ( AMZN ) plans to build new headquarters in New York and outside Washington.\n\n\"Tech companies are spending so much money,\" he said. \"And now we have the wind at our back because of Amazon's Long Island City and Crystal City plans. Both are surrounded by US Concrete plants. It couldn't be any better for us.\"\n\nWhen will the market start to agree with that assessment though? That remains to be seen. But Sandbrook remains confident.\n\n\"investors were too optimistic in 2016 but they are too bearish now,\" he said. \"Sentiment about a pullback is overdone. Our backlogs are strong.

Pregnant women in Vancouver who were exposed to the highest level of environmental nitric oxide, an airborne, traffic-related pollutant, were more likely to give birth to children later diagnosed with autism, the researchers say.\n\nLief Pagalan, lead author of the study and a member of the faculty of health sciences at Simon Fraser University, cautions that the study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, showed only an association between prenatal exposure to nitric oxide and autism rates. It did not prove that air pollution caused autism.\n\nExperts emphasize that the exact causes of autism remain unknown, and some say the researchers in this study did not analyze every potential risk factor.\n\nStill, the research \"adds to the growing concern that there may be no safe levels of exposure to air pollution,\" Pagalan wrote in an email.\n\n\"Not only did we have access to rich data, enabling us to develop one of the largest studies to date, but we were also able to conduct this study in a city with relatively lower levels of air pollution,\" he said.\n\nMore than 100,000 children studied\n\nPagalan and his colleagues analyzed the records of 129,436 children born in Vancouver from 2004 through 2009.\n\n\"We analyzed air pollution data in Vancouver over the same period to assess air pollution exposures in the pregnant woman,\" he said. \"Their children were followed up for at least 5 years to see if they were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.\"\n\nOverall, about 1% of the kids were diagnosed with autism by age 5, the researchers found. They compared autism rates among the children of women who had been exposed to the least amount of air pollution during pregnancy against rates among the children of women exposed to the most.\n\nAll three measures of air pollution (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide) showed a similar association with autism.\n\nThe odds of developing autism among children prenatally exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) were 1.04%, the odds of autism in children exposed to higher levels of nitrogen dioxide were 1.06%, and the odds of autism in children exposed to higher levels of nitric oxide were 1.07%. This final increased risk proved to be \"statistically significant,\" which means it crossed the line from random chance and shows a true relationship.\n\nPagalan said the causes of autism are not fully known. \"They're complicated and have many factors but researchers recognize that genetics and environmental factors both play a role,\" he said.\n\nExperts say that any association between air pollution and autism is small at best.\n\nAutism runs in families, and its causes remain unknown\n\nRobin P. Goin-Kochel , associate director for research at Texas Children's Autism Center and associate professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, said families should \"take these results with a grain of salt.\" Goin-Kochel, who was not involved in the new study, emphasized that it found only an association, which \"does not equate to causation.\"\n\nStill, she believes the authors \"nicely addressed\" some shortcomings in previous studies of the same subject. For example, the criteria for children with autism included only those who had received a \"gold-standard\" diagnosis, based on data from the British Columbia Autism Assessment Network.\n\nHowever, other important factors were not included in the analysis, she said, such as socioeconomic status, which has been shown to be linked with autism.\n\n\"Also, the focus was on the mothers' residential locale, and it's possible that mothers' work locales have a different environmental makeup that might be important to consider,\" she wrote in an email. \"It's possible that these pollutants and/or other exposures have an influence on fathers and the quality of their sperm.\"\n\nJames Cusack , director of science at Autistica, a UK charity, told the Science Media Centre that the new research \"should not concern people thinking about having children.\"\n\n\"Autism is strongly genetic. We know this because it runs in families,\" said Cusack, who was not involved in the study. He added that the researchers found only \"a tiny increase\" in the likelihood of having an autistic child for women exposed to more air pollution, specifically nitric oxide. \"Other differences which were not measured, such as genetic differences, may explain this increase. This study does not provide evidence that air pollution causes autism.\"\n\nKevin McConway , emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, told Science Media Centre that the new study is \"careful\" but the results are \"a bit hard to interpret.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"In broad terms, the results of the study were much the same for all three pollutants,\" said McConway, who played no part in the new research. However, only nitric oxide went \"over the conventional boundary of statistical significance,\" he said, \"and only just over.\"\n\n\"It's not really possible in studies like this to truly sort out what causes what,\" he said. \"Perhaps air pollution does really affect [autism] risk, or perhaps it doesn't.\" Although the study \"adds more evidence,\" he concluded, \"we're a very long way from knowing.\"\n\nPagalan said that because there's no cure for autism, \"identifying environmental risk factors helps identify opportunities for prevention.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "'Make America Rake Again': Finns mock Trump's forest fire claims", "description": null, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/collections/california-fires-intl-111918/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:41:56Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Betsy Klein, CNN", "title": "Trump tries to say told you so on bin Laden capture", "description": "President Donald Trump is once again claiming he knows best -- this time, criticizing the past military and political leadership for the timeline of the Osama bin Laden capture.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/politics/donald-trump-william-mcraven-bin-laden-pakistan/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181011114942-donald-trump-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:36:58Z", "content": "Instead of making Pakistan a scapegoat for their failures, the US should do a serious assessment of why, despite 140000 NATO troops plus 250,000 Afghan troops &amp; reportedly $1 trillion spent on war in Afghanistan, the Taliban today are stronger than before\u2026 [+47 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is once again claiming he knows best -- this time, criticizing the past military and political leadership for the timeline of the Osama bin Laden capture.\n\nThe issue re-emerged Sunday in a taped interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace.

Para algunos familiares, que se hallara el casco es una forma de cerrar un ciclo, mientras otros insisten en que se recupere el casco de la embarcaci\u00f3n, tarea que seg\u00fan las autoridades es \"virtualmente\" imposible.\n\n\n\nMira estos 14 datos que marcaron la tragedia del desaparecido San Juan:\n\n1. Un a\u00f1o y un d\u00eda\n\nEl 15 de noviembre de 2017, la Armada Argentina perdi\u00f3 comunicaci\u00f3n con los 44 tripulantes a bordo del ARA San Juan. Nunca regresaron a casa. Un a\u00f1o y un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s, el Ministerio de Defensa y la Armada Argentina informaron \"se ha dado identificaci\u00f3n positiva\" de la nave.\n\n\"Habi\u00e9ndose investigado el punto de inter\u00e9s N\u00b024 informado por Ocean Infinity, mediante la observaci\u00f3n realizada con un ROV a 800 mts de profundidad, se ha dado identificaci\u00f3n positiva al Ara San Juan\", dijo la Armada en Twitter.\n\nMIRA: El momento en que descubren el submarino argentino ARA San Juan en el fondo del mar\n\n2. El \u00faltimo contacto\n\nEl submarino deb\u00eda reportarse dos veces al d\u00eda, pero su \u00faltimo contacto fue el 15 de noviembre, cuando report\u00f3 que hab\u00eda tenido un fallo en las bater\u00edas, que logr\u00f3 arreglar.\n\n3. Una b\u00fasqueda extensa\n\nLa b\u00fasqueda fue tit\u00e1nica. 4.000 personas de 18 pa\u00edses, 28 buques y 9 aeronaves participaron de la misi\u00f3n.\n\n4. Hubo varias llamadas del submarino\n\nEl 18 de noviembre la Armada Argentina inform\u00f3 que se detectaron siete llamadas satelitales desde el submarino ARA San Juan que no lograron enlazarse con varias bases de la Armada.\n\nLas posibles llamadas, inform\u00f3 la Armada en ese entonces, duraron entre 4 y 36 segundos, y se recibieron entre las 10:52 a.m. y las 2:42 p.m..\n\nSeg\u00fan el Ministerio de Defensa, estas llamadas indicar\u00edan que la tripulaci\u00f3n estaba tratando de restablecer contacto.\n\n5. Falta de ox\u00edgeno\n\nLa falta de ox\u00edgeno dentro del submarino era una de las preocupaciones principales, lo que desat\u00f3 que varios pa\u00edses se unieran a los esfuerzos de b\u00fasqueda y rescate. Era una carrera contra el tiempo.\n\n6. La esperanza se desvaneci\u00f3\n\nEl 23 de noviembre el jefe de prensa de la Fuerza Armada Argentina, capit\u00e1n Enrique Balbi, inform\u00f3 que \u201cse recibi\u00f3 la informaci\u00f3n de un evento an\u00f3malo, singular, corto, violento, no nuclear, consistente con una explosi\u00f3n\u201d.\n\n7. Un cortocircuito\n\nSe conoce que en la \u00faltima comunicaci\u00f3n del San Juan, cuando reportaron el problema en las bater\u00edas, tambi\u00e9n se report\u00f3 de un \"principio de incendio\". La Armada dijo que eso no se consider\u00f3 una \"emergencia\".\n\n8. Anomal\u00edas y reparaci\u00f3n\n\nEl 4 de diciembre el ministro de Defensa de Argentina, Oscar Aguad, dijo que los materiales que se usaron para reparar el submarino en 2011, cuando cumpli\u00f3 su media vida, por mantenimiento de rutina, no eran de la mejor calidad. Esa misma fecha, la Armada admite que es posible que nunca se sepa qu\u00e9 le pas\u00f3 al San Juan.\n\nMIRA: Argentina: Comienza el debate sobre si reflotar o no el submarino ARA San Juan\n\n9. No hay tripulantes con vida\n\nEl 5 de diciembre Armada tuvo un anuncio que quebr\u00f3 la esperanzas de los familiares: la etapa de rescate con vida de los tripulantes hab\u00eda llegado a su fin. Desde ese momento empezar\u00edan a buscar \u00fanicamente al submarino.\n\n10. Dos oficiales apartados\n\nEl 12 de diciembre el Gobierno argentino apart\u00f3 a dos altos oficiales de la Armada tras la desaparici\u00f3n del ARA San Juan: al contralmirante Luis Enrique L\u00f3pez Mazzeo, comandante de Adiestramiento y Alistamiento de la Armada y del capit\u00e1n de nav\u00edo Claudio Villamide. Con todo, la Armada Argentina insisti\u00f3 en que continuar\u00e1 rastreando el lecho marino hasta agotar todos los medios y ha reiterado que acompa\u00f1an a los familiares de los submarinistas y los mantienen al tanto de los m\u00e1s recientes acontecimientos.\n\n11. Nuevos indicios\n\nEl 25 de diciembre, la Armada inform\u00f3 sobre tres nuevos indicios en el \u00e1rea de b\u00fasqueda del submarino. Se trata de puntos de inter\u00e9s en donde las naves de b\u00fasqueda detectan con sus herramientas posibles objetos en el lecho marino. Otros dos indicios fueron detectados a principios de enero por el ARA Sarand\u00ed a 500 y 700 metros de profundidad, respectivamente, agreg\u00f3 la Marina en la Gaceta Marinera.\n\nMIRA: Armada Argentina confirma el hallazgo del submarino ARA San Juan\n\nEl 27 de diciembre, la Marina report\u00f3 que el buque estadounidense Atlantis, que asist\u00eda en la b\u00fasqueda, abandonaba las labores. Sin embargo, el organismo aclar\u00f3 que Estados Unidos continuar\u00e1 apoyando con personal experto en planeamiento y an\u00e1lisis de datos.\n\n12. Se cancela la b\u00fasqueda\n\nEn febrero el Gobierno decidi\u00f3 ofrecer una recompensa millonaria por pistas sobre el submarino, pero la t\u00e1ctica no dio frutos y fue cancelada en julio de este a\u00f1o.\n\n13. Un \u00faltimo esfuerzo\n\nCon el transcurso de los meses, la ayuda internacional se fue apagando. Y el 2 de abril se retir\u00f3 el \u00faltimo buque no argentino, el ruso Yantar. Desde entonces, los familiares de los 44 tripulantes comenzaron una ardua lucha para que la b\u00fasqueda continuara.\n\nLo lograron cinco meses despu\u00e9s. El Estado argentino contrat\u00f3 a la empresa estadounidense Ocean Infinity y el 7 de septiembre se retom\u00f3 la b\u00fasqueda. Ah\u00ed volvi\u00f3 a encenderse la esperanza de encontrar al submarino desaparecido.\n\n14. Un indicio\n\nEl Ocean Infinity report\u00f3 el 16 de noviembre que ir\u00eda a revisar un indicio con \"alta probabilidad\".

Hartung is the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The humanitarian crisis in Yemen grows worse by the day. The conflict has been marked by violations of the laws of war on all sides, including targeting of civilians, torture , the use of child soldiers , and other abuses.\n\nThe Trump administration recently called for a ceasefire and announced its decision to stop refueling Saudi aircraft involved in the conflict, but if President Donald Trump and his foreign policy team really want to end the war, they need to use all the tools at their disposal -- military, diplomatic and economic.\n\nTrump seems unlikely to do so. In fact, it's more likely that the US will remain complicit in the civilian deaths that have resulted from Saudi attacks. It is therefore imperative that Congress hold Trump's feet to the fire by passing legislation that invokes the War Powers Resolution, which bars the United States from playing a substantial role in any conflict that has not been authorized by Congress. Bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate to do just that, but with mixed results.\n\nIn the Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mike Lee of Utah and Chris Murphy of Connecticut have introduced a bill that would end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen unless US involvement is authorized by Congress. That measure should come up for a vote in the next few weeks.\n\nIn the House, a similar bill sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna of California and dozens of his colleagues was blocked from coming to a vote by Republican leadership, backed up by all but 15 Republican members of the House.\n\nBut with the Democrats taking control of the House in January, the prospects of passing a War Powers Resolution on Yemen will increase dramatically. Incoming House Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith (D-Washington) was an original co-sponsor of Khanna's bill, and in recent days House Democratic leaders from Nancy Pelosi on down have spoken forcefully about the need to end the US role in the Saudi/UAE intervention in Yemen.\n\nThis action can't come soon enough. There have been more than 17,640 civilian casualties thus far, many the result of air strikes carried out the by US-backed, Saudi-led coalition, according to the United Nations. Bombing raids have hit hospitals, marketplaces, civilian infrastructure, weddings, a funeral and even a school bus carrying dozens of children. The Saudi government has claimed that the strike on the school bus was an error. But the sheer number of bombings that have impacted civilians raises serious questions about whether the US should continue to provide the equipment used to carry out the Saudi air campaign.\n\nUntold numbers of additional deaths in Yemen have been caused by a naval blockade and fighting on the ground, which have hindered the distribution of food, clean water and essential medicines. More than 8 million Yemenis are at risk of famine, and the bombing of civilian infrastructure, including water treatment plants, has sparked a cholera outbreak that has affected more than 1 million people\n\nJUST WATCHED Houthis ready for Yemen ceasefire, leader says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Houthis ready for Yemen ceasefire, leader says 03:04\n\nTo make matters worse, an ongoing assault on the port of Hodeida, spearheaded by the Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led coalition, is shutting the main route through which commercial goods and humanitarian aid get into Yemen. UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock has said that Yemen could now face the worst famine in living memory. Up to half the nation's 28 million people could be at risk of needing food assistance to survive. But Trump has not pressed the coalition forcefully enough to end the assault on the port, which had intensified in recent weeks before a brief lull late last week.\n\nIn the face of this unfolding humanitarian catastrophe, the Trump administration's steps to ameliorate the crisis are woefully inadequate. The Pentagon's announcement on the end of refueling for Saudi aircrafts involved in the war is a case in point. It describes the decision as taken jointly with Saudi officials and suggests that the kingdom is largely able to do its own refueling at this point.\n\nAnd Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration officials continue to perpetrate the fiction that the Saudi regime is taking good faith steps to limit civilian casualties in its air campaign. That claim is refuted by the fact that almost 60% of its October air strikes hit civilian targets, according to the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group. Framed in these terms, the end of refueling of Saudi aircraft reads less like an effort to stop deadly air strikes and more like a maneuver to sidestep pressure from the public, the press and Capitol Hill to end US complicity in the civilian casualties.\n\nFor more opinion...

That includes targeting assistance , arms sales and the provision of spare parts and maintenance for the existing Saudi and UAE arsenals. Given that the bulk of the Saudi arsenal -- including more than half its combat-capable aircraft, tens of thousands of bombs, and 2,000 armored vehicles -- is of US-origin, an end to US support could quickly degrade the fighting capability of the Saudi armed forces.\n\nUnless Congress acts, it is unlikely the Trump administration finally will say enough is enough and apply maximum pressure on the Saudis and the UAE to end the war. The sooner that happens, the better it will be, for the people of Yemen and the security of the United States and the region."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title":

This month, the White House reimposed all sanctions against Iran that had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement, against the objections of other signatories to the international pact: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, European Union, China and Russia.\n\nUS 'concerned'\n\nAnalysts have said the Trump administration's campaign, which lists 12 changes Iran must make, amounts to regime change in everything but name. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an October interview that the United States wants \"to restore democracy there.\"\n\nThe announcement is timed for a special meeting of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, set for November 21 to 30 in the Hague, to review how well the treaty is being implemented. The conference is held every five years, making it the fourth since the treaty entered into force in 1997.\n\nIran is a signatory to the chemical arms convention, which outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Last year, when the United States addressed the OPCW, the representative did not mention Iran.\n\nBut Trump administration officials have recently been hinting at the move. Yleem Poblete, the assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance, has referenced \"Iran's chemical weapons program\" as recently as November 2 , as if it is an ongoing, active project.\n\n\"The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism globally; has publicly stated 'Death to Israel,' our ally and friend; and represses the freedoms of the Iranian people. We are also concerned about its chemical weapons program,\" she told students at South Miami Senior High School.\n\nPoblete is closely allied with national security adviser John Bolton, who has taken a hard line on Iran and advocated for regime change.\n\nDaryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said it might be hard for the United States to make the argument that Iran should be punished for maintaining the facilities and equipment needed to produce them.\n\n\"You can't prove a negative and the ability to produce chemical weapons,\" Kimball said. \"Almost every country has it because almost every country has a chemical industry. There are certain prohibited chemicals, but this is a dual-use technology.\"\n\nChemical weapons are a highly sensitive issue in Iran. During the Iran-Iraq war, from 1980 to 1988, the United Nations determined that Iranian troops were gassed by Saddam Hussein's military six times. The security council did not condemn Iraq's actions. At the time, Iraq was backed by the United States.\n\nKimball also noted that the United States is the only country in the world, aside from Syria, that is a party to the 1997 treaty but hasn't eliminated its stockpile. The United States is not scheduled to neutralize or destroy its stockpile until 2023.\n\n\"The Iranians are going to say this is the pot calling the kettle back,\" Kimball said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Charles Riley and Chris Isidore, CNN Business", "title": "Why the Carlos Ghosn scandal matters", "description": "He was the driving force behind one of the leading powers in the auto industry, an alliance of three separate companies that employs over 470,000 people, operates 122 plants and sold 10.6 million vehicles in 2017.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/business/nissan-renault-alliance-carlos-ghosn/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119133454-04-carlos-ghosn-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:31:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "London (CNN Business) He was the driving force behind one of the leading powers in the auto industry, an alliance of three separate companies that employs over 470,000 people, operates 122 plants and sold 10.6 million vehicles in 2017.\n\nAnd now Carlos Ghosn is in deep trouble.\n\nThe auto industry was rocked Monday when Nissan said that an internal investigation had uncovered evidence that Ghosn had lied about his income over many years and misused company assets.\n\nWith 40 years of industry experience, Ghosn is no ordinary automotive executive.\n\nIn addition to his position at Nissan, where he was also CEO until last year, he is chairman at Mitsubishi Motors. He currently serves as both CEO and chairman of French carmaker Renault.\n\nThe three companies have more in common than a single chairman. They also share ownership stakes.\n\nSo while they sell to different customers under different brands, and are based on two continents, the trio of automakers function in some key ways like a single entity.\n\nMany top executives in the alliance report to three separate CEOs. Major decisions by each alliance member on products and investment are made only with agreement of the other two partners.\n\nGhosn was the driving force behind the alliance. He took what had been three second-tier automakers and brought them together into a single power with joint sales roughly on par with Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors.\n\nBetween them, Renault ( RNSDF ), Nissan ( NSANY ) and Mitsubishi ( MMTOF ) make one of every nine cars sold around the world.\n\nThe industry's most successful alliance\n\nThere have been other auto industry alliances over the years, but none had worked so well or brought the different parties so close together. Ghosn showed the industry that alliances can work and produce billions in savings.\n\nThe alliance started with Renault and Nissan coming together 19 years ago. Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. Mitsubishi joined in 2016 when Nissan purchased 34% of its stock.\n\nAt a press conference Monday evening in Japan, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said he's confident the cooperation between the alliance partners will continue even though Nissan is seeking to remove Ghosn as chairman.\n\nHe said he thinks it's very possible the three partners could agree on a single joint chairman as a replacement.\n\n\"I wouldn't say the impact is zero,\" he said through a translator. \"However we will do our best [to minimize the impact]. This alliance partnership itself will not be affected by this event.\"\n\nThe global auto industry needs to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop electric and autonomous cars \u2014 before tech companies get there. Other automakers, such as Ford ( F ) and Volkswagen ( VLKAF ), are in talks for new alliances\n\nRebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Cox Automotive, said the scale of the challenge facing the auto industry means the alliance created by Ghosn will survive. But it won't be business as usual.\n\n\"It doesn't break apart. But there's going to be disruptions for sure,\" she said.\n\nThe alliance had been planning for life after Ghosn, who was expected to retire as CEO of Renault by 2022. Lindland said that an accelerated search for a replacement would likely cause disruption in the top ranks.\n\n\"There may be plenty of people who's day-to-day jobs won't change,\" she said. \"But there is going to be some executive fallout. Anytime there is disruption at top, that is this sudden, it's bound to wreak a little havoc.\"\n\nMitsubishi said it was proposing that its board \"promptly\" remove Ghosn from that position, and Renault said its board would meet \"very shortly.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Enable set for historic third Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe bid", "description": "She is already a superstar, but the electric Enable can reach new heights after being targeted at an historic third Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe next year.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/19/sport/enable-horseracing-prix-de-larc-detriomphe-spt-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181102135944-arc-enable-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:31:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) She is already a superstar, but the electric Enable can reach new heights after being targeted at an historic third Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe next year.\n\nThe John Gosden-trained filly clinched a second straight Arc in Paris in October before becoming the first horse to add a Breeders' Cup Turf title in the same season this month.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that dual Arc winner and recent @BreedersCup heroine Enable will stay in training for 2019.\n\n\n\nA third Arc will be her main target #Champion pic.twitter.com/BQCdRwamWJ \u2014 Juddmonte Farms (@JuddmonteFarms) November 19, 2018\n\nAfter the triumph at Churchill Downs, owner Prince Khalid bin Abdullah took some time to decide on her future.\n\nBut instead of entering Prince Khalid's Juddmonte breeding operation, she will now be kept in training for a tilt at an unprecedented third Arc.\n\n\"No racing schedule has been set, but it will feature the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as a prime target,\" said Juddmonte in a statement Monday.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jack Guy, CNN", "title": "Meet 'the Tulip,' a next level skyscraper design for London", "description": "Architects Foster + Partners have revealed plans for a 1,000-feet stem topped with a glass bud that will become London's second-tallest building.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/tulip-skyscraper-london-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119134543-01-tulip-london-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:25:50Z", "content": "First there was the Gherkin, then the Walkie-Talkie and the Cheese Grater.

It's doing really well, I have great people.\"\n\nAnd away we go!\n\n2. \"My wife did a great job in Africa, and she was not treated properly by the press.\"\n\nThe question Trump was asked? Why First Lady Melania Trump publicly called for the firing of the firing of an aide on the National Security Council . But sure, Trump says the media is unfair!\n\n3. \"She was with me for a long time, although I don't know her. She's really somebody I don't know very well. But we're going to move her around because she's got certain talents.\"\n\nOK, so here's Trump on Mira Ricardel , the NSC staffer removed at the request of Melania Trump: 1) She was with him for a long time b) He doesn't know her c) He doesn't know her very well c) She'll stay within the administration because she has \"certain talents.\" We all clear on that? Good!\n\n4. \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\"\n\nIf you are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, this answer can't be terribly comforting. The problem for anyone in Trump's administration tasked with managing the border is that you will never do well enough in his eyes; it's the issue he ran on and cares deeply about but also has totally unrealistic expectations of what can be done there.\n\n5. \"Well there's a chance.\"\n\nTrump's take on whether there's a \"chance\" Nielsen stays in her job is utterly Trumpian. \"Well there's a chance\" could, literally, function as his answer to every single question ever asked of him.\n\n6. \"There are certain things I love what he does. And there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- that aren't his strength.\"\n\nIt's remarkable how willing Trump is to assess his top staffers in a public forum like an interview on Fox News Channel. If you are White House chief of staff John Kelly, who Trump is talking about here, and you watch this on TV, you have to start looking for another job ASAP, right?\n\n7. \"It could happen. Yes it could -- I mean it could be. But let's see what happens.\"\n\nThis Trump answer is about Kelly lasting through 2020. But much like \"there's a chance,\" this answer could function as a sort of catch-all for Trump's response to ANY query. Might happen. Might not. Let's see how it plays out.\n\n8. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"\n\nIf you believe that Trump had NO idea that Matt Whitaker had been publicly opposed to many aspects of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, I have a guy named Carmelo Anthony who will DEFINITELY make your NBA team better.\n\n9. \"If you look at those statements -- those statements that can -- they really can be viewed really either way.\"\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel. If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\" -- Matt Whitaker, November 2017 . Totally can see that in a lot of different ways....\n\n10. \"So if he said there is collusion, I'm supposed to be taking somebody that says there is?\"\n\nThis shows just how little Trump gets about how Justice Department officials should behave. He has no conception that Whitaker concluding that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians even as the probe is ongoing might not be seen as the right thing to do. And to be clear: There is no public proof that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in 2016. There may never be any proof. But since this is an ongoing investigation, all we can say is that there is not currently evidence of collusion. And, yes, that nuance is lost on Trump.\n\n11. \"And all these people that say I'm going to end the investigation, you know, they've been saying that now for -- how long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for, what?\"\n\n12. \"There was no collusion whatsoever, and the whole thing is a scam.\"\n\n13. \"I'm the one that does the answering.\"\n\nTrump is VERY focused on ensuring that everyone knows that he is the one answering the questions from Mueller's team. Why? I think because he wants to look as smart and as tough as possible. And he hates any perception that he has to have other people do something because he's not strong enough or smart enough to do it himself.\n\n14. \"They're writing what I tell them to write.\"\n\nSee #13.\n\n15. 'I would say probably. Probably. I mean, I can change my mind, but probably.\"\n\nThis is Trump on whether he's ruled out sitting down in person with Mueller's team. It's amazing how he simply cannot or will not be definitive about, well, anything. Everything is a negotiation, a possible deal.\n\n16. \"I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished.\"\n\n17. WALLACE: \"You ran a casino, sir.\" TRUMP: \"You're right, and very successfully, actually.\"\n\n18. \"Because it's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it.\"\n\nLook, I can understand the desire of ANY human not to hear the suffering of another human -- in this case the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was tortured and murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. But Trump is not just anyone. He's the President of the United States. And an argument can be made that listening to the last moments of Khashoggi's life might, finally, drive home the atrocity of what happened here and how the Saudis continue to play fast and loose with the truth.\n\n19. \"I don't -- I don't know. You know, who can really know? But I can say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.\"\n\nAnother example of Trump willing to bend over backward to give an ally -- in this case Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman -- the benefit of the doubt. Trump's comments about MBS came on the same day that sources told CNN that the CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered Khashoggi's murder\n\n20. \"Well, will anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know?\"\n\nTrump's moral relativism is on stark display here. The CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered the murder of Khashoggi. MBS has denied it to Trump. So Trump concludes that we can never, ever know the truth. Just throw your hands up and move on.\n\n21. \"But at the same time we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\"\n\nAnd now we are at the key point of the MBS-Khashoggi situation. The Saudis have repeatedly changed their story. They said Khashoggi's death was an accident. Then they said he was murdered. Then they said MBS and his people knew nothing. Then they admitted people close to MBS carried out the murder. Now the CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered the murder. But because Saudi Arabia is an important economic ally, Trump is willing to suspend disbelief and say, essentially, \"Who can know what happened???\"\n\n22. \"I won the Senate, you don't mention that.\"\n\nHe won the Senate. Not the candidates, or the party -- Donald Trump won it.\n\n23. \"I won the Senate. ... Number two, I wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\nUm. So, Trump won the Senate but any losses can't be blamed on him because he wasn't on the ballot. [Puts on green accountant visor thing-y] Yup, this all adds up.\n\n24. \"But I had people and you see the polls, how good they are, I had people that won't vote unless I'm on the ballot, OK? And I wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\nI love a good word salad.\n\n25. \"And it was all stacked against Brian, and I was the one that went for Brian and Brian won.\"\n\nBrian Kemp did win the Georgia governor's race. But it was not stacked against him. At all. The last time a Democrat was elected governor of Georgia was Roy Barnes in 1998.The last time a Democrat won Georgia in a presidential race was Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\n26. \"Rick Scott won and he won by a lot.\"\n\nScott won by 10,033 votes. Out of more than 8 million cast.\n\n27. \"If I didn't put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK?\"\n\nIn which the President of the United States take credit for blocking non-existent voter fraud.\n\n28. \"I didn't run. I wasn't running. My name wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\n\"I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me. I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot.\" -- Donald Trump, last month\n\n29. \"Nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do.\"\n\nSo, um, the thing is ... well, yeah, OK.\n\n30. \"Actually, I like to do it but in many cases I don't.\"\n\nThis is Donald Trump's answer to the question of why he calls on CNN's Jim Acosta. If you can explain what he means, I owe you a Coke\n\n31. \"They know when the news is fake, and they get angry when they see all of the fakeness.\"\n\nRemember that when Trump says \"fake news\" you should read that as \"news that is not as favorable to me as I would like.\"\n\n32. \"I don't mind getting bad news if I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe catch here is that Trump, truly, never thinks he does anything wrong. And therefore, the news is always fake if it suggests he has made any sort of mistake -- ever.\n\n33. \"The news about me is largely phony. It's false. Even sometimes they'll say, 'Sources say.' There is no source, in many cases -- in cases there is.\"\n\nAgain, this is about Donald Trump not liking the news. Not about the news being \"largely phony.\" And the idea that mainstream media organizations make up sources is beyond ridiculous.\n\n34. \"He's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama backer.\"\n\nTrump is talking here about William McRaven, the former head of US Special Operations Command and the architect of the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. Why? Because McRaven said that Trump's attempts to undermine the press were a threat to democracy. And because Trump is incapable of seeing anything outside of a purely partisan lens. Also, Trump is wrong about McRaven's political preferences; \"I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else,\" McRaven told CNN\n\n35. \"Would it have been nicer if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it been nice? Living -- think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan and what I guess in what they considered a nice mansion. I don't know, I've seen nicer.\"\n\nA truly incredible take on the bin Laden raid.\n\n36. \"I can tell what's fair and what's not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people.\"\n\n[narrator voice] He can't.\n\n37. \"And, Chris, you know that better, you don't have to sit here and act like a perfect little, wonderful, innocent angel. I know you too well. I knew your father too well, that's not your gene.\"\n\nI am frankly surprised that it took this long for Trump to turn on Wallace. Despite the obvious pro-Trump bias of lots of the shows (and people) on Fox news, Wallace is a straight-shooter and tough questioner. I'm actually surprised, given that, that Trump agreed to sit down for an interview with him.\n\n38. \"I think I'm doing a great job. We have the best economy we've ever had.\"\n\nModesty has never been Trump's strong suit.\n\n39. \"I would give myself, I would -- look, I hate to do it, but I will do it. I would give myself an A-plus, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\"\n\nTwo things: 1) He doesn't hate to do it 2) The President asked if he could give himself a grade higher than an \"A+.\" So, here we are.\n\n40. \"I should have done that, I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling as you know.\"\n\nThis is Trump's explanation on why he didn't go to Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran's Day. \"Extremely busy\" on calls. \"For the country.\"\n\n41. \"I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened.\"\n\nThe question? \"Why haven't you visited our troops serving in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years you've been in office as commander in chief?\" So, yeah.\n\n42. \"But tone is something that is important to me. But a lot of times you can't practice tone because you have people coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous way, you're not going to win. And we have to win. This country has to win.\"\n\n[nods head very slowly] This feels like a good place to end."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AngelaBonachera", "title": "\u00bfSe parece el nuevo logo de Ciudad de M\u00e9xico al de una banda de metal?", "description": "La banda Neutral FX dijo que \"de ser necesario tomar\u00e1n cartas en el asunto\".", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/19/se-parece-el-nuevo-logo-de-ciudad-de-mexico-al-de-una-banda-de-metal/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/captura-de-pantalla-2018-11-20-a-las-11-14-23-am.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:15:56Z", "content": "(Expansi\u00f3n) - Usuarios en redes sociales encontraron parecido entre el que ser\u00e1 el nuevo logo institucional de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico en la pr\u00f3xima administraci\u00f3n, presentado este lunes, con el de la banda de metal progresivo de Monterrey Neutral FX.

That makes Florida a rare bright spot for Republicans in a 2018 election that, since November 6, has looked better and better for Democrats.\n\nSo what happened in Florida? And why? Plus, most importantly, what does it all mean for 2020? I reached out to Adam Smith , the political editor of the Tampa Bay Times, for answers to all of those questions -- and more!\n\nOur conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nCillizza: Florida is the success story of the 2018 election for Republicans. What happened for the GOP there that didn't happen in other states?\n\nSmith: Keep in mind that less than half a percentage point difference in Florida's US Senate and governor's race, and you'd be asking about the extraordinary and history drubbing the GOP took in Florida. These were virtually tied elections. There was some good news for Democrats: Florida's congressional delegation now looks more like Florida, with 14 Republican-held seats, and 13 Democrats. Democrats gained a bit of ground in the legislature and did pick up one state office, agriculture commissioner.\n\nBut no, there was no big Democratic wave in Florida, while there probably was a bit of Trump wave. What happened for the GOP was simply that base Republicans turned out in big, big numbers.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson losing to his first strong challenger in decades was not a shock, but I think many Democrats had their hearts broken about Andrew Gillum's loss because misleading and/or poor public polls pointed to a more-likely-than-not win.\n\nCillizza: Did all the national attention for Gillum overrate him as a politician?\n\nSmith: I do think Gillum proved himself to be a sensational politician in terms of personal appeal, authenticity and inspiration. The DeSantis campaign was stunned at how strong he remained even after they threw everything at him and then threw more. Usually, Democrats push aside their losing gubernatorial nominees, but Gillum is not done by a long shot.\n\nWhat some of the national media underestimated I think was the amount of baggage Gillum had. Crime problems in his city and a seemingly ongoing FBI investigation would immediately sink less talented candidates. In Gillum's case, none of that stuff was aired out in the primary because almost no one thought he had a real shot at winning the nomination.\n\nCillizza: Rick Scott never wins by much -- but he always wins. Why?\n\nSmith: Money, hard work, money, discipline, money and luck. Many a Disney automaton comes off as more human than Rick Scott, but he also happens to be a ferocious campaigner. That robotic demeanor keeps him relentlessly on message, he is a truly tireless fundraiser and campaigner, and he has the bank accounts to spend $65 million(!) of his own money to barely, barely beat a career politician at about the worst time to be running as a career politician.\n\nCillizza: Trump was a VERY active presence in Florida for DeSantis and Scott. Any idea how big a difference he makes?\n\nSmith: Bigly difference. I don't think anyone here doubts that without Trump firing up the GOP in the closing week of the campaign, Scott and DeSantis would probably would have lost. Tellingly, Scott shifted his strategy in the closing days to stop keeping his distance from Trump and instead join him at his Florida rallies.\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: \"What the 2018 election should teach us about Florida in the 2020 presidential race is ____________.\" Now, explain.\n\nSmith: \"Wide open.\"\n\nThink about how extraordinary it is for a mega-state like Florida over and over and over again to wind up with dead-even statewide races. In a state with 13 million voters, the last three presidential races, the last three gubernatorial races, and the last US Senate race have been decided by about 1 percentage point. That is stunning, and there is no reason to think anything will be different in 2020."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Angela Dewan, CNN", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi's murder could be a game-changer for the Yemen war", "description": "The slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi wrote passionately about ending the brutal war in Yemen.

In one column for the Washington Post he called on Saudi Arabia to \"use its clout and leverage within Western circles\" to resolve the conflict.\n\nNever could he have imagined that he himself would become the leverage in attempts to end the war.\n\nUS President Donald Trump seems reluctant to connect Mohammed bin Salman to the journalist's death, appearing to take little note of what sources say is a CIA assessment that the powerful Saudi Crown Prince ordered Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTrump has distanced himself from the case as much as he can, refusing to listen to audio evidence shedding light on how Khashoggi was killed last month at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Saudi officials now admit a premeditated murder happened on its diplomatic premises, though it denies the Crown Prince was involved.\n\nDespite the CIA assessment, Trump has repeatedly explained the Saudi-US relationship is simply too important to risk.\n\nBut Trump isn't the only world leader who wants to avoid a direct clash with bin Salman and rock a strategic relationship that comes with the perks of intelligence sharing, lucrative arms deals and a stable supply of oil. And it wouldn't be the first time the world has turned a blind eye to human rights violations by the kingdom to preserve these creature comforts in a restive region.\n\nInstead, Western nations are responding to Saudi aggression by addressing the war in Yemen, ratcheting up pressure on the Crown Prince to enter a ceasefire agreement that will put an end to the three-year conflict.\n\nThe war in Yemen, between the US-backed Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-backed Houthis, has created the world's worst man-made humanitarian disaster, according to the UN. Much of the damage has come from Saudi coalition air power, and UN experts say its bombing of civilians are potential war crimes. The Saudis, who have denied allegations of war crimes, have the greatest power to end the conflict, above any other actor in the war.\n\nThere are plenty of members of Congress in the US who don't agree with Trump's lax response to the Khashoggi killing. A bipartisan group of Senators has introduced draft legislation to impose tougher sanctions on Saudi Arabia that target arms sales to the kingdom and bans the US practice of refueling of Saudi planes in the Yemen war.\n\n\"This legislation is an important way to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for various acts in Yemen as well as the death of Jamal Khashoggi,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said last week\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake accused the Trump administration of dragging its feet on the Khashoggi case in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" In the same breath, he brought up the Saudi role in Yemen as another example of how the kingdom's and US' values do not align.\n\n\"It looks more and more like the truth is that the Crown Prince was involved, that he likely ordered it,\" Flake said of the Khashoggi killing.\n\n\"So, to just deflect and say it's a spectacular ally, when, in fact, some of the bloom has been coming off that rose for a while, particularly given the war in Yemen. So, there are things that we're going to have to confront here soon. And I hope we do it based on the truth, not in something that we simply want to see because we have a lot invested in the relationship with the Crown Prince now.\"\n\nJoost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa program director at the International Crisis Group, said that Khashoggi's murder coincided with a growing willingness to address the Yemen war, particularly as hunger worsens in the country and ahead of a possible announcement at the end of the month that Yemen is officially in famine.\n\n\"There was growing unease and pressure from governments, civil society groups and others to do more to end this conflict. Everybody realized that the responsibility of a famine would shift to them too,\" Hiltermann said.\n\n\"But people are always looking for opportunities, there's always an opportunity in a crisis. Even when someone gets murdered in a horrific way, there's political capital to be made.\"\n\nYemen resolution picks up steam\n\nWestern nations have pounced on Riyadh's rare moment of vulnerability to push for progress on Yemen, an easier cause to sell politically at home than tussling with the powerful Crown Prince.\n\nThe UK was expected to table a long-awaited draft UN resolution on Yemen during a meeting of the Security Council in New York on Monday.\n\nA week ago, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visited Riyadh, where he met with bin Salman and presented him with the draft text that sources said provoked anger.\n\nTwo sources told CNN the Crown Prince \"threw a fit\" over the resolution. Two other sources described his reaction less dramatically, but didn't deny he was at the very least annoyed.\n\nAnother source told CNN that Hunt went to bin Salman and essentially said: \"This is what Western powers think, and this is what you need to do. What is your plan to stop this?\"\n\nHunt's trip followed discussions with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, suggesting the Western allies are on the same page on the resolution.\n\nAnd it seems the plan has already had some success; the Saudis have now agreed to facilitate Houthi negotiators' travel to Sweden for talks.\n\nIn a small first gesture, the US earlier this month halted its practice of refueling Saudi coalition jets operating in Yemen. Around the same time, Pompeo and US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis also called on participants in the conflict to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nBut the concern is that the renewed vigor for action on Yemen -- however desperately welcomed it may be -- has come at the cost of disclosing the full truth on Khashoggi.\n\nJUST WATCHED Symbolic funeral prayers held for journalist Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Symbolic funeral prayers held for journalist 01:33\n\nThe response to Khashoggi's killing has been soft, or has at least avoided direct targets at the Crown Prince, in what has become a particularly dark and dangerous time for journalists in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Trump administration announced sanctions against 17 Saudi government officials on Thursday last week -- the Crown Prince obviously not among them -- on the same day Saudi prosecutors formally charged 11 people over Khashoggi's killing, five of whom will face the death penalty. Both sides had apparently hoped their responses would be the end of the Khashoggi affair.\n\nGermany says it plans to ban 18 Saudis from entering the country, while Canada is also mulling sanctions.\n\nTurkey has been the most aggressive player against the Saudis, drip-feeding intelligence that has forced Riyadh to address at least some aspects of Khashoggi's killing. But even Ankara has been careful about explicitly naming names, and as a country that cracks down on journalists so aggressively, it's difficult to believe it has the cleanest of motives.\n\nWhen asked if he thought bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi's killing, Trump said, \"Well, will anybody really know?\" in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nHe might be right, and if the truth of what happened to Khashoggi is never fully disclosed, there is only hope that his death did something for the people of war-torn Yemen."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Charles Riley, CNN Business", "title": "Carlos Ghosn saved two companies.

The Nissan board of directors would be asked to remove Ghosn as chairman on Thursday.\n\nThe stage is now set for the spectacular downfall of an industry titan heralded as a visionary leader. Ghosn is also chairman of Renault ( RNSDF ) and Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ).\n\nThe three companies work together in an unusual and powerful global alliance. Ghosn was the driving force behind its creation. The alliance employs 470,000 people, operates 122 plants and sold over 10 million vehicles in 2017.\n\n\"He was the alliance,\" said Rebecca Lindland, senior auto analyst for Cox Automotive. \"He was the creative genius behind all of this, and set the parameters to run these fairly disparate companies.\"\n\nGhosn started his career at Michelin before rising through the ranks at Renault. He orchestrated a major restructuring of the struggling French carmaker, returning it to profitability and earning himself the nickname \"Le cost killer.\"\n\nThe Brazilian-born executive joined Nissan in 1999 when it formed an alliance with Renault, but he kept his responsibilities at Renault as part of an unusual arrangement.\n\nGhosn is also credited with executing a stunning turnaround at Nissan and was named its chief executive in 2001.\n\nDo or die\n\nThe toughest turnaround job was at Nissan, Ghosn wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 2002.\n\n\"Nissan was something else entirely,\" Ghosn said, comparing the company's troubles to what he had encountered at Michelin and Renault. \"This was, quite literally, a do-or-die situation: Either we'd turn the business around or Nissan would cease to exist.\"\n\nGhosn set about changing the culture at Nissan, eliminating automatic promotions for veteran employees. He slashed thousands of jobs at the carmaker and closed plants.\n\n\"Turning around a company in Nissan's state is a bit like Formula 1 racing,\" he wrote in the Harvard Business Review\n\n\"To take the highest-speed trajectory, you have to brake and accelerate, brake and accelerate all the time. The revival plan ... was as much about future growth [accelerating] as it was about cutting costs [braking].\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Behind-the-scenes look at car designs Replay More Videos ...

The companies own shares in one another.\n\nAll about scale\n\nGhosn turned his attention to Mitsubishi in recent years.\n\nHe became chairman of the smaller Japanese automaker in 2016, when Nissan ( NSANY ) took a controlling stake in Mitsubishi after it was rocked by a mileage falsification scandal.\n\nGhosn's latest project was to deepen ties between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi. The alliance structure, which allows the companies to pool resources and share costs, has been explored by other carmakers in recent years.\n\nAnalysts say consolidation is needed for automakers to fend off tech companies and upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ), which are plowing money into electric and autonomous cars.\n\nGhosn told the Financial Times in June that the alliance he forged was \"irreversible.\"\n\n\"We created a lot of synergies, and scale is the name of the game. But I respect that some stakeholders are saying, 'Hey, wait a minute, what's gonna happen after you're gone?' \" he told the newspaper\n\nGhosn had been expected to step down as CEO of Renault before his term expires in 2022. But accusations of wrongdoing could accelerate that timetable \u2014 and force Ghosn to cede control of the alliance he created.\n\nRenault said its board would convene \"very shortly\" to discuss Nissan's revelations. Mitsubishi said it was proposing that its board \"promptly\" remove Ghosn from that position."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Stelter, CNN Business", "title": "Instead of a comedian, White House Correspondents' Association enlists author Ron Chernow as speaker", "description": "The White House Correspondents' Association is shelving its tradition of having a comedian roast the president and the press corps at its annual fundraising dinner.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/media/ron-chernow-white-house-correspondents-dinner/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180428215042-12-whcd-0428-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:01:47Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "New York (CNN) The White House Correspondents' Association is shelving its tradition of having a comedian roast the president and the press corps at its annual fundraising dinner. Instead, famed author Ron Chernow will be the featured speaker.\n\nThe association's president Olivier Knox made the announcement on Monday. For several months, he had been leaning against inviting a comic, and he had been conferring with other members about the change.\n\nThe dinner is a key date on Washington's social calendar. But its meaning has changed amid constant attacks on the media and increasing political polarization. Booking Chernow instead of a stand-up performer is a recognition that the annual dinner changes dramatically when the president isn't there.\n\nPresident Trump has snubbed the event two years in a row, and there is little reason to believe that he will attend next dinner, which is scheduled for April 27, 2019.\n\nSo the association had to rethink things.\n\nHistorically, Knox told CNN earlier this year, \"when the president comes, the program's center of gravity naturally tilts toward the president.\" After he speaks and ribs the press corps, the featured comedian serves as the counter-balance. But with the president absent, the dinner has a different, more combative feel.\n\nKnox and the association's board members are trying to change that.\n\n\"As we celebrate the importance of a free and independent news media to the health of the republic, I look forward to hearing Ron place this unusual moment in the context of American history,\" Knox said in a statement on Monday.\n\nChernow is the author of six books, including best selling titles about Alexander Hamilton and George Washington. The Hamilton biography inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway hit musical \"Hamilton,\" and Chernow served as a historical consultant on the production.\n\nChernow said in a statement, \"The White House Correspondents' Association has asked me to make the case for the First Amendment and I am happy to oblige. Freedom of the press is always a timely subject and this seems like the perfect moment to go back to basics. My major worry these days is that we Americans will forget who we are as a people and historians should serve as our chief custodians in preserving that rich storehouse of memory. While I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won't be dry.\"\n\nComedienne Michelle Wolf spurred debate about the dinner format when she performed at last April's dinner.\n\nAfterward, Trump allies claimed that the jokes proved the press corps' hatred of Trump. Trump tweeted that the dinner was \"embarrassing\" and the event is \"dead.\"\n\nBut many writers, activists and comedians defended Wolf for roasting both the administration and the media.\n\nWolf seemed happy about the outcome. When former press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted that the dinner \"was a disgrace,\" Wolf replied, \"Thank you!\"\n\nThe correspondents' association -- which did not vet her monologue ahead of time -- expressed regret that the controversy over the jokes overshadowed the dinner's First Amendment message.\n\nMembers of the association serve one-year terms as president. The president back then, Margaret Talev, said she invited Wolf because \"she was a talented comedian with a message to deliver.\" But Talev also said Wolf's stand-up act did not reflect the \"spirit\" of the association's mission.\n\nKnox took over as president of the association in July. His day job is chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM. He leads the group's advocacy for press access and other White House issues. In the past week, the association has supported CNN in litigation with the White House over Jim Acosta's press pass.\n\nAfter Knox's term as president, Jon Karl of ABC News will take over next July.\n\nThen it will be Karl's turn to decide whether to invite a comedian, an author, or someone else for the 2020 dinner.\n\nBut the decision about 2019 has already stirred lots of debate, with some journalists praising the pick and others saying it was a capitulation to Trump.\n\nWolf left no doubt about her point of view.\n\nShe tweeted, \"The @whca are cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn't be prouder.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ashley Strickland, CNN", "title": "First-known 'pinwheel' star system is beautiful, dangerous and doomed", "description": "For the first time ever, astronomers have discovered a beautiful serpentine, pinwheel-like star system that is doomed to end in an explosion of gamma rays.

The giant columns of cold gas, in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, were popularized by a similar image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. Hide Caption 71 of 75\n\nPhotos: Wonders of the universe Astronomers using the Hubble Space pieced together this picture that shows a small section of space in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax. Within this deep-space image are 10,000 galaxies, going back in time as far as a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.

The blue bubble was created when an aging star shed its outer layers and a star in the foreground happened to align with it to create a \"diamond engagement ring\" effect.

The cluster, called Abell 2744, contains several hundred galaxies as they looked 3.5 billion years ago; the more distant galaxies appear as they did more than 12 billion years ago, not long after the Big Bang.

Se sabe que usa el esti\u00e9rcol para marcar su territorio, depositando pilas de heces fuera de las madrigueras y sobre rocas y troncos, seg\u00fan Australian Geographic.\n\nPero c\u00f3mo el wombat produce las formas en cubos es un fen\u00f3meno que ha desconcertado a muchos observadores del marsupial peludo.\n\nLos investigadores, dirigidos por Patricia Yang del Instituto de Tecnolog\u00eda de Georgia, dijeron que descubrieron los procesos digestivos detr\u00e1s del misterio y presentaron sus hallazgos en la 71\u00aa Reuni\u00f3n Anual de la Divisi\u00f3n de Din\u00e1mica de Fluidos de la American Physical Society en Atlanta el domingo.\n\nLos excrementos en cubos del wombat son un rasgo \u00fanico en el mundo animal, dijeron los investigadores, ya que los cubos generalmente se crean mediante corte o moldeado.\n\n\"En el mundo construido, las estructuras c\u00fabicas se crean por extrusi\u00f3n o moldeo por inyecci\u00f3n, pero hay pocos ejemplos de esta haza\u00f1a en la naturaleza\", dijeron los autores del proyecto en el resumen del estudio.\n\nMIRA: Cient\u00edficos votan para definir una nueva forma de medir un kilogramo\n\nPara resolver el misterio, el equipo examin\u00f3 los tractos digestivos de los wombats que tuvieron que ser sacrificados despu\u00e9s de haber chocado con veh\u00edculos en Tasmania, Australia.\n\nEl wombat tarda aproximadamente dos semanas en digerir su alimento y los investigadores encontraron que a medida que las heces se mueven hacia el 8% final del intestino, cambia de un estado l\u00edquido a materia s\u00f3lida. En esa etapa, el esti\u00e9rcol toma la forma de cubos separados que miden aproximadamente dos cent\u00edmetros de longitud.\n\nAl inflar el intestino con un globo largo, los investigadores encontraron que las paredes intestinales de los wombats se estiran de manera desigual, lo que permite la formaci\u00f3n de los cubos.\n\n\"La tensi\u00f3n local var\u00eda del 20% en las esquinas del cubo al 75% en los bordes\", dijo el equipo. \"Por lo tanto, el intestino se estira preferentemente en las paredes para facilitar la formaci\u00f3n del cubo\".\n\nLos autores del estudio dijeron que los hallazgos podr\u00edan tener implicaciones m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del mundo natural, al ayudar a proporcionar informaci\u00f3n sobre las nuevas t\u00e9cnicas de fabricaci\u00f3n."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "abelhaik", "title": "\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0633\u064a\u0624\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \"\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646\" \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u061f", "description": "\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u0623\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646 &quot;\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0643&quot; \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u0649 \u0623\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645. \u0641\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0633\u064a\u0624\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u061f", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/business/video/2018/11/19/v68309-nissan-chairman-carlos-ghosn-arrested-in-japan", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/19/images/181119132852-03-carlos-ghosn-file.jpg?itok=AHOSE7gZ", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:54:03Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0644 \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0625\u0630 \u0623\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u063a\u0635\u0646 \"\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0643\" \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u0649 \u0623\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645. \u0641\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0633\u064a\u0624\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u061f\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u060c 19 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Paula Bravo Medina", "title": "Los 10 narcotraficantes m\u00e1s notorios de M\u00e9xico", "description": "Estos son los capos m\u00e1s notorios del narcotr\u00e1fico en M\u00e9xico que fueron y son perseguidos tanto por las autoridades locales como por las estadounidenses e internacionales", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/19/los-10-narcotraficantes-mas-notorios-de-mexico/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/120904082329-guillen-cartel-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:53:20Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Han sido perseguidos por las autoridades mexicanas y estadounidenses por ser l\u00edderes y miembros prominentes de los m\u00e1s grandes carteles mexicanos de las drogas.

The document does condemn attacks by the Houthis against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and condemns those providing weapons to the Houthis, without directly mentioning Iran.\n\nRebels in Yemen earlier said they would cease missile and drone strikes on Saudi coalition targets.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "The rise of China's 'Silicon Valley' - CNN Video", "description": "Forty years ago, Shenzhen was a poor fishing village on the southern coast of China.

Jim Acosta y CNN continuar\u00e1n informando sobre las noticias sobre la Casa Blanca y el presidente\".\n\nEl viernes pasado, CNN gan\u00f3 una orden de restricci\u00f3n temporal, lo que oblig\u00f3 a la Casa Blanca a restablecer el acceso de la prensa de Acosta a la Casa Blanca durante 14 d\u00edas. El juez Timothy J. Kelly fall\u00f3 sobre la base de la Quinta Enmienda, diciendo que el derecho de Acosta al debido proceso hab\u00eda sido violado. No se pronunci\u00f3 sobre el argumento de CNN sobre las violaciones de la Primera Enmienda.\n\nM\u00e1s tarde, ese mismo d\u00eda, la Casa Blanca le envi\u00f3 a Acosta una carta formal en la que describ\u00eda una \"decisi\u00f3n preliminar\" para suspender su pase nuevamente una vez que la orden de restricci\u00f3n expire. La carta cit\u00f3 su conducta en la conferencia de prensa del 7 de noviembre del presidente Trump.\n\nLa carta fue firmada por dos de los acusados \u200b\u200ben la demanda, la secretaria de prensa Sarah Sanders y el jefe de personal adjunto de comunicaciones Bill Shine.\n\nMIRA: Fox News, NBC, AP, The New York Times y m\u00e1s apoyan la demanda de CNN para recuperar el pase de prensa de Jim Acosta\n\nLa carta se\u00f1alaba que el gobierno de Trump quiere continuar luchando contra Acosta, a pesar del rev\u00e9s en la primera ronda en la corte, en lugar de buscar un acuerdo extrajudicial.\n\nParec\u00eda un esfuerzo por establecer un rastro que permita a la administraci\u00f3n sacar a Acosta de nuevo a fin de mes.\n\nEn una demanda judicial presentada el lunes, los abogados de CNN dijeron que la cadena y Acosta \"tienen la esperanza\" de que las partes \"puedan resolver esta disputa sin m\u00e1s intervenci\u00f3n judicial\".\n\nPero la nueva carta de Shine y Sanders es un \"intento de proporcionar un proceso retroactivo,\" dijeron los abogados.\n\nDe modo que CNN y Acosta est\u00e1n buscando una audiencia sobre un requerimiento judicial preliminar \"para la semana del 26 de noviembre de 2018, o tan pronto como sea posible\", seg\u00fan la presentaci\u00f3n del lunes.\n\nTal interdicto podr\u00eda estar vigente durante mucho m\u00e1s tiempo, protegiendo as\u00ed el acceso de Acosta a la Casa Blanca.\n\nSe esperaba que los abogados regresaran a los tribunales esta semana para discutir el cronograma de los procedimientos adicionales."},

The site sells flowers sourced at farms in South America. Unlike its competitors, however, it limits the choices it offers consumers.\n\n\"It was kind of an 'aha moment' I had,\" she says. \"Because we [limit choice], we can use every flower. It drastically reduces our waste.\"\n\nWhile most other online sellers can offer hundreds of options, Farmgirl Flowers only offers between 12 to 20 arrangements at a time on its site.\n\n\"We're under 1% waste and we can purchase more expensive flowers than a lot of our competitors,\" she says. \"There are peonies and garden roses and calla lilies.\"\n\nAll of the company's floral arrangements are made in-house. \"Arranging is much harder than people think,\" she says. \"If you're spending that much money, and it's a gift for someone, you want them to receive it beautifully.\"\n\nBased in San Francisco, Farmgirl Flowers ships across the US, with the exception of Hawaii and Alaska. The flowers are wrapped using reused burlap coffee bags obtained from local coffee roasters, instead of plastic.\n\nTaking the path less traveled\n\nStembel doesn't shy away from doing things a little differently.\n\nShe never enrolled in college but worked for eight years at Stanford, first as general manager of catering and then for a few years at the law school.\n\nShe calls herself an \"ideas\" person. \"I was one of those crazy people that came up with a different idea every week,\" she says. \"I had an idea notebook in my bag and had about 200 ideas at any given moment.\"\n\nChristina Stembel launched her San Francsico-based flower startup Farmgirl Flowers in 2010.\n\nThe company's name was inspired by her experience growing up on a farm in Bremen, Indiana, a small town of 3,600. There, she never imagined running her own company.\n\nMy parents worked for people. Everybody I saw worked for people,\" she says. \"When you don't see it, you don't go for it. You can't think of that as an opportunity for yourself.\"\n\nIt wasn't until she moved to San Francisco and became immersed in its culture that she began believing she could become an entrepreneur.\n\n\"I kind of joke that in San Francisco, everybody has a business plan in their back pocket. It was contagious, that entrepreneurial spirit,\" she says. \"It was the first time in my life that I thought, 'Whoa, I could start a business.'\"\n\nBut as a first-time entrepreneur and a woman, she realized the deck was stacked against her. To date, Stembel has not been able to raise any outside funding.\n\n\"I'm a female founder. I have a less than 2% chance of raising capital, statistically speaking,\" says Stembel. \"I've tried several times thus far and have not been successful. I didn't graduate college. I didn't work at one of the big tech giants. I didn't have the connections.\"\n\nInstead, the operation remains self-funded. Farmgirl was launched eight years ago with $49,000 of Stembel's own savings. This year, it's expected to log about $23 million in annual revenue \u2014 and it's turning a profit, she says.\n\nStill, Stembel is vigilant about keeping costs under control. The business relies on social media \u2014 mostly Facebook and Instagram \u2014 for 90% of its marketing efforts.\n\nAnother cost-saving measure: \"We opt to use empty coffee bags from local roasters [and] cut them down to size for wrapping. We love the look it gives the arrangements and it is compostable on the customer's end.\"\n\nA key mission of Farmgirl Flowers is to help reduce waste in the floral industry.\n\n\"We are reinvesting all of our profit into our growth and bootstrapping,\" she says. \"I'm really proud of that now.\"\n\nOne area where she doesn't skimp is hiring.\n\nStembel says she hires only full-time employees and offers a 401(k) plan. The startup currently employs 100 people.\n\n\"I am very passionate about creating good jobs,\" says Stembel. \"But the challenge is that it is so much more expensive. Our workers comp is more expensive than our medical insurance, and we offer full medical.\"\n\nStembel says she looks to the future one day at a time, but has no plans on immediate selling the company or taking it public.\n\n\"I don't know if we'll be acquired, or [do] an IPO, or grow really big. I don't know that I'll always be the CEO,\" she says. \"I hope that I can learn enough to be a really good leader at every level.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "aabdelsalam", "title": "\u0645\u0635\u0645\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062a \u064a\u062c\u0633\u062f\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0624\u0644\u0624 \u0628\u0623\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u062f\u0628\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0645\u064a\u0645", "description": "\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631\u062a \u0663 \u0645\u0635\u0645\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062a \u062a\u062c\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0642\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0648\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0648\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0624\u0644\u0624 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0641\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0636\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0639 \u062f\u0628\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u061f", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/style/video/2018/11/19/v68290-dubai-design-week-saudi", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/19/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-19%20at%202.16.52%20PM.jpg?itok=C_OnM07e", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:30:59Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Thomas Page, CNN", "title": "'The Crimes of Grindelwald's' fascist themes are everywhere this fall", "description": "Back in November 2016, before the premiere of the first installment of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" spin-off series, J.K.

Her debut screenplay focused on happy-go-lucky\u2026 [+5011 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) Back in November 2016, before the premiere of the first installment of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" spin-off series, J.K. Rowling told press that the story had been influenced by rising populism around the world. Her debut screenplay focused on happy-go-lucky \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander scurrying around New York in pursuit or errant creatures, but on the fringes lay dark forces waiting to take center stage -- namely evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald.\n\nNow Rowling's follow-up \" The Crimes of Grindelwald \" arrives in cinemas. Anyone who read or watched the Harry Potter series knew where the story was heading. What we didn't know was that it was heading there quite so soon.\n\nLast seen carted off by the magic police, on his return Grindelwald is a seductive orator who loves a stump speech. He's distrustful of the state, obsessed with lineage, preaching a supremacist vision declaring non-wizards are not \"lesser\" but \"other\" and a threat waiting to bloom. It's wizards first he says, his manifesto built on fear. Yet Grindelwald draws characters we thought we knew to his cause.\n\nRowling's script takes 1920s European history, filters it through her magical world and adds dashes of contemporary American anxieties. It's not particularly subtle -- but then nor does it seem to want to be. And it's not the only film this autumn flexing its political muscles.\n\nA political slate\n\nAfter a summer in which Vox bemoaned a lack of clear-headed politics in recent blockbusters, we have ourselves a season of big screen discontent.\n\nFascism is under the microscope, on scales both large and small. The latest \"Fantastic Beasts\" joins a growing list of releases tackling the subject in vary degrees of directness.\n\nIn summer's last gasp we already had one under our belt: \" Operation Finale ,\" based on the true story of Mossad agents in 1960 who captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and took him to stand trial in Israel. Then in October, two versions of the 2011 terror attacks committed by Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Breivik, \" 22 Jul y\" by Paul Greengrass and \"Utoya: July 22\" by Erik Poppe.\n\nBoth retellings landed trailing ethical questions about entertainment derived from recent terrorist incidents. For his part, Greengrass told the BBC his film wasn't about the attacks, rather \"how Norway fought for her democracy\" when faced with a far-right ideologue. Through due process in the courts, the nation's values won out.\n\nMia Goth as Sara and Dakota Johnson as Susie star in 'Suspiria.'\n\nLuca Guadagnino's \" Suspiria \" remake, released October in the US, took Dario Argento's cult classic about a German dance school run by witches and injected it with post-World War II trauma, asking if the stain of fascism is destined to pass between subsequent generations.\n\nMeanwhile in the documentary department, Michael Moore's \" Fahrenheit 11/9 \" hit headlines in September comparing Hitler to President Trump, the director arguing that democracy was not a given.\n\nThere's more material to come. \" Thor Ragnarok \" director Taika Waititi is deep in production for \"Jojo Rabbit,\" a WWII satire in which a young German boy with an imaginary friend (played by Waititi in Hitler get up) is forced to confront his naive worldview.\n\nUpcoming film \"Jojo Rabbit\" features Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, Scarlett Johansson as his mother Rosie and writer/director Taika Waititi as his imaginary friend Adolf.\n\nAnd Guillermo Del Toro announced last month he will write and direct a stop motion \"Pinocchio\" set in 1930s Mussolini-era Italy.\n\nDel Toro described his Pinocchio as \"an innocent soul with an uncaring father who gets lost in a world he cannot comprehend.\" The boy puppet's complicated history, including a period when he was appropriated by fascist propagandists and indoctrinators in Italy, adds an extra dimension to what promises to be a complex retelling.\n\nEntertainment and advocacy\n\nWhat's the end goal here? Entertainment yes, but also something more.\n\n\"'Operation Finale' isn't just a museum piece, it has things to say about today,\" said its director Chris Weitz Waititi went with: \"This film is going to piss off a lot of racists and that makes me very happy.\"\n\nBoth comments point to relevancy and advocacy. But there are issues controlling the message. In a digital age when images can be so easily stripped of intended meaning, cinema's ability to advocate for a political position also leaves it open to appropriation or subversion. The \"meme-ification\" of pop culture has seen to that.\n\nSo should creatives continue feeding these images into the pop culture machine? In holding up characters like Grindelwald for scrutiny in the expectation of condemnation, do filmmakers create another poster boy for those who would espouse his views?\n\nCase in point: You can find corners of the internet where \"The Man in the High Castle\" -- a cautionary alt-history drama where the US is divided between the American Reich and Japanese empire -- has been adopted by those who agree with its politics.\n\n'The Crimes of Grindelwald' takes place in a turbulent Paris in 1927.\n\n\"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" not a zero-sum game; many, many times more people who watch the film will be appalled by its villain than see Grindelwald as a brother in arms. But acting as a canary in the cultural coalmine is not without the risk of having your death rattle willfully mistranslated."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Lowry, CNN", "title": "'Ralph Breaks the Internet' runs up score on clever plot", "description": "'Ralph Breaks the Internet' review: 'Wreck-It Ralph' sequel runs up score on clever plot, that may play better with adults than their kids", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/entertainment/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181109160121-ralph-breaks-the-internet-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:14:30Z", "content": "(CNN) It's often said that the best animated movies play equally well with adults and children, while bad ones prove an ordeal for kid-squiring parents.

If anything, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" bends in the opposite direction: The colorful action should delight tykes, but the smart, media-savvy asides make it especially appealing to grownups.\n\nSix years removed from the original \"Wreck-It Ralph,\" the sequel reloads with an inspired premise, as the video-game character of its title (voiced by John C. Reilly) -- always eager to help, but prone to make a mess of things -- inadvertently breaks the game that houses his pal Vanellope (Sarah Silverman). So the pair embark on a journey into the Internet, hoping to acquire the part that can fix the machine and get Sugar Rush back up and running again.\n\nThe plan, not surprisingly, yields a host of unintended consequences, one that exposes the vagaries of the web in an amusing variety of ways. Those include, but aren't limited to, the annoying nature of pop-up ads, the \"like\"-driven calculus of social media, and another reminder that you should never read the comments, especially if you're an unusually sensitive 1980s-era videogame villain.\n\nDrawing heavily from real websites while creating a few new ones, Ralph and Vanellope's adventures are endlessly inventive, none more so than a self-referential dive into Disney's Internet site, where they're exposed to wide range of studio properties, including an animated version of the late Stan Lee and a room filled with Disney princesses. Even with the sequence having been extensively teased, the princesses' admissions about what they have in common -- from waiting for princes to staring at water -- are utterly riotous, an instant classic that will be replayed for years to come.\n\nFor all its pop-culture passions, though, \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" also incorporates very astute lessons about friendship, and the issue of harboring different passions or growing apart. While modern Disney films have been especially good in presenting messages of empowerment and self-esteem, few have been better in communicating the need to accept others without being heavy-handed about it.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Ghosn and a board member have been arrested", "description": "An internal Nissan investigation found Chairman Carlos Ghosn and board member, Greg Kelly, had been under-reporting Ghosn's compensation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/19/nissan-carlos-ghosn-arrested.cnn-business", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119100209-01-carlos-ghosn-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:13:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary,\" the network said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to cover the White House.\"\n\nMonday afternoon's announcement, what the White House called a \"final determination,\" was an abrupt shift from the administration's earlier positions.\n\nNearly two weeks ago the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access to the White House after he had a contentious exchange with President Trump at a press conference.\n\nWhen a federal judge sided with CNN and issued a temporary restraining order last Friday, thereby forcing the White House to restore his press pass for 14 days, the administration continued to threaten his access.\n\nIn a private letter to Acosta that same evening, two of the defendants in CNN's suit -- press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine -- cited Acosta's conduct at the November 7 press conference, where he asked multiple follow-up questions and didn't give up the microphone right away. \"You failed to abide\" by \"basic, widely understood practices,\" the letter to Acosta claimed.\n\nMany journalists have challenged the administration's actions, pointing out that aggressive questioning is a tradition that dates back decades. But Trump appeared eager to advance an argument about White House press corps \"decorum,\" no matter how hypocritical.\n\nThe letter from Shine and Sanders said their \"preliminary decision\" after the press conference was to suspend the press pass. This indicated that the White House could take further action against Acosta as soon as the judge's temporary restraining order expired.\n\nIt was also a sign that the White House was trying to establish a paper trail. The judge in the case, Timothy J. Kelly, had criticized the government for not following due process before banning Acosta on November 7. His ruling in Acosta and CNN's favor was on Fifth Amendment due process grounds.\n\nSo Friday night's letter offered Acosta a chance to contest the decision and said a \"final determination\" would be made by Monday at 3 p.m.\n\nLawyers for Acosta and CNN did respond, forcefully, in a letter and in a court filing.\n\nThey had signaled a willingness to settle after prevailing in court on Friday. But in a new motion on Monday morning, they said the defendants \"did not respond to this offer to cooperate.\" Instead, the letter from Shine and Sanders was an \"attempt to provide retroactive due process,\" the filing alleged.\n\nSo CNN and Acosta asked the judge to set a schedule of deadlines for motions and hearings that would give the network the chance to win a preliminary injunction, a longer form of court-ordered protection to Acosta's press pass.\n\nThey were seeking a hearing \"for the week of November 26, 2018, or as soon thereafter as possible,\" according to the court filing.\n\nThe judge had yet to file on that request when the Monday at 3 p.m. deadline came.\n\nThe new Monday afternoon letter from Sanders and Shine included no expiration date, though it did contain the general threat to take action against reporters who flouts new \"rules.\"\n\nThe White House's letter said, \"Having received a formal reply from your counsel to our letter of November 16, we have made a final determination in this process: your hard pass is restored. Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future, we will take action in accordance with the rules set forth above. The President is aware of this decision and concurs.\"\n\nThe White House press corps, however, has not agreed to any new set of rules governing presidential press conferences. And Trump rarely holds press conferences anyway.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association said Monday it had \"no role in crafting\" what the White House sent out.\n\nThe letter asserts that reporters may ask \"a single question\" at a press conference. Follow-ups will only be permitted \"at the discretion of the President or other White House officials.\" And reporters must \"physically surrender\" the microphone, when directed.\n\nIn practice, many reporters asked follow-up questions at the November 7 press conference.\n\nAnd that's not going to change any time soon. \"For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions. We fully expect this tradition will continue,\" the association said.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the rules are just cover for the administration's loss to CNN in court. At the same time, the White House's move could create a chilling effect among reporters.\n\nTensions remain high, with the White House rarely holding press briefings and Trump regularly lashing out at the media. Some observers wondered if he picked the fight with CNN and Acosta to distract the media from the Democrats' gains in the midterm elections.\n\nTrump seemed to shrug off last week's loss in court, telling Fox's Chris Wallace in an interview that \"it's not a big deal.\"\n\nHe said in the interview that the White House would \"create rules and regulations for conduct\" so that the administration can revoke press passes in the future.\n\n\"If he misbehaves,\" Trump said, apparently referring to Acosta, \"we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference.\"\n\nAcosta, for his part, thanked his supporters on Monday. \"Lets get back to work,\" he tweeted."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jessica Ravitz, CNN", "title": "New report explores what total abortion ban means in the Dominican Republic", "description": "Human Rights Watch takes a close look at the Dominican Republic and how its abortion laws affect women and girls.

A nurse described how a woman who was experiencing heavy bleeding after self-inducing an abortion was forced by medical providers to wait for treatment as \"punishment\" -- only to lose too much blood to be saved. An outreach worker remembered the mentally disabled 14-year-old girl who became pregnant at 12, probably by her father, and received no care.\n\nStories like these are revealed in a new Human Rights Watch report , released Monday, that focuses on the effect of a total governmentban on abortions in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Caribbean nation is one of just 26 countries around the globe that prohibit -- even criminalize -- the procedure with no exceptions, according to the Guttmacher Institute , a research and policy group focused on reproductive health and rights. And the Dominican Republic is one of six countries in the Caribbean and Latin America to maintain restrictions, no matter the circumstances.\n\nArticle 37 in the country's Constitution , which also prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances, reads, \"The right to life is inviolable from conception until death.\"\n\nBut just because abortions are outlawed doesn't mean they don't happen. In fact, Guttmacher has reported that incidence of abortions are no less frequent -- but are less safe -- when they are restricted. And in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 97% of women and girls of reproductive age live in a place with restrictive abortion laws, the rate of abortion has increased, rising 9 percentage points between the early 1990s and 20 years later, Guttmacher found\n\nRosaura Almonte Hern\u00e1ndez, known as \"Esperancita,\" died in 2012 after initally being denied chemotherapy because she was pregnant.\n\nIn a nation where the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance reports that nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted , the lack of safe and legal options for abortion has real consequences, the report shows.\n\n\"Women and girls in the Dominican Republic have always defied the abortion ban, but they have been forced to put their health and lives on the line to end pregnancies clandestinely,\" said Margaret Wurth, senior women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch and the report's author.\n\nThey've tried home remedies, sipped special teas and denied themselves food or water. They've taken prescriptions that aren't supposed to be taken while pregnant, have ingested or inserted other pills to terminate their pregnancies and have tried to harm themselves. One woman reported using a concrete block to beat her belly.\n\n'Fear that permeates everything'\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 167 people for this report. Included were 50 women and girls who'd experienced unplanned or unwanted pregnancies and dozens of others -- such as health providers, social service professionals and other officials.\n\nWomen with resources who want to terminate their pregnancies may be able to travel outside the country or, with the help of their connections, arrange for abortions through safe clandestine providers. But those who are poor or living in rural parts of the country don't have these options, Wurth said. They are left with two choices: have babies they don't want or fend for themselves to end their pregnancies. Adolescent girls, who often lack access to contraception and information, she said, are especially vulnerable.\n\nAdd to this Article 317 in the Dominican Republic's penal code , which threatens prison sentences when it comes to abortion. Women and girls who self-induce or consent to abortions, and medical providers who provide illegal abortions, face the risk of serving time behind bars.\n\nIn practice, while abortions are against the law even to save the life of a woman or girl, the United Nations reports that \"general principles of criminal legislation allow abortions to be performed for this reason on the grounds of necessity.\"\n\nBut this exception doesn't help every woman or girl who feels she needs an abortion.\n\nProsecutions and arrests are rare, but fear of both persists -- often preventing people from seeking or offering help, Wurth explained. Even women who have had miscarriages, she said, admit being afraid to enter hospitals because they might be falsely accused of having induced an abortion.\n\n\"Criminal penalties create fear that permeates everything,\" the report's author said. It means women and girls believe that \"Going to the hospital and saying I had an abortion means I'm going to jail.\"\n\nAs a result, complications like heavy bleeding or pain go untended to and, in the worst cases, kill. A perforated uterus and tissue remaining in the uterus that leads to sepsis are two examples of what can go horribly wrong.\n\nEven with the fear of arrest, \"there are an estimated 25,000 hospitalizations for abortion and miscarriage in the public health system every year, many of which are women needing care after a clandestine abortion,\" the report says.\n\nThis information came from Dr. Jos\u00e9 Mord\u00e1n, the head of the Department of Family Health at the Ministry of Public Health, in an email he sent this month to Human Rights Watch, the report states. He also said that at least 8% of maternal deaths in the Dominican Republic result from illegal abortions or miscarriages.\n\nSome of the girls and women who did seek medical help after experiencing complications talked to Human Rights Watch about being mistreated and abused by care providers. They reported name-calling, being denied pain medications and even undergoing surgical procedures without anesthesia.\n\nBut mixed in too are those in the medical community who put their patients first, laws be damned, the report shows.\n\n\"Sometimes you have your hands tied. You don't know what to do. You have the law telling you that you can't do it [perform an abortion],\" one doctor told Human Rights Watch researchers. \"But it doesn't work like that. ... My job is to preserve the woman's life. If I have to violate the law, I will.\"\n\n'A starting point'\n\nA poll taken in the Dominican Republic by a research organization shows that 79% of those surveyed believe abortion should be decriminalized in certain cases. And protesters, demanding change, took to the streets in July.\n\nThousands march in Santo Domingo in July, calling for the decriminalization of abortion in the Dominican Republic.\n\nA coalition of groups, ob-gyns, the ministry of health and even President Danilo Medina support legalizing abortion in three circumstances, Wurth said: when the life of a woman or girl is endangered, when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, and when the pregnancy is unviable and the fetus won't survive outside the womb.\n\nMedina has objected to the penal code a number of times, encouraging decriminalization in these three circumstances. In a letter to the president of the Senate in 2016, obtained by Human Rights Watch, he called these exceptions \"extreme circumstances, terrible, but that occur in daily life, and which we as legitimate representatives of the people, should give responses in accordance with the Constitution and with our values.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSo far, though, the laws remain the same. It's on the National Congress to enact this kind of reform -- and Wurth is hopeful that it will. Other countries, like Ireland this year and Chile last year , have eased abortion restrictions. And the Guttmacher Institute reports that 27 countries, between 2000 and 2017, reformed their laws to increase legal abortion access.\n\nWhy not the Dominican Republic too, Wurth asked, even if it's limited to three circumstances?\n\n\"It would be a starting point,\" she said. \"There's no place in modern democracy for a ban on abortion.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Hadas Gold, CNN Business", "title": "Facebook donates $6 million to support local news in UK", "description": "As Facebook faces increasing scrutiny for misinformation on its platform, its UK arm is looking to help bolster local reporting.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/media/facebook-donation-local-journalism/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181002003457-cnnmoney-facebook-hq-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:55:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "London (CNN Business) As Facebook faces increasing scrutiny for misinformation on its platform, its UK arm is looking to help bolster local reporting.\n\nThe social media site is donating \u00a34.5 million pounds (about $6 million) to the National Council for the Training of Journalists to launch the Community News Project, the company announced Monday.

sister of an unarmed black man who died after being tased by California deputies last month says police video of the incident contradicts official accounts of how he died.\n\nIn a statement released that day, San Mateo County Sheriff's Office said deputies encountered Okobi \"running in and out of traffic\" about 1 p.m.\n\nOkobi \"immediately assaulted\" a deputy who got out of his vehicle and there was a struggle with other deputies who responded, the statement continued. It said Okobi was taken into custody and transported to a hospital, where he died. San Mateo County District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe said Tasers were discharged at Okobi three to four times.\n\nAn autopsy report has not been completed.\n\nOkobi's sister Ebele Okobi -- Facebook's public policy director for Africa -- said in a post on the social media platform Sunday that her family had seen videos on Friday of her brother \"getting tortured to death in broad daylight.\"\n\n\"They were shocking because they contradicted, in every single particular, the statement that the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office released and to which San Mateo District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe referred in multiple news outlets after my brother's murder,\" she wrote.\n\nCNN has not viewed the video and has not been able to confirm what it shows.\n\nWagstaffe said the video will be released when an investigation into the incident has concluded.\n\nIn a Monday statement, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office said it \"also wants these videos released to the public as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"It is our understanding that there may still be witnesses to interview and therefore the release of video could influence the independent recollection of those witnesses,\" the sheriff's office said. \"We need to provide the district attorney's office with every ability to conduct a full and complete investigation.\"\n\n'He is not fighting'\n\nEbele Okobi wrote that the videos showed that her brother had been calmly walking on the sidewalk, carrying bags, when a deputy drove up alongside him and asked what he was doing, telling Okobi he needed to question him. Her brother then \"walks to the intersection, looks out for traffic, and crosses the street,\" her Facebook post says.\n\nShe said the deputy calls for backup and a second police car cuts off Okobi, who drops his bags and puts his hands in the air.\n\n\"They grab him, rip off his jacket. He tries to run, asking, 'What's wrong? What did I do?'\" Ebele Okobi wrote. She said her brother was then tased and fell to the ground while keeping his hands raised.\n\n\"He is not fighting, just crying in pain. I will never forget the visual of his hands, waving above his head, open, begging. He begs them to take the Taser prongs off of him. He tries to pull them off himself,\" Ebele Okobi's post reads.\n\n\"When there is a break in the torture, my brother staggers to his knees, tries to run away. A deputy pulls out his baton, strikes, they tase him again. My brother goes down. At some point, my brother tries to run across the street, they chase him, they tase him, they pepper spray him, they jump on top of him while he is prone,\" she writes.\n\nEventually, the footage shows someone shouting \"I see blood,\" she writes. \"Then it's over.\" No CPR or other lifesaving measures are administered, she writes.\n\nOngoing investigation\n\nEbele Okobi listed a number of calls for action, including for the videos and relevant recordings to be released to the public. She also called for a moratorium on the use of Tasers in San Mateo County and the creation of a permanent independent police review body to investigate officer-involved killings and use of force.\n\nWagstaffe declined her call for an independent investigation, saying his investigation is not yet complete.\n\n\"Everything that I review at the end of this I release to the public,\" Wagstaffe said Sunday night.\n\nHe told CNN that Okobi's family and their attorneys had viewed a 25-30 minute composite video -- made up of witness cell phone video, surveillance footage and deputies' dashcam footage -- that showed any interaction between law enforcement and Okobi on the day he died. He said that sheriff's deputies do not wear body cameras.\n\nWagstaffe said he decided to show the video to the Okobi family because he wanted them to be apprised of the situation from his office, rather than hearing of any new developments secondhand through the media.\n\n\"They lost a loved one,\" Wagstaffe said, \"I respect that.\"\n\nWagstaffe said neither he nor anyone from his office had ever said Okobi attacked a deputy and said any correction of the record in those statements would have to be done by the San Mateo County Sheriff's office.\n\nFather of one\n\nIn the weeks after her brother's death, Ebele Okobi spoke out against police violence against black men.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what school you went to,\" she said. \"You can go to Harvard. You can work in tech. Every black American will tell you they live in a state of constant anxiety. Every black man will tell you they can work at Google, they can be a senior person at Facebook or Apple but when you're driving and you're a black man, you recognize the danger that you're in.\"\n\nChinedu Okobi graduated in 2003 with a degree in business administration from Morehouse College in Atlanta.\n\nHe grew up in the San Francisco area as the youngest son of a Nigerian-American family, Ebele Okobi said after his death.\n\nChinedu Okobi pictured with his daughter.\n\nShe said her brother had a 12-year-old daughter and was really gentle: \"He was someone people connected to all his life. He was a kind person. He loved poetry. He recorded poetry. He recorded rap. He was also very spiritual and deeply religious.\"\n\nEbele Okobi also said in October that her brother had spent the last decade struggling with mental health issues and may have stopped taking medications earlier this year.\n\nIn her Facebook post Sunday, she said that she was angry that she had at first believed it was possible that her brother's mental illness could have played a role in his death.\n\n\"I knew that my brother didn't 'attack' or 'assault' deputies, but because of his mental illness, I believed it was possible that he might have been in crisis and acting erratically,\" she said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Stacey Lastoe", "title": "World's best ski resorts in 2018", "description": "The World Ski Awards contest has come out with 2018 winners.

Ski representatives from Europe, Asia, North America, South America and Australasia gathered in Austria for three days of alpine events, capped off with the awards ceremony. Voting was done online by both ski professionals and the general public.\n\nNearly all of the top honors went to European resorts, hotels and operators.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, Val Thorens in the French Alps was named best ski resort in the world. Europe's highest resort, Val Thorens is part of the 3 Vallees ski area (Courchevel and Meribel are the other two), with ski offerings for all levels and much on offer off the mountain too.\n\nBest ski hotel: A mix of contemporary design touches and Swiss tradition helped give W Verbier its third straight win. W Verbier\n\nAlpine Europe\n\nEurope dominated in the hotel and chalet category, with many of 2018's winners the same as last year's. W Verbier in Switzerland was once again named World's Best Ski Hotel, and World's Best Green Ski Hotel went to Rocksresort (its stone buildings are heated with renewable biomass energy), also in Switzerland.\n\n\u00b0Fahrenheit Seven Courchevel won World's Best New Ski Hotel, and \u00b0Fahrenheit Seven Val Thoren took home an award for France's best ski hotel. \u00b0Fahrenheit Communication Manager Chlo\u00e9 Vidoni, whose parents started the hotel brand, is proud of the recognition and says that they \"are all very thankful that people understood our philosophy on hospitality and voted for us.\"\n\nAustria's own Aurelio Lech won World's Best Boutique Hotel. Its minimalist, spare decor results in clean lines and a polished feel. Apr\u00e9s- ski opportunities abound and non-skiing activities -- such as alpaca trekking -- are on offer here as well.\n\nPerched above the Swiss town of Zermatt is the Chalet Les Anges. It was named World's Best Ski Chalet for the second consecutive year. Elysian Collection\n\nChalet Les Anges claimed World's Best Chalet again, and newcomer Chalet des Cascades , also in France, took home World's Best New Chalet. The catered chalet, which sleeps up to 14, includes hot breakfast, afternoon tea and cakes, and a four-course evening meal with wine pairings.\n\nA few resorts in the U.S. and Canada are now offering extreme ski trips where a helicopter ride takes you away from the crowds and straight to fresh snow.\n\nEverywhere else\n\nRegional \"best of\" awards also honored hotels, chalets, resorts and boutique hotels, so all is not completely lost for destinations outside of Europe.\n\nThere were several repeats in these categories as well, with Hokkaido's Rusutsu once again winning Japan's best resort and upmarket, no-snowboarders-allowed Deer Valley in Utah taking home a win for Best Ski Resort in the United States.\n\nIn China, Vanke Lake Songhua Resort , located at the foot of Daqingshan mountain, was named best ski resort, and Thredbo , which lays claim to the longest runs in Australia, won best resort.\n\nSki Dubai in the UAE was named World's Best Indoor Ski Resort, demonstrating that there's more than one way to enjoy the slopes and living in a desert doesn't mean you can't enjoy alpine activities.\n\nWorld's Best Indoor Ski Resort: Ski Dubai took home this honor.

For his Outstanding Contribution to Ski Tourism, Argentina's Juan Cruz Adrogu\u00e9 was the only person, not organization, to receive an accolade. Adrogu\u00e9 was given the award because of his decade-long pioneering work at the Argentine ski resort of Chapelco . The ski resort, located in the country's lakes district, won Argentina's Best Ski Resort for the fourth consecutive year."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Dan Merica, CNN", "title": "Sun Sentinel: Brenda Snipes resigns as Broward County supervisor of elections", "description": "Brenda Snipes has submitted her resignation as the supervisor of elections for Broward County, Florida, after the completion of a recount that brought renewed scrutiny of her tenure, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/politics/brenda-snipes-florida-broward-resigns/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113214237-brenda-snipes-11-13-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:26:35Z", "content": "(CNN) Brenda Snipes has submitted her resignation as the supervisor of elections for Broward County, Florida, after the completion of a recount that brought renewed scrutiny of her tenure, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. \"It is true.

Rick Scott, which was obtained by CNN. She requested in the letter that her resignation be effective January 4, 2019.\n\nSnipes, a Democrat, was the subject of widespread condemnation from Republicans during Florida's statewide recount.\n\nRepublicans used Snipes, who oversaw the at times hapless vote counting effort in Broward County, as a foil during the recount, seizing on mistakes made in her office to suggest that fraud was being committed, although no evidence of fraud was ever produced. Snipes dismissed the criticism as politically motivated, and expressed her frustration during the recount.\n\n\"I can't wait for this to be over,\" she told CNN last week.\n\nFlorida's recount ended on Sunday, when all of the state's 67 counties -- including Broward -- submitted their final vote totals to the secretary of state.\n\nDuring the recount, Snipes publicly toyed with the idea of stepping down.\n\n\"It is time to move on, to let someone else (do the job),\" Snipes said. When a reporter asked whether she would resign, the election official backed off slightly.\n\n\"Well, I haven't finalized that. I'll just check with my family. They'll tell me what I'm doing,\" she said.\n\nIt now appears that Snipes has finalized her decision.\n\nOne reason the accusations of Republicans stuck is because Snipes has a history of legal issues during her time as the head of elections for the county.\n\nA Florida judge ruled that Snipes violated state and federal laws when she destroyed ballots too soon after the 2016 election, despite one of the Democratic candidates in a primary race taking her to court to preserve the ballots and a federal requirement that mandates ballots be kept for 22 months after an election.\n\nShe was also party to a lawsuit in 2016 over a medical marijuana amendment that was missing from some absentee ballots and another suit decided in 2018 regarding when and how her staff could open absentee ballots.\n\nThe lawsuits were the backbone of attacks against Snipes, whom Republicans cast as a scandal-plagued liberal who was trying to tip the election in the favor of Democrats.\n\nSnipes was appointed to her position in 2003 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, after he removed her predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, for a series of missteps. Snipes went on to win re-election four times, most recently in 2016.\n\nDemocrats tried to use Snipes' appointment by Bush as a defense against Republican criticism, but it did little to blunt the attacks.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, the Republican Senate candidate, put Snipes squarely at the center of his recount effort, suing her shortly before the recount began, and calling her out by name -- along with Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher -- during a televised statement on the steps of the governor's mansion.\n\nAnd during the recount, Bush called for Snipes to be removed from office once the tallying was completed."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "George Ramsay and Christina Macfarlane, CNN", "title": "Alexander Zverev thanks 'soft guy' Dad after ATP Finals win", "description": "Alexander Zverev speaks to CNN Sport after securing the biggest title of his career with victory over Novak Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/19/tennis/alexander-zverev-nitto-atp-world-tour-finals-tennis-novak-djokovic-spt-intl-grm/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119115020-alexnader-zverev-atp-finals-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:25:01Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Story highlights Zverev thanks Dad after ATP World Finals victory\n\nThe pair shared an 'emotional' hug after win\n\n(CNN) After sealing the biggest title of his young career, Alexander Zverev embraced his Mum and Dad -- as well as his dog.\n\nHaving nurtured his son's tennis progression, Sunday was a particularly poignant moment for Alexander Zverev Sr. as he watched the 21-year-old prodigy topple Novak Djokovic in straight sets and win the ATP World Tour Finals the day after ousting Roger Federer in the semifinals in London.\n\n\"There were a lot of emotions hugging him.

Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book, \" Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting .\" Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) It's quite possible that voter suppression made the difference in the Georgia gubernatorial election, which Republican Brian Kemp narrowly won over Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who was seeking to become the nation's first female African-American governor.\n\nYet instead of simply conceding, Abrams has cast a cloud of illegitimacy over Kemp's victory, refusing to answer CNN's Jake Tapper as to whether Kemp legitimately won the election. Instead, she simply said that he would be the \"legal Governor of Georgia.\"\n\nThat hedging is itself harmful to democratic legitimacy. While Abrams may have valid points -- Kemp, for example, improperly used his position as secretary of state to influence the campaign, and promulgated voter registration rules that potentially shut out thousands of minority voters -- our democracy depends on the losers recognizing the winner's rightful claim to the elected office.\n\nOther candidates who have lost under a cloud of electoral improprieties have not questioned the final result in the same way. Most famously, Al Gore almost certainly should have won the 2000 presidential election, if not for the \"butterfly\" ballot in Palm Beach County, Florida that confused voters who meant to vote for him.\n\nMany saw the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore , which ended the recount, as fundamentally unfair. George W. Bush won Florida by only 537 votes, which gave him an Electoral College majority. Yet in accepting his loss , Gore did not refuse to acknowledge Bush's win as \"legitimate.\"\n\nOf course, the situations are not exactly analogous: Unlike Kemp, Bush wasn't creating the rules of the game in the very campaign where he was a candidate (though arguably it is similar given that the person running Florida's elections at the time, Secretary of State Katherine Harris, was also serving as the co-chair of Bush's Florida campaign). To be sure, others suggested that Bush was not a legitimate President. But the losing candidate himself graciously accepted defeat.\n\nWe will probably never know for sure if Kemp's actions, leading to voter suppression, may have changed the result in Georgia. Yet that's not as important as the underlying problem: voter suppression is never appropriate and we must do everything we can to make it easy for all voters -- and especially racial minorities, given our sorry history of discrimination -- to participate in our democracy.\n\nIt's heartening that Abrams apparently plans to file a lawsuit to change Georgia's election processes and make it easier to vote. But there's a meaningful difference between challenging Kemp's voter suppression tactics and refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of his election while conceding the race. It's possible for Abrams both to lament the voter suppression that occurred -- while pledging to fix it -- and still recognize Kemp as the legitimate winner this year.\n\nI've not been shy about criticizing Donald Trump and other Republicans for lying about voter fraud as a political maneuver to justify voter suppression. Though it's not exactly the same, Abrams' refusal to acknowledge Kemp as a legitimate winner also undermines the public's confidence in our electoral structure. Of course, that was likely Abrams' point -- to draw attention to the election problems in the state. But the answer is to work harder for positive voting rights changes, not to question whether the winner actually has a rightful claim to the office.\n\nFor more opinion...

That has set a dangerous precedent, undermining the public's confidence in our elections. Democrats shouldn't follow their lead.\n\nAs Abrams said in her CNN interview, words matter. Losing candidates should recognize the legitimate claim of the winner to the elected office. Then they should double down on their efforts to make our electoral system as inclusive and democratic as possible."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump changes step on midterms: 'I wasn't on the ballot'", "description": "After Republicans lost the House in the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump said in an interview with Fox News that these losses couldn't be tied to him because he was not on the ballot.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/19/trump-fox-ballot-midterms-congress-newday-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119074512-trump-fox-news-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:01:26Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for.\"\n\nMcRaven's crime, as far as Trump seems to be concerned, is that he publicly defended former CIA director, John Brennan, in August when the President revoked Brennan's security clearance because of his criticism of Trump.\n\nMcRaven has also stood up for the press, which Trump routinely derides as \"the enemy of the people.\" In a speech in Texas last year McRaven said, \"This sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\"\n\nIn Sunday's interview, Trump went on to claim that bin Laden was \"living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\"\n\nThis is complete nonsense. When I was researching a book about the hunt for bin Laden, I spoke to dozens of key government, intelligence and military officials involved in the bin Laden operation and they all said that the Pakistanis had no clue that al Qaeda's leader was living in the city of Abbottabad, Pakistan where he was found.\n\nOn the night of the bin Laden operation, US officials eavesdropped on the communications of top Pakistani officials who were completely surprised by the news that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad.\n\nIn the interview Sunday, Trump went on to say, \"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\" This is an appalling smear on the many dozens of men and women at the CIA who dedicated their entire careers to finding bin Laden both before and after 9/11.\n\nThe fact is that finding bin Laden took a decade after the 9/11 attacks because he wasn't using any form of electronic communication and relied instead on handheld messages delivered by his trusted courier. As a result, even senior leaders of al Qaeda didn't know where bin Laden was hiding.\n\nThe whole issue of the hunt for bin Laden may be a sore subject for Trump because the final countdown for the operation took place during the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner when Obama roasted Trump mercilessly for his penchant for spreading conspiracy theories, such as the so-called \"birther\" conspiracy, which claimed that Obama wasn't an American citizen.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDuring a break from rehearsing that speech for the correspondents' dinner, Obama called McRaven for a final status check.\n\n\"What do you think about the intel?\" Obama asked. The intelligence that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad was entirely circumstantial.\n\n\"Well, if he's there, we're going to get him. If he's not, we won't,\" McRaven answered.\n\n\"Exactly! It's 50-50,\" Obama said, according to reporting from my book about the hunt for bin Laden.\n\nThe president wrapped up the call, saying, \"I couldn't have any more confidence in you than the confidence I have in you and your force. Godspeed to you and your forces. Please pass on to them my personal thanks for their service and the message that I personally will be following this mission very closely.\"\n\nThe bin Laden raid was, of course, a success. Not only was bin Laden killed, but also thousands of important documents about al Qaeda were recovered during the operation. As a result, it is arguably the most successful special operations mission in American history.\n\nAfter stepping down from leading the Special Operations Command, McRaven became the chancellor of the University of Texas, where as an undergraduate he had majored in journalism. (He has since retired from that role.)\n\nIt's an experience that seems to have shaped McRaven's continuing pushback against Trump's assaults on the press."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"},

Before then, the number of people contracting the disease globally had been falling.\n\nThe 10 highest-burden countries in Africa saw a significant increase in cases. Nigeria, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo had the greatest rise, reporting an extra half a million cases each.\n\nAcross the 10 countries -- including Tanzania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Uganda and Niger -- there were an extra 3.5 million people diagnosed with malaria in 2017 over 2016.\n\n\"We're no longer seeing a decrease in malaria as we were over the past few years,\" said Alistair Robb, senior adviser for WHO's Global Malaria Programme. \"This is a concern.\"\n\nWHO's region of the Americas also saw a rise in malaria cases, mostly due to increases in Brazil, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nMalaria is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is both preventable and treatable, yet an estimated 435,000 people died of it worldwide in 2017. The African region accounts for 92% of all cases, according to the report.\n\nSome countries had a significant decline in the number of reported cases, most notably India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Rwanda. India reported 3 million fewer cases and Rwanda 430,000 fewer cases in 2017, according to the report. Experts are heralding these countries as examples, particularly for those countries with increasing cases.\n\nSuccess in these four countries came down to political commitment, reaching marginalized populations and efficiently using resources, such as bed nets and drugs, Robb explained. In many parts of Africa, \"large numbers of people still do not have access.\"\n\nIn the high-burden African countries, the people most in need -- marginalized and vulnerable communities -- are unable to access treatment and prevention resources, he added, leaving them prone to infection. In 2017, an estimated half of the people at-risk of the disease in Africa did not sleep under a treated net, according to the report.\n\n\"We have distributed tools where we can,\" said Dyann Wirth, professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Now, strategies should be rethought, as there are issues to address differently, she said.\n\n\"If we just keep doing the same thing, we risk having a significant rebound,\" Wirth said.\n\nMaintaining -- not sitting on -- success\n\n\"You can't be complacent,\" Robb added, citing Nicaragua and Venezuela, which have seen a rise in malaria cases for the past three years, and Brazil the past two years.\n\nVenezuela saw the greatest increase on the continent, with 411,000 cases in 2017, up from 136,000 in 2015.\n\nHowever, South America as a whole has a low burden of malaria -- less than 2% of the global burden -- resulting in a different transmission pattern, Robb explained.\n\nPeople there have less natural immunity to malaria, he said, making them more susceptible as a population. A failure to maintain resources there can cause a significant rise in the number of cases.\n\n\"The introduction of an infected person can start an outbreak,\" Wirth said.\n\nWhen levels are also low, the perceived risk is reduced, she explained, so people may be less likely to use bed nets to protect against mosquito bites, for example. \"Paying attention is important.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWirth gave the example of Sri Lanka, which had extremely low levels of cases in the 1960s but saw them bounce back in the 1970s and 1980s. \"It took 35 years to eliminate it again.\" Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free in 2016.\n\nVenezuela now faces the same challenge, she said.\n\n\"It's very important we recognize that progress has stalled,\" Wirth said. \"The countries reporting a rise in cases are an early warning.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Tara John", "title": "Damien Hirst's giant uterus sculptures re-emerge at Qatar hospital", "description": "Conceptual artist Damien Hirst is not one to shy away from a statement -- and a series of bronze sculptures of a gestating fetus gracing the entrance to a new hospital in Qatar is proof.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/damien-hirst-uterus-sculptures-qatar-scli-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119103206-02-damien-hurst-miraculous-journey-doha-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:27:57Z", "content": "arts Published 19th November 2018 Conceptual artist Damien Hirst is not one to shy away from a statement -- and a series of bronze sculptures of a gestating fetus gracing the entrance to a new hospital in Qatar is proof.

We have used the engine on our sailboat \"Boomerang\" a lot more than we anticipated.\n\nThe main reason has been to compensate for the fickle nature of the Mediterranean winds, which have generally been blowing at a speed which is beyond our present level of skill and patience.\n\nIt is wonderful to turn the engine off and be carried along by the power of wind alone. This is Boomerang under sail.\n\nDespite this justification for our occasional diesel-guzzling, many times we've watched other boat owners sail on and off moorings and wondered if we have the right to even describe ourselves as sailors.\n\nAre we in some way \"cheating\" in this time-honored means of travel?\n\nIt seemed like a question for more experienced seafarers so I sought them out in marinas and via the online platform \"Women Who Sail.\"\n\n\"A sailor is anyone who takes to water on a boat\"\n\n\"Sailors throughout history have used every tool at their disposal to accomplish safe and prompt arrival at a destination,\" says Niki Fox Elenbaas, who has been sailing with her husband Jamie for almost four decades. \"I doubt that Phoenicians considered the deployment of sweeps or kedging as 'cheating.'\"\n\nWhile the couple prefer to use the sails, they do use their engine when mooring their 40ft catamaran \"Grateful.\"\n\n\"We are able to sail on and off anchor and mooring buoys but why?\" asks Fox Elenbaas. \"Safety and preserving our bodies for more years of sailing matters more than some idea of 'purity' in our journeys.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED \u200bThe first man to sail round the world solo\u200b\u200b\u200b Replay More Videos ...

It is very broad,\" says Australian MySail Founder and CEO Deborah Dalziel.\n\n\"There are so many types of sailing and boating that can be done and so many different ways to enjoy the sport. I don't think people should limit themselves to a definition here. Sailing is what you make of it.\"\n\n'Easy is not the goal'\n\nWhile we at times feel like we are making a bit of a hash of it and fear the humiliation of crashing while docking, we have found the sailing community to be refreshingly non-judgmental and incredibly supportive of all \"yachties\" no matter what their level of skill.\n\nAmong them is Shemaya Laurel who has honed her skills to the point she no longer uses an engine at all on her 20ft Chebacco Glasshouse \"Auklet.\"\n\n\"Forethought, planning and schedule flexibility are crucial,\" says the American skipper, in explaining the challenges of sailing without an engine. \"When I think about putting a motor back on the boat, it's because it would make things so much easier, but easy is not necessarily the goal.\"\n\nFor Laurel, the goal is to use traditional rigging and methods of sailing. To use a motor would simply defeat the purpose for her at this point in her sailing career.\n\nMany sailors use their engine when the wind is benign.\n\nAsk anyone who owns a sail boat, ourselves included, and the preference is almost always to leave the engine off.\n\n\"I really love it when the wind is strong and the sails are up and the boat is heeled over with water running over the gunnels,\" says Maribeth Theisen who sails a 43ft Dufour Gib Sea. \"There is nothing quite like the quiet absence of engine noise and sounds of the water being sliced by the keel.\"\n\nBook editor Jennifer Silva Redmond has been sailing since 1989, and says it is the \"blessed silence and the feeling of using nature to power your travel.\"\n\nCloser to Mother Nature\n\nThis sentiment was also shared by Jeanne Assael Goussev who made history this year as the skipper of \"Sail Like A Girl,\" the first all-female team and first monohull to win the Race to Alaska.\n\nEngines aren't permitted in this unsupported race, but they were able to power the boat's propellers with bicycles mounted on the stern.\n\nAssael Goussev (on the right) skippering the all female crew on 'Sail Like A Girl'. The notion of sailing without a notion initially scared her but she loved the feeling of being powered entirely by nature.\n\n\"I have to say that while the notion scared me, I loved relying on nothing but our sails and our bodies,\" says the Seattle-based sailor. \"I felt closer to Mother Nature and the sea than I ever had before.\"\n\nA desire to protect the environment and reduce our carbon footprint is profound within the sailing community and was also cited by many sailors as the reason they prefer wind over an engine.\n\nPhotos: Best sailing images 2018 Portuguese photographer Ricardo Pinto has won the Mirabaud Yacht Racing Image award for 2018.

The boat handles beautifully under sail and is far more comfortable than when motoring.\"\n\nEven then, the Hendersons wouldn't be without their engine.\n\n\"We use our motor in emergency situations. We had an anchor drag once and another time ended up on a lee shore. In both cases we were pleased to have it.\"\n\nEngines come in handy... when you hit a sleeping whale\n\nSafety was another key reason many sailors considered it crucial to have auxiliary power on sailboats.\n\nFormer corporate executive Jodi Watson and her husband Kirby were thankful for their engine during a recent passage from San Diego to Cabo San Lucas in the Pacific Ocean when they hit, what they believe, was a sleeping whale. The impact knocked out the boat's steering.\n\n\"After trying to fix it for eight hours bobbing in the ocean, we had to get the emergency tiller out and steer the boat into safety. If we didn't have a reliable engine during that time, the outcome could have been extremely dire for us.\"\n\nSailors Jodi Watson and her husband sail \"SV Lodos\" were thankful for their engine after hitting what they believe was a sleeping whale.\n\nBudget can be another factor.\n\nTony and Shannon Morrelli, who sail 45 ft Hunter Legend \"SV Sweetie,\" say the amount they use the engine can come down to the cost of fuel.\n\n\"We used to do a lot more motor-sailing in the America's for convenience when fuel was cheaper. We sail much, much more and pick weather windows that allow us to sail entire legs now that we are in Europe with fuel twice as costly.\"\n\nMia McCroskey, who began sailing in the mid-1980s, believes people who have sails and don't use them much are \"missing the point\" but there are still a number of reasons she will turn on the engine.\n\n\"Has the wind died? Is my crew complaining that the rigging is rattling noisily? Do we want to get anchored or docked so we can have a beer?\"\n\nBigger question is: why do we sail, and what is our goal?\n\nNeedless to say, the sailing community has assured me we are not \"cheating.\" It is more a question of why we sail and what our goal is. At this stage, our focus is on staying safe and remaining enthusiastic in the face of mishaps.\n\nThe reality is we couldn't have chosen this incredibly rewarding way of life if we had set off on a boat that was only fitted with sails.\n\nOnboard 'Boomerang' we use our engine when mooring and to make progress when the wind is blowing in a direction or at a speed that is beyond our level of experience and patience.\n\nThe perils of not having an alternative source of propulsion were amplified for us even on our maiden voyage when we caught a monstrous rope around the propeller, disabling the engine. We were in the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping routes, in a flat calm and had to be towed back to land for the safety of ourselves and others.\n\nAs our journey, continues it would be wonderful to think that our skills and patience will also progress to the point we could we cover vast distances by the power of wind alone.\n\nBut equally, it's nice to know that even if we do \"crank up the donk\" -- as many sailors put it -- we're still accepted as part of a diverse and inspiring community of adventurers who respect the sea and its farers.\n\nAs Niki and Jamie Fox Elenbaas say on \"SV Grateful\": \"Other people's boats are other people's boats.

Gov. Rick Scott came out victorious in the race for US Senate. Former Rep. Ron DeSantis will be Florida's next governor, and Nikki Fried will be the next agriculture commissioner.\n\nIt is finally over\n\nThe 2018 Florida recount drama, a story told against the backdrop of the 2000 presidential recount, turned out to be like most sequels -- a story with a lot of hype that ultimately ended not with a bang, but a faint whimper.\n\nIn the race for governor and US Senate, the ultimate results that we saw on election night ending up being the same results we saw after two exhaustive recounts and several expensive and intense lawsuits. With each passing day, Sen. Bill Nelson's opportunity to flip the results dwindled. The apparent end of his political career came with a simple phone call to his successor and a pretaped video statement. Neither the call nor the statement were a surprise and they came long after everyone, except seemingly his high-priced election lawyers, knew the outcome of the race.\n\nHow much damage was done?\n\nThe true story of this election may have very little to do with the politicians who won or lost. It may have much more to do with the damage this process did to the democratic system.\n\nAs the recount played out, Republicans at the highest level went to great lengths to suggest that fraudulent votes were being cast or added to the vote total. The most absurd claim of all was leveled by the President of the United States who suggested that Democrats in Florida were changing outfits in cars so that they could vote multiple times.\n\nWhile there are plenty of examples of elections supervisors doing a less than admirable job of counting the votes efficiently -- and there are certainly some questions that need to be answered by Florida Democratic Party leaders about how they conducted their vote-counting process -- none of that had any impact on who won the election.\n\nOn the other end of things, Democrats consistently suggested that Republicans were using their positions of power to willfully set aside legally cast votes to win the election, a theory that was the backbone of their multiple legal challenges. Marc Elias, the lead Democratic lawyer, suggested that perhaps \"many thousands\" of constitutionally legal votes were being tossed out, but a federal judge , who is no fan of Scott, consistently ruled against Elias' legal arguments.\n\nAt the end of this back and forth, there are a significant number of Republicans who truly believe that fraudulent votes were cast, and a significant number of Democrats who believe that lawfully cast votes were tossed aside. There is simply no evidence to support either claim. The democratic process works based on a peaceful transition of power that is based on a faith in our voting system. It worked in Florida -- but not without serious, largely baseless, attacks against its foundation.\n\nRick Scott is a force to be reckoned with\n\nIt may be time to give Scott, the politician, the recognition he deserves.\n\nWhen he broke onto the political scene as an unknown multimillionaire willing to invest significant sums of his own personal fortune, even Republicans were skeptical of his first run for governor in 2010. When I met him for the first time during the campaign, he made sure I knew that the Republican Governor's Association did not initially support his candidacy.\n\nClose to a decade after that initial rejection from the RGA, Scott has won three races in the largest competitive state in America. Along the way, he has beaten major Democratic stars despite being the underdog in every single race. Scott does not have natural political skills, but what he does have is a relentless work ethic and millions of dollars. National Democrats spent roughly $50 million to protect Nelson's seat -- money that could've easily gone to winnable races in other states. Scott's personal bank account meant that national Republicans did not have to spend a dime. Not only is Rick Scott going to be a US Senator, but simply entering the race went a long way to helping Republicans keep the majority in the Senate in 2018.\n\n2020 impact\n\nThe night before the election, I had a lengthy background call with a prominent Florida Democratic leader who was very optimistic about the party's chances but did say what \"keeps me up at night\" was the possibility they could lose, and that a loss could lead national Democrats to wonder if Florida should be written off as a swing state.\n\nFlorida is no easy investment. It costs millions to shower the state with ads and the human capital necessary to win elections. Even though it is most certainly a 50-50 state, Democrats can win the presidency without Florida. If they keep losing there, is it worth it to keep spending millions that could be spent somewhere else?\n\nChances are the answer is yes, for a couple of reasons."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Oscar Holland, CNN", "title": "Return of stolen Picasso dismissed as fake", "description": "Officials say stolen painting may have been returned six years after $21-million heist.

Romania's anti-organized crime agency said in a statement Sunday that it was \"investigating the circumstances in which a Picasso-signed painting worth about 800,000 euros ($913,000) was found Saturday evening in Tulcea County.\"\n\nNetherlands National Police\n\nHowever, writer Mira Feticu, who has previously penned a novel about the Kunsthal heist, described the alleged discovery as a \" publicity stunt .\"\n\nThe novelist told Dutch public broadcaster NOS that she received an anonymous letter alerting her to the painting's whereabouts around 10 days ago. She claims to have subsequently unearthed a canvas in a forest in eastern Romania.\n\nBut Feticu said Sunday that she then received an email from two Belgian directors who admitted to tipping her off as part of a project called \"True Copy,\" according to reports. Images retweeted by Feticu appear to show her with what she at first believed to be the original Picasso canvas.\n\nA website apparently connected to the Belgian pair describes the project as a \"performance\" created \"with a view to bringing back Picasso's 'T\u00eate d'Arlequin.'\" It references infamous Dutch forger, Geert Jan Jansen, explaining that the project \"revolves around the life of a forger and the inherent question of the value of truth.\"\n\nThe site goes on to list a number of news stories reporting the alleged discovery. A representative for the duo declined CNN's request for comment.\n\nWhy is art so expensive?\n\nThe Kunsthal raid shook the art world in 2012, and Romanian prosecutors valued the total haul at 18 million euros ($21 million). The thieves are believed to have entered through a back door, with security camera footage appearing to show them carrying out the paintings minutes later.\n\nPicasso's \"Tete d'Arlequin\" was stolen as part of the Kunsthal art raid.\n\nOther items stolen in the heist included Henri Matisse's \"La Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune\" and Monet's paintings \"Waterloo Bridge, London\" and \"Charing Cross Bridge, London.\" Works by Paul Gauguin, Lucian Freud and Meijer de Haan also went missing in the raid.\n\nA statement from the museum at the time said the artworks belonged to a private collection.\n\nThe Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam a day after seven artworks were stolen in a heist.

Ringleader Radu Dogaru was also sentenced to six years in prison, although none of the missing paintings were ever recovered.\n\nDogaru's mother, who was handed a two-year sentence for her role in the raid, claimed that she had burned the paintings to protect her son when police searched her village. Museum officials in Romania appeared to support her version of events, announcing that traces of paint and canvas had been found in the woman's oven.\n\nShe later denied her initial claims in court, giving rise to hopes that some of the paintings may yet be recovered.\n\nSunday's statement by Romanian authorities said that efforts to authenticate the artwork are underway. Director of the Kunsthal, Emily Ansenk, said that the museum was still waiting for news on the investigation, though she expressed support for the Belgian duo.\n\n\"We are firm believers in artistic freedom, even when it concerns such a sensitive subject for us, and we hope that the (directors) reached their intended goal with this initiative,\" she said in an email to CNN. \"That said, we would have found it even better if the work by Picasso had actually been found undamaged.\"\n\nMira Feticu and Romania's anti-organized crime agency did not respond to CNN's requests for comment."},

A winning bid of $56,250 secured the dress, which comes with a tragic back story.\n\nThe ivory silk moir\u00e9 mini wedding dress was the height of style in 1968, when Tate wore it for her wedding to director Roman Polanski in London.\n\nThen 24 years old, Tate was known as one of the most promising actors in the world after her performance in the 1967 movie \"Valley of the Dolls,\" now a cult classic.\n\nBut just 18 months after her wedding, Tate's life was ended by one of the most notorious criminals in US history.\n\nPolish film director Roman Polanski and the late American actress Sharon Tate at their wedding. Credit: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn August 1969, four members of Charles Manson's \"Family\" gang broke into Tate and Polanski's home in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and murdered the actress and four friends.\n\nManson, who masterminded the killings, was subsequently convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The sentence was eventually modified to life imprisonment.\n\nTate was heavily pregnant and due to give birth to her first child with Polanski when she was killed at the age of 26.\n\nHer wedding dress was sold by Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles Saturday along with other pieces of memorabilia from her estate.\n\nNext summer will mark the 50th anniversary of Tate's death, and this auction is part of a growing wave of interest in her story.\n\n\"The property from the Estate of Sharon Tate has been the most requested auction catalog in all of Julien's Auctions' history.\n\n\"Her wedding dress was one of the most desired items of interest during this weekend's auction given her storybook romance and marriage to Roman Polanski,\" Darren Julien, President and Chief Executive Officer of Julien's Auctions, told CNN.\n\nThe story of Tate's death will be told in upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\n\nAustralian actor Margot Robbie will play Tate, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Lena Dunham, with the film scheduled for release in July 2019."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "s.zaghloul", "title":

California wildfires\n\nBrace yourself, because sadly, it looks like it's going to be another week of devastation in California. The Camp Fire has been burning for more than 10 days, taken at least 77 lives, and destroyed thousands of structures, and officials say it's only about halfway done . Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency, says the blaze likely won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nAmid the horrible news coming out of the Camp Fire, there are a few moments of comfort and kindness to be found. A 'bus driver from heaven' evacuated a school bus full of young students because their parents weren't able to make it to the flame-surrounded school. Elsewhere, a 93-year-old woman with no phone, internet or way to get out was finally saved when a garbage man sped down her street and picked her up . Here she is, safe and sound on the garbage truck.\n\n2. White House\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Mueller probe decisions up to Whitaker Replay More Videos ...

The present castle was built in roughly 1500.\n\nIts imposing location had its downside: legend has it that the castle's kitchen collapsed over the cliff edge and into the crashing waves below.\n\nLater, it was seized by the Scottish MacDonnell clan and now lies in disrepair. Its otherworldly look is said to have inspired CS Lewis, author of the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" series. Apparently, the ruins formed the basis for the Narnian castle of Cair Paravel.\n\nMore recently, it played a role in hit TV series \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nRelated content Spectacular abandoned castles around the world\n\nAnother highlight is Caerlaverock Castle (above) in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It lays claim to being the UK's only triangular castle. Built in the 13th century, during Robert the Bruce's famous rebellion, the castle was part destroyed by the Scots to stop it falling into English hands.\n\nIt was later rebuilt twice, but fell into disrepair in the 16th century and became the atmospheric ruin tourists can visit today.\n\nJelena Popovic, the architect and researcher who chose the six castles that NeoMam digitally recreated, explains to CNN Travel that the team picked the fortresses based on a number of key criteria.\n\nThey chose castles that hadn't really been restored for tourist purposes, were pretty dilapidated and weather beaten, in an array of styles and with plenty of archaeological research available to recreate the structures accurately.\n\nTake Goodrich Castle (above), which dates back to the 1100s. It's owned by British public charity English Heritage and has a tea room on site, but it remains a ruin.\n\n\"Once we had shortlisted the final castles, I dug deeper to find archaeological research and reconstructions available on different sources,\" explains Popovic.\n\nSources included Caithness.Org , a collaborative project by Robert Richmond, Andrew Spratt -- the custodian of Scotland's Dirleton Castle -- and historian Bill Fernie. The NeoMam team also consulted MedievalHeritage.eu , a collaborative website dedicated to ancient and medieval architecture.\n\nRelated content Own part of the French chateau of Ebaupinay for less than $60\n\nPast to present\n\nSo how did the team go about rebuilding the past?\n\nFirst, they analyzed all the images Popovic had collated.\n\n\"If there is the tiniest window or element which allows to determine a historical size and that one is still present today, it is used as a general reference to scale up the entire location,\" Laurentiu Stanciu, the architect and 3D artist, tells CNN Travel.\n\nDunstanburgh Castle -- pictured above -- is a huge castle in the North of England that was built as a show of might by powerful baron Earl Thomas of Lancaster in the 14th century. It formed the backdrop to some intense fighting during the Wars of the Roses, but was later abandoned.\n\nDigitally restoring Dunstanburgh to its original height was a big task.\n\nThe team paid close attention to the materials found on the castles today and the different types of stone -- although matching the materials like for like wasn't always easy.\n\nRelated content 25 of the best places to visit in the UK\n\nThe last step in the process was combining the original image and the architectural drawings with the 3D recreations into an animated gif, which takes the fortress from dilapidated to reconstructed.\n\nAlso on the list is Bothwell Castle, a 13th century castle near Glasgow that was the backdrop of several battles in Scotland's Wars of Independence, changing hands several times.\n\nIt's also supposedly haunted by the ghost of Bonnie Jean, a noblewoman who drowned in the River Clyde while en route to elope with her lover.\n\nRelated content 6 haunting battlefields to explore in Scotland\n\nThe Norman castle of Kidwelly in Wales, which dates back to the 1100s, was among those recreated.\n\nThe result of these digital restorations is an incredible glimpse at the past, the viewer can watch these decrepit medieval structures restored to their former glory."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Euan McKirdy, CNN", "title": "North Korean defector: 'If you don't have money or power, you die in a ditch'", "description": "The North Korean soldier who was caught on tape making a dramatic escape through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to South Korea late last year has given some startling insights into life in the North, including the suggestion that the majority of young people th\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/asia/north-korean-defector-interview-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171122085209-01-north-korea-defector-1122-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:55:02Z", "content": "(CNN) The North Korean soldier who was caught on tape making a dramatic escape through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to South Korea late last year has given some startling insights into life in the North, including the suggestion that the majority of young peo\u2026 [+2954 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) The North Korean soldier who was caught on tape making a dramatic escape through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to South Korea late last year has given some startling insights into life in the North, including the suggestion that the majority of young people there have no loyalty to Kim Jong Un.\n\nGiving his first interview since his defection last November, Oh Chong-song told Japanese and South Korean media that he's a \"new person with a new name\" in South Korea, and that one of the first things he remembers following his emergency life-saving surgery, was seeing the South Korean flag.\n\nThe then-24-year-old was shot around five times by his fellow North Korean soldiers as he made his daring escape across the line that divides North and South Korea.\n\nJUST WATCHED Defector recovering after daring escape Replay More Videos ...

Trouble for Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi: Nissan says that an internal investigation into its chairman, Carlos Ghosn, has turned up evidence of \"significant\" financial wrongdoing.\n\nThe revelation has major implications for the global auto industry. Ghosn is also chairman of Renault and Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ), and the driving force behind an alliance that links the three carmakers.\n\nNissan ( NSANY ) said in a statement that Ghosn has for years been under-reporting his income in Japan. It said \"numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered,\" including personal use of company assets.\n\nThe Japanese carmaker said it would seek to remove Ghosn as chairman. Japanese media reported that Ghosn was being questioned by prosecutors and could be arrested.\n\n\"Nissan has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with their investigation,\" Nissan said in a statement. \"We will continue to do so.\"\n\nStocks had stopped trading in Japan when the statement was released, but Nissan shares listed in Frankfurt dropped over 10%. Renault ( RNSDF ) shares trading in Paris plunged as much as 13%.\n\n2. Brexit support: Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to find a receptive audience Monday when she talks up her Brexit deal at a meeting of the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nJohn Allan, president of the influential business lobby, will endorse her deal to withdraw from the European Union, saying it \"minimizes the damage to our economy,\" according to a copy of his remarks released in advance.\n\n\"While companies in this room would be the first to say that it is not perfect, it does open a route to a long-term trade arrangement and unlocks transition \u2014 the very least that companies need to prepare for Brexit,\" he is expected to say.\n\n\"So our message to the politicians is this \u2014 listen to the businesses in your constituencies \u2014 and everyone who depends upon them,\" he will add.\n\nThe pound strengthened 0.2% to trade at $1.28 on Monday, clawing back some of the losses suffered last week when key UK government ministers resigned and said they would not support the deal. It still needs to be signed off by the other 27 EU member states and the UK parliament.\n\nBefore the Bell newsletter: Key market news. In your inbox. Subscribe now!\n\n4. Earnings and economics: Xiaomi earnings beat estimates Monday, in what should be a boost for the company's beleaguered Hong Kong-listed shares. The Chinese smartphone maker posted profit of 2.5 billion yuan ($360 million) for the three months ended in September. Revenue grew 49%.\n\nChinese e-commerce firm JD.com ( JD ) will publish earnings before the US open.\n\nL Brands ( LB ), the parent company of Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret, will release earnings after the close.

I already knew I was in the right seat, but it was confirmed when he made his demand.\n\nKnowing I was in the right, I refused to show him my pass. The real issue, I think, was that he didn't want to sit in the dreaded middle seat, so he thought he could cajole or intimidate me into moving.\n\nHe didn't call a flight attendant, probably because he knew the aisle seat was mine. Instead, he behaved like a spoiled child, muttering under his breath and throwing me hostile looks for the rest of the flight.\n\nA veteran of the friendly skies\n\nAviation Queen Ben\u00e9t J. Wilson Kelvin Bulluck/Courtesy Ben\u00e9t J. Wilson\n\nI have traveled more than 250,000 miles last year for my work as an aviation journalist, and I've also worked at two airlines, so I'm not new to this rodeo.\n\nOn my travels, I see people who have manners that would impress Emily Post on the ground seemingly lose their minds once they cross the threshold of an airport.\n\nRemember my aisle seat? I choose the aisle because I'm claustrophobic, and I typically have to pay extra to ensure that I get one. But there are always travelers who don't want me to have it. Another scenario I encounter regularly is the seat switcher.\n\nThis person just asks to switch seats so they can either sit next to someone or avoid sitting in a window or middle seat. When I give them a simple no (with no further explanation), it turns into a debate and sometimes even escalates. I even had one person call a flight attendant on me because I refused to move -- from the seat I paid to have.\n\nThat's not your personal storage bin\n\nAnother situation that has only gotten worse since the airlines (minus Southwest Airlines) started charging checked baggage fees is the fight for limited overhead bin space. I'm someone who never checks a bag if I can help it. Thanks to having status on two airlines (which means early boarding and plenty of space in the bins), I never have to worry about overhead bin access. But that hasn't stopped my fellow passengers from behaving badly.\n\nRelated content Christmas vacations: 15 of the best places around the world to go\n\nOne time on a completely full flight, a gentleman was desperately searching for a place to put his bag, with no luck. So he pulled my bag out of the overhead bin, placed it in the middle of the aisle, put his in and sat down.\n\nWhen I asked him to put my bag back, he refused, saying he had a really tight connection and didn't want to check his bag, with no apology for moving mine. After a quick call to the flight attendant and an \"exchange\" over proper bin etiquette, the gentleman had his bag checked to his final destination.\n\nRespect other passengers' space\n\nI've had a passenger try to take a meal I ordered because \"you don't look like a vegetarian.\" I had a seatmate who, right after we landed, climbed over me to rush back three rows to grab her carry-on luggage and attempt to blow past her fellow passengers who were waiting to get off the plane.\n\nI had a woman get upset after I asked her to put her cat back in its kennel under her seat (as required by the airlines) because I'm allergic, and his tail kept brushing me.\n\nRelated content Places to visit in December: 5 delightful destinations\n\nMy dad is a retired Air Force colonel, so that meant a life that included travel throughout my childhood. I took my first flight on Pan Am from New York to London in 1970. Back then, flying was only for the wealthy or privileged few. People dressed up, coach seats were comfortable, and everyone was more civilized.\n\nI know those days aren't coming back. But the current madness must stop, and I'm here to help. Here are five tips to make air travel better for everyone because, in the end, we're all in this together.\n\nLet's get along in the air\n\n1. Choose your seats in advance. If you want to sit with your family or friends, then plan accordingly. There are too many of you who ask your fellow travelers to give up their seats \u2014 the ones we either booked months ago or paid extra for \u2014 because you didn't do it in advance or you were too cheap to pay to get the seat you really want. So either pony up for that seat or sit in the one you've been assigned.\n\n2. Be prepared. Travel is stressful enough, and bad behavior can be caused by some of the things listed above. So cut back on stress by being ready to take to the skies. Have a power pack to ensure your smartphone or tablet stays charged when outlets aren't available.\n\nBring snacks to tide you over in case of flight delays or closed airport eateries. Pack things like eye masks, a travel pillow and noise-canceling headphones to create a peaceful and comfortable environment.\n\n3. Don't be a bin hog. Thanks to airline baggage fees, more people than ever are trying to cart all their belongings onto flights. This has turned into a flashpoint because there are only so many bags that can go into those bins. If bin space runs out, the airline will check it for you \u2014 for free!\n\n4. No temper tantrums. There's that passenger who's upset anytime their flight doesn't go perfectly. They didn't get an upgrade, their special meal didn't show up or their flight was delayed or canceled. So they decide to release their wrath on gate agents, flight attendants or whoever else they feel wronged them. Calm down and realize that things don't always go your way during travel (or in life).\n\n5. Call for help. Flight attendants aren't just there to serve drinks and snacks. They have been trained to keep passengers safe, which includes intervening if someone is making your flight uncomfortable."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Nissan descubre 'actos de mala conducta' de su presidente Carlos Ghosn", "description": "Nissan dijo el lunes que hab\u00eda descubierto \"importantes actos de mala conducta\" de su presidente Carlos Ghosn.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/19/nissan-descubre-actos-de-mala-conducta-de-su-presidente-carlos-ghosn/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/cnn-nissan.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:22:50Z", "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) - Nissan dijo el lunes que hab\u00eda descubierto \"importantes actos de mala conducta\" de su presidente Carlos Ghosn. \"Nissan ha proporcionado informaci\u00f3n a la Oficina del Ministerio P\u00fablico de Jap\u00f3n y ha cooperado plenamente con su invest\u2026 [+101 chars]", "fulltext": "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHong Kong (CNN Business) - Nissan se prepara para destituir a su presidente, Carlos Ghosn, tras anunciar el descubrimiento de \"significativos actos de conducta indebida\" cometidos durante muchos a\u00f1os por \u00e9l y otro alto ejecutivo.\n\n\"Nissan ha proporcionado informaci\u00f3n a la Oficina del Ministerio P\u00fablico de Jap\u00f3n y ha cooperado plenamente con su investigaci\u00f3n\", dijo la automotriz japonesa en un comunicado. \"Seguiremos haci\u00e9ndolo\".\n\nDijo que una investigaci\u00f3n hall\u00f3 que Ghosn y otro integrante de la junta de la empresa no hab\u00edan informado correctamente los pagos al primero.\n\n\"Se han descubierto muchos otros actos significativos de conducta indebida, como el uso personal de activos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda\", a\u00f1adi\u00f3 Nissan.\n\nEl presidente ejecutivo de la empresa, Hiroto Saikawa, propondr\u00e1 a la mesa de directores \"destituir inmediatamente a Ghosn de sus puestos de presidente y director representante\", dijo la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nLas acciones de la automotriz francesa Renault, de la que Ghosn es presidente ejecutivo, se desplomaron un 13% en Par\u00eds.

The three companies employ more than 470,000 people in nearly 200 countries.\n\nNissan said in a statement that it had been investigating Ghosn, a 40-year veteran of the auto industry, and another board member for monthsfollowing a whistleblower report.\n\n\"These two gentlemen were arrested this evening, that is what I understand,\" Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said at a press conference in Tokyo late on Monday.\n\nJapanese prosecutors confirmed the arrests of Ghosn, 64 and the other board member, Greg Kelly, on suspicion of violating financial laws by filing false statements. According to the prosecutors' statement, the two men allegedly collaborated to under-report Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) over a five-year period ending in March 2015.\n\nCNN wasn't immediately able to reach Ghosn, Kelly or their representatives for comment.\n\nCarlos Ghosn at a Renault factory in France earlier this month. He oversees an alliance between the French automaker and Japan's Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.\n\nThe maximum punishment in Japan for filing a false financial statement is up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 10 million yen ($89,000).\n\nNissan said its internal investigation also found \"numerous other significant acts of misconduct ... such as personal use of company assets.\"\n\nAs a result, CEO Saikawa will propose to Nissan's board of directors to \"promptly remove Ghosn from his positions as chairman and representative director,\" at a meeting on Thursday, the company said. He will also try to have Kelly removed from the board.\n\nRenault and Nissan shares plunge\n\nShares in Renault, where Ghosn is chairman and CEO, closed down more than 8% in Paris. Renault said its board would convene \"very shortly\" to discuss Nissan's revelations.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the government, which owns 15% of Renault, was watching closely.\n\n\"The state, as a [Renault] shareholder, will be extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance and the group,\" Macron said during a visit to Belgium.\n\nNissan's announcement came after the close of trading in its stock in Tokyo on Monday. Its shares were down around 5% on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Nissan deeply apologizes for causing great concern to our shareholders and stakeholders,\" the company's statement said. \"We will continue our work to identify our governance and compliance issues, and to take appropriate measures.\"\n\nGhosn is also chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. The Japanese company said it was proposing that its board \"promptly\" remove Ghosn from that position. Its shares fell about 7% in Tokyo on Tuesday morning.\n\nUnder Ghosn, the three carmakers formed an alliance that rivals Volkswagen ( VKLAF ) and Toyota ( TM ) in terms of vehicle sales. The alliance sold 10.6 million vehicles last year.\n\nNissan said last year that it paid Ghosn a salary of 1.1 billion yen ($9.7 million) in the year ended March 2017, his last as CEO. Nissan doesn't break out individual board members' compensation in its annual report.\n\nA career spanning continents\n\nBorn in Brazil, Ghosn started his career at French tire maker Michelin in 1978, working his way up to running the company's North American operations.\n\nHe moved to Renault in 1996. After the French carmaker established its alliance with Nissan in 1999, he became the Japanese firm's chief operating officer, helping steer it out of financial crisis.\n\nThe turnaround earned him the nickname \"Le cost killer.\"\n\nGhosn was promoted to CEO of Nissan in 2001, and then made the unusual move of taking on the role of Renault CEO in 2005. That made him the first executive to run two Fortune Global 500 companies at the same time.\n\nAfter Nissan took a 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motors in 2016, Ghosn handed off the Nissan CEO role to Saikawa."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Serenitie Wang, CNN", "title": "Chinese writer sentenced to 10 years in prison for homoerotic book", "description": "A Chinese novelist has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for writing and distributing homoerotic novels, provoking widespread debate online over the severity of her sentence.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/china/chinese-erotic-fiction-writer-prison-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119092645-chinese-supreme-peoples-court-beijing-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:04:35Z", "content": "Beijing (CNN) A Chinese novelist has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for writing and distributing homoerotic novels, provoking widespread debate online over the severity of her sentence.

However, the harsh punishment given to Liu has caused outrage among social media users, many of whom have expressed anger at the apparent discrepancy between her sentence and those given to violent criminals, pointing out that under Chinese criminal law, rapists are liable to receive between three to 10 years.\n\nAs of Monday, there were more than 1.7 million posts using the hashtag #Tianyi on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, with the majority of users coming to Liu's defense.\n\n\"The author deserves sympathy,\" posted Li Yinhe, a renowned Chinese sexologist and sociologist, who has more than two million followers on Weibo. \"She did violate criminal law, but even a one-year sentence is too much, not to mention 10 years.\"\n\nMany users questioned the country's conservative attitude and asked why the government felt the need to police people's private lives.\n\n\"This sentence, even for me, who hasn't read any of her works, feels not fair. The attitude of this country toward sex can be only described as 'immature.' (We) ask for commutation!\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Deng Xueping, a lawyer at China's Capital Equity Legal Group, said that the sentence was based on an outdated judicial interpretation of the country's laws dating from 1998.\n\n\"When the number of copies exceeds 5,000, the case is deemed as a severe one. So the 10-year imprisonment is based on that,\" said Deng.\n\n\"But things have changed a lot in society ... especially that the internet helps things spread faster than ever ... That's why I think it's worth discussing if the sentence for the case is too heavy. The supreme court might need to reconsider the related judicial interpretation,\" he added. \"The punishments of the criminal law should be in proportion to the social impact of the crimes.\"\n\nOthers attributed the judgment to latent prejudice. \"If judges think content related to homosexuality and indecency has a baneful impact on the society, they might choose a heavy sentence within the legal range,\" Lu Xiaoquan, a Beijing-based lawyer, was quoted by the Global Times.\n\nHomosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, and was removed from the official list of mental illnesses a few years later.

The two sides split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the Chinese mainland after a bloody civil war.\n\nThe Golden Horse awards, often called Taiwan's Academy Awards, was founded by the island's authorities in 1962. In recent years, however, it has evolved into a major platform for Chinese-language filmmakers around the world to showcase their work, attracting stars from Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and elsewhere -- despite periodic political and military tensions between Taipei and Beijing.\n\nThe war of words this year escalated after the award ceremony, with Fu's social media pages inundated with vitriolic comments. Numerous Chinese celebrities, including disgraced megastar Fan Bingbing , joined millions of internet users on the mainland to retweet a Chinese map that includes Taiwan with a superimposed national flag.\n\nEven Taiwan's leader waded into the debate, with President Tsai Ing-wen calling the Golden Horse moment a highlight of the island's freedoms and diversity that nurture artistic creativity.\n\n\"We have never accepted and will never accept the 'Taiwan, China' label -- Taiwan is Taiwan,\" she wrote Sunday to her more than two million followers on Facebook. \"I'm proud of the Golden Horse ceremony yesterday because it accentuated how Taiwan is different from China.\"\n\n\"Nobody will disappear or be censored because of different remarks and we don't have sensitive keywords blocked on the internet,\" she added, taking a swipe at the Beijing government's notoriously stifling restrictions on freedom of speech.\n\nIn their Golden Horse coverage, Chinese media outlets quickly scrubbed clean any references to Fu and her winning documentary \"Our Youth in Taiwan,\" a film about a 2014 student protest movement on the island.\n\nBeijing's official response so far has been relatively subdued, however -- with even Fu's seldom-used account on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, still intact.\n\nAnalysts say the Chinese authorities are mindful of their actions' impact on Taiwan's hotly contested local elections this coming Saturday, where Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing an uphill battle amid a sluggish economy and rising tensions with Beijing.\n\n\"The DPP and media in its camp are seizing this incident as their last gambit -- hyping up the issue of cross-strait relations to boost the DPP's electoral chances,\" said Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China's nationalistic tabloid Global Times, in a video posted on Weibo. \"The Chinese public should be on alert about this.\"\n\nFollowing Tsai's rise to power in Taiwan in 2016, relations between Taipei and Beijing have quickly deteriorated. The Chinese Communist leadership has hardened its stance because of concerns over strong pro-independence sentiment within Taiwan's ruling party.\n\nThe Chinese People's Liberation Army has increased drills around the island while Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington over increasingly close political and military ties with Taipei under US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Beijing government has also worked to poach Taiwan's remaining small number of formal diplomatic allies and squeeze Taipei out of any international gatherings, in addition to ramping up pressure on global companies to drop references to Taiwan as an independent entity.\n\nDespite the vicious attacks she received for her pro-independence speech, Fu has expressed no regrets and brushed aside criticisms that she should have avoided talking politics in a rare platform for cross-strait cultural exchanges.\n\n\"I didn't make my remarks 'on an impulse,' or 'instigated by the DPP government' as suggested by some Chinese netizens,\" she wrote on her Facebook page Sunday. \"I said what I had always wanted to say about the film.\"\n\n\"My film is about politics,\" she added. \"As director, I have to speak for my work.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Katy Scott, CNN", "title": "South African diver exposes the secret lives of sea creatures", "description": "The Atlantic Ocean off the southern-most tip of Africa is so cold it feels like your skin is burning.

But still Craig Foster slips into the frigid water every day, without a wetsuit or scuba gear, off to explore an underwater kingdom.\n\nSome might call him reckless -- in the past, Foster, a filmmaker, has dived with Nile crocodiles in Botswana's Okavango Delta and swum with great white sharks. But for the past eight years, he has turned his attention to a vast underwater kelp forest off the west coast of South Africa where he spends his days tracking sea creatures.\n\nHe has now published a book, along with fellow diver Ross Frylinck, documenting his close encounters with these wild animals.\n\nThe book, \"Sea Change: Primal Joy and the art of underwater tracking,\" details how he touched a cat shark on its \"nose\" before it lay relaxed in his hands \"tame as a puppy.\" It describes how an enormous stingray wrapped its wings around him for a few frightening seconds, and how a Cape clawless otter reached out to touch his face.\n\nBut his most memorable encounter was with an octopus he befriended and accompanied on hunts.\n\nFoster said it took years of diving and learning how to completely relax around animals before they started engaging with him. Sea Change Project\n\nFoster's octopus even made a cameo on the BBC's \"Blue Planet II\" documentary last year, where it demonstrated an impressive camouflage technique in which it grabs shells and stones to build a temporary armored shell around itself to ward off small predators.\n\nThis is just one of dozens of never-seen-before behavioral traits that Foster has witnessed on his dives. He has discovered seven new species, including a shrimp that was named after him: Heteromysis Fosteri.\n\nDangers in the deep\n\nUnsurprisingly, Foster doesn't fear the bigger beasts that patrol the sea forest.\n\n\"Certainly (it is scary) if you're not expecting it and a big white shark is there in front of you and the water is murky,\" he told CNN. \"But to be honest there's very little to fear from the animals, they are not the danger.\"\n\nOver the years Foster has taken thousands of intimate photos of wildlife, including this extreme close up of a pyjama catshark's eye. Sea Change Project\n\nYet Foster has put his life on the line in the ocean.\n\n\"I've come very close to death a number of times, but never close to death from a shark,\" he said. \"It's always being thrown by a huge wave onto a rock, being cut into pieces, or jammed in a cave underwater.\"\n\nHe is more mindful of the multiple threats facing the kelp forest: plastic and chemical pollution, over fishing, poaching, ocean mining and climate change.\n\nThrough his work Foster hopes to raise awareness of what he calls the \"great African sea forest\" \u2014 which spans from Cape Town up the coast to Namibia.\n\nThis particular kelp forest extends for 1,000 kilometers and is just 100 meters wide. It is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, providing food, shelter and the ideal habitat for various species including endangered sea snails called abalone, the Cape fur seal and a variety of shark species.\n\nFoster believes that if he can get others to think of this sea forest as one of the natural wonders of the world, much like the Great Barrier Reef , they will be inspired to conserve it.\n\nProtecting underwater worlds\n\nThe book details how this blue dragon eats the venomous \"Portuguese man o' war\" and stores their stinging cells in its own body to repel predators. Sea Change Project\n\nBut Foster also stressed the need for marine protected areas to further conserve South Africa's waters.\n\nLast month, South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs approved the declaration of 20 marine protected areas, collectively covering 50,000 square kilometers. This means 5% of the country's oceans are now protected, compared to 0.4% previously.\n\n\"We are now working to try get to 10%,\" said Foster. \"I think marine protected areas are absolutely critical, we should ideally be at 50%.\"\n\nHe adds that it should be in everyone's interest to \"honor our pact with the wild.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "m.nadi",

Robusta's high caffeine content makes it well suited for instant coffee, but also gives it a bitter taste locals complain about.\n\nIn contrast, the Arabusta bean is grown in the mountainous region of Man, combining the strength of Robusta with floral flavors.\n\nArabusta was first grown in the 1960s at the request of Ivory Coast's first President, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who wanted something sweeter and milder than Robusta, earning it the nickname 'The Presidential Coffee'.\n\nHowever, there are reasons why, decades later, only a few farmers are growing the regal bean.\n\nFirstly, the plant grows slowly -- a newly planted tree will not produce beans for up to two years.\n\nArabusta farmers argue that long lifespan of the plant makes up for this, providing a source of income that spans generations.\n\n\"This farm run by my grandfather and father helped put me through school and it's transformed our daily lives,\" said local farmer Aime Tia Sadie.\n\nHe notes that Arabusta coffee sells in supermarkets for three or four times the price of Robusta coffee. But this is due to the time-consuming nature of processing the beans, which are crushed and dried by hand with old-fashioned methods.\n\n'Gold in your backyard'\n\nThat's where agricultural entrepreneurs like Andre Braud-Mensah come in. He is working to mechanize the process of growing Arabusta in the Ivory Coast.\n\nBraud-Mensah has built a high tech roasting plant in his backyard, 50 kilometers from the country's economic capital, Abidjan.\n\n\"Everything is digital and computerized, it's the highest technology. Its Japanese technology,\" he explains.\n\nAt the plant, Braud-Mensah focuses on roasting the Arabusta beans in very small quantities and in a highly controlled environment. He has also been experimenting with different recipes -- ones that include notes of pepper and ginger.\n\n\"People say 'I don't like coffee' but in fact they do like it. You just have to roast it in the right way,\" said Braud-Mensah.\n\nOne of the final challenges for both Robusta and Arabusta producers is broadening the market for Ivorian coffee at home.\n\n\"We're here to promote Ivorian coffee and make the Ivorian people understand the quality of their coffee,\" said Mohammad Fraoua, the manager of one of the newest arrivals to the Abidjan coffee scene, Caf\u00e9s Bondin,\n\nWith the motto \"an African coffee roasted by Africans and for Africans,\" Caf\u00e9s Bondin sources beans from across the African continent to serve its customers.\n\n\"Africa is the birthplace of coffee,\" Fraoua explained. \"Unfortunately, all the African countries export their 'green' coffee beans, which are roasted in other countries and mixed in with other coffees from other countries. In Africa we really don't know the value of our coffee.\"\n\nCreating a taste for Ivorian coffee isn't an easy task. For Ivory Coast's burgeoning community of coffee aficionados - 'the presidential bean' is just the way to do it.\n\n\"It's like keeping some gold in your backyard and nobody knows you have something exceptional,\" says Andre Braud-Mensah."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Naomi Thomas, CNN", "title": "One-third of US parents plan to skip flu shots for their kids this season", "description": "During the last US flu season, 179 children died, with hundreds hospitalized due to flu-related illnesses; 80% of the children who died were unvaccinated.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/health/flu-vaccine-children-study/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130110105255-child-sick-flu-temperature-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:00:36Z", "content": "(CNN) Thirty-four percent of US parents said their child was unlikely to get the flu vaccine this year, according to a report published Monday by C.S.

William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command, and attacked the military for not having killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before 2011.\n\nHe also dismissed a Washington Post report that the CIA believes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of the paper's journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a possible fresh example of the President ignoring his intelligence agencies when it conflicts with his political goals.\n\nAnd Trump revived alarmist talk over a caravan of asylum seekers marching across Mexico toward the southern border, on which he anchored a midterm campaign that was laced with falsehoods and racism.\n\n\"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months'\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nFor any other president, these attacks and comments would represent an extraordinary breach of White House norms.\n\nFor Trump, they reflect his own combative temperament and willingness to flout conventions and political correctness that he clearly believes are key to his strong bond with his most loyal supporters.\n\nHis jab at Schiff was also a reminder of how the Russia investigation, now thought to be in a critical stage, hovers over everything else that happens in Trump's presidency.\n\nTrump said he will submit written answers to questions posed by Mueller about alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia this week.\n\nNo changing course\n\nThe President's determination to follow his instincts and reluctance to moderate his confrontational approach suggests that there has been little self reflection about the Democratic capture of the House that was fueled on a rejection of Trump by suburban voters.\n\nIt may also indicate that the President will win or lose in his re-election race in 2020 by betting on his strategy of mobilizing an angry political base to win the electoral college, as he did in 2016. Such an approach helped him win Senate seats -- albeit on a favorable electoral map for the GOP -- this year.\n\nBut exit polls showed that 38% of people who cast a vote in House races did so to oppose Trump, compared to 26% who did so to support him.\n\nOne possible remedy would be for Trump to moderate the polarizing behavior that damaged him with women voters and independents in urban areas, to try to win them back to the fold in 2020.\n\nThere have been rare moments of bipartisanship from Trump in recent days. Democrats and Republicans gathered at the White House to celebrate a bill that represents a small step towards criminal justice reform.\n\nTrump tweeted tributes to two foes he had furiously criticized during the midterms -- Democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Andrew Gillum of Florida after they formally conceded defeat.\n\nCongratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia.

He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2018\n\nMany Republicans remain mystified why Trump does not play his best card more often by building his political message around the strong economy. His failure to do so in the midterms may have cost him House seats.\n\n\"I recognize it's boring to go out every single day and remind everybody that unemployment is below 4%,\" said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, on CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday.\n\n\"But I think embracing the boring here and doing what he hates, which is to stick with the script, rather than create original programing every day is the right answer.\"\n\nThere are clear signs, however, that Trump is planning to become even less constrained by norms, as evident in his talk of changing his Cabinet.\n\nBy appointing Whitaker, a Mueller critic, in place of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the President has already removed an impediment to his desire to control the Justice Department.\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday\" he said he wants more aggressive enforcement of his hardline immigration policies.\n\nReferring to reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on the way out, Trump said: \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\"\n\nOne senior administration official characterized the President's goals in reshaping his team for CNN's Jake Tapper last week.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" the official said.\n\nRetrenchment still\n\nThe weekend's developments with McRaven and in the Khashoggi case were revealing of the President's approach.\n\nMcRaven was prominent during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and so he was a characteristic target for the President.\n\n\"OK, he's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama-backer, and frankly ... wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?\" Trump told Chris Wallace of Fox News.\n\nMcRaven responded by telling CNN that he did not \"back Hillary Clinton or anyone else\" and said he admired Obama and Bush for leadership in challenging times.\n\n\"I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime,\" McRaven said.\n\nThe Washington Post report about the CIA's conclusions on Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul complicated Trump's efforts to safeguard his close relationship with the Saudi crown prince and will fuel a building confrontation with those in Congress who want serious action against Riyadh.\n\nThe President and the State Department said that no final determination has been made about who ordered Khashoggi's death."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Banu Ibrahim", "title": "These are the best Black Friday flash deals on Amazon to shop right now", "description": "Amazon's lightning deals are some of the best discounts this Black Friday.

I don't think he will give an honest assessment of why he did what he did, how he did what he did,\" Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said after Watts was sentenced Monday to five life sentences -- three consecutive and two concurrent -- with no possibility of parole.\n\nBefore learning that he would never walk out of prison, Watts sat at the defense table, head down and leg bobbing, as his mother told him she loved him and his slain wife's family called him a monster.\n\nJudge Marcelo Kopcow called the murders in a north Denver suburb \"the most inhumane and vicious crime that I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen.\"\n\nWatts also received an additional 48 years for the unlawful termination of his wife's pregnancy and 36 more years for crimes related to his disposal of the bodies.\n\nThe couple's first son would have been named Nico Lee, according to his wife's father.\n\nJUST WATCHED Daughter called her dad 'hero' before her death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Daughter called her dad 'hero' before her death 00:34\n\nThe 33-year-old Watts pleaded guilty this month to first-degree murder and other charges in the killings of his wife, Shanann, 34, and their daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, before crudely disposing of them at a secluded site where he worked. With approval of his wife's family, prosecutors dropped the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nIn court, Shanann Watts' mother, Sandy Rzucek, explained, \"I didn't want death for you because that's not my right. Your life is between you and God, and I pray he has mercy for you.\"\n\nWatts' hands were shackled at his waist and he wore an orange jumpsuit. He rarely looked up during the proceeding -- not even when his mother turned around to face him and tearfully said, \"We have loved you from the beginning and we still love you now. ... We forgive you, son.\"\n\nTwo families devastated\n\nWatts' parents, who had previously defended their son and questioned his plea deal during an interview with CNN affiliate KMGH , recanted those remarks and told the court in a prepared statement that the family would not ask for leniency.\n\n\"This should never have happened. This is not condonable. This is something that we will never get over,\" a family representative said, reading a statement as the parents looked on.\n\nFrank Rzucek Sr., Shanann Watts' father, questioned how Chris Watts could have killed people he was charged with protecting before disposing of them like bags of rubbish.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cops: Bodies of pregnant mom and daughters found Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cops: Bodies of pregnant mom and daughters found 01:19\n\n\"I trusted you to take care of them, not kill them,\" he said. \"You have to live with this vision every day of your life, and I hope you see that every day of your life.\"\n\nWhile he said he hoped that God had mercy on Chris Watts, he prayed the judge took the opposite tack, he said.\n\nFrank Rzucek Jr., Shanann Watts' brother, had Rourke read his statement, in which he said he can't sleep and is anguished to know Chris Watts robbed him of the privilege of being an uncle. Rzucek Jr. wrote his statement from a motel room where his parents have cried themselves to sleep, the prosecutor said.\n\n\"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't cry for my family,\" Rourke said, reading Frank Jr.'s statement. \"You don't deserve to be called a man. What kind of person slaughters the people they love the most?\"\n\nGruesome disposal of bodies\n\nBefore Watts was sentenced, Rourke revealed horrific details of how Watts strangled his wife and smothered their daughters.\n\nWatts strangled his wife with his bare hands, not in an uncontrolled rage as he had claimed, but deliberately and viciously for at least 2 minutes. He then suffocated Bella and Celeste. While Bella fought back, Celeste had no external injuries, the prosecutor said.\n\nHe then backed his vehicle in to the driveway, loaded up the bodies in three trips and drove them to a work site, a place he suspected they'd never be found. He buried his wife in a shallow grave before stuffing his daughters into tanks, Rourke said.\n\n\"Imagine this: This defendant took those little girls, put them through a hatch 8 inches in diameter,\" the prosecutor said. \"Bella had scratches on her left buttocks from being shoved through the hole.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows Shanann Watts talk about husband Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows Shanann Watts talk about husband 00:56\n\nWhen his coworkers arrived at the site later that morning, Rourke said, they described his behavior as perfectly normal. Millions across the country were riveted and local law enforcement searched for the woman and girls, while Watts was texting his new girlfriend about their future, he said.\n\nHis sentencing came days after a woman he had been dating told The Denver Post that he lied to her about being near the end of divorce proceedings. She cooperated with police before his arrest, she told the newspaper.\n\n\"You don't annihilate your family and throw them away like garbage,\" Rourke told the court. \"Why did they have to lose their lives in order for him to get what he wanted?\"\n\nAn attorney for Chris Watts told Judge Kopcow her client is \"devastated,\" and though Watts realizes his words are hollow, he is \"sincerely sorry for all of this.\"\n\nThe only time Watts spoke during the proceeding was when Kopcow asked him if he wished to deliver a statement. \"No, sir,\" the former father replied.\n\nToxicology results showed that Shanann had a blood-alcohol content of .128, which is consistent with decomposition, Rourke said. It does not mean she consumed alcohol or was drunk, he said.\n\nSeveral substances found in the young girls' bodies can be attributed to the crude oil and water in which they were submerged, Rourke said.\n\nLate wife noticed suspicious behavior, prosecutor said\n\nRourke told reporters that Watts had visited museums, bars and restaurants with his new love interest. Other evidence of that relationship included photographs of the pair at the Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve in southern Colorado while Watts' wife was in North Carolina, Rourke said.\n\nWatts had also researched secluded vacation spots in Aspen where he had planned to take the new girlfriend, Rourke said, referring to Watts' Internet searches while his wife and daughters were away.\n\n\"For whatever reason, in his mind divorce wasn't an option,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\"He was doing all that kind of research that you would think that somebody in a brand new relationship would be doing, but he was still married with two daughters and a son on the way,\" Rourke said.\n\nShanann Watts noticed her husband's suspicious behavior, Rourke said.\n\n\"We knew that she was getting alerts on her phone of credit cards being used at a restaurant in north Denver at a time that she was in North Carolina for amounts of money that one person couldn't possibly probably consume reasonably,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\"We know that she confronted him about that numerous times,\" Rourke said. \"We knew that he was never completely forthcoming with her.\"\n\nA plea from the front porch\n\nWhen Shanann Watts and the two girls went missing in mid-August, Chris Watts first told reporters they had gone to a friend's house before later pleading for his family's return in an interview with CNN affiliate KMGH\n\n\"My kids are my life,\" Watts said, standing on the front porch of their home in Frederick, about 30 miles north of Denver. \"Those smiles light up my life.\"\n\nWatts told the station his wife came home from the airport about 2 a.m., and he left for work about 5:15 a.m. He said the two had an emotional but civil conversation before he left, but he didn't elaborate.\n\nJUST WATCHED See husband plea for wife's return Replay More Videos ...

They had not argued, but they were both upset and crying, he told police, according to an affidavit.\n\nChris Watts claimed he had called and texted his wife about three times that morning with no reply, he told KMGH. He said he realized something was wrong when Shanann Watts' friend arrived at the couple's home around noon.\n\n\"She just got back from Arizona, and I figured she was just busy, but when her friend showed up, that's when it just registered -- like all right, this isn't right,\" Watts said.\n\nStory didn't add up\n\nThree days later, the body of Shanann Watts,15 weeks pregnant, was found in a shallow grave. The bodies of Bella and Celeste were found in commercial oil tanks at a company where Watts had worked.\n\nChris Watts' mugshot\n\nRourke said Watts became a suspect \"very, very early on.\"\n\n\"Many of the things that he was saying just weren't quite adding up,\" Rourke said Monday.\n\nOne key piece of evidence was sheets from the bed in the Watts' master bedroom that were found at the crime scene, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter authorities found the bodies, Chris Watts changed his story, telling police he had strangled Shanann Watts in a fit of rage after seeing his wife choking Celeste.\n\nOn November 6, Watts pleaded guilty to nine charges, including three counts of first-degree murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy.\n\nOther woman tells her side of story\n\nAccording to an unsealed Weld County arrest affidavit , investigators say they discovered Watts was \"actively involved\" in an affair with a co-worker.\n\nIt's not clear if that was Nichol Kessinger, 30, who told The Denver Post she met him while working for the environmental department of a petroleum contractor.\n\n\"We had just met,\" Kessinger told the newspaper. \"I barely knew him.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Man pleads guilty to killing wife, kids Replay More Videos ...

When they first met outside of work in late June, he told her he was in the final stages of a divorce. She never met any of his relatives or friends, Kessinger told The Post.\n\nWatts sent her a text August 13 to say his family had disappeared, and she was confused about why the media was at his house.\n\n\"When I read the news, I found out he was still married and his wife was 15 weeks pregnant,\" Kessinger told the newspaper.\n\nShe peppered him with questions via phone calls and text, she said, and he changed his story about the divorce, showed little emotion about his family's disappearance, and tried to change the subject.\n\n\"It got to a point that he was telling me so many lies that I eventually told him that I did not want to speak to him again until his family was found,\" she told the paper, explaining that she called police on August 15 to report Watts' lies.\n\nRourke said she \"was absolutely instrumental\" in the investigation."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Stelter, CNN Business", "title": "A liberal blogger, a conservative reader, a Facebook algorithm, and 'unreality'", "description": "Media reporters used to spend a lot time writing about TV anchor shakeups, newsroom shenanigans and ratings races.

There's a part of me that misses those days.\n\nToday the beat is about political propaganda, viral misinformation, threats against newsrooms and failing business models. It's about shiny tech tools enabling the worst of humanity and echo chambers eroding our common understanding of the world around us. It's about the information war that's raging on our screens.\n\nHang with me while I walk you through this weekend's examples... Beginning with one of the best stories I've read all year...\n\n\"The more extreme we become, the more people believe it\"\n\nChristopher Blair is a liberal blogger who writes fake stories. He says he's trying to trick conservative readers. And he says he's making a lot of money doing it. \"How could any thinking person believe this nonsense?\" he wonders before hitting send.\n\nShirley Chapian is one of the Facebook users who reads Blair's lies and believes some of it. Believes enough of it to click \"like\" and \"share.\" Eli Saslow's story for the Washington Post is about both of them -- and it's about what is wrong with the internet in 2018. After you read the story, I'd love to know what you thought of it...\n\nHere are a few takeaways from the story, starting with my own...\n\n\u2192 For years, Chapian \"had watched network TV news,\" but then she went deep down a far-right-wing hole, with Alex Jones, etc. So she traded (imperfect!) journalism for really manipulative entertainment that sometimes poses as journalism. This can do a lot of damage...\n\n\u2192 BF's Charlie Warzel: \"The story shows that the viral, platform-based assault on truth is really a story about addiction, too. Like any drug, there are the people who peddle it (who can stand to make a lot of money somewhat easily) and the people who become dependent on the product (in this case outrage)...\"\n\n\u2192 WaPo's Tony Romm: Read Saslow's story \"to understand how and why so many Americans, especially older ones, are falling victim to falsehoods online. It's not Russian trolls. It's poverty. It's loneliness and isolation. It's poor digital literacy skills...\"\n\n\u2192 I'd like to second this comment from Ann Marie Lipinski: \"The gullible are not the only problem. Guys claiming 'satire' while getting rich off the ads need to own their role in this debacle...\"\n\nMisinfo is a chronic condition\n\nThere is no quick or easy fix for these fundamental problems. We have to think about misinformation as a \"chronic condition,\" researcher Renee DiResta told me the other day . Misinfo has always existed, but now \"we have an information ecosystem that really facilitates the amplification of that content, that facilitates it going viral,\" she said. It can't be \"fixed,\" but it can be managed...\n\nInside Facebook...\n\nWill this week be any better than last week for FB? A few key stories to read...\n\n-- The WSJ's Deepa Seetharaman has a new story describing Mark Zuckerberg on a \"war\" footing... And detailing \"tensions\" and \"strains\" between Z and Sheryl Sandberg...\n\n-- Jim Rutenberg's Monday NYT column says \"The Social Network\" movie told us everything we needed to know about FB, eight years ago...\n\nLeaks about leaking\n\nThis is never a good sign. In a Q&A with employees on Friday, in the wake of that damaging NYT story, Zuckerberg \"made it clear that Facebook would not hesitate to fire employees who spoke to The New York Times or other publications,\" according to... yes... leaks to the NYT . Zuckerberg also accurately acknowledged that leaks are usually caused by \"issues with morale...\"\n\nBrian Wieser's latest\n\nWell respected Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser's Sunday night note: \"Advertiser concerns about morality at Facebook are real. Post-last week's New York Times articles on the company, we don't see immediate financial impact, but other risks to the business are elevated on many fronts. We maintain our Sell rating and $125 price target.\"\n\nUnderstanding the links\n\nDonie O'Sullivan emails: New emails New emails obtained by CNN this weekend show Steve Bannon's early correspondences with \"Leave.EU,\" one of the pro-Brexit campaigns. The emails raise new questions about the extent of Bannon and Cambridge Analytica's involvement in Brexit. An investigation has been launched into Leave.EU, and its main donor has faced questions about whether any funding came from Moscow...\n\n\u2192 Big picture: British journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who led the way on the Cambridge Analytica story, has launched a new podcast called \"Dial M For Mueller.\" She is arguing that the UK needs its own Mueller probe... She summed up her case in this NYRB piece...\n\nMaking sense of nonsense\n\nReturning to the \"unreality\" theme for a moment... I made this point on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources...\" Fact-checkers are fantastic, but sometimes President Trump seems to be beyond fact-checking. A few days ago he talked about showing a voter I.D. to buy cereal. Over the weekend, while visiting fire devastation in CA, he talked about raking the forests. It is hard to make sense of this nonsense...\n\n\"How dark is your mood?\"\n\nThat was one of Chris Wallace's questions to POTUS in the interview that aired Sunday. Wallace cited the numerous news reports about Trump's anger and isolation.\n\nSo \"how dark is your mood?\" Wallace asked.\n\n\"It's very light, it's fake news, it's disgusting fake news,\" Trump said. \"I read a front page story in the Washington Post, they never even called me, nobody ever calls me.\" Then he claimed the sources were made up. When I hear Trump complaining about reporters not calling him... A comment he made re: the NYT's story about Mike Pence, too... It makes me wonder how much info his press shop is withholding from him...\n\n\u2192 Also note Wallace's quote about Fox being in \"solidarity\" with CNN and other outlets... While this doesn't seem to apply to Fox's pundits, it's still meaningful...\n\nToday's \"potty humor tweet\" from the president\n\nHow did news outlets handle Trump's tweet about \"little Adam Schitt?\" Well, the CNN.com homepage headline says \"Trump attacks leading House Democrat in profane tweet.\" WaPo's headline calls it a \"derisive nickname.\" USA Today labels it a \"vulgarity,\" and Bloomberg says it's a \"potty humor tweet.\"\n\nDecorus, it is not...\n\nMany reporters immediately pointed out that Trump has been calling for White House \"decorum\" while posting crude tweets and saying terrible things. (Don't even get me started on his factually inaccurate criticism of Ret. Admiral William McRaven.)"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "What a shot! 33 amazing sports photos", "description": "Take a look at 33 amazing sports photos from November 11 to November 18.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/19/sport/gallery/what-a-shot-sports-1118/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181118225400-05-what-a-shot-1118-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T05:28:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Photos: What a shot! 33 amazing sports photos Zion Williamson of the Duke Blue Devils dunks against the Eastern Michigan Eagles during the first half of their game at Cameron Indoor Stadium on November 14 in Durham, North Carolina.

Bennett had threatened to withdraw the coalition, forcing its collapse, if he were not given the position. On Sunday night, Netanyahu announced he would hold the defense ministry for himself, forcing Bennett to withdraw or give up on his demand.\n\nIsraeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett (L) speaks as he and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (R) give a statement at the Knesset in Jerusalem on November 19, 2018.\n\nAcknowledging political defeat, Bennett said, \"It's better that Netanyahu beats me in a political fight than that [Hamas leader Ismail] Haniyeh beats the State of Israel.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Netanyahu called it \"irresponsible\" to topple the government at this \"sensitive security time.\" Attending the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee for the first time as Defense Minister, Netanyahu said, \"Whether our partners decide to topple the government or not, we will continue to take action to ensure the security of our state and of our people. We will do so sensibly, responsibly and with determination.\"\n\nLast week, Netanyahu's right-wing coalition faced its most serious challenge since coming to power nearly four years ago after a key minister resigned and others called for a new government.\n\nThe crisis was sparked Wednesday by the resignation of Liberman, who opposed a ceasefire with Gaza militants that was struck on November 13, bringing an end to the most severe round of fighting between the two sides since the 2014 war.\n\nThe resignation of Liberman, the hardline leader of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, left the government with 61 seats -- a majority of only one seat -- in the 120-seat Knesset.\n\nControversial ceasefire struck\n\nThe crisis began after a barrage of some 400 rockets was launched from Gaza toward Israel on November 12, hours after a botched Israeli operation in Gaza left a Hamas commander and an Israeli soldier dead. The Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza.\n\nA renewed ceasefire was brokered by the Egyptians and the United Nations to end the hostilities. Liberman denounced the ceasefire as a \"capitulation to terror.\"\n\nHowever, Netanyahu once again defended the ceasefire on Sunday, saying it was done in consultation with Israel's security establishment, suggesting there might be future military action.\n\n\"I know what to do, when to do it, and we will do it,\" said Netanyahu. \"I hope that all of the partners will show responsibility and will not topple the government.\"\n\nNetanyahu has faced coalition crises in the past but none as serious as the one currently unfolding. He has repeatedly promised to see out the government's term to November 2019, but that pledge seems increasingly in doubt.\n\nIf the coalition parties agree by the end of the month to call early elections, they are required by law to hold the vote within three to five months, putting the earliest possible election window in late February or early March."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name":

Over recent weeks we have been profiling the four finalists for the 2018 award.\n\nArchitect Stefano Boeri has always been obsessed with trees. The Italian traces his fascination back to a novel he read as a child, \"Il Barone Rampante\" (\"The Baron in the Trees\"), in which a young boy climbs up into a world of trees and vows to never to return.\n\n\"I think trees are individuals,\" Boeri said in a phone interview. \"Each has its own evolution, its own biography, its own shape.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, there is child-like wonder to the architect's best-known building, Il Bosco Verticale, or the Vertical Forest. Built in his home city of Milan, the celebrated complex teems with greenery, its facades transformed into living, breathing organisms.\n\nGreenery is placed on balconies across the two buildings' facades.

They spill out from irregularly placed balconies and crawl up the structures' sides. By Boeri's estimates, there are two trees, eight shrubs, and 40 plants for each human inhabitant.\n\nThe purported benefits of this garden architecture transcend aesthetics. Greenery, supposedly, provides shade to apartments, psychological benefits to residents and a home to wildlife. (There are, Boeri said, \"hundreds of birds, more than 15 different species\" nesting on the towers' various floors.)\n\nBut the architect's proudest claim is that the buildings absorb 30 tons of carbon dioxide and produce 19 tons of oxygen a year, according to his research , with a volume of trees equivalent to more than 215,000 square feet of forestland.\n\nRIBA International Prize 2018: World's best new buildings revealed\n\n\"The ability to enlarge green surfaces inside and around our city is one of the most efficient ways to try to reverse climate change,\" he said. \"So, a vertical forest is one of the possible ways to ... enlarge biological surfaces, in the horizontal and the vertical. (The solution is) not only gardens. Why not also the side of the building?\"\n\nOther energy-efficient features, including geothermal heating systems and wastewater facilities, have attracted less attention. Nonetheless, they help the towers to not only resemble trees, but function like them too, the architect said.\n\n\"The buildings really work as trees, from the roots up,\" he explained. \"They have a trunk, and they distribute (water and energy) through the different branches.\"\n\nScalable urban model\n\nIn September, Vertical Forest was named among four finalists for the RIBA International Prize, a biennial award honoring the world's best new buildings. Amid the plaudits, Boeri claims the project's real success is that it serves as a prototype.\n\nThe architect has far more ambitious designs. His firm has already unveiled plans for new Vertical Forest buildings in European cities including Treviso in Italy, Lausanne in Switzerland and Utrecht in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the Chinese city of Liuzhou, Guangxi province, he has masterminded an entire \" Forest City ,\" scheduled for completion in 2020, which comprises tree-covered houses, hospitals, schools and office blocks over a sprawling 15-million-square-foot site. (Boeri said that he's also been approached about producing similar \"cities\" in Egypt and Mexico.)\n\nThe Vertical Forest in Milan was completed in 2014.

(Levels of humidity, wind and sunlight are the most challenging variables.) Before opening his Milan towers, Boeri spent two years observing the growth of different plants, and only used those that proved most resilient.\n\nHaving already carried out numerous studies (and proven the project's real estate worth), future ventures will invariably become more attractive to developers -- and cheaper to deliver. On this front, Boeri highlights an upcoming project in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. The 19-story, 125-unit tower will mark the first time the Vertical Forest concept is applied to social housing.\n\nVertical Forest is located in Boeri's home city of Milan.

And this is, for me, a very, very important step. We have reduced the cost of construction and used prefabrication for the facade without reducing the number of trees or plants.\n\n\"I want to demonstrate that it's possible to put together the two main issues for the future of our cities: climate change and poverty.\"\n\nA green 'manifesto'\n\nBoeri is, undoubtedly, an architect on a mission. A manifesto published on his firm's website commits to launching \"a global campaign on urban forestry\" that spans city farms, roof gardens, green facades and other forms of public greenery. He recently helped establish the first World Forum on Urban Forests, which is set to take place in Mantua, Italy, later this month.\n\nYet Boeri is neither dogmatic nor protective of his vision. \"I'm proud to say we didn't put any kind of copyright,\" he said, \"because we know well the social value of this kind of building.\"\n\nIt could easily be argued that designers and architects like Thomas Heatherwick and Ole Scheeren -- whose upcoming projects in Shanghai and Ho Chi Minh City , respectively, feature prominent urban forestry -- owe a debt of gratitude to Boeri's vision. But the Italian remains modest about his role in what is a burgeoning architectural movement.\n\nBoeri claims that the volume of trees on the two towers is equivalent to more than 215,000 square feet of forestland. Credit: Stefano Boeri\n\n\"There will be architects and urban planners who realize buildings, with the same philosophy, that will be better than what we've done,\" he said. \"It's already happening. I'm very happy to see that.\n\n\"As architects, we are used to dealing with natural materials,\" he added. \"But living nature is something very different. We normally think that living nature is only an ornamental part of our buildings. What we have done with the Vertical Forest ... is to demonstrate that it is possible to transform living nature into a basic component of architecture.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "CNN Library", "title": "2017 In Review Fast Facts", "description": "Read CNN's Fast Facts about 2017 to learn about domestic and international events that have taken place during the year.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/us/2017-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171103104805-cnnee-rosario-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T02:20:01Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Here is a look back at the events of 2017.\n\nAccording to authorities, Esteban Santiago opens fire in the baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport , in Florida, killing five people and wounding six others.

Davis saw other kids dozing off.\n\nThe adults had to improvise. There was only one water bottle on the bus. McKay took off his shirt. They tore it up and doused the strips of cloth with water, so the students could use them to breathe properly, they recalled.\n\nThe bus was caught in the gridlock of hundreds of other vehicles trying to evacuate.\n\n\"That seemed to help,\" McKay said.\n\nDuring the journey, McKay and the teachers also created their own emergency plan: Pair little kids with the big kids. Take roll. Get phone numbers.

Zverev downs Djokovic in ATP Finals... Condi Rice NFL coaching rumors quashed... Opponents blame each other for darts match stink. This is your Monday sporting recap.\n\nGrudge settled\n\nHarry Kane of England is challenged by Tin Jedvaj of Croatia during their UEFA Nations League A group four match.\n\nLosing World Cup semifinalist England took some measure of revenge against Croatia with a 2-1 win against the team that dumped it out of this year's tournament in Russia, thanks to a 85th-minute Harry Kane goal. The win secures the Three Lions a place at the inaugural UEFA Nations League finals, a four-team mini-tournament to be held in Portugal this coming June.\n\nAn Andrej Kramaric strike just before the hour looked like leading to an ominous repeat of that fateful match at the Luzhniki Stadium last July, but a Jesse Lingard strike 12 minutes from time brought English heads up again before Kane capped the win, sending Croatia down to the second tier of the league next season.\n\nElsewhere in the weekend's action, Switzerland also secured a place at the Nations League finals with a 5-2 drubbing of Belgium and Scotland kept playoff hopes alive with a welcome 4-0 win away to Albania, while on Friday World Cup champion France lost to the Netherlands 2-0.\n\nThe draw for the Nations League Finals will be held on December 3.\n\nThey're human after all\n\nIreland's Jacob Stockdale scores the only try of the game against New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\n\nThe mighty All Blacks took on Ireland in Dublin Saturday as part of their European tour, and in a rare turn of events, walked off the field dazed after suffering a 16-9 loss against the home side.\n\nIt might've taken the world's second-ranked international side to break down the perennial champions New Zealand but in the run-up to next year's Rugby World Cup in Japan the Irish -- winning their first-ever match on home soil against the All Blacks -- showed that they have the potential to go the distance in the world's pre-eminent rugby competition.\n\nEven All Blacks coach Steve Hansen seemed to agree, saying that \"as of now (Ireland) are the number one team in the world. If you want to make them World Cup favorites, go ahead.\"\n\nAll Blacks' TJ Perenara in action.\n\nThe two sides exchanged penalties in an evenly matched first half, sending Ireland to the dressing room with a narrow 9-6 lead before Jacob Stockdale's phenomenal 48-minute chip-and-chase try set Irish eyes smiling. The Kiwis could only muster a further three points before the final whistle in a brutal slugfest that left everyone on the field -- and those watching -- drained.\n\nZverev puts brakes on Djokovic's stellar year\n\nAlexander Zverev reacts with joy after beating Novak Djokovic at the ATP Finals.\n\nIn men's tennis, 2018 has undoubtedly been the Year of Novak. But that didn't matter to Alexander Zverev, who stunned the World Number 1 , 6-4 6-3, at the ATP Finals in London.\n\nThe 6-ft-6, 21-year-old played out of his skin to become the youngest winner of the year-end championships since Djokovic himself in 2008, spoiling what had been a stellar year for the Serb, who had won 35 of his past 37 matches, including titles at Wimbledon and the US Open to lift his tally of majors to 14 in a remarkable comeback campaign.\n\nNovak Djokovic reacts in the final against Alexander Zverev.\n\nDespite Djokovic cruising to the final -- he hadn't even dropped serve en route to Sunday's match -- the young German had other plans after dumping out six-time winner Roger Federer earlier.\n\n\"Obviously it's quite astonishing, winning this title, beating two such players back-to-back, Roger and Novak, in the semifinals and finals,\" Zverev told reporters. \"Means so much.

In a Facebook post , she said that she was sure the team would \"hire an experienced coach,\" and called on the sport to consider more women \"as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches.\n\n\"I'm not ready to coach but I would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas!

Hangover stew (\ud574\uc7a5\uad6d)\n\nGiven South Korea's dedicated drinking culture, it's not surprising that its hangover-curing culture is equally as developed, from pre-drinking drinks to post-drinking drinks to a glorious array of spicy and steamy stews and soups.\n\nMade from a beef broth, with cabbage, bean sprouts, radish and chunks of congealed ox blood, the deeply satisfying taste does wonders to kick-start your sluggish brain in the morning.\n\n2. Kimchi (\uae40\uce58)\n\nDating to the Silla Dynasty (around 2,000 years ago), kimchi is the beloved spicy sidekick at every Korean table. It's made by salting and preserving fermented cabbage in a bed of pepper, garlic, ginger and scallion.\n\nFeeling adventurous? Exchange your regular red cabbage kimchi for ggakdugi (chopped radish kimchi), a popular side at gimbap restaurants. Yeolmumul kimchi is a less spicy kimchi made with young radish stalks floating in a tangy soup.\n\nFor a selection of handmade kimchi, try online kimchi sellers Real Kimchi\n\n3. Soft Tofu Stew (\uc21c\ub450\ubd80\ucc0c\uac1c)\n\nSoft tofu, clams and an egg in spicy broth? This popular stew is a classic example of unexpected flavor combinations yielding delightful sensations.\n\nThe soft tofu -- which breaks into fluffy chunks in the stew -- holds the flavor of the clam and serves as a relief from the overall spiciness.\n\nProper sundubu-jjigae comes in a traditional earthenware pot designed to retain heat. The egg is cracked into the stew after serving, and cooks inside the bowl.\n\n4. Samgyeopsal (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4)\n\nEvery samgyeopsal feast is a rollicking party. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nThe best part of eating in a samgyeopsal restaurant is the atmosphere -- a rollicking party punctuated by soju shots, pork strips sizzling on a grill and shouts for \"one more serving, please!\"\n\nServed with lettuce, perilla leaves, sliced onions and raw garlic kimchi, it's smudged in ssamjang (a mix of soybean paste called 'doenjang' and chili paste called 'gochujang') or salt and pepper in sesame oil.\n\nRelated content 7 super spicy South Korean dishes -- and tips for eating them\n\n5. Jjajangmyeon (\uc9dc\uc7a5\uba74)\n\nAlthough originally a Chinese dish, Koreans have taken the noodles and created a thicker, yummier version that holds only a vague resemblance to its Chinese predecessor. (Think of New Yorkers and the wonders they've done with pizza.)\n\nIt would not be an understatement to say Korean diets would not be the same without this dish -- most Koreans eat it at least once a week, and have their favorite jjajangmyeon delivery shop on speed dial.\n\n6. Chimaek (\uce58\ub9e5)\n\nChimaek, short for \"chicken, maekju (beer)\" is actually not a dish, but an institution. This glorious pairing features two surprisingly mundane foods: fried chicken and beer.\n\nNeither half, chicken nor beer, is particularly remarkable on its own. But their popularity as a joint entity demonstrates a glorious combination devoured by millions of Koreans every weekend.\n\n7. Instant noodles (\ub77c\uba74)\n\nAnyone can follow the directions on the back of the ramyeon package to boil water and sprinkle in the spice packet, but connoisseurs will add extras like canned tuna, eggs, and cheese for enhanced flavor.\n\n8. Kimchi Stew (\uae40\uce58\ucc0c\uac1c)\n\nA lesser-known fact about kimchi is its versatility as an ingredient in a whole slew of derivative dishes, which comprise a category of their own.\n\nIn kimchi-jjigae, red cabbage kimchi is chopped, sauteed in oil, and cooked with tofu, cellophane noodles, pork (sometimes tuna), and other vegetables.\n\nDespite the stew's debt to kimchi, you know it has come into its own when it's served with kimchi as a side dish.\n\n9. Army Stew (\ubd80\ub300\ucc0c\uac1c)\n\nThis hodgepodge stew of sausages, Spam, American cheese, instant noodles, tteok, and assorted vegetables dates back to the aftermath of the Korean War.\n\nBecause meat was scarce, cooks found creative replacements in the surplus foods from the American army base stationed in Seoul, hence the stew's name.\n\nAlthough meat has since then become plentiful, a buddae jjigae without Spam is unimaginable.\n\n10. Soy sauce crab (\uac04\uc7a5\uac8c\uc7a5)\n\nGanjang gejang, or crab marinated in soy sauce, can be so addictive that it's often affectionately called \"rice thief,\" the joke being that you keep eating more rice just so that you can have more gejang since it's just that good.\n\nSlightly tangy, tantalizingly bitter, pungent and cold, the taste may come as a shock for first-timers. But among South Koreans, gejang has been carving out a niche for itself as more of a centerpiece than a sideshow to other seafoods.\n\nRelated content 10 of South Korea's most delicious dishes\n\n11. Tteokbokki (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774)\n\nTteokbokki is a simple Korean street food snack made of rice cakes and fish cakes. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nThis iconic red-orange street food is so popular there's an entire part of Seoul just devoted to the steamed and sliced rice cakes (tteok), cooked with fish cakes (oden) and scallions in a sweet and spicy sauce made of chili paste.\n\nChefs have been known to put all sorts of things inside the sauce, from the black soybean paste to plain old ketchup. Call us masochists, but one thing is certain: the more pepper, the better.\n\nRelated content 15 food etiquette rules from around the world\n\n12. Gopchang (\uacf1\ucc3d)\n\nGopchang refers to the small intestines from pork or cattle, which, chopped into rounded sections, can be cooked into soups, stir-fried, or grilled.\n\nGrilled, gopchang is yet another important aspect of Korean barbecue culture. Chewy without being rubbery, it's a bit more festive than samgyeopsal, although it's still a staunchly earthy food.\n\nAnd as most office workers in South Korea can tell you, it's divine with soju.\n\n13. Samgyetang (\uc0bc\uacc4\ud0d5)\n\nSamgyetang - Korean ginseng chicken soup. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nContinuing along the masochistic strain, Koreans have a saying that goes, \"fight heat with heat.\" What that means is they love to eat boiling hot dishes on the hottest summer days.\n\nThe most representative of these is samgyetang, a thick, glutinous soup with a whole stuffed chicken floating in its boiling depths.\n\nThe cooking process tones down the ginseng's signature bitterness and leaves an oddly appealing, aromatic flavor in its stead -- a flavor that permeates an entire bird boiled down to a juicy softness.\n\n14. Bibimbap (\ube44\ube54\ubc25)\n\nBibimbap combines rice, vegetables and eggs with a spicy sauce. courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nThis Korean lunch-in-a-bowl mixes together a simple salad of rice, mixed vegetables, rice, beef, and egg, with sesame oil and a dollop of chili paste for seasoning.\n\nAlthough Korean kings from yesteryear would probably be shocked at how the royal dish has become so ingrained into the palate of the masses, we love how cheaply and quickly we can devour our favorite lunch.\n\n15. Gimbap (\uae40\ubc25)\n\nThe process of making gimbap resembles the Italian glasswork technique of millefiori, and indeed, the finished gimbap often looks too pretty too eat.\n\nSauteed vegetables, ground beef, sweet pickled radish, and rice, rolled and tightly wrapped in a sheet of laver seaweed (gim), and then sliced into bite-sized circles.\n\n16. Doenjang (\ub41c\uc7a5)\n\nWhen people think Asian cuisine, they often think soy sauce. But soy sauce is actually a byproduct of this soybean product, a paste made from dried and fermented soybeans in a process too complicated to describe here.\n\nThis brown, textured paste is not the prettiest food in the world, and like Australian vegemite, the taste takes some getting used to. But once that taste is acquired, good luck trying to make do without it.\n\n17. Gamjatang (\uac10\uc790\ud0d5)\n\nMost gamjatang places are open 24 hours, because South Koreans tend to crave this stew in the early hours of the morning as an alternative to hangover stew.\n\nThis hearty dish features potatoes (gamja), scallions, ground perilla seed, and bits of pork cooked in a pork bone broth. The real appeal of this stew lies in the unique taste of the perilla seed, which is perhaps more important to the flavor than the meat.\n\n18. Haemul Pajeon (\ud574\ubb3c\ud30c\uc804)\n\nCrunchy and filling, Korean pancake tastes best when it comes studded with shellfish, cuttlefish, and other varieties of seafood, to make haemul (seafood) pajeon.\n\nAnd with its traditional companion of Korean rice wine, makgeolli, pajeon makes the perfect meal for a rainy day.\n\n19. Jjambbong (\uc9ec\ubf55)\n\nThis dish is the soupier, spicier counterpart to jjajangmyeon and together they form the core of Korean Chinese home delivery cuisine.\n\nBut although noodles dominate in terms of sheer quantity, the onions and chili oil that flavor the soup are what really demand your attention. With copious amounts of chili oil-saturated onions and other vegetables on top of the noodles, few are able to finish this dish in its entirety, but many try.\n\nRelated content 7 super spicy South Korean dishes -- and tips for eating them\n\n20. Sundae (\uc21c\ub300)\n\nSundae, or Korean sausage, has roots in Mongolian cuisine. courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nAnother street food, sundae is a type of sausage, similar in content to blood pudding, with roots in Mongolian cuisine. \"Real\" sundae is pig intestine with a stuffing of cellophane noodles, vegetables, and meat, but even if you eat the street vendor version, which uses a synthetic replacement for the pig intestine, you will still be able to enjoy the lungs and liver on the side. Yum.\n\n21. Kongguksu (\ucf69\uad6d\uc218)\n\nThis seasonal dish might taste bland to some, but once you learn to enjoy the subtle flavor of the bean, you will acquire a taste for this cold, creamy, textured noodle dish that no other dish will be able to satisfy in the summer.\n\nAnd if the pale, spring green julienne cucumbers placed on the hand-ground, snow-white soybean doesn't tip you off, kongguksu is a highly nutritious dish that also happens to be vegetarian-friendly.\n\n22. Kalguksu (\uce7c\uad6d\uc218)\n\nBad kalguksu can be very bad. But good kalguksu is divine.\n\nAlthough most kalguksu places will add mushrooms, sliced pumpkin, and seafood or chicken to the basic ingredients of noodles and broth, at the end of the day kalguksu is about the pleasure of the plain.\n\n23. Ox Bone Soup (\uc124\ub801\ud0d5)\n\nThis ox bone soup is easily recognizable by its milky white color and sparse ingredients. At most, seolleongtang broth will contain noodles, finely chopped scallions, and a few strips of meat.\n\nYet for such a frugal investment, the results are rewarding. There is nothing like a steaming bowl of seolleongtang on a cold winter day, salted and peppered to your taste, and complemented by nothing more than rice and kkakdugi kimchi.\n\n24. Tteokguk (\ub5a1\uad6d)\n\nOriginally tteokguk was strictly eaten on the first day of the Korean New Year to signify good luck and the gaining of another year in age. The custom makes more sense if you think in Korean: idiomatically, growing a year older is expressed as \"eating another year.\"\n\nBut this dish of oval rice cake slices, egg, dried laver seaweed, and occasionally dumplings in a meat-based broth is now eaten all year round, regardless of age or season.\n\n25. Doenjang jjigae (\ub41c\uc7a5\ucc0c\uac1c)\n\nThis humble, instantly recognizable stew is one of Korea's most beloved foods.\n\nThe ingredients are simple: doenjang, tofu, mushrooms, green peppers, scallions, and an anchovy or two for added flavor. Add rice and kimchi on the side and you have a meal -- no other side dishes necessary.\n\nWhile its distinctive piquancy might throw some off, that very taste is what keeps it on the South Korean table week after week.\n\n26. Galbi (\uac08\ube44)\n\nGalbi means \"ribs\" in Korean. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nGalbi, which means \"rib,\" can technically come from pork and even chicken, but when you just say \"galbi\" sans modifiers, you're talking about thick slabs of meat marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, chopped garlic, and sugar and grilled over a proper fire.\n\nOf course, beef galbi can be used to make soup (galbitang) and steamed galbi (galbijjim). But these dishes, while excellent in their own right, are overshadowed by their grilled leader.\n\n27. Chuncheon dakgalbi (\ucd98\ucc9c \ub2ed\uac08\ube44)\n\nWith diners working together to cook the ingredients on an iron plate, this fiery South Korean chicken dish was designed for sharing.\n\nOn the other end of the galbi spectrum is the low-budget student favorite Chuncheon dakgalbi.\n\nIn this dish, chunks of chicken are marinated in a sauce of chili paste and other spices, and stir-fried in a large pan with tteok, cabbage, carrots, and slices of sweet potato.\n\nBecause of the tendency of the red dakgalbi sauce to splatter, it's common to see many diners wearing aprons over their clothes as they cook and eat.\n\n28. Bossam (\ubcf4\uc308)\n\nBossam -- a very Korean way to eat pig. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nAs is frequently the case with many South Korean meat dishes, Bossam at its core is simple: steamed pork.\n\nBut key to this dish is that the steamed pork is sliced into squares slightly larger than a bite, lovingly wrapped in a leaf of lettuce, perilla, or kimchi, and daubed with a dipping sauce. There are two traditional options: ssamjang, made of chili paste and soybean paste (doenjang), or saeujeot, a painfully salty pink sauce made of tiny pickled shrimp.\n\nWrapping and dipping are essential.\n\n29. Agujjim (\uc544\uad6c\ucc1c)\n\nAgujjim, also known as agwijjim, is a seafood dish that consists of anglerfish braised on a bed of dropwort and bean sprout. It is as spicy as it looks: the entire dish is a bright reddish color, from the chili powder, chili paste, and chili peppers used in the seasoning.\n\nThe white, firm flesh of the anglerfish, which is quite rightly called the \"beef of the sea,\" is meaty and filling. And the tangle of dropwort and bean sprout that make up the majority of the dish aren't just there for decoration: the dropwort is tart and the bean sprouts crunchy.\n\nRelated content World's 11 best places for vegetarians from Oregon to India\n\n30. Japchae (\uc7a1\ucc44)\n\nJapchae, a side dish of cellophane noodles, pork, and assorted vegetables sauteed in soy sauce, makes its most frequent appearances at feasts and potlucks.\n\nThere are no precise rules governing the precise assortment of vegetables in japchae, but most recipes won't stray far from the standard collection of mushrooms, carrots, spinach, onions, and leeks.\n\n31. Dubu kimchi (\ub450\ubd80\uae40\uce58)\n\nThis appropriate combination of blanched dubu (tofu), sauteed kimchi, and stir-fried pork is a threesome made in heaven. The dubu, which has the potential to be bland on its own, has the pork to add substance and the kimchi to add flavor.\n\nAnother stalwart companion to alcohol, especially at more traditional bars and restaurants, dubu kimchi makes soju almost palatable.\n\n32. Hobakjuk (\ud638\ubc15\uc8fd)\n\nHobakjuk is both delicious and healthy. Courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nThis viscous, yellow-orange juk, or porridge, gets its distinctive color and flavor from the pumpkin, its namesake and its main ingredient. The pumpkin is peeled, boiled, and blended with glutinous rice flour, and the result is a bowl of porridge so creamy, golden, and sweet that in some ways it seems more pudding than porridge.\n\nHobakjuk is often served as an appetizer to meals, or as a health food: it is supposedly beneficial to those suffering from intestinal problems. The specifics of medicinal science aside, it's not difficult to imagine that this mellow, mildly flavored meal can heal.\n\n33. Gyeranjjim (\uacc4\ub780\ucc1c)\n\nThis side dish, in which an egg is beaten into a bowl, lightly salted and steamed into a spongy, pale yellow cake, is absolutely essential when eating spicy food.\n\nSimilar in consistency to soft tofu (sundubu), but with more flavor, gyeranjjim is sometimes made with diced mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, leeks, and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.\n\n34. Naengmyeon (\ub0c9\uba74)\n\nNaengmyeon is one of the main highlights of summers in Korea. courtesy Korean Tourism Organization\n\nIn South Korea we wait for summer just so we can start eating naengmyeon every week. The cold buckwheat noodles are great as a lightweight lunch option or after Korean barbecue, as a way to cleanse the palate.\n\nMul naengmyeon, or \"water\" naengmyeon, hailing from North Korea's Pyongyang, consists of buckwheat noodles in a tangy meat or kimchi broth, topped with slivers of radish, cucumber, and egg, and seasoned with vinegar and Korean mustard (gyeoja).\n\nBibim naengmyeon, or \"mix\" naengmyeon, generally contains the same ingredients, but minus the broth. The noodles are instead covered in a sauce made from chili paste.\n\n35. Dotorimuk (\ub3c4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ubb35)\n\nThis light brown jello, made of acorn starch, is served cold, frequently with a topping of chopped leeks and soy sauce as a side dish, or as an ingredient in Dotorimuk salads and dotorimukbap (dotorimuk with rice).\n\nLike tofu, dotorimuk, while nutritious and vegan-friendly, can taste bland on its own. The flavor, which is unique, can only be described as acorn -- bitter rather than nutty. But although dotorimuk may be an acquired taste, most dotorimuk dishes have a host of appetizing spices and condiments to help the process along.\n\n36. Mudfish Soup (\ucd94\uc5b4\ud0d5)\n\nThis spicy soup has a consistency closer to that of stew. Although mashed and boiled to the point where it is unrecognizable, chueotang is named for the freshwater mudfish (chueo) that constitutes the main ingredient.\n\nBut the selling point of this soup is the coarse yet satisfying texture of the mudfish and the vegetables -- mung bean sprouts, dried radish greens, sweet potato stems, and most of all the thin, delicate outer cabbage leaves.\n\n37. Bulgogi (\ubd88\uace0\uae30)\n\nBulgogi is becoming as well-known as kimchi across the rest of the world. courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nIf galbi represents Korean barbecue, then bulgogi's playing field is Korean cuisine as a whole. This well-known sweet meat dish, which has existed in some form for over a thousand years, was haute cuisine during the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nThe dish is also a fusion favorite: bulgogi-flavored burgers are part of the menu at fast food franchise Lotteria, and there have also been sightings of other adaptations like the bulgogi panini.\n\n38. Ppeongtwigi (\ubee5\ud280\uae30)\n\nIf you've ever been lucky enough to get stuck in daytime Seoul traffic, you will see the ppeongtwigi sellers emerge from nowhere and park themselves in the center of the highway. Their fearlessness is a sure sign that your car won't be budging for a while yet.\n\nPpeongtwiti is onomatopoeic.

From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own.\n\n(CNN) With the presidents of the United States and Russia staying home, it seemed Chinese President Xi Jinping would dominate this weekend at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and increase his country's influence in the Pacific.\n\nChina has already lent at least $1.3 billion to the Pacific Islands and about $590 million alone to the summit's host, Papua New Guinea (PNG). And to coincide with the PNG visit, Beijing promised $4 billion of finance to build PNG's first national road network, one of several gestures for which China secured effusive praise from Pacific Island countries including Samoa, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Niue, Fiji and the President of the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nBut nevertheless, Xi left PNG dissatisfied and disgruntled.\n\nFor the first time in APEC's 25-year history, PNG was forced to end the summit with leaders failing to agree on a communique . And Beijing was also left embarrassed by reports of four Chinese officials being unceremoniously banished from the office of PNG Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato after allegedly trying to influence his statement.\n\nThe Director General of China's Department of International Economic Affairs, Wang Xiaolong, was reported as saying this was \"simply not true.\"\n\nFor China, the trade summit should have been a public relations victory -- but it was turned into partial defeat when Chinese officials barred most reporters from participant countries and other international outlets from the forum and instead only allowed Chinese state-owned media journalists, citing space and security concerns according to Reuters.\n\nConcerted and coordinated push back by the US and its allies\n\nOf more enduring consequence than diplomatic embarrassment, is the concerted and coordinated push back by the US and its allies -- such as Japan and Australia -- which was done in a very public way. Earlier this month, Australia announced a $2.2 billion \"step-up to the Pacific\" -- which includes an Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility and an export credit agency to help Australian companies invest in the region.\n\nThen on Saturday, the Trilateral Partnership countries of the US, Japan and Australia released a joint statement declaring together they would identify infrastructure projects for development and financing. Pointedly, these projects would adhere to \"international standards and principles for development, including openness, transparency, and fiscal sustainability.\" That approach, it said, would \"help to meet the region's genuine needs while avoiding unsustainable debt burdens for the nations of the region.\"\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence was even more blunt during his speech at the APEC summit.\n\nTaking a swipe at China, he said that the US \"offers a better option\" and \"does not drown partners in a sea of debt...coerce\" them or \"compromise\" their independence.\n\nTo indicate that the US and allied powers were serious about using economic and military means to counter Chinese influence, Pence announced over the weekend the US will join with Australia and PNG to redevelop and create a joint naval base on Manus Island. \"We will work with these two nations to protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific Islands,\" he said.\n\nPublic distaste for 'sharp power' on show\n\nthat China Previously, in August, it was reportedthat China could be given the contract to redevelop a port on Manus Island. A military facility on Manus Island is of high strategic significance -- this is a deep-water port capable of hosting aircraft carriers and hundreds of naval vessels.\n\nAs one of the most important bases for the US fleet in the Pacific theater during World War II, it will be a second line of defence should China's People's Liberation Army Navy successfully break out of the so-called First Island Chain, a line of archipelagos that cover the Kuril Islands, Japan, Taiwan, northern Philippines and Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBut even if the reports about Chinese involvement in the Manus Island port are untrue, Beijing would be alarmed at the prospect of American and Australian military assets in PNG to counter any Chinese naval breakout.\n\nAs far as Beijing is concerned, the weekend was the time to showcase China's emergence as a benign superpower in the South Pacific. Instead, public distaste for and rebuke of its 'sharp power' was on show.\n\nXi defended China's trade practices and denied that its Belt and Road Initiative contained hidden geo-political and other sinister motivations. And no matter how adamantly he did so, it was not a conversation that Xi intended to have when he first landed in Port Moresby.\n\nAnd it has not ended.\n\nThe more China offers economic largesse and inducements, the more it will need to reassure the recipient and the world that it is not laying a 'debt trap' or seeking to buy influence.\n\nThe weekend was supposed to be China's moment in the sun during this most important regional economic meeting. Instead, it became obvious to all that Beijing's ambitions are as feared and resisted by at least as many countries, as welcomed by others."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Caroline Kelly, CNN", "title": "Finnish President doesn't recall telling Trump Finns do a lot of 'raking' to prevent forest fires", "description": "Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said in an interview published Sunday that although President Donald Trump claimed the European leader told him Finns rarely have forest fires because they \"spend a lot of time raking,\" he doesn't recall discussing that with T\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/18/politics/finnish-president-trump-raking-forest-fires/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181117163701-03-trump-camp-fire-1118-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:36:27Z", "content": "(CNN) Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said in an interview published Sunday that although President Donald Trump claimed the European leader told him Finns rarely have forest fires because they \"spend a lot of time raking,\" he doesn't recall discussing that \u2026 [+1724 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said in an interview published Sunday that although President Donald Trump claimed the European leader told him Finns rarely have forest fires because they \"spend a lot of time raking,\" he doesn't recall discussing that with Trump when they met last weekend in Paris.\n\nNiinist\u00f6 told the Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, a CNN affiliate, that the subject of raking was never brought up in his conversations with Trump.
