Las esclavas africanas, explotadas sexualmente, adem\u00e1s de servir para trabajar y proporcionar placeres malvados a depravados amos, produc\u00edan cr\u00edas.\n\nTal vez por la magnitud de la ignominia, la primera concesi\u00f3n de los esclavistas fue declarar \u201cvientres libres\u201d a las esclavas gr\u00e1vidas que par\u00edan hijos emancipados sin alcanzar ellas mismas la libertad. En Iberoam\u00e9rica se llam\u00f3 \u201clibertos\u201d a esas criaturas y en Estados Unidos \u201cfreeborn\u201d, algo as\u00ed \u201ccomo nacido libre\u201d. La paradoja recuerda a los beb\u00e9s que hoy nacen estadounidenses sin que sus madres puedan serlo.\n\nEn el presente, la desigualdad nacional ha generado una nueva modalidad de asumir la maternidad, se trata del llamado \u201cturismo de parto\u201d, que consiste en viajar a pa\u00edses desarrollados donde se practica el \u201cIus soli\u201d (derecho de la tierra), que vincula legalmente el suelo a la persona, generando la \u201cciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento\u201d. Una figura distinta, aunque no necesariamente contrapuesta es el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d o \u201cderecho de sangre\u201d, que asocia la ciudadan\u00eda de los hijos a la de los padres.\n\nMuchas personas estiman que, al nacer ciudadanos de Estados Unidos, Canad\u00e1 u otros pa\u00edses desarrollados, donde se aplica la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento, sus hijos tendr\u00e1n mejores oportunidades. En Estados Unidos donde esa pr\u00e1ctica no constituye delito, existen compa\u00f1\u00edas que ofertan \u201cpaquetes\u201d del tipo \u201ctodo incluido\u201d que seg\u00fan BBC News pueden costar entre 15.000 y 80.000 d\u00f3lares.\n\nAl respecto, es preciso aclarar que los pa\u00edses que practican el \u201cIus soli\u201d o ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento, no reconocen el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d\n\ninverso, lo cual significa que tener hijos estadounidenses, canadienses o franceses por nacimiento, no hace ciudadanos ni residentes ni tampoco dota de derechos especiales a los padres. Es frecuente el caso de turistas o personas con visas temporales que desean permanecer en los pa\u00edses de acogida sin poder lograrlo. Sus hijos estadounidenses pueden quedarse y los padres no.\n\nAunque viajar a Estados Unidos o Canad\u00e1 con el prop\u00f3sito de parir all\u00ed no constituye delito, algunas dependencias y funcionarios creen poder penalizar a las mujeres cuando se compruebe que han mentido al falsear los motivos del viaje y ocultar su condici\u00f3n de embarazadas. No obstante, todav\u00eda no existen legislaciones al respecto.\n\nLos avances de la Uni\u00f3n Europea en materia de integraci\u00f3n y unidad pol\u00edtica, condujeron a la adopci\u00f3n en 1992 del Tratado de Maastricht, en el cual se establece que: \u201cEs ciudadano de la Uni\u00f3n Europea toda persona que ostente la de un Estado Miembro...\u201d La ciudadan\u00eda de la Uni\u00f3n, no sustituye a la nacional.\n\nTal vez, t\u00e9cnicamente hablando, lo cual es dif\u00edcil cuando se trata de humanos, los pa\u00edses que cuentan con enormes territorios y poca densidad poblacional ganan m\u00e1s de lo que pierden. Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos con casi diez millones de kil\u00f3metros cuadrados y una densidad poblacional de unas 33 personas por km\u00b2, se beneficia porque obtiene a los hijos sin haber criado a los padres.\n\nAunque personalmente preferir\u00eda que tales fen\u00f3menos no existieran y que a las mismas personas se les aplicara a la vez el \u201cIus soli\u201d, derecho de la tierra y el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d, \u201cderecho de sangre\u201d, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan que todos los terr\u00edcolas fueran ciudadanos del mundo, comprendo que por ahora tales sue\u00f1os no son practicables.\n\nEntre tanto, mientras la utop\u00eda no se materialice, no encuentro argumentos v\u00e1lidos para criticar a las parejas o mujeres que mediante emigraci\u00f3n nonata procuren un futuro mejor para sus hijos. De alguna manera sus vientres son tambi\u00e9n libres. Estados Unidos deber\u00eda sentirse orgulloso de dar libertad tambi\u00e9n a los nonatos.\n\nComo un d\u00eda con inspirada prosa humanista escribi\u00f3 el afamado autor novelas para la radio, F\u00e9lix B. Caignet, al final, se trata de \u201cEl derecho de nacer\u201d.

There are 200 other such zones across Europe and several in Asian cities such as Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nGriffiths' team is the first to look at the effects of large-scale traffic emission controls on air quality improvements and at their effects on children's health, he said.\n\nEach year from 2009 through 2013, they measured the lung capacity of 400 different primary-school children between 8 and 9 years old in four East London boroughs. All four boroughs were within London's low emission zone and are heavily polluted, exceeding European Union limits on nitrogen dioxide at the start of the study.\n\nAverage exposure concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured annually at each child's home and school addresses.\n\n\"The introduction of lower-emission zones did improve air quality but had less of an effect than expected,\" Griffiths said.\n\nThey hoped to see children's lung capacity grow year by year, as the zoning should reduce pollution, but the researchers found the opposite: Their lung capacity was an estimated 5% smaller than it would otherwise be.\n\n\"Although changes of this magnitude are unlikely to cause problems in healthy children, we urgently need to know whether these lung deficits will impact lung function and health in later life,\" Griffiths said.\n\nAt the study's start, 99% of the children were living in areas that exceeded the European Union's limits for nitrogen oxide. By 2013, 34% were living in areas that exceeded EU limits -- but many went to schools that had higher levels of pollution, next to busy roads, according to the paper.\n\n\"Doctors should consider advising parents of children with clinically significant lung disease to avoid living in highly polluted areas or to adopt personal mitigation measures to limit their exposure,\" Griffiths said.\n\nImproving child health\n\nA reduction in lung capacity can lead to stunted lungs, which is dangerous for two reasons, Griffiths said.\n\nFirst, it increases the risk of asthma and worsens the condition in those who have it. In the long term, it can also be problematic for adults, as lung size is a good predictor for life expectancy, for reasons that are not exactly clear.\n\nWith age, the lungs start to decline, and if people enter adulthood with already declining lungs, this will lower their life expectancy, he explained.\n\n\"All of the children involved in this study lost some degree of lung function from breathing toxic air,\" said Dr. Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research. \"What this means is that we urgently need to go much further to protect people right now.\"\n\nGriffiths highlighted that the study would have benefited from a comparison group of children living in an area of similar poor air quality and without any zoning regulations in place. Also, a larger number of children would have helped strengthen the findings.\n\nbreathe polluted air, according to the World Health Organization, and About 93% of children globallybreathe polluted air, according to the World Health Organization, and 4.2 million deaths every year are caused by outdoor air pollution.\n\nSome of the world's most polluted cities include Peshawar, Pakistan; Varanasi, India; Cairo, Egypt's capital; and Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIs ultra the next step?\n\nIn April, Central London will be equipped with a new version of the traffic control measure: an ultra-low-emission zone in which vehicles will have to meet stricter exhaust emission standards or drivers must pay a daily charge to travel within the zone.\n\nThe measure will encompass a larger area of London, to include more than 3.6 million additional residents, by 2021. It will also require that vehicles meet updated European guidelines on gas and diesel vehicles.\n\n\"It is predicted to have much bigger impacts on health,\" Griffiths said, and the research team is conducting a new study on the upgraded zone's effectiveness.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nUltimately, \"a big step forward\" to deal with traffic pollution would be to move away from cars that use diesel or gas and switch to electric vehicles, he said. Even in that case, there would be pollution created from tires and breaks the researcher added.\n\nThe British government also encourages such vehicles through grants of up to 4,500 pounds (US $5,800) to buy environmentally friendly cars.\n\n\"It is disappointing that the low-emission zone in London has not helped to improve children's lung capacity and [the study] shows that a piecemeal approach to reducing air pollution does not work,\" said Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at the charity Asthma UK.\n\n\"If children's lungs don't develop properly as a result of air pollution, it can increase their likelihood of developing asthma, leaving them coughing, wheezing and at risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.\"\n\nStefan Reis, head of atmospheric chemistry and effects at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, added that the study \"highlights a key challenge for the implementation of policy interventions to improve air quality.\"\n\n\"Planned measures aiming to reduce population exposure in urban areas, and in particular vulnerable groups such as children or older adults, need to be adequately assessed prior to implementation.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "George Conway's group against Trump", "description": "The husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway is among a new group of conservative lawyers that seeks to provide a \"voice\" to speak out in favor of principles that it feels are under attack in the Trump era.

result in offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed using firearms; shorten mandatory minimum sentences, including reverting life imprisonment to a 25-year minimum for those convicted under the \"three strikes\" provision; and expand the \"drug safety valve\" to reduce the number of nonviolent drug offenders receiving mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nProponents of the bill

Kai Wiggins is a policy analyst at the Arab American Institute. The views expressed here are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The federal government's 2017 hate crime statistics are out, and they show a disturbing trend: Last year, as in 2016 and 2015 before, hate crimes were on the rise. But what the data fail to show is perhaps even more alarming, and further demonstrates the need for an improved response to hate crime.\n\nWe know that in 2017 , as in 2016 and 2015 before, the increase coincided with burgeoning racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. The FBI's information shows that crimes motivated by race or ethnicity, which rose 18% in 2017, accounted for a majority of all incidents reported, with hate crimes specifically targeting African-Americans representing the greatest share, while anti-Arab hate crimes increased 100%. As for crimes motivated by religion, anti-Jewish incidents surged yet again last year, this time over 37%, while anti-Muslim incidents, which stabilized after two years of dramatic rise, remained well above historical averages from before the 2016 election cycle.\n\nBut despite the reported increase, we know that many incidents, including some of the most horrific acts of bias-motivated violence committed last year, are somehow missing from the official statistics.\n\nThe murder of Heather Heyer is missing. According to the FBI data, the Charlottesville, Virginia, Police Department reported no hate crimes between July and September of last year. But on August 12, 2017, Heyer was killed in Charlottesville when a man plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally. An additional 35 people were injured, and the accused driver, James Alex Fields Jr., is awaiting trial on federal hate crime charges. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe killings of Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche are missing. According to FBI statistics, no hate crime murders were reported in Oregon last year. But on May 26, 2017, Best and Namkai-Meche were killed on a train in Portland when a man fatally stabbed them and wounded Micah David-Cole Fletcher after they confronted him for harassing two teenage passengers with anti-Muslim and racist slurs. The accused attacker, Jeremy Joseph Christian, was indicted on the state hate crime charge of \"second degree intimidation\" and pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla is missing. According to FBI statistics, no hate crimes were reported last year in Olathe, Kansas. But on February 22, 2017, Kuchibhotla was killed at a bar in Olathe when a man shot him because of his perceived national origin. His friend Alok Madasani was also targeted but survived the shooting, as did a man named Ian Grillot who attempted to intercede. The shooter, Adam Purinton, was convicted on federal hate crime charges.\n\nWhile all three cases were prosecuted as hate crimes, this detail is not relevant to whether they should have been reported in the FBI data. According to federal guidance on hate crime reporting, it is the responsibility of law enforcement officials responding to an incident to determine whether there was any indication that it was bias-motivated. After a secondary review, and regardless of whether any hate crime charges are brought, the relevant agency may then report the incident as a hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reporting, or UCR, system, which the FBI uses to publish its annual report.\n\nWe should also note that negligence on the part of responding law enforcement officials is not necessarily the cause of these apparent omissions. While the Portland Police Bureau was not immediately available for comment, the Olathe Police Department confirmed it had reported six hate crime incidents, including the murder of Kuchibhotla, which was recorded as an \"Anti-Other Ethnicity/National Origin\" incident, to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Because the Olathe Police Department and agencies from other jurisdictions submit hate crime data using an antiquated reporting format, the KBI said it was unable to aggregate these incidents into the data collections submitted to the FBI. As for Charlottesville, the department did not return a recent request for comment but had told us in a September statement that the Heyer case and others relating to the white nationalist rally would be reported as hate crimes, but it appears they were not finalized in time for inclusion in the official state or federal data.\n\nIn some states, including Virginia and Oregon , state UCR programs publish annual hate crime statistics. Like the FBI statistics, Virginia's annual hate crime report contains no data relating to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. However, and in seeming contradiction with the federal data, state-level statistics from Oregon include two hate crime murder offenses reported in Multnomah County. But without additional information, we are unable to determine whether either of these offenses corresponds to the May 26 stabbing.\n\nAdditional findings from state-level statistics raise questions about the FBI data. In advance of this week's FBI release, the Arab American Institute collected UCR hate crime data from 27 states and the District of Columbia. Based on these state-level statistics, we predicted a significant nationwide increase reported in 2017 federal statistics. While the overall prediction was correct, much like in the case of Oregon, we found some notable discrepancies. According to the FBI data, just 48 incidents were reported in Maryland in 2017, but state-level statistics indicate a far greater total of 183. Similar disparities occurred in multiple states, including Indiana. While FBI statistics contained no data from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, according to state UCR data , the department reported 44 incidents in 2017.\n\nArkansas, But the problem of questionable or underreported data is not limited to any one state. Hawaii does not even participate in the national hate crime statistics program, and aside from Nevada, an additional 11 participating states had fewer than 10 agencies report hate crime incidents in 2017. Many of these states, such as Alabama Georgia and Mississippi , have dark histories of racial and ethnic violence but have not enacted sufficient legislation to address hate crime. If all states offered inclusive protections in their hate crime laws, required hate crime reporting and data collection from law enforcement, and authorized comprehensive police training on investigating and reporting hate crime incidents, maybe then we would have more accurate and representative federal statistics.\n\nFor more opinion...

In order to improve the data collected under the Hate Crime Statistics Act and published in the FBI's annual report, Congress should pass legislation that provides law enforcement with incentives for hate crime reporting and ties federal funding for state or local agencies to the provision of accurate data.\n\nUntil then, we will continue to highlight what the data show, and bring what's missing to light."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Tapper: Voter fraud claim a 'fever dream'", "description": "CNN's Jake Tapper and Nia-Malika Henderson discuss President Trump's false claims of voter fraud in the 2018 midterm elections.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/14/trump-voter-fraud-claim-jake-tapper-nia-malika-henderson-lead-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114164405-jake-tapper-11142018-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:54:43Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

He's openly speculating about replacing more members of his Cabinet , though so far has stopped short of executing the dismissals , leaving those aides in a career purgatory.\n\nAt an election night party at the White House, Trump left attendees guessing when he was spotted in a huddle with a potential replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly, who himself stood awkwardly in a corner.\n\n\"Yes, he's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official said, noting the mood in the Oval Office is darker than normal this week. After nearly a month straight of campaigning before adoring crowds, the applause has gone silent and the President has retreated. The tempest has led to rampant speculation inside the building about the fates of other senior staffers, some of whom are beginning to plan their exits.\n\nFriends of the President describe him as embittered by the election losses and troubled by the Mueller investigation. He met Monday with his lawyers to go over a series of written questions from the special counsel. Some of his longtime confidants are worried for his health, believing he's gained weight and looks unwell.\n\nThe President's fury at special counsel Robert Mueller burst into view again Thursday morning when he unleashed a string of angry tweets about the special counsel.\n\nThe timing for the President's fury couldn't be worse, considering the White House is heading into uncharted territory with Democrats assuming control of the House. Trump has told some advisers he's itching for the fight, believing it can provide him a political foil. Meanwhile, Mueller is inching closer to issuing his report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\"He knows it's winding up. So, it's unsettling,\" another person close to the President said.\n\nIt was a 24-word statement from the East Wing, where the first lady and her small staff work, about a presidential adviser that revealed how the dysfunction inside the White House is deeper and more tangled than previously known.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" a spokeswoman for Melania Trump said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nYet a day after that extraordinarily public rebuke, Mira Ricardel reported to work in the suite of offices in the National Security Council . After Ricardel was not even given the dignity of being named in the statement -- which referred to her only as \"she\" -- everyone in the West Wing was saying her name on Wednesday as anxiety intensified about what this latest feud would mean for the President's mood. Later Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIn the last week, the President's frayed and fraught relationships have been laid bare for all to see: He's furious at Kelly for a Paris trip that ended in a public relations debacle. He's blaming his political advisers for losing the winning narrative of the midterms. And he was caught off guard by his wife's shot across the bow at one of the top advisers in the West Wing -- a sign that their private conversations clearly aren't functional.\n\nAfter his wife ordered the astounding statement to be released Tuesday afternoon, Trump was furious that what had been an internal staffing matter was now thrust into public view, leaving him to look like a bossed-around husband. The President's mood was dark and intense after what officials said was a blindsiding by aides who do not report to him.\n\nIf the sudden public interest in Ricardel, a behind-the-scenes operator, came as a surprise to the President, however, the underlying issues between her and the first lady's office were not new.\n\nThe Ricardel affair\n\nTwo sources said the first lady's office believed Ricardel accused members of their staff of inappropriate behavior as part of her trip to Africa last month, and asked for the White House counsel's office to investigate. The counsel's office declined, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's on top of concerns that Ricardel treated the trip dismissively and interfered with seating arrangements on the first lady's plane.\n\nIt became \"very personal\" to the first lady, one person familiar with the matter said, because she \"ran over Melania's staff.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said the first lady and her aides sought to take issue with Ricardel through \"appropriate channels\" for weeks, including Kelly, but nothing came of their concerns.\n\nOther officials said tensions between the first lady and Ricardel stemmed from more than just the deputy national security adviser's handling of her Africa trip, noting friction had developed over how Ricardel treated administration staff in general.\n\n\"It's true there was infighting between Mira and the first lady's staff. And it's true that the Africa trip was a big part of the tension,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \"But the reason the first lady asked for Mira to be fired was that the first lady believed she was a bully.\"\n\nThe episode came against the backdrop of broader tensions between the National Security Council and others in the West Wing who have bristled at the way national security adviser John Bolton has run his team. One senior White House official said some had viewed Bolton as more interested in serving as a personal adviser to the President than in running the day-to-day operations of the National Security Council.\n\nRicardel was Bolton's highest-ranking aide at the National Security Council, and her gruff style matches that of her boss. Both have made enemies within the administration for appearing to discard opposing opinions while advancing their own.\n\nBut when the first lady's office delivered its broadside against his top aide, Bolton was 10,000 miles away in Singapore on a trip with Vice President Mike Pence. Working against a 12-hour time difference, aides traveling with the national security adviser made furious calls to their colleagues back in Washington in an attempt to figure out what was going on and potentially stall Ricardel's firing. Bolton kept his head down, an official traveling with him said, and did not mention the drama publicly.\n\nMost viewed Bolton's efforts to preserve Ricardel's job as futile and just delaying the inevitable, which Bolton apparently realized after seeing the drama unfold from half a world away. But Trump had surprised staffers in the past, and there had been some speculation earlier Wednesday that Ricardel would end up in another position in the administration outside the National Security Council. The first lady does not offer the President staffing advice on a regular basis, but one former White House official said that when she does, it carries significant weight.\n\nPervasive dysfunction\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match 02:12\n\nThe episode underscored the dysfunction that continues to pervade West Wing staffing matters almost two years into the Trump presidency. It lays bare the continued factionalism pitting aides against each other, often in convoluted and unpredictable configurations. And it reflects the deep unease within the White House as Democrats prepare to launch an assault of investigations into all manner of administration business.\n\nStaffers are still coming to grips with the new political reality while responding to a freshly enraged President. The prospects for wide-ranging investigations launched by the new Democratic-led House have concerned aides, who worry about legal bills and the potential impact on their careers.\n\nA slow-rolling staff shake-up is far from over, with Kelly again the subject of rampant speculation, despite his proclamation earlier this year he would remain at Trump's side until 2020 . While the President has strongly considered Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff and an ally of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as a replacement for Kelly, there has been \"aggressive pushback\" against him, one senior official said. Some senior aides have even threatened to resign if Ayers is tapped for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother name discussed inside the White House as a potential Kelly successor is Johnny DeStefano, a senior aide to Trump who has quietly taken over a growing portfolio. DeStefano, a former top adviser to then-House Speaker John Boehner, has a solid relationship with the President and is generally well-liked among the staff.\n\nBut the President, who detests the narrative that his White House is chaotic, could ultimately decide not to ax Kelly -- if only to spite the press.\n\n\"The more the press writes that John Kelly is gone, the more Trump is emboldened to keep him just to prove them wrong,\" one source close to the White House said.\n\nFraught workplace\n\nTrump's foul mood, meanwhile, has rendered the White House a tumultuous workplace where outbursts are becoming more common. The decision to scrap a planned visit to an American cemetery in France because of rain over the weekend only deepened the President's conviction that he's being misserved by some of his staffers.\n\nTrump was advised by deputy chief of staff Zach Fuentes, a close aide of Kelly's, just ahead of his tense meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not be able to fly his helicopter to the Aisne-Marne cemetery, situated 50 miles from Paris. A drive, Fuentes said, would cause traffic havoc around Paris, and would also make Trump late to the event -- something he detests.\n\nSome aides told the President that he should not worry about missing the event because he had other opportunities to pay respects on the trip, including another cemetery visit scheduled for the following day, according to people familiar with the conversations. Neither they nor the President expected the massive backlash the decision prompted, which sank in over the course of the following hours. As he watched the onslaught of headlines criticizing him for skipping the trip with no backup plan, the President took his anger out on Fuentes personally.\n\nWhiling away the empty hours at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, Trump complained the entire trip to France was poorly conceived and executed, according to people familiar with the matter. He'd long discovered the events on Sunday would not include a grand military parade like the one he witnessed a year ago on Bastille Day, leading him to wonder what the point of the trip was.\n\nInstead, Trump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nAs they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing. And they worked to set up phone calls with officials back home in the hopes of keeping him occupied.\n\nA brewing presidential tempest\n\nThe clouds started gathering on election night, people familiar with the matter said. Surrounded by his wealthy friends, three oldest children and select senior staffers, Trump entered a White House watch party a week ago in a cheerful mood. But as he huddled over pizza and tiny hotdogs with some of his billionaire friends, the President began to see things shift. His mood went south. And the blame began flying.\n\nHe did everything his political team asked him to do, Trump protested to his friends. He did his job while others clearly had not.\n\nKelly, the beleaguered chief of staff, attended early in the evening with his wife. Long viewed by the President as lacking political acumen, Kelly appeared out of his realm, according to two sources familiar with the scene. He remained in a corner sipping a drink with his deputy.\n\nAn hour before midnight, the President -- visibly annoyed -- announced he was done. The rooms, which had been set up with large televisions for viewing results, began to empty. As attendees began trickling out, some saw an intriguing sight.\n\nHuddled in a corner, intense in conversation, were the President, his wife and Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, who has been speculated about as a leading contender to replace Kelly.\n\nTo those still there who saw, and others who later heard about it, it was a moment the President appeared to stage."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jeremy Herb, CNN", "title": "Jeff Flake threatens to vote against judges after GOP blocks Mueller protection bill vote", "description": "Retiring Republican Sen.

Their lawyers are asking for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would restore his pass right away. They also want the administration's action deemed unconstitutional.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed suit on Tuesday. The case was assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon Kelly heard arguments over the proposed temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction from Theodore Boutrous, an attorney representing CNN, and Justice Department attorney James Burnham.\n\nThe judge began by probing CNN's arguments for the better part of an hour. Then he questioned Burnham and heard rebuttals from Boutrous. The hearing lasted for nearly two hours, with Kelly scrutinizing both sides, drilling down especially deep on some of CNN's arguments.\n\nBefore dismissing court, Kelly said he would rule on the temporary restraining order Thursday at 3 p.m.\n\nOutside the courthouse, Boutrous told reporters that the \"judge was very very focused on the key issues of the case.\"\n\nBoutrous said he is grateful the judge \"gave us such a serious hearing\" and said he is \"very much looking forward to his ruling tomorrow.\"\n\nKelly opened the hearing by quizzing Boutrous on the network's First Amendment claim and asking how the President's history of attacks on CNN should be viewed in the context of the lawsuit.\n\nBoutrous rattled off examples of Trump's missives against CNN, including his claim that the network is an \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nKelly expressed skepticism that this proves the Acosta ban is \"content-based discrimination,\" as CNN is alleging.\n\nKelly said there is some evidence that Acosta's conduct -- not his content -- led the White House to suspend his press pass.\n\nBut Boutrous disputed that and said there \"never will there be more evidence of facial discrimination and animus against an individual reporter\" than in this case.\n\nKelly said \"we've all seen the clip\" of the White House press conference where Trump and Acosta had a combative exchange last week. Kelly said that Acosta \"continued speaking after his time expired\" and \"wouldn't give up his microphone\" -- points that the Trump administration made in its briefs earlier Wednesday.\n\nUnder questioning from the judge, Boutrous cited Trump's words to Acosta from the press conference, and said, \"'Rudeness' is really a code word for 'I don't like you being an aggressive reporter.'\"\n\nKelly peppered CNN's attorney with hypotheticals as he tried to determine what a lawful move by the White House, responding to Acosta's actions, would look like.\n\n\"Could they let him keep the pass but tell him he couldn't come to presidential press conferences?\" Kelly asked.\n\nBoutrous contended that even a partial response like that would be a violation of Acosta's First Amendment rights.\n\nBoutrous called the White House's move to revoke Acosta's hard pass \"the definition of arbitrariness and capriciousness.\"\n\n\"What are the standards?\" Boutrous asked. \"Rudeness is not a standard. If it were no one could have gone to the press conference.\"\n\nBoutrous separately brought up evidence that hadn't been available when CNN filed its suit: A fundraising email that the Trump campaign sent Wednesday.\n\nThe email touted the decision to revoke Acosta's credentials and attacked CNN for what it called its \"liberal bias.\" Boutrous said that by grouping that all together in the same breath, the email made it clear that it was Acosta's coverage and not his conduct at a press conference that triggered the revocation of his press pass.\n\nKelly asked CNN's lawyers to state the company's position regarding the original White House accusation that Acosta placed his hands a White House intern as she tried to grab a microphone out of his hand.\n\n\"It's absolutely false,\" Boutrous said.\n\nBoutrous also pointed out that Trump administration never mentioned that accusation against Acosta in the 28-page brief that Justice Department lawyers filed with the court earlier on Wednesday.\n\n\"They've abandoned that\" claim, Boutrous said.\n\nIn his first question in a back and forth with the government, Kelly asked Burnham to clear up the government's shifting rationale for revoking Acosta's pass.\n\n\"Why don't you set me straight,\" Kelly said. \"Let me know what was the reason and address this issue of whether the government's reason has changed over time.\"\n\n\"There doesn't need to be a reason because there's no First Amendment protection and the President has broad discretion,\" Burnham said.\n\nStill, Burnham called the White House's stated reasonings \"pretty consistent throughout,\" and walked through a series of statements that the administration has made \u2014 from Trump's first comments at the press conference to Sanders' tweets announcing the revocation to the official statement put out Tuesday after CNN filed its suit.\n\nBurnham said Sanders' claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched a White House intern was not a part of their legal argument.\n\n\"We're not relying on that here and I don't think the White House is relying on that here,\" Burnham said.\n\nBurnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's credentials if it didn't agree with their reporting.\n\nHe made the assertion under questioning from Kelly, who asked him to state the administration's position in this hypothetical situation.\n\nThe judge asked if the White House could essentially tell any individual journalist, \"we don't like your reporting, so we're pulling your hard pass.\" Burnham replied, \"as a matter of law... yes.\"\n\nPressed again by the judge on Sanders' claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched the intern, Burnham said \"we don't have a position\" on that.\n\n\"The one consistent explanation,\" Burnham said, \"is disorder at the press conference.\"\n\nBurnham contended that revoking Acosta's hard pass was not \"viewpoint discrimination\" \u2014 part of a legal threshold for a First Amendment claim.\n\n\"A single journalist's attempt to monopolize a press conference is not a viewpoint and revoking a hard pass in response to that is not viewpoint discrimination,\" Burnham said.\n\nKelly tried to press for details about how Acosta's pass came to be revoked, asking Burnham who made the actual decision.\n\nBurnham said he didn't have any information beyond what had been filed in court documents: that the revocation was first announced by Sanders on November 7 and then \"ratified\" by Trump the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any information to suggest that it was anyone other than Ms. Sanders that made the decision?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\"No, not that I'm offering today. I'm not denying it but I don't know anything beyond what's been filed,\" Burnham said.\n\nLater, Burnham argued that revoking Acosta's press pass does not infringe on his First Amendment rights because he can still call White House staffers for interviews or \"catch them on their way out\" of the building.\n\n\"I think the harm to the network is very small,\" Burnham said.\n\n\"Their cameras are still in there,\" he added.\n\nBurnham said CNN had made an \"odd First Amendment injury\" claim and suggested that Acosta could do his job \"just as effectively\" watching the President's appearances piped into a studio on CNN.\n\n\"The President never has to speak to Mr. Acosta again,\" Burnham said. \"The President never has to give an interview to Mr. Acosta. And the President never has to call on Mr. Acosta at a press conference.\"\n\n\"To be in a room where he has no right to speak... this seems to me like an odd First Amendment injury that we're talking about,\" Burnham said.\n\nBoutrous, the CNN attorney, fired back on rebuttal.\n\n\"That's not how reporters break stories. It's simply a fundamental misconception of journalism,\" Boutrous said, adding how unscheduled gaggles and source meetings throughout the White House amounted to \"invaluable access.\"\n\nIn a legal filing by the Justice Department on Wednesday, the White House asserted that it has \"broad discretion\" to pick and choose which journalists are given a permanent pass to cover it.\n\nThat position is a sharp break with decades of tradition. Historically both Republican and Democratic administrations have had a permissive approach to press access, providing credentials both to big news organizations like CNN and obscure and fringe outlets.\n\nAcosta's suspension -\u2014 which took effect one week ago \u2014 is an unprecedented step. Journalism advocates say it could have a chilling effect on news coverage.\n\nCNN and Acosta's lawsuit was filed on Tuesday morning, nearly one week after Acosta was banned.\n\nBefore the hearing began, CNN's lawyers said the case hinges on Acosta and CNN's First Amendment rights; the shifting rationales behind the ban; and the administration's failure to follow the federal regulations that pertain to press passes, an alleged violation of Fifth Amendment rights. The lawsuit asserts that this ban is really about Trump's dislike of Acosta.\n\nThe \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\" CNN's lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn addition to the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that CNN is seeking at the hearing, CNN and Acosta are also seeking what's known as \"permanent relief.\" The lawsuit asks the judge to determine that Trump's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" This could protect other reporters against similar actions in the future.\n\n\"If the press is not free to cover the news because its reporter is unjustly denied access, it is not free,\" former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson said in a declaration supporting CNN that was filed with the court on Tuesday. \"And if denying access to a reporter an organization has chosen to represent it -- in effect asserting the president's right to take that choice away from a news organization and make it himself -- is permitted, then the press is not free.\"\n\nTed Olson, a Republican heavyweight who successfully argued for George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, is representing CNN, along with Boutrous \u2014 himself another prominent attorney \u2014 and the network's chief counsel, David Vigilante.\n\nOlson said Tuesday that while it was Acosta whose press pass was suspended this time, \"this could happen to any journalist by any politician.\"\n\nHe spoke forcefully against Trump's action. \"The White House cannot get away with this,\" Olson said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "McCarthy: Will work across aisle", "description": "Rep.

Jeb Bush, who first appointed Snipes to the post, called for her to step down on Monday. Gov. Rick Scott, whose Senate race is central to the recount, sued her and has used her as a foil for days. And dozens of Trump supporters protested outside of Snipes' office in Broward County, some holding signs labeling her the \"Supervisor of Corruption.\"\n\nSnipes has kept a low profile through much of it, but even Democrats in Florida admit the criticism is not entirely without reason: Broward County's elections office has been hampered by controversies for years and Snipes has been plagued by questions of bias for much of her tenure.\n\nSnipes hinted Tuesday that she may not be in the job very long, saying it was \"hard to rule out race\" as a factor in the criticism being lobbed at her.\n\n\"It is time to move on, to let someone else\" do the job, Snipes said.

Pero no es probable que el derroche vaya a acabar muy pronto.\n\nEl Banco de Jap\u00f3n ha acumulado la mayor parte de las enormes reservas de activos desde que su gobernador, Haruhiko Kuroda, se embarc\u00f3 en un plan sin precedentes en 2013 para comprar una gran cantidad de bonos del gobierno. La meta era bajar las tasas de inter\u00e9s, animando a los consumidores y a los negocios a gastar m\u00e1s dinero.\n\nLa medida fue similar a los extraordinarios programas de alivio monetario que lanzaron Estados Unidos y Europa despu\u00e9s de la crisis financiera global. Pero el de Jap\u00f3n es mucho m\u00e1s grande en escala en relaci\u00f3n al tama\u00f1o de su econom\u00eda.\n\nLos bienes de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos est\u00e1n en cerca de un quinto del tama\u00f1o del PIB de Estados Unidos, y los del Banco Central Europeo est\u00e1n en cerca del 40% de la econom\u00eda de la eurozona.\n\nLa Reserva Federal anunci\u00f3 el cese del gasto de bonos en 2014 y est\u00e1 ahora aumentando las tasas de intereses y el Banco Central Europeo para su programa el pr\u00f3ximo mes. Pero el exceso del Banco de Jap\u00f3n parece no tener un final a la vista.\n\nResultados mezclados\n\nJap\u00f3n disfrut\u00f3 recientemente de su racha m\u00e1s larga de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico en d\u00e9cadas, pero la econom\u00eda ha empezado a balbucear este a\u00f1o. Se encogi\u00f3 a un \u00edndice anual de 1,2% en el tercer trimestre, seg\u00fan informaci\u00f3n del gobierno publicada el mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nA pesar de las compras masivas de activos del banco central y otras pol\u00edticas inusuales como tasas de inter\u00e9s negativas, la inflaci\u00f3n se ha mantenido obstinadamente por debajo del objetivo del banco de 2%. Kuroda ha dicho que el banco no considerar\u00e1 finalizar el esfuerzo de los est\u00edmulos prolongados hasta que se alcance la meta.\n\nEstrategia riesgosa\n\nPero esa puede ser una tarea imposible, y continuar el programa de est\u00edmulos de manera indefinida puede tener riesgos significativos.\n\n\u201cHay l\u00edmites sobre cu\u00e1ntos activos puede comprar el Banco de Jap\u00f3n\u201d, dijo Marcel Thieliant, un economista de la firma de investigaci\u00f3n japonesa Capital Economics, debido a la gran cantidad de que sus activos est\u00e1n en bonos del gobierno japon\u00e9s, de los cuales hay una oferta limitada.\n\nEste ya ha disminuido \u201csignificativamente\u201d las compras de bienes y al parecer continuar\u00e1 haci\u00e9ndolo, seg\u00fan Thieliant. No es porque el plan est\u00e9 teniendo \u00e9xito, dice \u00e9l, sino porque funcionarios del banco central est\u00e1n preocupados porque sus pol\u00edticas est\u00e9n haciendo que los bancos comerciales tengan ganancias. Las tasas de inter\u00e9s negativas han reducido sus m\u00e1rgenes, y las enormes compras de activos han matado efectivamente las operaciones regulares en el mercado de bonos, que alguna vez fue lucrativo.\n\nLa pol\u00edtica monetaria ultra flexible del Banco de Jap\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n lo deja con poco poder para ayudar a apuntalar la econom\u00eda en caso de otra gran crisis."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Zachary Cohen, CNN", "title": "Mattis fills void left by Trump's silence on military's border mission", "description": "While President Donald Trump has been relatively silent on the threat posed by what he had termed an \"invasion\" of migrants heading toward the southern border prior to the midterm elections, Defense Secretary James Mattis traveled to Texas on Wednesday with a\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/mattis-nielsen-texas-border-trip/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181104153810-troops-us-mexico-border-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:19:18Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) While President Donald Trump has been relatively silent on the threat posed by what he had termed an \"invasion\" of migrants heading toward the southern border prior to the midterm elections, Defense Secretary James Mattis traveled to Texas on\u2026 [+5176 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) While President Donald Trump has been relatively silent on the threat posed by what he had termed an \"invasion\" of migrants heading toward the southern border prior to the midterm elections, Defense Secretary James Mattis traveled to Texas on Wednesday with a simple message for US troops deployed to the area: Ignore the news and focus on the mission at hand.\n\nHe also made it clear that their mission will not involve fending off a hoard of dangerous migrants as Trump insisted in his pre-election rhetoric.\n\nAccompanied by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Mattis appeared to take the lead when addressing troops at Donna Base Camp, using the opportunity to encourage those present to block out any outside noise related to politics, and he emphasized the importance of serving as \"confidence builders\" for Border Patrol officers.\n\n\"Now, there's all sorts of stuff in the news, and that sort of thing. You just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander tells you. Because if you read all that stuff, you know, you'll go nuts,\" Mattis said. \"You know what your mission is here. You've had to deploy on short notice to a nontraditional location and do your jobs. So you focus on doing that.\"\n\n\"We were asked by the secretary, due to the number of people coming this way, to back them up. What does that mean? It means that her people do all the work, but we're standing behind them as a confidence builder,\" he added, referring to the request from the Department of Homeland Security to provide support.\n\nWhile touring the base camp, Mattis and Nielsen saw the living conditions of the troops and were given a briefing on the camp's laundry service.\n\nThey also spoke to several service members about their deployment experience thus far, including one woman who told Mattis that her husband was serving overseas and their young child was being cared for by the grandparents.\n\nA stark contrast\n\nThe visit by Mattis and Nielsen stands in stark contrast to Trump's relative silence in recent days on the migrants traveling to the US from Central America, after characterizing their approach as an \"invasion\" prior to the midterm elections.\n\nSince November 6, Election Day, Trump hasn't mentioned the so-called caravan in a tweet. He has used the word \"border\" a single time -- in a tweet on Friday in which he included a link to a \"Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States\" that said, essentially, that he was trying to push people entering the country illegally to specified ports of entry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mattis sought to distance the US military from the criticism that the President used the deployment to rev up his base prior to the election, emphasizing that the border mission is not unique in a historical context.\n\n\"There's nothing new under the sun,\" he said.\n\n\"I think many of you are aware that President Wilson 100 years ago, a little over a 100 years ago, deployed the US Army to the Southwest border. That's over a century ago. The threat then was Pancho Villa's troops, a revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States, New Mexico, in 1916 and there's a more recent history of DoD support on the border: It spans four administrations and both political parties,\" Mattis added.\n\nHe defended the legitimacy of the mission, particularly the task of backing up Border Patrol officers ahead of the migrants' arrival.\n\n\"We determined the missions as absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" Mattis told reporters prior to visiting the base camp.\n\nWhile the troops in Texas have largely been tasked with reinforcing border crossing points, largely with concertina wire, Mattis suggested that the deployment serves as a valuable training opportunity.\n\nWhen one service member said they were planning a field exercise when they got the call to deploy to the border, Mattis laughed before saying: \"We just gave you the best field training exercise possible.\"\n\nBut when asked about the long and short term plans for the operation, Mattis was able to offer few details.\n\n\"Short term right now, get the obstacles in so that the border patrolmen can do what they've got to do ... longer term, it's somewhat to be determined,\" he said before encouraging troops to \"keep the faith in each other, listen to your NCOs and you do what your officers tell you.\"\n\nNielsen under fire\n\nWhile Mattis repeatedly made clear that the border operation is being led by DHS, Nielsen, for the most part, appeared to take on a secondary role as the two Cabinet secretaries toured the base camp and engaged with troops, seeming to take her cues from Mattis before chiming in.\n\nWhen she did speak, Nielsen focused her on thanking the troops for their service and partnership in the border operation.\n\n\"We thank you for your partnership always. We greatly, greatly appreciate it,\" she said. \"We are right there with you, we know you're with us and we greatly appreciate it. So thank you, each and every one of you.\"\n\nNielsen's trip to the border comes amid indications that she could potentially be out of a job soon.\n\nTrump could ask Nielsen to resign in the coming days, multiple officials familiar with the matter predicted, describing the President's continued frustration at her handling of his signature issue: immigration and border security.\n\nMattis has faced a steady wave of rumors in recent months suggesting he too could be replaced but his name has not been mentioned lately as reports circulate that the President has been eyeing potential replacements for several senior positions in his administration -- both inside the West Wing and across the Cabinet."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AngelaBonachera", "title": "Im\u00e1genes de antes y despu\u00e9s muestran c\u00f3mo Paradise, en California, qued\u00f3 reducido a cenizas", "description": "42 personas han muerto y m\u00e1s de 6.500 casas se han incendiado.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/14/imagenes-de-antes-y-despues-muestran-como-paradise-en-california-quedo-reducido-a-cenizas/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/181113135029-11-before-and-after-images-paradise-california-cypress-meadows-super-169.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:10:14Z", "content": "(CNN) - Las im\u00e1genes de antes y despu\u00e9s ayudan a mostrar la devastaci\u00f3n que el incendio Camp tuvo en Paradise, California.

Sanders critic\u00f3 a Acosta por, seg\u00fan ella, actuar de manera poco profesional y acaparar el micr\u00f3fono en la conferencia de prensa la semana pasada. Pero ella no se refiri\u00f3 a los problemas legales que se nombran en la demanda de CNN.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 en la conferencia de prensa?\n\nAcosta es uno de los reporteros m\u00e1s agresivos en criticar a Trump, algo que ha hecho que gane tantos fan\u00e1ticos as\u00ed como cr\u00edticos. Trump le llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n durante la conferencia de prensa del 7 de noviembre. Ambos se enfrentaron por la ret\u00f3rica de Trump sobre la migraci\u00f3n, y luego Acosta trat\u00f3 de cambiar el tema y hacerle una tercera pregunta sobre la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial Robert Mueller. Cuando el presidente le dio la palabra a otro reportero, una becaria de la Casa Blanca fue a tomar el micr\u00f3fono que Acosta ten\u00eda, pero Acosta se rehus\u00f3 a entregarlo inmediatamente. \u00c9l hizo su pregunta y luego le dio el micr\u00f3fono a la becaria.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 dijo la Casa Blanca originalmente?\n\nEn un comunicado anunciando la suspensi\u00f3n del pase de prensa de Acosta, Sanders dijo que el gobierno \u201cnunca tolerar\u00e1 que un reportero ponga sus manos sobre una joven que solo trata de hacer su trabajo como becaria de la Casa Blanca\u201d. Pero el video del evento muestra que Acosta no la maltrat\u00f3. \u00c9l dijo incluso \u201cperd\u00f3n, se\u00f1ora\u201d, cuando la joven fue por el micr\u00f3fono.\n\nPara apoyar su razonamiento, Sanders tuite\u00f3 un video distorsionado de la conferencia de prensa que no muestra la situaci\u00f3n completa. El mismo video fue publicado por una personalidad de InfoWars dos horas despu\u00e9s. InfoWars es medio de comunicaci\u00f3n radical de extrema derecha con una historia de publicar contenido lleno de odio y teor\u00edas de la conspiraci\u00f3n.\n\nDos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, el propio Trump dud\u00f3 del razonamiento de Sanders: \u00e9l dijo que Acosta \u201cno fue amable con esa joven\u201d, pero, \u201cno lo suspendo porque haya sido excesivo, ya saben, horrible\u201d. Luego sigui\u00f3 quej\u00e1ndose sobre el comportamiento de Acosta en general.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo ha cambiado el razonamiento de la Casa Blanca?\n\nSanders ya no dice que Acosta puso sus manos sobre la becaria. En un comunicado del martes, la secretaria de Prensa dijo que \u201cf\u00edsicamente se rehus\u00f3 a entregar\u201d el micr\u00f3fono. Por supuesto, los reporteros frecuentemente tratan de hacer preguntas de seguimiento en ruedas de prensa.\n\nSanders continu\u00f3 diciendo que \u201cesta no es la primera vez que este reportero se ha rehusado inapropiadamente a ceder a otros reporteros\u201d. Y agreg\u00f3: \u201cSi no hay control de este tipo de comportamientos, esto impide la habilidad del presidente, del personal de la Casa Blanca, y miembros de los medios, llevar a cabo su trabajo\u201d.\n\nEste es, aparentemente, un nuevo razonamiento de por qu\u00e9 le revocaron el pase de prensa a Acosta.\n\nMira en este video: \"No sea grosero\", Trump manda callar a periodista de CNN\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 dicen los abogados de CNN?\n\n\u201cLos periodistas no pueden ser silenciados, censurados o intimidados. As\u00ed es. La Casa Blanca no puede salirse con la suya\u201d, dijo Olson en una entrevista este martes.\n\nOlson y otros consejero externo de CNN, Theodore Boutrous, dijo que ellos creen que CNN tiene un caso muy fuerte. Los abogados de la industria concuerdan. George Freeman, jefe del Media Law Resource Center, dijo que \u201cla retaliaci\u00f3n del presidente contra Acosta no fue por una raz\u00f3n apropiada, por no hablar de una raz\u00f3n convincente requerida constitucionalmente\u201d.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo aplica a este caso la Primera Enmienda?\n\nLa demanda de CNN dice que \u201cla deducci\u00f3n razonable de la conducta de los acusados es que han revocado las credenciales de Acosta como una forma de discriminaci\u00f3n basada en el punto de vista y en represalia por el ejercicio de la actividad protegida de la Primera Enmienda por parte de los demandantes\".\n\nSeg\u00fan el analista legal de CNN Paul Callan, \u201cla Primera Enmienda es muy clara en esto, que la prensa tiene el derecho legal de reportar y expresar las opiniones sobre la conducta del presidente\u201d.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 piden CNN y Acosta?\n\nUna soluci\u00f3n tanto a corto como a lago plazo. Inmediatamente CNN quiere que un juez emita una orden de restricci\u00f3n temporal y un requerimiento para que el acceso de Acosta a la Casa Blanca sea restaurado.\n\nLa cadena tambi\u00e9n quiere que un juez falle que la acci\u00f3n la Casa Blanca fue inconstitucional y que no puede volver a pasar.\n\n\u201cUna restricci\u00f3n temporal es una medida a corto plazo que tendr\u00e1 efecto hasta que, por ejemplo, un requerimiento preliminar sea emitido\u201d, dijo Jonathan Peters, profesor de leyes en la Universidad de Georgia.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con los otros reporteros de CNN?\n\nLa suspensi\u00f3n solo aplica a Acosta. Todos los dem\u00e1s reporteros de CNN, productores y fotoperiodistas asignados a cubrir la Casa Blanca siguen trabajado desde sus lugares asignados.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo fallar\u00e1 el juez de este caso?\n\nEl juez Timothy J. Kelly, asignado por Trump, tomar\u00e1 el caso. Este mi\u00e9rcoles se har\u00e1 una audiencia sobre la orden de restricci\u00f3n temporal en horas de la tarde.

Clara Hendrickson is a research analyst in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nMore than a year ago, the leaders of scores of up-and-coming cities across America's Heartland entered Amazon's HQ2 contest, embracing the idea that the e-commerce giant might choose a mid-size city or metropolis in the Rust Belt, like Detroit or Columbus, for its second headquarters location.\n\nAlas, we all should have known better. On Tuesday, Amazon officially announced its decision to split its award of 50,000 headquarters jobs \u2014 not to one up-and-coming city in the Midwest \u2014 but between Long Island City in Queens, New York and Crystal City, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. (The company also plans to create around 5,000 jobs in Nashville.)\n\nSo much for the Rust Belt uplift story, one that might help knit a divided country together through mid-market, Midwestern economic development.\n\nWhich raises the real story here: Amazon's decision to invest heavily in two preexisting \"superstar\" cities perfectly epitomizes one of the most troubling aspects of digital economies: their strong tendency to concentrate people and investment in a very few well-educated, tech-rich hubs that have, in recent decades, continued to pull away from the rest of the country on basic measures of prosperity.\n\nScholars for years have suspected that tech might alter the hierarchy of cities. Economist Elisa Giannone recently found that beginning in the 1980s the wages of cities \u2014 after converging for generations \u2014 had begun to diverge as tech began to inordinately reward dense clusters of highly skilled workers and firms. Likewise, research at Brookings has shown that a short list of highly digital, often coastal, tech hubs are pulling farther away from the pack on measures of growth and income, concentrating more of the nation's tech activity and talent.\n\nIn short, the \"digitalization of everything\" is exacerbating the unevenness of America's economic landscape and making it increasingly likely that new tech headquarters go not to new places, but to the same places. What just happened proves the point.\n\nThis matters because the widening gap between \"superstar\" cities and the places left behind by economic transformation is creating a troubling panorama of untapped potential and frustration. On the one hand, the drift of scores of promising cities filled with talented people, outstanding institutions and underutilized infrastructure mean that America is not fully delivering on its promise for economic fulfillment. On the other hand, whole swaths of the country that have fallen behind in a changing economy are marked by political discontent that has contributed to the nation's populist backlash and widening social divides.\n\nThe nation as a whole will need to push back against today's widening regional gaps with specific, intentional action.\n\nWhat might such action look like? For starters, it might begin by implementing policies that limit the kind of locational sweepstakes that impelled hundreds of places to ante up billions of collective dollars of business relocation subsidies in order to attract Amazon. One idea we endorse in a forthcoming paper is a 100% federal tax on every dollar in state and local tax incentives directed toward a specific company.\n\nAt the same time, local governments \u2014 ideally supported by Congress \u2014 should also take this moment to double down on focused initiatives that emphasize training workers with digital skills, while venture capitalists should ensure more local startups outside the coasts have access to the capital they need to grow. The federal government, for its part, should get serious about helping the Heartland and offer grants to 10 or so competitively selected, mid-sized business centers that show promise of emerging as regional \"growth poles\" that will ensure more people reside near top-quality jobs and opportunity.\n\nTo be sure, such an agenda would be an undeniably heavy lift for today's divided Congress. And yet, for all that, a growing chorus of policymakers and thought-leaders is increasingly calling for such action.\n\nIndeed, even those who see the concentration of economic activity in cities like San Francisco, Boston and New York as a good thing for the national economy may soon find themselves calling for a more geographically balanced national economy. After all, concentrating economic growth in just a few prosperous cities works as a national growth stance only up to a point. Eventually, even today's winners will be left to grapple with the side effects, like traffic congestion and expensive housing, while others will continue to struggle with too little growth and hope.\n\nMany hoped that Amazon would bring economic opportunity to the places left behind in the shift from a manufacturing economy to a tech economy. Now that it's clear that will not likely happen by itself, it is time for policymakers and concerned citizens to ensure that the current market forces don't deepen the economic and political divides between the places that have benefitted from the tech revolution and those it has left behind."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN Business", "title": "Bloomingdale's wants to sell fridges and TVs.

It posted $3.9 billion in losses since then and has been closing stores in an an attempt to stanch the bleeding. And like Sears, it has run up debt while its credit rating has sunk deep into junk territory.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting another money losing quarter when the company reports earnings on Thursday.\n\nThat's not a surprise. Analysts expect losses to go on for years.\n\nThe company's executive turmoil, along with inventory and supply chain struggles, have raised concerns by outside observers.\n\nJCPenney ( JCP ) is in a quiet period ahead of Thursday's quarterly report and not able to comment for this story.\n\nDespite its problems, some opportunities could keep JCPenney out of bankruptcy court for a while, at least.\n\nBecause its near-term debt payments are relatively modest -- about $50 million is due next year, and $100 million in 2020 -- it has some time.\n\nBut not much. An estimated $2.1 billion in payments comes due in 2023, and that has credit rating agencies and analysts worried.\n\nIt also could benefit from Sears' demise\n\nAn analysis by Cowen and Co. found that 56% of Sears shoppers also shop at JCPenney, the highest overlap of any of the traditional department store chains.\n\nThe shoppers share similar demographics, according to research by Coresight Research and Cowen. For example, the average age of a Sears shopper was nearly 50, according to Coresight. At Penney, it's just over 48.\n\nSears will be closing hundreds of stores and its customers will be looking for places to shop.\n\nSo some experts say there's still a chance that JCPenney can avoid bankruptcy. They point to department store chains like Macy's ( M ) and Kohl's ( KSS ) which have been able to turn around and become profitable, despite changing shoppers' tastes.

Pero debido al gran alboroto medi\u00e1tico, los funcionarios de Colombia y Cartagena ten\u00edan problemas con que el evento mostrara a Cartagena como una ciudad de prostituci\u00f3n\u201d, le dijo el representante de Sex Island a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol a trav\u00e9s de un mensaje de texto.\n\n\u201cAs\u00ed que nos movimos a otra isla de nuestra propiedad que est\u00e1 en el Caribe\u201d, dijo el portavoz de la fiesta.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol se ha intentado comunicar con la Alcald\u00eda de Cartagena para obtener un comentario al respecto, pero no ha recibido una respuesta hasta el momento.\n\nA mediados de octubre, el alcalde de Cartagena (e) Pedrito Pereira protest\u00f3 contra este evento y dijo que este promov\u00eda \u201cel turismo sexual\" en la ciudad por lo que asegur\u00f3 enviar\u00eda una nota formal a la Fiscal\u00eda para que investigara los hechos.\n\nY por esa amenaza los organizadores decidieron cambiar el lugar la fiesta.\n\n\u201cEntonces, \u00bfcambiaron el evento de lugar a otro pa\u00eds debido a las amenazas de las autoridades colombianas por investigarlos?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 CNN.\n\n\u201cS\u00ed. Es correcto\u201d, respondi\u00f3 el portavoz de la fiesta.\n\nExplotaci\u00f3n sexual y trata de personas\n\nEl evento que se promociona es una fiesta privada en la que se permite el consumo de drogas y alcohol ilimitado e invita a los asistentes a tener \u201csexo ilimitado\u201d con al menos 100 mujeres. Este es uno de los cambios que se hace el nuevo evento, pues hace unos meses hab\u00eda cupo para 30 invitados y participaban 60 mujeres.\n\n\"No vendemos drogas a nuestros clientes\", dijo el portavoz del evento. \"Pero si ellos usan drogas en nuestros eventos, no tenemos problema\".\n\nPero la fiesta, que ya hab\u00eda causado pol\u00e9mica en 2017, prendi\u00f3 las alarmas de las autoridades de Cartagena, una ciudad azotada por la prostituci\u00f3n.\n\nEl alcalde Pereira dijo el mes pasado que este evento, adem\u00e1s, promov\u00eda el abuso y la explotaci\u00f3n sexual. La corporaci\u00f3n de Turismo de Cartagena tambi\u00e9n acuso a los organizadores de promover la trata de personas.\n\nSobre esto, el portavoz de Sex Island dijo que este evento s\u00ed promueve el turismo sexual, pero neg\u00f3 las acusaciones sobre abuso y explotaci\u00f3n sexual y sobre trata de personas.\n\n\u201cTurismo sexual, s\u00ed\u201d, respondi\u00f3 el portavoz. \u201c[Promovemos] el sexo con protecci\u00f3n entre hombres y mujeres en una ubicaci\u00f3n segura, con todas las partes dispuestas, a cambio de dinero\u201d.\n\nY a\u00f1adi\u00f3:\n\n\u201cTr\u00e1fico humano y explotaci\u00f3n sexual, NO\u201d. Todas nuestras chicas est\u00e1n dispuestas y son mayores de 18 a\u00f1os\u201d, agreg\u00f3.\n\nAlgunos cambios en el evento\n\nA mediados de octubre, cuando se desat\u00f3 la pol\u00e9mica, los organizadores dec\u00edan que la fiesta se llevar\u00eda a cabo en Cartagena, Colombia con 30 hombres que pod\u00edan estar con 60 mujeres en una isla privada.\n\nEn un video promocional se ve\u00eda a un turista llegando al aeropuerto internacional de Cartagena, y la fiesta se promocionaba con mujeres colombianas. Ahora las cuentas de Twitter y Facebook fueron borradas, y en Instagram solamente hay publicadas algunas im\u00e1genes que no hacen referencia ni a Cartagena ni a Colombia, como en el pasado, pero s\u00ed al Caribe.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 ocurre en Cartagena con el turismo sexual?\n\nCartagena es una ciudad azotada por la explotaci\u00f3n sexual, de ah\u00ed que las autoridades hayan rechazado enf\u00e1ticamente la realizaci\u00f3n de estas fiestas.\n\nRecientemente en la ciudad, que es uno de los principales destinos tur\u00edsticos del pa\u00eds, se llevaron a cabo una serie de redadas para desmantelar redes de prostituci\u00f3n y trata de personas.\n\nCon la Operaci\u00f3n Vesta, que se llev\u00f3 a cabo hacia finales de julio de 2018, las autoridades develaron la existencia de varias redes y formas de explotaci\u00f3n sexual comercial de ni\u00f1as y adolescentes en esta ciudad.\n\nEn agosto, en el desarrollo de esa misma operaci\u00f3n, 49 mujeres fueron halladas en s\u00f3tanos, y seg\u00fan la Fiscal\u00eda, hab\u00edan estado siendo sometidas a tratos crueles y obligadas a ofrecer servicios sexuales en Cartagena.\n\nEsas mujeres eran manejadas por una \u201cpresunta organizaci\u00f3n de proxenetismo que las manten\u00eda en hospedajes ubicados en s\u00f3tanos y precarias condiciones\u201d, seg\u00fan la Fiscal\u00eda."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn",

That's probably a stretch. But Wall Street clearly is getting more worried about the company's reliance on the iPhone to generate sales and profit at a time when demand for the newer phones appears to be subpar.\n\nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) fell 3% Wednesday and that was one of the big reasons why the Dow , which includes Apple, lost more than 200 points. Apple's stock even dipped into bear market territory, meaning it was down 20% from its all-time high.\n\nIt was the fourth straight drop for the Dow, which actually opened the day with a more than 100-point gain after the US government reported that the latest figures for consumer prices were in line with expectations -- a sign that inflation remains mostly in check.\n\nThe other big tech stocks in the Dow -- Microsoft ( MSFT ), IBM ( IBM ), Intel ( INTC ) and Cisco ( CSCO ) -- were all lower too.\n\nThe Dow briefly bounced off its lows after UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her cabinet had agreed to a Brexit deal\n\nBut the broader market was also hurt by a slide in bank stocks after Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters, who is expected to take over the House Financial Services Committee in January, said in a House hearing Wednesday that the days of more lax regulations for banks \"will come to an end.\"\n\nStill, all eyes were mostly on Apple, which fell for a fifth consecutive day.\n\nThe reason for Apple's latest slide? Several companies that produce chips and other components used in iPhones have all issued gloomy forecasts recently, citing sluggish demand for higher-end smartphones.\n\nAlthough none of these companies, which include Qorvo ( QRVO ), Lumentum ( LITE ), Japan Display and IQE, have named Apple as the source of their woes, they are all Apple suppliers.\n\nBut it may not be time to throw in the towel on Apple just yet, even though some analysts are cutting their price targets and earnings estimates due to concerns about soft sales for the newer iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.\n\nApple's stock is still up more than 10% this year, making it one of the better performers in the Dow. The company is still worth nearly $900 billion. It remains the most valuable company in the world.\n\nApple also continues to pay a solid dividend that yields 1.5% -- and the company is likely to keep raising its dividend thanks to its cash stockpile of $237.1 billion.\n\nWhat's more, Apple's earnings are expected to increase by more than 13% this fiscal year and keep growing at about a 12% clip annually, on average, for the next few years.\n\nSo predictions of an Apple iPocalypse, if you will, may be premature. There are other legitimate worries for Apple though.\n\nUBS analyst Tim Arcuri cut his price target on Apple Wednesday. He wrote in a report that the stronger dollar could be hurting iPhone sales in China since currency fluctuations make the already expensive iPhones even pricier in China.\n\nAnd it does seem like the company needs a new product to get consumers and investors excited again.\n\nPerhaps Apple needs to take a cue from the movie \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and release a new iPhone that goes to eleven. But would it be the iPhone 11 or iPhone XI?"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "nshalalda", "title": "\u062a\u0648\u0642\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062a\u0647\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u062a\u0644 8 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629", "description": "\u0623\u0648\u0642\u0641\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u0629 \u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0642\u062a\u0644 8 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0642\u0639\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0645 2016 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0648.", "url": "https://arabic.cnn.com/world/video/2018/11/14/v68114-rhoden-wagner-ohio-family-murder-arrest-orig-js", "urlToImage": "https://static.arabic.cnn.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2018/11/14/images/181114110432-wagner-family-murder.jpg?itok=GZghL4ze", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:21:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "02:33\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \"\u0644\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\" \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629.. \u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a\u061f"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chloe Melas, CNN", "title": "Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham expecting first child", "description": "\"Bachelor\" stars Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham have a baby on the way.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/entertainment/arie-luyendyk-jr-lauren-burnham-baby/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114111243-arie-luyendk-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:16:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) \"Bachelor\" stars Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham have a baby on the way.\n\nThe couple confirmed the news on Wednesday via Instagram.\n\nLuyendyk Jr. and Burnham shared a sonogram image he captioned: \"Nothing compares, absolutely nothing compares to the moment you find out you're going to be a dad!

Esto podr\u00eda proteger a otros reporteros contra acciones similares en el futuro.\n\nLa presentaci\u00f3n del gobierno cita un tuit de la secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Sanders, en el que anunci\u00f3 la suspensi\u00f3n del pase de Acosta y dijo que su \"conducta es absolutamente inaceptable\".\n\nMIRA: La Casa Blanca de Trump suspende pase de prensa del reportero de CNN Jim Acosta\n\nLa \"conducta\" mencionada por Sanders en el tuit que los abogados del gobierno citan en realidad se refiere a un argumento falso y desde entonces abandonado que Sanders hab\u00eda presentado despu\u00e9s de la conferencia de prensa: que Acosta estaba \"poniendo sus manos sobre una mujer joven que estaba tratando de hacer su trabajo como pasante de la Casa Blanca \".\n\nLa administraci\u00f3n se ha apartado de ese argumento en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas y no aparece en el primer comentario legal del gobierno sobre el caso el mi\u00e9rcoles.

At 77, Simon has a strong claim to be America's greatest living songwriter, with an award-winning career spanning seven decades -- first as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, then as a genre-defying solo artist.\n\nArt Garfunkel, left, with Paul Simon, around 1957. They were known at the time as \"Tom and Jerry.\"\n\nBut now, Simon has decided to stop. It's not quite retirement, but it comes close. In September, his final tour concluded in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, near where he grew up in Queens, New York. But as he explained to Christiane Amanpour for her show on CNN International and PBS, this isn't a final goodbye.\n\n'Good' songs, 'overlooked'\n\n\"I don't intend for it to be my last performance,\" he said at his office in New York -- just his last tour.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch part 2 of Amanpour's interview with Paul Simon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch part 2 of Amanpour's interview with Paul Simon 10:48\n\n\"I'd like to do it for my own pleasure, in concert halls that have prestige sound and with perhaps different musicians that I admire, and play a repertoire that is different from what I've been playing.\"\n\nIt's a repertoire, he pointed out, that includes songs he's been playing for decades.\n\nAnd what songs. With \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"Graceland,\" Simon has provided something of a soundtrack to the American experience.\n\nWith his most recent and possibly last album, \"In the Blue Light,\" he has dusted off some of his back catalog, rearranging and revising some of his favorite songs.\n\n\"These are songs that I thought were well written -- good songs that were overlooked, or people didn't notice them when I put them out,\" he said.\n\nPaul Simon performing in London, around 1980.\n\nIf this indeed proves to be his last album, Simon considers that very much his own choice.\n\n\"It's not like I couldn't do another album now at the same qualitative level as I've done the last two or three albums -- which I think are as good as I can do, as I've ever been. I think I could do that, but I'm not sure that's the most interesting choice for me.\"\n\nStill, he acknowledges that even if he wants to let go of songwriting, songwriting may not let go of him: \"I can't help but think music. It seems it's always there. I wake up with it.\"\n\nAt its best, songwriting for Simon comes close to a mystical experience. When he finished writing \"Bridge over Troubled Water,\" he recalled, he had to admit to himself: \"'That's better than I usually do.'\"\n\nSimon performing during the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\n\"Graceland,\" he said, also fell into that category, \"where you feel as if you are a conduit and the song is coming through you. You're shaping it, but you're absolutely surprised at what's happening, and you don't know why, and you don't know where it comes from.\n\n\"But I recognize that that happens sometimes, and it's led me to be a more spiritual person -- because of the mystery of it.\"\n\nHe has learned to accept that process for what it is.\n\n\"I'm holding back from going into solving these musical thoughts, as if they were puzzles that needed to be solved.\n\n\"Now I say, 'No, don't solve it that way. Just leave it alone. Let's just see what happens.' \"\n\nFrom 'Tom and Jerry' to Paul Simon\n\nIt was over half a century ago that he started performing with Art Garfunkel, originally under the stage name Tom & Jerry. It would become one of the most renowned musical pairings in history.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel perform during a reunion concert at London's Wembley Stadium in 1982.\n\nAs a solo artist over the decades, Simon has continually reinvented himself, using music as a tool of global exploration: South Africa for \"Graceland,\" Brazil for \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nBut he remains, at heart, a New Yorker. So much so that after 9/11, the city called on him numerous times to reflect New York's feelings in song; most memorably, Lorne Michaels asked Simon to open \"Saturday Night Live\" on September 29, 2001, the first episode of the show after the attacks.\n\nThe memory of that performance still moves him.\n\n\"What I remember most about that moment was coming from the dressing room to the studio, where my mind is -- as it usually is when I'm about to perform -- focused on what I am about to do.\n\n\"But I passed by these lines of firemen and policemen, and the reality of what had occurred and what the situation was. ... The context that I was performing in was very powerful. Very powerful. It took away from any sense that it was going to be a regular performance.\n\n\"It was very emotional. And it's seldom that I feel my heart pounding -- not really on any of those times in Central Park or in front of people. But that night, that night, and again on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 when I sang down at the World Trade Center in front of the families, that was also...\" He trails off and shakes his head.\n\nWith these performances, Simon has had to acknowledge that he inhabits a healing role for the city.\n\n\"I've come to realize that I have that capacity, yeah. I'm surprised. I didn't plan it -- I've observed it.\"\n\nGraceland\n\nSimon hasn't always been a healing figure. In particular, the release of 1986's \"Graceland\" was surrounded by controversy. Simon traveled to South Africa to record with black musicians at a time when the country was still under the apartheid regime, and he was subsequently accused by some artists of breaking the cultural boycott against the country. At the time, he met his critics head on, and more than 30 years later, his opinion hasn't changed.\n\n\"They were completely disingenuous about it,\" he said. \"First of all, we didn't break any boycott. There was no rule about recording with black South African musicians. In fact, the whole purpose of the boycott was the antithesis of what we did.\n\nSimon with the South African musician Joseph Shabalala, founder of the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, with whom Simon collaborated on \"Graceland.\"\n\n\"The musicians voted whether they wanted me to come or not. I didn't know that, but I found out later on that they had voted. And what they wanted to know, the musicians, was, 'How much are we going to be paid? And will we get credit?' So that was easy, you know. Of course they were going to get credit and royalties. And I paid them, at that time, what was -- I think it was triple scale of what you would be paid in New York. So I think it came out to be like maybe $600 for a three-hour session. They were making like $15 for a day. So everybody was perfectly happy.\"\n\nOne of the groups Simon worked most closely with on the album was Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose founder, Joseph Shabalala, embraced Simon both figuratively and literally -- the first time, he said, he had ever hugged a white man.\n\nIn the end, it's that message of unity that Simon hopes the album still carries: \"It's very hard to get the trust, but musicians will often bring it on a level that goes right to the heart. It's really true that music is the universal language. It's a clich\u00e9, but it happens to be true.\"\n\nLeaving a trail for environmentalists\n\nWhen it comes to finally making peace with his most famous musical partner, Garfunkel, Simon demurs: \"I don't know how to even approach that.\"\n\nHe mulls the question for a while.\n\n\"There's too much damage that was done. But, you know, it's like somebody that I've known since I'm 11, so I understand. I understand -- I think I understand why it happened, but I think it's best to stay away. Stay away just for safety's sake. And so I do.\"\n\nWithout a final reunion in the cards for this famous duo, and with Simon's touring career behind him, he is turning instead to more personal matters, including the cause that he cares about most: the environment.\n\nSimon, right, with Art Garfunkel, around 1965.\n\nDuring his penultimate tour, Simon gave the proceeds to the Half Earth Foundation, and in his final tour he donated money to a local charity or group in each city he played: \"A small amount, $25,000, as a thank you.\"\n\n\"I was going and trying to leave it as like a trail of breadcrumbs through the forest so that people, if they were following it, would join.\"\n\nIn fact, while he generally seems at peace with his life and his choices, Simon admits he feels tremendous guilt about the environmental mess that he is leaving his children and grandchildren.\n\nSo, what of his musical legacy? It's an inheritance he's more reluctant to assess.\n\n\"I don't believe in legacy,\" he told Amanpour. \"I don't believe that there's any importance to it.\n\n\"I've already left a great deal of my thinking. I just turned 77, so I've already left my thinking through these songs -- some of which are very, very well-known -- so it's good to stop and see what else will I think of. Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just take a rest.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Tami Luhby, CNN", "title": "Blue wave shrinks states' anti-Obamacare coalition", "description": "The coalition of Republican attorneys general hoping to bring down Obamacare is losing at least one member, thanks to last week's blue wave in state elections.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/obamacare-lawsuit/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113110113-01-josh-kaul-file-1113-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:41:05Z", "content": "New York (CNN Politics) The coalition of Republican attorneys general hoping to bring down Obamacare is losing at least one member, thanks to last week's blue wave in state elections.

Mexican border agents attempted to stop them at the Mexican border, but to no avail. The wall must be built. The wall will keep America safe and strong.\"\n\nThat's the sales pitch for a new toy -- a set of MAGA building blocks -- aimed at children ages 5 and up.\n\nThe toy is sold by Keep and Bear , a conservative apparel and gifts website that also sells Christmas cards featuring President Donald Trump in a Santa cap.\n\nThe set includes 100 building-block pieces and a Trump figurine wearing a Make America Great Again hard hat. The pieces snap together, allowing kids -- or their parents -- to build a section of a miniature border wall.\n\nThe President has trumpeted his promise of building a wall along the US southern border since the 2016 campaign. He has sought the billion-dollar structure to keep out \"dangerous drugs and criminals from pouring into our country.\"\n\nIn the three weeks before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump tweeted about the border more than 40 times, mostly referring to a \"caravan\" of migrants making its way north through Mexico towards the US. In late October, he sent more than 5,000 troops to the border to halt the migrants, although since the November 6 election, he has stopped tweeting about the issue.\n\nJust another toy?\n\nTo grown-ups, the MAGA building blocks may look like a political gimmick. Most kids, though, will see them as just another set of building bricks, said Richard Gottlieb, CEO and founder of Global Toy Experts.\n\n\"I wouldn't be concerned about it, it's just a novelty statement,\" he told CNN. \"I think it's mostly designed to appeal to adults who maybe feel they're making some kind of political statement.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Candidate teaches kid to 'build the wall' in new campaign ad Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Candidate teaches kid to 'build the wall' in new campaign ad 01:14\n\nThe set sells for $29.95 on the Keep and Bear website and begins shipping on November 23.\n\n\"We understand why they want to flee Honduras and live in and work in America,\" reads a description of the toy on the site. \"After all we are the greatest nation on Earth.\"\n\n\"This toy makes a great Christmas gift for your kids and grandkids!\"\n\nBut Gottlieb isn't so sure.\n\n\"I can't think of anything that would turn a child off more to that political position than building a wall,\" he said. \"It's the most boring play concept in the history of the world. It's just one-fourth of a house.\"\n\nFor kids, he said, there's no meaning behind the bricks.\n\n\"I think that whatever the toy is, we tend to, as adults, assert a meaning that children don't necessarily see. They just play.\"\n\nThe toy's political message will be lost on a young child, Gottlieb said.\n\n\"These are little bricks, construction pieces that are a part of every child's life,\" he said. \"If you're 5 years old, you may do it because Daddy wants you to, but I don't think it has a meaning.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Brian Stelter, CNN Business", "title": "Fox News and other outlets join fight over press access", "description": "More than a dozen news outlets -- from the Associated Press to USA Today, The Washington Post and Politico -- are filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN and Jim Acosta's lawsuit against President Trump and several top aides.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/media/cnn-lawsuit-support/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181107125055-17-trump-presser-1107-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:23:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) More than a dozen news outlets -- from the Associated Press to USA Today, The Washington Post and Politico -- are filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN and Jim Acosta's lawsuit against President Trump and several top aides.\n\nThe list represents most of the biggest news organizations in the United States.\n\nThe most notable name on the list is Fox News.

While food accounts for a large portion of the added sugar in our diet, many experts recommend cutting back on sugary beverages to reduce daily intake. Consumption of sugary drinks might lead to an estimated 184,000 adult deaths each year worldwide, according to research published in the journal Circulation , an update of a 2013 American Heart Association conference presentation . In the following slides, we compare the amount of sugar found in some of America's top-selling beverages -- according to Beverage Industry magazine's 2013 State of the Industry Report -- to the sugar found in common sugary snacks. Hide Caption 1 of 18\n\nPhotos: How much sugar is in that drink? Soda: Coca-Cola \u2013 A 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola Classic contains 65 grams of sugar, which is the same amount of sugar found in five Little Debbie Swiss Rolls. Hide Caption 2 of 18\n\nPhotos: How much sugar is in that drink? Soda: Pepsi \u2013 A 20-ounce bottle of Pepsi contains 69 grams of sugar.

Juice: Minute Maid 100% Apple Juice \u2013 This 15.2-ounce bottle contains 49 grams of sugar, which is about the amount of sugar in 10 Oreos. Sugar occurs naturally in fruit, but natural sugar isn't any different in chemical structure from what most people refer to as added sugar. The body processes both the same way. One benefit of eating whole fruit is the fiber that helps slow absorption; that fiber is generally lost in the juice-making process. Hide Caption 4 of 18\n\nPhotos: How much sugar is in that drink? Juice: SunnyD Original \u2013 A 16-ounce bottle of SunnyD Original contains 28 grams of sugar. Each these six Oreos contains about 4.6 grams of sugar.

Tea: Arizona Green Tea with Ginseng & Honey \u2013 A 23-ounce can of Arizona Green Tea contains 51 grams of sugar, which is about the same as can be found in 20 Hershey's Kisses. The World Health Organization recently proposed new guidelines that recommend consuming less than 5% of our total daily calories from added sugars. For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, 5% would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons. Hide Caption 6 of 18\n\nPhotos: How much sugar is in that drink? Tea: Lipton Lemon Iced Tea \u2013 There are 32 grams of sugar in this 20-ounce bottle of iced tea. Each of these 12 Hershey's Kisses contains approximately 2.5 grams of sugar.

This 16-ounce can of Red Bull has 52 grams of sugar. Red Bull and many of the companies in this gallery offer lower or no-sugar versions of their drinks. \"Nearly half -- 45% -- of all non-alcoholic beverages contain 0% (sugar),\" said Christopher Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association.

It was the largest US jackpot won by a single ticket and the nation's second-largest jackpot ever.\n\n\"They still have over 100 days to come forward,\" Holli Armstrong, a South Carolina Education Lottery spokeswoman, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThat's because the winner has 180 days from the draw date to claim the prize, she said. In doing so, the new billionaire could remain anonymous.\n\n\"The winner has an option on the claim form to check 'yes' or 'no' for publicity,\" Armstrong said. \"If the winner declines publicity, we respect their wishes and do not release their name.\"\n\nThough surprised that no one has shown yet up to claim the money, Armstrong said people often take their time to come forward.\n\n\"We don't speculate why they haven't come forward. The winner should know how they will handle the money accordingly, so is not uncommon they take their time to claim it,\" she said.\n\nAnd this will be a lot of money to handle. The winner can pick between a one-time cash option of $878 million, before taxes, or the full $1.5 billion, before taxes, paid in annuities over 29 years.\n\n\"We encourage the winner, whoever they are, to sign the back of their ticket, put it in a safe place and speak to someone they trust for guidance before claiming the money,\" Armstrong said.\n\nIt's very likely the person who won will come forward, she said. But if not, the money will go to a great cause.\n\n\"The funds are returned to the states that sell Mega Millions tickets,\" Armstrong said. \"In South Carolina, the unclaimed prize money goes into an unclaimed prize fund that supports education.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "s.zaghloul", "title": "\"\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0629

Mitch McConnell to serve as majority leader for the new Congress and selected Sen. John Thune to be the new whip, the second-ranking member of leadership, as well as adding a female member -- Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst -- in the No. 5 spot.\n\nErnst won the contest to become the vice chair of the Republican conference, becoming the first woman to be elected to the Senate GOP's leadership since 2009.\n\nThune, who was the No. 3 leader, takes over for Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, who held that post for three two-year terms and must step aside because of term limits imposed by Senate GOP rules.\n\nThe slight realignment of the leadership structure came a week after the midterm elections, when Republicans narrowly preserved their majority . Republicans held a 51-49 before the election and it may grow to 53-49 if they win a runoff in Mississippi and Gov. Rick Scott preserves his lead over Sen. Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent in Florida.\n\nOther Republicans in the leadership ranks moved up one spot too. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, took over from Thune as chair of the Republican conference. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri took Barrasso's old job as Policy Committee chair.\n\nSen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, was elected chair of the Senate Republican campaign operation, the National Republican Senate Committee.\n\n\"Sen. Young understands how to win difficult Senate races in a presidential election year,\" said John Ashbrook, a Republican strategist close to McConnell. \"He did it in Indiana and his colleagues seem to like the idea of putting a Marine on the job for them in 2020.\"\n\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley will become the Senate president pro tempore, the longest-serving member in the majority, when Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch retires in January. In this new role, Grassley will be in the presidential line of succession. The position is third in line following the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nMcConnell held a photo-op with new members of the GOP conference and expressed gratitude Republicans held the majority.\n\n\"I've been through a few of these over the years,\" he told reporters. \"It's a lot better to have a big freshman class than not. We're here this morning to welcome our six new Republican senators who will allow us to continue our majority.\"\n\nScott was in the photo-op even though his race hasn't been called. He declined to say if he stood by his earlier claims of fraud in the counting of ballots in his race.\n\nAfter the photo-op, the incoming senators walked across the hall to the historic Old Senate Chamber where they joined incumbent Republicans to meet privately and cast votes for the leadership slate.\n\nIn 2004, Thune of South Dakota stunned the political world when he knocked off the powerful Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle. He served in the House before moving to the Senate. He currently chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n\nCornyn will stay on as an appointed member of the leadership, something McConnell said a few weeks ago he would offer to Cornyn his long time and trusted No. 2.\n\nCornyn and Thune are key spokesmen for the Republicans, outlining policy and political goals for the conference and answering the constant barrage of questions from the Capitol press corp. McConnell limits his interactions with reporters typically to only a few questions at a weekly news conference.\n\nThune, Cornyn and a few other GOP senators are considered possible replacements for McConnell when he decides to give up the post. He is already the longest serving Senate Republican leader in history and has said he plans to run for a new term representing Kentucky when he is up for re-election in 2020.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was re-elected by affirmation, according to a source familiar. Other top Democrats held their positions, including Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois as the number two and Sen. Patty Murray as the No. 3."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Andrew Kaczynski and Christopher Massie, CNN", "title": "Roger Stone repeatedly claimed contact with Donald Trump and his campaign while touting WikiLeaks connections", "description": "Roger Stone claimed on several occasions during the 2016 presidential race that he was in communication with Donald Trump and his campaign, including declaring that he on average spoke with Trump weekly.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/kfile-roger-stone-2/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180713221253-roger-stone-cpt-7-13-2018-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:10:44Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Roger Stone claimed on several occasions during the 2016 presidential race that he was in communication with Donald Trump and his campaign, including declaring that he on average spoke with Trump weekly.\n\nThe nature of that communication is now part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the election.

Meanwhile, doctors and researchers continue to discover new illnesses linked to the crawling bugs.\n\nThe committee, known as the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, was established under theand is tasked with proposing how to rein in this public health problem.\n\n\"As tick populations continue to grow and infected ticks expand geographically, the threat to human health intensifies,\" the working group wrote. To highlight the necessity to act, the report includes stories from patients, including Ruben Lee Sims.\n\n'Untreated patients can lose everything'\n\nSims, a Vietnam veteran who in 1977 was recognized by the US Air Force as the \"top enlisted management analyst of the year,\" had his life derailed several years later by tick bites.\n\nRuben Lee Sims is a Lyme disease advocate.\n\nUnable to diagnose Lyme disease, the military discharged Sims in 1984, labeling him a hypochondriac whose pain was caused by psychological factors. A year later, a non-military doctor also failed to deliver a diagnosis. Though the doctor suspected Lyme disease, Sims had never traveled to New England, where the disease is prevalent, so the tick-borne disease was crossed off the list of possibilities.\n\n\"I was misdiagnosed for over three decades and left untreated for Lyme disease,\" Sims told the report's authors. Today, that's no longer true. Better equipped to diagnose tick-borne disease, the VA has confirmed Sims' pain as a symptom of Lyme disease, and with appropriate treatment, he no longer has symptoms.\n\n\"Untreated patients can lose everything, as I did, and become part of the unemployed, under-employed, disabled, and homeless populations,\" Sims said in the report. These days, he shares his story to help others who may be affected by tick-borne illnesses.\n\nMost Lyme patients who are treated early can fully recover, yet up to 20% experience persistent symptoms -- some disabling. Immediate symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, swollen lymph nodes and a distinctive ring rash . Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, and shooting pains in the hands or feet are among the longer-term symptoms in patients with chronic illness.\n\nThe spread of Lyme disease\n\nLyme disease cases have doubled since 2004, according to the report. Meanwhile, its geographic prevalence has grown: The number of counties considered to have high incidence of the disease has increased by more than 300% in the northeastern states and by nearly 250% in North Central states, the report states.\n\n\"The geographic range of Lyme disease cases has expanded since its first appearance in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975 and has consistently spread northward, southward, and westward,\" the report says. The working group suggests this spread may be due, at least in part, \"to ecological changes taking place in North America since the middle of the 20th century, including habitat and climate changes.\"\n\nThough less common on the West coast, Lyme disease is an important concern there, as are other diseases that result from tick bites, the report states. Despite hundreds of thousands of estimated cases, only about 35,000 are reported each year to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLyme disease is transmitted by infected deer ticks. Infected blacklegged ticks, Western blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks also frequently transmit illness in the United States.\n\nTick-borne diseases can be difficult to diagnose. Tests are not always accurate, and health care providers may not know how to use them. Additionally, patients may have not just one but two or more tick-borne illnesses at the same time.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Tick-Borne Disease Working Group's recommendations include improving early and accurate diagnosis and treatment, strengthening national surveillance and developing new treatment options for treating acute and persistent illness.\n\n\"For decades, tick-borne diseases have increased at an alarming rate,\" the committee concluded. \"The continued spread of ticks, the discovery of new tick-borne pathogens, and the spreading outbreak of human disease is a near certainty.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ashley Strickland, CNN", "title": "Frozen super-Earth found 6 light-years away", "description": "Astronomers have found a frozen exoplanet more than three times the mass of Earth, orbiting a star that's only six light-years away.

The exoplanet is orbiting Barnard's star, the closest solitary star to our sun.\n\nThis makes it the second closest known exoplanet to us. Previously, an exoplanet was found orbiting in the three-star Proxima Centauri system\n\nThe exoplanet was found after stitching together 20 years of data, including 771 individual measurements, from seven instruments. The analysis that led to the discovery is detailed in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nFor years, astronomers thought they would find a planet around the nearby star, but it eluded them.\n\n\"The biggest 'kick' about this discovery is the host star,\" Paul Butler, study co-author and astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science, wrote in an email. \"Barnard's star is the 'great white whale' of planet hunting.\"\n\nThe planet, known as Barnard's star b, is probably dimly lit by its star and slightly colder than Saturn. The researchers believe that it is an icy desert with no liquid water, a hostile environment where the average surface temperature is around minus-274 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAn artist's impression of the planet under the orange-tinted light from the star.\n\nThe red dwarf star itself emits only about 0.4% of our sun's radiance, so the planet receives about 2% of the intensity that Earth receives from its sun. This is because Barnard's star is in the class of M dwarf stars, cooler and less massive than our sun. It's also an old star that predates our own solar system.\n\nAnd to look at it through a telescope, the star appears to be moving the fastest among the other stars in the night sky. This is because it's moving quickly in relation to the sun, and it's the nearest single star in the sky to us, Butler said.\n\n\"The star is named in honor of the great American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, who was a pioneer of stellar photography and astrometry,\" Butler said. \"He recognized that this star had the largest known proper motion a century ago.\"\n\nThe planet is about the same orbital distance from its star as Mercury is from our sun, making a full pass around the star every 233 days. This places it in the \"snow line\" of the star, where it's cold enough for water to freeze into solid ice. This region in a planetary system is where the building blocks of planets are thought to form, collecting material to become cores. As they migrate closer to their host stars, gathering more material, they become planets.\n\nIt's the first time a planet this small and distant from its star has been detected using the radial velocity technique, which Butler helped pioneer. This method is sensitive to the mass of the exoplanet and measures changes in the host star's velocity. Instruments can be used to detect tiny wobbles in the star's orbit that are caused by the planet's gravity.\n\n\"I think this discovery shows the power of the [radial velocity] technique for detecting longer period, small planets that are much harder or not possible to detect with missions like Kepler and TESS, which focus on finding transiting exoplanets in shorter orbital periods,\" Johanna Teske, study co-author and Hubble Fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science, wrote in an email. \"This study sets a wonderful example of collaboration and coordination across multiple teams and multiple data sets, something that doesn't always happen successfully in exoplanet research. It is only by combining data and working collaboratively that this very challenging detection was possible.\"\n\nThese methods haven't always been available to astronomers searching for exoplanets. For most of the past hundred years, the only way was the astrometric technique, in which astronomers look for the host star to wobble relative to background stars, Butler said. It worked only for the nearest stars and was achieved by taking photographs of the star and measuring its positions in relation to one another.\n\n\"This made Barnard's star the most important star in the sky because it is the nearest single star in the sky,\" Butler said.\n\nIn the 1930s, Dutch-American astronomer Peter van de Kamp began a quest to study Barnard's star that lasted for most of his 93 years. His claims of how planets could fit in orbit around the star were refuted, and he died five months before the first verifiable discovery of an exoplanet was made in May 1995, Butler said.\n\n\"He worked hard at improving the only technique at that time that had a prayer of finding planets, and spent decades collecting the data,\" Butler said. \"Van de Kamp is a true pioneer in extrasolar planets.\"\n\nGiven its proximity to our solar system and its long orbit, future missions and telescopes will be able to provide new insights about Barnard's star b."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Could trash power your home? - CNN Video", "description": "Entrade is building mini power plants that are fueled by green waste and create cleaner, self-sustaining energy.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/14/waste-to-energy-entrade-mission-ahead.cnn-business", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114104923-entrade-3-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:01:59Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

They also discovered that leprosy-causing bacteria have changed little over hundreds of years, possibly explaining the decline in the disease after it peaked in medieval Europe as humans developed resistance.

The creature -- whose skull was excavated in Yunnan province -- would have been twice the size of today's otters.

Since Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, he has overseen one of the most chaotic Cabinets in modern history -- with resignations, firings and the whispers of future resignations and firings an almost-daily story.\n\nThe latest: Trump has decided he wants Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, gone -- although it's unclear when she will go. Thrown into that mix is the fact that White House chief of staff John Kelly is very close to Nielsen -- she followed him into the DHS job -- and might take umbrage at her firing (or forced resignation) and step aside himself. Given the ongoing tensions between Trump and Kelly, it's hard to say that such a two-for-one scenario would bother the President.\n\nThere's a tendency to reach to normalize Trump's hot-knife-through-butter slicing and dicing of his Cabinet. After all, being a Cabinet secretary -- or a senior White House official -- is a very stressful job. And history suggests that people wear out and are replaced -- particularly after a major moment like a midterm election.\n\nBut, as with so many things when it comes to Trump, this tendency toward normalization undersells the historic anomaly we are witnessing.

Among Democrats in the poll, more would prefer a different leader.\n\nIn CNN's post-election poll, respondents who participated in a survey from just before the election were called back. Only 30% of Americans said they want Pelosi to be speaker. Even Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are split -- 44% back her and 46% want another Democrat to take the lead.\n\nIn a CNN/ORC poll from after the 2010 election, when Republicans seized control of the House and Pelosi lost her role as speaker, 45% said they wanted her to continue as the Democratic leader in the House and 47% preferred another Democrat. Among all Americans in 2010, 66% said they wanted another Democrat and 25% said they preferred Pelosi. Despite that opposition, Pelosi has remained the top Democrat in the House for Democrats during the intervening eight years, and now that they have regained the majority, she is primed to retake the speaker's gavel.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Death toll rises to 50 as families return to nothing", "description": null, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/collections/california-fires-intl-111418/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:34:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "AngelaBonachera", "title": "La impactante foto de J\u00fapiter de la NASA muestra las tormentas y vientos en el planeta gigante", "description": "En la imagen se ven nubes arremolinadas en el planeta de mayor masa del Sistema Solar.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/14/la-impactante-foto-de-jupiter-de-la-nasa-muestra-las-tormentas-y-vientos-en-el-planeta-gigante/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/jupiter.png?w=1200", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:29:46Z", "content": "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El 29 de octubre de este a\u00f1o a las 4.58 p.m. ET. una c\u00e1mara de la NASA capt\u00f3 una impactante fotograf\u00eda de J\u00fapiter, el planeta con mayor masa en todo el Sistema Solar.

Bill Nelson's reelection campaign, which is hoping the effort will give them a chance at flipping the lead held by Florida Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nDemocrats, through the lawsuits, are looking to expand the universe of available votes, primarily by overturning a Florida statute that requires voter signatures on file to match the signatures on mail in ballots, reversing a measure that would allow votes postmarked before Election Day but received after to be counted and by expanding how election officials determine a voters' intent on ballots where a vote is not totally clear.\n\nNelson's campaign, led by lawyer Marc Elias, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are also suing to get rid of the Thursday deadline that requires all counties to finish the machine recount of votes. It appears, due to aging machines, that Palm Beach County will struggle to meet this deadline.\n\nRepublicans have also filed their own suits, including one filed by Scott's legal team against controversial Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes and another filed by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch that alleges voter fraud under Snipes. To date, however, there have been no reports of the kind of fraud alleged by Republicans.\n\nHere's a look at the suits in play:\n\nDemocrats sue over signature matching\n\nThis important hearing happens today at 1 p.m. before Judge Mark Walker in federal court in Tallahassee. Nelson's camp is asking a judge to invalidate Florida rules that say signatures on absentee and provisional ballots must match signatures on file. If successful, that suit could theoretically put thousands of tossed ballots back in play.\n\nDemocrats sue to lift all Florida recount deadlines\n\nNelson's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are asking a judge to allow all local elections officials \"the time they say is needed\" to finish \"because the race was so close.\" There's a status hearing on this Thursday morning before that same judge, Walker, in federal court).\n\nGroups sue to force Rick Scott to recuse himself\n\nThe League of Women Voters and Common Cause are asking for a restraining order to stop Scott from exercising any of his powers as governor in relation to the recount. They say he has demonstrated conflict of interest.\n\nAttorneys for Scott told a federal judge Wednesday morning that Scott will recuse himself from the certification of the final election results in Florida.\n\nThe comments came during the status hearing in the suit.\n\nWhile the governor's lawyers said Scott will not sit on the elections board to try to certify the result, that's only a small part of what the plaintiffs are seeking. They want the governor to not have any influence on the election canvassing process or use his authority to suspend election supervisors.\n\nThe judge did not make a ruling. A hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. tomorrow.\n\nDemocrats sue over \"voter intent\" with undervotes and overvotes\n\nNelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are asking a judge to strike down a state rule that requires voters to use the same method of marking different races in order for such ballots to be counted. For example, the suit argues, the rule would disqualify a ballot where a voter clearly indicated intent by circling a candidate's name in one race but used another kind of marking for different race. Dems believe there are thousands of tossed undervote and overvote ballots in their favor.\n\nDuring a telephone conference today before Walker, attorneys for both the Nelson campaign and the secretary of state agreed the case is over interpretation of a legal issue and will not require a full hearing before the judge rules.\n\nWalker asked for written filings and responses by tomorrow morning and could rule at any point after that.\n\nWalker noted that there are seven recount-related lawsuits before his court alone, telling the parties: \"The people of Florida need to get orders out of me, as well as the parties, sooner rather than later. There's a lot of reasons why time is of the essence.\"\n\nState house candidate sues to extend recount in Palm Beach County\n\nDemocrat James Bonfiglio, in a recount for House District 89, sued to ensure Palm Beach County officials have time to review his race by the deadline. Interestingly, Nelson's team wants a judge to dismiss this case as not to hold up everything else. This case was just transferred from state court to federal court, so the status is unclear.\n\nDemocrats sue to allow the count of ballots that arrived late by mail\n\nThe VOTEVETS Action Fund, Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing the state following the discovery of 266 ballots in the Opa-locka mail facility. The rules say mailed ballots must arrive in elections offices by election night, but the suit argues that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service. This suit had a status conference Tuesday and Walker set a Thursday deadline for more filings.\n\nRick Scott is suing the Broward Supervisor of elections\n\nThis case in state court asks for an injunction to stop Snipes from counting any ballots not canvassed by last Saturday's noon deadline. This case is pending in Broward's 17th judicial circuit.\n\nAgriculture commissioner candidate is suing the Broward Supervisor of elections\n\nGOP agricuture commissioner candidate Matthew Caldwell, whose race is also undergoing a recount, wants 205 provisional ballots in Broward County declared invalid and no votes received after Election Day counted. This case is pending in Broward's 17th judicial circuit.\n\nJudicial Watch is alleging voter fraud in Broward County\n\nLarry Klayman, the founder of Freedom Watch and Judicial Watch, is suing Snipes, the supervisor of elections for Broward County, for alleged fraud, misconduct and corruption as well as denial of access to the inspection of ballots. This case is pending in Broward's 17th judicial circuit.\n\nNelson campaign sues Bay County elections official over emailed ballots\n\nNelson's campaign is suing Bay County's supervisor of elections, who accepted 158 ballots via email or fax from voters who were impacted by Hurricane Michael.\n\nThe suit accuses Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen's office of refusing to allow Nelson's campaign to inspect the ballots and voting records.\n\n\"Given the limited period of time for recount results to be certified, Supervisor Andersen's refusal to produce the requested documents not only violates Plaintiff's fundamental right to promptly inspect and copy public records, but threatens the integrity of the voting process by allowing votes to be counted that were not cast by legal means,\" the complaint reads.\n\nThe suit seeks an immediate hearing and a judge's ruling declaring that the documents are public records.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Andersen's office for comment."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Lisa Respers France, CNN", "title": "CMAs 2018: Watch for familiar favorites and some surprise performances", "description": "Country music has its biggest night of the year Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/entertainment/cmas-2018/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114091951-carrie-underwood-and-brad-paisley-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:22:57Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Country music has its biggest night of the year Wednesday.\n\nThe 52nd Annual Country Music Association Awards are being held at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHere's what you can expect:\n\nWho's hosting?\n\nIt wouldn't be the CMAs without Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood.\n\nThe superstar singers will host the ceremony for the 11th straight year.\n\nWhat time should you be ready?\n\nThe show airs at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.\n\nWho will be performing?\n\nBig big names will, of cours, be hitting the stage.\n\nIn addition to hosts Paisley and Underwood, some of the announced performers include Garth Brooks, Chris Stapleton Jason Aldean with Miranda Lambert, Kelsea Ballerini, Dan + Shay, Florida Georgia Line with Bebe Rexha, Dierks Bentley with Brothers Osborne, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, and Lauren Alaina.\n\nWho is nominated?\n\nChris Stapleton leads the nominations with five: male vocalist of the year, single of the year, album of the year, song of the year and the prestigious entertainer of the year.\n\nDann Huff has four nominations.\n\nA surprise?\n\nGarth Brooks is performing a secret song.\n\nThe legendary singer told Taste of Country his wife, fellow country star Trisha Yearwood, hasn't even heard the new tune yet.\n\n\"Guys on the farm are taking a pool on how many words in before I start crying,\" Brooks said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Geneva Sands and David Siegel, CNN", "title": "In first public speech as acting AG, Whitaker praises Trump on economy", "description": "During his first public speech as acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker on Wednesday praised President Donald Trump's handling of the economy, telling an audience in Iowa that under this administration, seniors' retirement plans \"are doing pretty good right \u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/whitaker-trump-401k/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114112859-01-matthew-whitaker-1114-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:22:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) During his first public speech as acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker on Wednesday praised President Donald Trump's handling of the economy, telling an audience in Iowa that under this administration, seniors' retirement plans \"are doing pretty good right now.\"\n\nTrump last week fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and installed Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, in his place.

Bueno, una especie de trato. Apenas 872 d\u00edas desde que el Reino Unido votara para abandonar la Uni\u00f3n Europea, el texto del \"acuerdo de retirada\" se acord\u00f3 entre los equipos de negociaci\u00f3n de ambas partes. La primera ministra de Gran Breta\u00f1a, Theresa May, ahora tiene que persuadir a los miembros de su gabinete para que le den su bendici\u00f3n. Desafortunadamente para May, ah\u00ed es donde comienzan sus dolores de cabeza.\n\nMIRA: Alcanzan un acuerdo preliminar del Brexit m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su votaci\u00f3n\n\nVender el acuerdo al gabinete\n\nDesde hace tiempo se reconoce que el mayor problema que enfrenta May es la realidad pol\u00edtica en Londres.\n\nHay muy poco amor en cualquier lado del debate sobre el su plan para el brexit, y eso comienza a nivel del Gabinete.\n\nEl Gabinete de May est\u00e1 profundamente dividido entre los partidarios ardientes del brexit y los que votaron para permanecer. Ahora debe convencer a los miembros de probrexit de que el texto, que se espera que incluya un acuerdo que mantiene a todo Reino Unido en estrecha alineaci\u00f3n con la UE, cumple con el resultado del refer\u00e9ndum de 2016.\n\nSi ella falla, entonces es probable que tenga que regresar a Bruselas para renegociar, eso si no la obligan a renunciar. Sin embargo, ella deber\u00eda ganar a los 'brexiteers' del gabinete...\n\nLuego vuelve a Bruselas\n\nCon el Gabinete del Reino Unido en l\u00ednea, se convocar\u00e1 para noviembre una cumbre de emergencia del consejo de la UE, los 28 estados miembros que conforman la Uni\u00f3n Europea. O, al menos May espera eso.\n\nEn esta cumbre, los estados miembros aceptar\u00e1n el texto de retiro, lo que permitir\u00e1 que sea trasladado a las c\u00e1maras legislativas de la UE y Reino Unido.\n\nDebido al hecho de que el negociador principal de la UE, Michel Barnier, ha trabajado estrechamente en cada etapa con la UE27, los 28 estados miembros menos Reino Unido, se supone que esto ser\u00e1 poco m\u00e1s que un ejercicio de sello.\n\nMIRA: Theresa May convoca reuni\u00f3n de emergencia para presentar el borrador del acuerdo de negociaci\u00f3n para el brexit\n\nLo siguiente: la C\u00e1mara de los Comunes\n\nEsta ser\u00e1 la parte m\u00e1s complicada del proceso, y se le podr\u00eda perdonar a la primera ministra por golpearse la cabeza contra una pared.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de haber pasado meses tratando con la UE y viendo a una sucesi\u00f3n de ministros del gobierno renunciar por su gesti\u00f3n de brexit, debe enfrentarse a su propio Parlamento. El a\u00f1o pasado, gan\u00f3 el derecho a votar sobre el borrador del acuerdo, algo que el gobierno estaba dispuesto a evitar.\n\nEsto se conoce en Reino Unido como el \"voto significativo\" y permite a los diputados la oportunidad de dar su veredicto sobre el contenido del texto de retiro y el acuerdo pol\u00edtico asociado sobre la futura relaci\u00f3n entre Reino Unido y la UE.\n\nDesde que May perdiera su mayor\u00eda en el Parlamento despu\u00e9s de una elecci\u00f3n improvisada en 2017, la aritm\u00e9tica ha sido un desaf\u00edo para ella.\n\nLa prioridad para el Partido Laborista de la oposici\u00f3n es derribar al gobierno de May y forzar una elecci\u00f3n, por lo que est\u00e1 virtualmente garantizado que votar\u00e1 en contra del acuerdo. Pero May tambi\u00e9n sabe que una parte significativa de sus propios parlamentarios detestan el acuerdo que ha alcanzado con la UE y est\u00e1n listos para rechazarlo.\n\nLuego est\u00e1 el Partido Unionista Democr\u00e1tico de Irlanda del Norte, o DUP, cuyos 10 diputados apoyan a su gobierno. El DUP ha estado convencido desde el primer d\u00eda de que cualquier acuerdo que socave el lugar de Irlanda del Norte como parte del Reino Unido los llevar\u00eda a votar en contra.\n\nSi May pierde esta votaci\u00f3n, entonces todas las apuestas est\u00e1n perdidas. El gobierno ha sostenido durante mucho tiempo que se trata de su acuerdo de s\u00ed o no, pero en realidad a\u00fan podr\u00eda hacer un llamamiento a Bruselas e intentar obtener algunas concesiones adicionales.\n\nEn teor\u00eda, el gobierno, en este punto liderado por May o alguien m\u00e1s, podr\u00eda llevar a los comunes un acuerdo revisado y tener otro intento de lograrlo. Si no lo hace, lo m\u00e1s probable es que se produzca una ca\u00edda del gobierno, una elecci\u00f3n general y una mir\u00edada de posibles resultados, incluido un segundo refer\u00e9ndum.\n\nPero si ella gana este voto...\n\nM\u00e1s drama en los Comunes\n\nSuponiendo que el voto significativo pase, una suposici\u00f3n enorme en este punto, entonces debe ser traducido a la ley de Reino Unido. Aqu\u00ed es donde entra en juego el Proyecto de Ley de Acuerdo de Retirada de la UE. Esto estipular\u00e1 formalmente los t\u00e9rminos bajo los cuales Reino Unido dejar\u00e1 la Uni\u00f3n Europea y entrar\u00e1 el per\u00edodo de implementaci\u00f3n.\n\nNormalmente, los legisladores pueden enmendar legislaci\u00f3n como esta y frustrar al Gobierno. Pero como el brexit es un acuerdo entre el gobierno de Reino Unido y la UE, que no tiene voto en la C\u00e1mara de los Comunes, es dif\u00edcil ver c\u00f3mo los parlamentarios podr\u00edan influir en \u00e9l (aunque podr\u00edan hacer la vida muy dif\u00edcil para el gobierno de Reino Unido).\n\nEl fracaso de la votaci\u00f3n en esta etapa presumiblemente llevar\u00eda a Gran Breta\u00f1a a quedarse fuera de la UE sin un acuerdo, y una importante crisis pol\u00edtica. Pero, si May logra obtener la factura de retiro...\n\nA\u00fan m\u00e1s drama en los Comunes\n\nA continuaci\u00f3n, la Ley de Reforma Constitucional y Gobernabilidad de 2010, de la que poco se habla, que requiere que el gobierno presente ante el Parlamento cualquier cambio en los tratados internacionales con un memorando explicativo.\n\nMIRA:Theresa May pide \u201crespeto\u201d de la Uni\u00f3n Europea despu\u00e9s de la humillaci\u00f3n por el Brexit\n\nEn esta etapa, uno supondr\u00eda que una vez aprobado por el Parlamento, este ser\u00eda un trato hecho. Pero el brexit siempre ha sido una pelea complicada. Se podr\u00eda esperar que aquellos que a\u00fan se oponen al acuerdo que se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo recojan las rocas que puedan encontrar y se las lancen al gobierno.\n\nDe vuelta a Bruselas\n\nSi el acuerdo llegara tan lejos, el proceso final de ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo se traslada al Parlamento Europeo. Dado que, a estas alturas, el acuerdo ya habr\u00e1 sido acordado a nivel del Consejo y en el Parlamento del Reino Unido, es dif\u00edcil ver una raz\u00f3n para que el Parlamento de la UE lo arruine, especialmente porque la mayor\u00eda en Bruselas quieren que el brexit quede fuera del camino, por lo que pueden concentrarse en las elecciones europeas, que tendr\u00e1n lugar el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o.

But if its equipment is found to be responsible for it, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the fire is far from being under control, which means more damage is likely. PG&E said in the filing that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimates the fire won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nThe damages alone could cost up to $6.8 billion. according to a report from Moody's this week.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover the cost that, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay. The utility said in its filing that it currently has $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nShares of PG&E ( PCG ) plunged more than 30% Wednesday following this disclosure and were briefly halted for volatility.

OPEC is warning Trump to be careful what he wishes for.\n\nThat's because low prices at the pump have cost the US oil industry jobs in the past, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told CNN Business on Wednesday.\n\nAs a cautionary tale, Barkindo pointed out how painful the 2014-2016 oil crash was for American oil workers. He noted that more than 100 US oil companies went bankrupt and thousands of jobs were lost during that downturn.\n\nOnce that crash ended, however, the oil rebound became a big win for energy-producing states like Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and North Dakota. The Permian Basin of West Texas has morphed into one of the most prolific oilfields in the world.\n\nAmerica's energy industry \"benefited immensely\" from the coordinated output cuts by OPEC and its allies, Barkindo told CNN Business' Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios.\n\n\"If you look at the job creation in the basins, you will appreciate what OPEC and non-OPEC have jointly done to benefit the United States,\" Barkindo said.\n\nThose jobs could be threatened if crude keeps crashing like Trump wants.\n\nFears about a new supply glut knocked oil into a bear market last week. The selling deepened dramatically on Tuesday, when crude plunged 7%, its worst day in three years\n\nThe OPEC comments serve as a reminder to Trump that cheap oil cuts both way for the United States. American drivers save at the gas pump, but oil workers have their livelihoods threatened.\n\nThat's a reality for the United States, which is both the biggest producer and consumer of oil in the world.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whatever decision we make will be in the interest of the United States,\" Barkindo said. \"I'm sure he (Trump) will come to terms with reality.\"\n\nOPEC pledges to do 'whatever it takes'\n\nMuch to Trump's dismay, OPEC signaled on Monday that it would consider cutting production in response to excess supply.\n\nDespite the oil meltdown, Trump is urging OPEC not to dial back output.\n\n\"Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production,\" Trump tweeted on Monday. \"Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\"\n\nBarkindo urged Trump to speak directly with OPEC. \"We prefer a face-to-face dialogue with his administration,\" he said.\n\nBut OPEC may go forward with cuts anyway when the cartel meets in Vienna next month.\n\n\"We will do whatever it takes to sustain the stability that we have achieved,\" Barkindo said. \"Going into 2019, there are signs of a resurgence of an imbalance which we are determined to stay the course.\"\n\nHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nThe comments helped lift US oil prices 2% on Wednesday, putting crude on track to snap its record 12-day losing streak.\n\nOf course, OPEC played a major role in the 2014-2016 crude crash.\n\nDespite a huge glut, OPEC kept pumping aggressively in a bid to steal back market share from the United States and other high-cost producers. The cartel didn't agree to production cuts until September 2016 , when pain from the crash was hurting the finances of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations.\n\nWorkers extract oil from the Permian Basin, the booming shale oilfield in West Texas.

Currie argued that oil is set to \"snap back\" because the selloff is not justified.\n\nIran whiplash\n\nThe Trump administration has played a role in the latest boom-to-bust cycle for oil.\n\nPrices soared earlier this year after Trump officials signaled a desire to cut all oil exports from Iran. But the administration later took a softer approach on Iran sanctions out of fear they could cause crude to spike to $100 a barrel. US officials granted temporary waivers allowing China, India and others to keep buying oil from Iran.\n\nYet Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States ramped up output in recent months in a bid to avoid a shortfall caused by Iran.\n\nUS production has been especially strong, led by the roaring Permian Basin. America recently surpassed both Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's No. 1 oil producer for the first time since 1973."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Polling Director", "title": "CNN poll: Majority say midterms were repudiation of Republican policies", "description": "A majority of Americans say the 2018 midterms were mostly about the rejection of Republican policies, but Democrats may have more of a mandate this time around than in past election cycles, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/cnn-poll-post-election-happiness-democrats-republicans/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170518110309-03-capitol-hill-exterior-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:05:23Z", "content": "WASHINGTON (CNN) A majority of Americans say the 2018 midterms were mostly about the rejection of Republican policies, but Democrats may have more of a mandate this time around than in past election cycles, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.

But the nearly one-third of Americans who see the election as a mandate outpaces the share who saw the election outcome that way in other recent elections where control of either the US Senate or the House of Representatives changed hands.\n\nIn 2014, 16% of Americans said the takeover of the US Senate by Republicans equaled a mandate. Similarly, in 2010, when tea party backlash to Democrats helped Republicans take the House, 17% called it a mandate for Republicans. In 2006, when fatigue and anger at the Iraq War helped Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, 27% called it a mandate for the party. In 1994, 18% saw the takeover led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America as a mandate for Republicans.\n\nIn the new poll, which was conducted by re-interviewing those who participated in a CNN poll conducted just before Election Day, 53% of Americans said the election results indicate a rejection of policy positions pushed by Republicans.\n\nMore than 6 in 10 say it will be good for the country that Democrats will be in charge of the US House, higher than in any of those midterms save 2006, when 67% considered the Democratic takeover of the House good for the country.\n\nDespite divided control of the Senate and House, about half of Americans expect a more responsive Congress, and an optimistic 37% think it will get more done than the GOP-controlled Congress leaving office in January.\n\nBut few want to see Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the Democratic Party in the House -- 59% overall say they'd rather see another Democrat lead the party's caucus, and even among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, opinions on Pelosi are about evenly split, with 44% saying they'd like to see her in charge and 46% preferring another Democratic leader.\n\nIt also suggests that little has changed in perceptions of President Donald Trump or the state of the country in the wake of the election. Overall, 42% in the poll say they approve of the way the President is handling his job, a narrow increase from 39% who approved before Election Day. And 54% feel things in the country are going well, about even with the 55% who said so in the pre-election survey.\n\nThe survey finds a majority saying they trust the Democrats in Congress over Trump to deal with the major issues facing the country today, 55% to 38%, and that margin holds roughly steady across a range of critical issues, including health care (59% to 36%), immigration (58% to 39%), the Russia investigation (58% to 33%), gun policy and taxes (both 54% for the Democrats to 39% for Trump), and the federal budget deficit (52% to 39%). The one exception: the economy. On that issue, 48% say they trust Trump over the Democrats in Congress and 47% prefer the Democrats.\n\nImmigration and health care stand clearly ahead of other issues as voters' top priorities for the new Congress, with 29% citing immigration when asked open-ended what they'd like to see as Congress's first priority come January, and 21% naming health care. Another 10% say the Mueller investigation is their first priority for Congress.\n\nStill, both Republican and Democratic voters are mostly happy with the outcome of last week's midterm elections, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, but the election has done little to dampen the sense that the country's political divisions are deeper than they have been before.\n\nOverall, 57% say they're mostly happy with the way this year's congressional elections, 34% are mostly disappointed. Those who said they backed the Democrat in their own congressional district were most pleased (64% said they were happy) but a majority who say they voted Republican also feel mostly happy (53%).\n\nRelated: Full poll results\n\nViews of Trump divide perceptions of the outcome a bit more than House votes did: 66% of those who said before the election that they were casting a ballot to oppose the president were happy with the outcome, vs. 49% among those who said they were voting to express support for Trump.\n\nMost don't think Trump ought to be impeached and removed from office. Fifty-five percent say they don't feel that way and 42% say that they do. About 6 in 10 say there isn't enough cause for the Congress to begin hearings into whether or not Trump should be impeached. And just 3% say impeachment is their top priority for the new Congress come January.\n\nAbout half (49%) say they disapprove of the President firing Jeff Sessions as attorney general, while 44% approve. But most, 67%, say they think Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself from the Russia investigation, seemingly the President's biggest complaint about his former attorney general.\n\nThis CNN poll was conducted by SSRS by re-interviewing 677 adults who participated in a nationally representative pre-election survey. Those participating in the poll were originally interviewed from November 1 through 3 and callback interviews took place between November 8 and 12.

That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" Zwingli said Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.\n\nThe airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features.\n\nJUST WATCHED Families grieve at airport after plane crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Families grieve at airport after plane crash 02:19\n\nLion Air Flight 610 crashed shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on October 29. Investigators believe the MAX 8 plane may have experienced problems with several sensors.\n\nBoeing said last week that a safety bulletin issued to aircraft operators in the wake of the crash was merely meant to reinforce existing procedures. Both Lion Air and the APA have now rejected the company's assertion.\n\n\"They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft,\" Capt. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the APA group, told CNN on Tuesday. \"The bulletin is not reaffirming, it's enlightening and adding new info.\"\n\nZwingli added that Boeing's safety bulletin did not suggest additional training for pilots operating that aircraft. \"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" he said.\n\nZwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission, the US National Transportation Safety Board, and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary, Lion Air pilots would undertake it.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that it could not \"discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation\" and that the company had \"provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the MAX 8 planes, but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.\n\nOn Tuesday, the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the MAX 8 planes, \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\"\n\n\"What seems to have happened here is that a new version or a modified anti-stall capacity was added which pushes the nose down automatically. If it's true, it is beyond comprehension that Boeing did not tell the airline and pilots about this,\" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest.\n\nHe added that if important information hadn't been communicated to pilots, it would be a matter for aviation regulators, rather than individual airlines.\n\n\"The issue is how much information to give the pilots about the systems on board so they can respond in an emergency,\" Quest said, adding that pilots are often overloaded with readouts and signals from multiple devices and monitors that can risk distracting them at the worst possible moment.\n\nLion Air sensor replaced\n\nBoeing's operational bulletin, released last week, pointed airlines to \"existing flight crew procedures\" to address any erroneous readings related to \"angle-of-attack\" (AOA) sensors.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later issued its own directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems.\n\nLast week, investigators said the AOA sensor on board the aircraft had been replaced the day before the incident, but problems persisted.\n\nIndonesian authorities confirmed last Wednesday that the AOA sensor was replaced after a flight from Manado, in North Sulawesi, to Denpasar, Bali, on October 28. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 then made another flight to Jakarta that same day, and the pilots reported further problems.\n\nInvestigators said the jet experienced problems on its last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT).\n\nThe FAA's directive affects 246 Boeing 737 Max aircraft worldwide, with 45 of these operated by US carriers that include Southwest, American and United Airlines.\n\nVoice recorder still missing\n\nMore than two weeks after the crash, authorities are still searching for the plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which is believed to be buried under deep mud. If found, it should reveal what happened in the cockpit in the final seconds of the flight.\n\nInvestigators are already examining the flight data recorder (FDR) that was pulled off the seabed, some 30 meters under water, on November 1. Preliminary findings suggested there were problems with the airspeed indicator on the past three flights before the crash.\n\nThe airspeed indicator is like a speedometer and tells the pilot how fast the plane is moving through the air. It does this by gathering data from the plane's pitot tube and the static port, which essentially compare differentials in the air pressure to arrive at the plane's speed and altitude.\n\nAfter problems were reported with the airspeed indicator, the AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nPassengers on that flight told CNN that the plane experienced a significant drop in altitude shortly after takeoff. \"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" passenger Robbi Gaharu said.\n\nOnce in Jakarta, a Lion Air technician checked the plane again and gave it the green light to fly on its final flight, from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "m.nadi", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a \u064a\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0628 \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633\u064a\" \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629", "description": "\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a\u060c \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u060c &quot;\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645&quot;

For businesses, the agreement would deliver much-needed certainty about the next two years.\n\n\"This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead,\" May told reporters following a marathon cabinet meeting. \"It is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.\"\n\nBut the resignation of key UK government ministers on Thursday underscored the difficulty of gaining parliamentary approval for the deal. The pound dropped sharply against the US dollar following the resignations, weakening as much as 1.8%.\n\nHere's what the deal \u2014 should it survive \u2014 would mean for business, markets and the economy.\n\nBusiness\n\nCompanies in Britain and the European Union have spent months preparing for a chaotic Brexit. Their biggest fear is a scenario where the United Kingdom crashes out of the European Union, leading to new trade barriers.\n\nThat risk hasn't been completely eliminated and companies remain cautious. Still, business groups including the British Retail Consortium welcomed news of a potential deal.\n\n\"It is vital that we avoid the cliff edge of no deal in March 2019 as this could immediately lead to consumers facing higher prices and reduced availability of many everyday products,\" said Helen Dickinson, the industry group's chief executive.\n\nKey manufacturing firms also cheered the emergence of a deal.\n\n\"My gut feeling is we need to get behind it and we need to make this deal work. What we need is certainty,\" Juergen Maier, UK CEO of German engineering giant Siemens ( SIEGY ), told BBC Radio.\n\nThe deal includes a transition period during which most trading rules for companies in Britain will remain the same. A joint declaration published Wednesday said that agreement had been reached on a close relationship on trade in financial services, and broad cooperation on transportation and energy.\n\nBut businesses have also been warned to prepare for a scenario where the deal falls through.\n\n\"We still urge business to continue preparing for both a deal and no deal scenario until the deal is ratified,\" said Andrew Gray, head of Brexit at PwC.\n\nOne more problem: The deal only covers the divorce terms, and doesn't give businesses much clarity about a future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and its biggest trading partner following the transition.\n\nThe joint declaration said that negotiations had been \"particularly challenging\" on how future trade in goods would be conducted.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe pound has been volatile since Brits voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, and it's still trading almost 14% lower than on the day of the referendum.\n\nAnalysts said it would strengthen following a deal.\n\n\"If the deal as described in the press were to pass into law, both [the pound] and [the euro] would benefit,\" Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nKallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg bank, said the pound would likely jump higher in two stages, along with government bond yields and shares in companies that do business in Britain.\n\nHe expects the first increase once the UK parliament has approved the divorce deal, which could happen in December, and the second during the following year as investors update their outlook for the United Kingdom.\n\nKaren Ward, a market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that investors were still \"most nervous\" about the deal getting through parliament. But she expects it to be approved.\n\n\"Going into next year we expect business investment to experience a relief rally and higher sterling to depress inflation and lift real wages so consumer spending would also accelerate,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\nIf the deal fails and Britain crashes out of the bloc, S&P estimates the pound will slump 15% against the dollar.\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomists say a Brexit deal would boost the beleaguered UK economy.\n\n\"While the long-term risks to UK potential growth from Brexit loom large, the prospect of a deal presents considerable upside potential for the UK economy over the medium-term,\" Pickering said.\n\nBerenberg estimates that a deal would lift economic growth to 2% in 2019, from 1.3% this year.\n\nThe UK economy slowed sharply following the Brexit vote, but it has avoided slumping into recession. Investment also slumped dramatically.\n\nA chaotic Brexit, without a deal, could sink the economy into a prolonged recession, S&P warned last month."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Levenson and Tina Burnside, CNN", "title": "Parkland shooter faces charges for allegedly attacking officer and taking his stun gun", "description": "Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooter Nikolas Cruz allegedly tackled and repeatedly punched a jail guard, then took his stun gun Tuesday in a fight, an arrest report shows.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/us/parkland-nikolas-cruz-charges/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180427140550-nikolas-cruz-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:49:54Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooter Nikolas Cruz allegedly tackled and repeatedly punched a jail guard, then took his stun gun Tuesday in a fight, an arrest report shows.\n\nThe incident began when Sgt.

can pick and choose which journalists are given a permanent pass to cover it, according to a court filing by the Justice Department on Wednesday.\n\nThe filing was the government's legal response to CNN and Jim Acosta's lawsuit over the recent suspension of Acosta's press pass.\n\nTuesday's lawsuit against President Trump and several of his top aides alleged that the ban violates CNN and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nMost of the country's major news organizations have sided with CNN through statements and plan to file friend-of-the-court briefs.\n\nBut the Trump administration, in a sharp break with decades of tradition, is asserting that it has \"broad discretion\" to limit reporter access to White House buildings and events.\n\n\"The President and White House possess the same broad discretion to regulate access to the White House for journalists (and other members of the public) that they possess to select which journalists receive interviews, or which journalists they acknowledge at press conferences,\" lawyers say in the filing.\n\nHistorically both Republican and Democratic administrations have had a permissive approach to press access, providing credentials both to big news organizations like CNN and obscure and fringe outlets.\n\nAcosta's suspension -- which took effect one week ago -- is an unprecedented step. Journalism advocates say it could have a chilling effect on news coverage.\n\n\"If the press is not free to cover the news because its reporter is unjustly denied access, it is not free,\" former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson said in a court declaration supporting CNN on Tuesday. \"And if denying access to a reporter an organization has chosen to represent it -- in effect asserting the president's right to take that choice away from a news organization and make it himself -- is permitted, then the press is not free.\"\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.\n\nCNN and Acosta are asking Kelly for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would restore his access right away.\n\nLawyers for CNN and Acosta are arguing that time is of the essence because his rights are violated every day his pass is suspended.\n\nThey are also seeking a declaration that Trump's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" This could protect other reporters against similar actions in the future.\n\nThe government's filing quotes a tweet by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in which she announced the suspension of Acosta's pass by saying his \"conduct is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe \"conduct\" mentioned by Sanders in the tweet that the government lawyers cite actually refers to a false and since-dropped argument that Sanders had made in the aftermath of the press conference \u2014 that Acosta was \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nThe administration has backed away from that argument in recent days, and it makes no appearance in the government's first legal comment on the case Wednesday. Even when the filing directly quotes Sanders' tweets, it leaves out that part.\n\nInstead, the White House is complaining about Acosta's aggressive style. In an interview with The Daily Caller, a conservative website, on Wednesday, Trump called Acosta \"bad for the country,\" depicting him as \"just an average guy who's a grandstander who's got the guts to stand up and shout.\"\n\nTrump called on Acosta at last week's post-midterms press conference. The two men had a combative exchange. When Trump called on someone else, Acosta held onto a microphone and asked another question. Trump responded, and Acosta handed off the mic.\n\nLater in the day, Acosta returned to the White House and was told to hand in his Secret Service \"hard pass.\" Sanders, around the same time, announced his suspension.\n\nCNN is alleging that this abrupt action violated due process rights. But the government's lawyers said in Wednesday's filing that the back and forth between Trump and Acosta, during which Trump strongly criticized Acosta, qualified as due process. They also cite Sanders' statement the night of that press conference as \"notice of the factual bases for denial.\"\n\n\"The President had similarly criticized Mr. Acosta's conduct during that press conference, which complemented Ms. Sanders' notice,\" the government argued.\n\nThe government also claimed that CNN can't be harmed by the banning of one of its journalists, arguing that the \"network has roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN's behalf.\"\n\nCNN has rejected that assertion. So has the White House Correspondents' Association. The group said Tuesday that the president \"should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\"\n\n\"This is a very, very important case,\" Ted Olson said. Olson, a Republican heavyweight who successfully argued for George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, is representing CNN along with another prominent outside attorney, Theodore Boutrous, and the network's chief counsel, David Vigilante.\n\nOlson said Tuesday that it was Acosta whose press pass was suspended this time, but \"this could happen to any journalist by any politician.\"\n\nHe spoke forcefully against Trump's action. \"The White House cannot get away with this,\" he said in an interview with CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nCNN's lawyers say the case hinges on Acosta and CNN's First Amendment rights; the shifting rationales behind the ban; and the administration's failure to follow the federal regulations that pertain to press passes, an alleged violation of Fifth Amendment rights. The lawsuit asserts that this ban is really about Trump's dislike of Acosta.\n\nThe \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\" CNN's lawsuit alleges.\n\nMany media law experts, unaffiliated with CNN, believe the network has a very strong case.\n\nJudge Andrew Napolitano, the top legal analyst on Trump's favorite network, Fox News, said the same thing on Tuesday. \"I think this will be resolved quickly,\" he said, adding \"I think it will either be settled or CNN will prevail on motion.\"\n\nIf there is no settlement, CNN is requesting a jury trial.\n\nIn an interview with Wolf Blitzer, Boutrous said the government officials are being sued in their \"official capacity,\" but \"there is a possibility of damages claims,\" which would mean suing them personally.\n\nBlitzer pointed out that the officials would have to \"go out and hire their own attorneys.\"\n\nIt is incredibly rare to see a news organization suing a president.\n\nMore than a dozen news outlets -- from the Associated Press to USA Today, The Washington Post to Fox News -- have publicly expressed support for the effort.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign is trying to capitalize on the lawsuit. On Wednesday it sent out an emailed survey to potential donors that asked recipients if they think the ban on Acosta was justified. The email's subject line was, \"CNN SUES! Help Trump win.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jeremy Herb, CNN", "title": "House Democrats target Whitaker's involvement in 'scam' company", "description": "House Democrats are kicking off their investigations into the Trump administration by probing acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's connections to a Florida company that was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission over what court documents called \"a scam \u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/house-democrats-matt-whitaker/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181109111414-01-matthew-whitaker-lead-image-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:04:51Z", "content": "(CNN) House Democrats are kicking off their investigations into the Trump administration by probing acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's connections to a Florida company that was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission over what court documents called \"a\u2026 [+2604 chars]", "fulltext": "(CNN) House Democrats are kicking off their investigations into the Trump administration by probing acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's connections to a Florida company that was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission over what court documents called \"a scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe top Democrats on the House Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence and Energy and Commerce Committees jointly sent seven letters requesting documents and briefings about Whitaker's role on the advisory board of the company, World Patent Marketing, which was hit with a $26 million judgment when it was shut down earlier this year.\n\nThe letters represent an opening salvo of how House Democrats plan to investigate the Trump administration when they take over in January.

Basic safety precautions, like keeping wallets, cameras and jewelry unobtrusive, are part of a pre-tour emailed brief.\n\nThe combo you never knew you needed\n\nThe eating begins in earnest in the banquet\u00f3n, the large food hall that runs the perimeter of the market. The first stop is at -- given what's to come, the relatively prosaic -- McTeo, a market-stall taqueria that, if looked at charitably, pays homage to the king of fast food, Ronald McDonald.\n\nA less understanding interpretation might see lawyers from the burger giant descend on the market with a cease-and-desist order regarding the liberal use of the mascot to sell tacos, but this doesn't seem to have deterred the stall's cheery workers.\n\nThe specialty at Tacos McTeo is adding papas fritas -- French fries -- to their tacos. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nInstead, in a cloud of oily steam they relentlessly slice potato after potato directly into a vat of boiling oil to provide the papas fritas -- French fries -- that serve as a carb-y garnish for the delicious carne enchilada tacos with cactus and onion. It's the combination you never knew you needed.\n\nNico says that on a weekend day, they'll get through three 50-kilo (110 lb) sacks of potatoes, easy.\n\nAll in all the tour takes in as many as 11 stops, while also wandering through the market's cavernous, multiple-football-field sized halls, so there's little dawdling. A pit stop for fried tamales -- a specialty of the city -- sees Nico expound on one of the most ubiquitous of Mexican foods.\n\n\"A famous chef, Ricardo Mu\u00f1oz Zurita of the Azul restaurants, once tried to catalog every variation of tamal, throughout the whole country,\" he says. \"He had to give up when he realized that he'd write down one recipe, and the guy next door would tell him, 'yeah, but you can also make it like this,'\" indicating just the tiniest change. Unfazed, he eventually published his unfinished research in a cookbook.\n\nFive siblings, one taqueria\n\nEach stop involves one or two bites, but upon reaching Cinco Hermanos, the famed family-run taqueria, it's OK to pause a little longer.\n\nWidely recognized as some of the best tacos in the city, Nico says that the secret comes from the synergy of owning the adjoining butcher's shop -- affording the five siblings the choicest cuts to turn into mouthwatering suadero -- a cut of beef similar to brisket -- longaniza (sausage) or tripe tacos.\n\nCinco Hermanos is rightfully known as one of the best places to get tacos -- possibly in the entire city. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nThe meat is confited in a vat of bubbling oil, along with the small, sweet onions habitually served as full stops to the meal. A bunch of p\u00e1palo leaves, which are used as palate cleansers, is on hand, self-serve, for customers.\n\nHuge variety\n\nNico shows us market stalls where men thump down huge knives in quick drumbeat succession into huge cakes of chicharr\u00f3n prensado -- pressed pork -- deconstructing them once again for gorditas or to be added to salsas or tacos.\n\nNearby, small samples of mole -- encompassing a huge variety of shades from deep, rich chocolate to bright red, are offered and tasted.\n\nAn array of moles is available at Moles Dona Balbi. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nA few rows over, an impassive worker methodically -- and rapidly -- shaves the spines off nopales, the ubiquitous prickly pear cactus pads that are sold for less than a peso each.\n\nHe strips and preps each in seconds flat. \"He makes it look easy, but if I were to try to do that, each one would take at least a couple of minutes,\" Nico admits.\n\nMesoamerican ingredients\n\nWe are in front of one of the smallest stalls, a mere table top, stacked with old plastic jars and bags, opaque with age and use. Alongside them are open, shallow baskets filled with crickets and tiny orange crustaceans called acociles. This is Se\u00f1ora Edith's pre-Hispanic ingredients, a unique stop in La Merced's vastness.\n\nSe\u00f1ora Edith's is a tiny stall selling pre-Hispanic ingredients such as mosquito larvae, ants and stink bugs. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nNico points out dried mosquito eggs and larvae, alongside dried ants and worms and a bug known as cocopaches -- crispy on the outside but harboring a gooey interior.\n\nMost of these ancient ingredients, vital sources of protein in Mesoamerican diets, are handed over, and following a moment of trepidation, sampled.\n\nChapulines -- grasshoppers -- are a tasty snack that has survived since pre-Hispanic times. To the right are acociles, tiny shellfish. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nHead tacos\n\nBlinking in the bright Mexico City sun, the group exits the building -- one of the market's eight -- through a slim passageway and walks along a narrow, bustling alley.\n\nStalls selling kitchen utensils line the sides, bookending a battered taco stand, next to which, on an old, worn chopping block cratered through years of use, sits a partially dismembered cow's skull.\n\nWisps of hair and skin stick to it, and Nico says that while customers can usually choose their cut -- from a dizzying array including cheek, tongue, eyeball and eyelid, brain, snout and sweetbreads -- Sundays are too busy so everyone gets the same -- surtida, a mix of all of the above. He says that on a Sunday, they'll get through six entire heads.\n\nTacos de cabeza -- beef head tacos -- can be found outside the Nave Mayor, in the road that runs between the market and the meat section. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nThe tacos de cabeza -- literally, \"head tacos\" -- are complex in taste and texture, but it takes a certain concentration to ignore the fact that we're eating parts of the animal that, in the US or Europe, would normally be discarded.\n\nStill chewing the last of the sticky, flavorful meat we wander to our next stop, El Pollo, which serves us quesadillas de huitlacoche -- quesadillas served with corn smut, the musty, earthy fungus also known as \"Mexican truffle.\"\n\nIt's unique to the country -- elsewhere in the world smut is seen as a disease and farmers will destroy whole fields to rid their crop of the infestation, but here it is actively encouraged.\n\nHuge stacks of fruit and veg\n\nAnother wander through the halls ensues, past stacks of limes, avocados and the multicolored hues of Mexico's bountiful and varied vegetable crops. Another aisle is filled with huge sacks stuffed with dried chiles, the air redolent with their smokiness.\n\nStacks of limes and avocados bring vivid greens to the multicolored hues of the market. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nEn route through the vegetable section, Nico pauses and hands over a few coins to a woman standing beside a small cart. She hands back a few bulbs of garlic. \"Every time I'm on one of these tours, I make sure I find her here. This is the best garlic I know.\" And he says she sells it for about an eighth of the price of a supermarket.\n\nA basketful of habaneros in the vegetable section of the market. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nAnother building and, after a warning from Nico about the number of bees flying around the alleys, the group is plunged again into the bustling passageways.\n\nThis building, the Mercado de Dulces, is home to a bewildering selection of candies, many made with honey -- hence the bees.\n\nSmall candy skulls made of amaranth -- an ancient grain which predates the Hispanic era -- lie stacked alongside other skeleton-themed snacks ahead of the Day of the Dead. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nIrreplaceable staple\n\nEven then it's not over. We emerge from the market to check out a tortilleria, which churns out dozens of the staple a minute.\n\nThe flatbreads are so crucial to the Mexican diet that the government regulates the price -- currently around 17 pesos (90\u00a2) a kilo (2.2 lb). Nico says that the average Mexican eats as much as 55 kg (120 lb) of tortillas a year.\n\nUnusually, this place does its own nixtamalization, the complex processing of corn that allows humans to reap the full nutrition of the grain.\n\nThousands of tortillas are pressed every day in small tortillerias. The staple is regulated by the government. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nAround another corner, a hand-pulled ice cream cart, which offers delicious homemade flavors including horchata, cotija cheese with blackberries, passion fruit and lime sorbet.\n\nWe finally stagger into Rold\u00e1n 37, a restaurant set in a restored mansion atop an old dried chile warehouse, for a restorative tequila and a final quesadillita."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN", "title": "A California couple 'adopted' a 93-year-old veteran after his town burned to the ground", "description": "Tracy Grant was in a parking lot handing out hamburgers to evacuees from the devastating Camp Fire in Northern California when she encountered Lee Brundige.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/us/california-93-veteran-paradise-fire-trnd/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114094935-california-93-veteran-paradise-fire-trnd-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:54:36Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Tracy Grant was in a parking lot handing out hamburgers to evacuees from the devastating Camp Fire in Northern California when she encountered Lee Brundige.\n\nThe 93-year-old World War II veteran had just fled his house in Paradise by driving his own car as the wildfire was approaching.\n\n\"He called me the burger girl,\" Grant says. \"It took us about 24 hours to convince him to follow me home.\"\n\nThis was last Thursday in Oroville, about 11 miles south of the fire.

Melania Trump ya hab\u00eda dicho en una entrevista en ABC el mes pasado que no confiaba en algunos empleados de la Casa Blanca. Ahora, ella est\u00e1 haciendo algo al respecto.\n\nUna persona le dijo a CNN que, incre\u00edblemente, Trump, el secretario general de la Casa Blanca, John Kelly, y la secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Sanders, no ten\u00edan idea de que llegar\u00eda la declaraci\u00f3n.\n\nNo es raro que la incomodidad aceche a la Casa Blanca despu\u00e9s de una p\u00e9rdida de las elecciones intermedias, ya que los empleados agotados por la primera mitad del mandato del presidente dan paso a tropas m\u00e1s frescas. Y el martes no fue la primera vez que una primera dama presion\u00f3 a su marido sobre un miembro del personal que ella encuentra irritante.\n\nPero el temperamento vol\u00e1til de este presidente y el nido de v\u00edboras que es su Ala Oeste ha infligido m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n sobre su personal de lo que es normal incluso en la Casa Blanca, donde las crisis siempre est\u00e1n a la vuelta de la esquina.\n\nVarios miembros del gabinete, incluida la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, son objeto de ataques por susurros, filtraciones y especulaciones sobre su destino mientras hay especulaci\u00f3n sobre sus posibles reemplazos.\n\nSe dice que Kelly, que ha sobrevivido a varias rondas de rumores sobre su partida, a menudo supuestamente inminente, se dirige a la salida de nuevo. Y los informes filtrados de que Trump ve a Ryan Zinke como vulnerable a la supervisi\u00f3n dem\u00f3crata han debilitado la posici\u00f3n del secretario del Interior.\n\nMientras tanto, Trump est\u00e1 atrincherado en su nombramiento constitucionalmente cuestionable de Matthew Whitaker, un cr\u00edtico de Robert Mueller, para supervisar la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial como secretario de Justicia interino despu\u00e9s de que despidieran a Jeff Sessions.\n\nSe esperaba que Sanders se fuera, junto con su adjunto Raj Shah, pero su estado sigue siendo incierto.\n\nMIRA: Michelle Obama dice que Melania Trump declin\u00f3 su ofrecimiento de ayuda\n\nM\u00e1s que la agitaci\u00f3n habitual del personal\n\nTrump usa el caos como un instrumento de poder personal, dejando a todos inseguros de lo que suceder\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, mientras se sienta en el centro de la tormenta listo para hacer su pr\u00f3ximo movimiento.\n\nLa alteraci\u00f3n de los rumores en Washington, al mismo tiempo que confunde al establishment pol\u00edtico y las percepciones de c\u00f3mo debe funcionar una Casa Blanca, permite al presidente mantener la fe en su base pol\u00edtica.\n\nAs\u00ed que la intriga ha sido parte del gobierno desde el principio, junto con las narrativas de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n sobre que Trump dirige su Casa Blanca como un reality show y est\u00e1 constantemente disparando distracciones para que los reporteros vayan tras ellas.\n\nPero la turbulencia actual y el sentido de que las normas presidenciales se rompen por un presidente emocional y err\u00e1tico se sienten diferentes a las salvajes intrigas del personal al principio de la presidencia. Est\u00e1 empezando a generar preguntas reales sobre lo que est\u00e1 reservado para la naci\u00f3n durante la segunda mitad del mandato de Trump.\n\nParece seguro que Trump emerger\u00e1 de este momento altamente cargado con menos restricciones si los altos funcionarios que han tratado de mantenerlo dentro de los l\u00edmites de la costumbre presidencial y la ley se retiran.\n\nEs posible que tenga m\u00e1s libertad para seguir un curso impredecible en el que a veces parece repasar las convenciones de gobierno y las barreras de seguridad constitucionales que a menudo parece que ni siquiera est\u00e1n all\u00ed.\n\nEsto podr\u00eda ser un problema creciente cuando el gobierno enfrenta un repentino estallido de investigaciones de la nueva C\u00e1mara dem\u00f3crata, una realidad para la cual la negligencia de los republicanos les ha dejado profundamente mal preparados.\n\nY hay una buena posibilidad de que Trump se distraiga a\u00fan m\u00e1s con la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller con la especulaci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 calentando sobre posibles nuevas acusaciones y el contenido del tan esperado informe final del fiscal especial.\n\nMIRA: La oficina de la primera dama de EE.UU. pide boicotear al rapero T.I. por un \"repugnante\" video sobre Melania Trump\n\nEl martes, con su Casa Blanca alborotada, estaba sentado con sus abogados para responder a las preguntas escritas formuladas por Mueller, un momento cr\u00edtico potencial para su presidencia.\n\nSorprendentemente, el presidente a\u00fan tiene que enfrentar una gran crisis internacional que no precipit\u00f3, como una llamada militar cercana con un adversario importante o una crisis financiera, que requerir\u00e1 un liderazgo centrado e inequ\u00edvoco y un equipo que funcione con unidad y prop\u00f3sito. Eso parece una posibilidad poco probable en esta Casa Blanca.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de todo, funcionarios como Nielsen y Kelly han puesto su propia reputaci\u00f3n en el lugar, defendiendo las pol\u00e9micas pol\u00edticas del presidente sobre inmigraci\u00f3n, solo para que \u00e9l las cambiara al final.\n\nEn este momento, los \u00fanicos empleados de la Casa Blanca que podr\u00edan considerarse seguros son sus parientes: su hija Ivanka y su yerno Jared Kushner.\n\nPero el peligro de dirigir un ala oeste en el modelo nepotista del negocio de Trump se ha aclarado recientemente con la crisis por el asesinato del periodista saud\u00ed Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nEl asesinato, que caus\u00f3 indignaci\u00f3n global, est\u00e1 siendo ampliamente atribuido a Mohammad bin Salman, el pr\u00edncipe Heredero a quien Kushner apoy\u00f3 en la pol\u00edtica de Medio Oriente.\n\nMelania Trump muestra su poder\n\nEl golpe del martes de la primera dama fue notable. En una demostraci\u00f3n de fuerza que aparentemente se estaba gestando durante d\u00edas, hizo que la posici\u00f3n de Ricardel fuera insostenible.\n\nEn una pizca de intriga adicional, Melania Trump le retorci\u00f3 el cuchillo al asesor de seguridad nacional, John Bolton, quien ha forjado su merecida reputaci\u00f3n como un asesino burocr\u00e1tico despiadado, y quien estaba fuera de la acci\u00f3n a casi 16.000 kil\u00f3metros de distancia, en Singapur.\n\nNo fue la primera vez que un miembro del personal del ala oeste pag\u00f3 el precio por haberse peleado con una primera dama.\n\nMIRA: Encuesta: Melania Trump tiene mejor aceptaci\u00f3n que su marido\n\nLos chismes a menudo rebosaban sobre la mala voluntad entre Nancy Reagan y el ex jefe de personal de la Casa Blanca Don Regan. George Stephanopoulos escribi\u00f3 en sus memorias sobre los enfrentamientos con Hillary Clinton cuando prest\u00f3 servicio en la Casa Blanca de su marido. Y a menudo se hablaba de tensi\u00f3n entre Michelle Obama y el primer secretario de Prensa de su esposo, Robert Gibbs.\n\nPero es dif\u00edcil encontrar un precedente para el despido p\u00fablico, y categ\u00f3rico de Ricardel por Melania Trump, un golpe que ejemplific\u00f3 la voluntad de la primera dama de mostrar su peso pol\u00edtico.\n\nSin embargo, Marc Short, el ex enlace del Congreso con Trump, le dijo a Erin Burnett de CNN que, si bien su movimiento no ten\u00eda precedentes, no era probable que comenzara una nueva tendencia.\n\nUna fuente le dijo a Jeff Zeleny de la CNN que Trump, a quien a menudo le resulta dif\u00edcil despedir a las personas en persona, hab\u00eda decidido que Ricardel ten\u00eda que irse, aunque se le estaba dando tiempo para limpiar su escritorio.\n\nAlgunas fuentes de la Casa Blanca pintaron una imagen de Ricardel como alguien con quien es dif\u00edcil de trabajar y dijeron que hab\u00eda protagonizado muchas peleas desde que subi\u00f3 a bordo en abril.\n\n\"Ella atravesar\u00eda un muro de ladrillos por ti, pero su personalidad no es para todos\", dijo otro funcionario.\n\nSin embargo, Ricardel a\u00fan no ha tenido la oportunidad de contar su propia historia. Y el tono de cualquier Casa Blanca se establece desde arriba, y no hay duda de que hay pocos lugares m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles para trabajar en Estados Unidos.\n\n- Kate Bennett, Pamela Brown, Jeremy Diamond, Jeff Zeleny y Sarah Westwood de CNN contribuyeron a este informe."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Modern Slavery Act Statement for Cable News International Limited, a U.K. subsidiary of Warner Media, LLC", "description": "WarnerMedia is committed to conducting global business with high ethical and legal standards.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/21/cnn-info/modern-slavery-act-statement/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:45:53Z", "content": "Warner Media, LLC (formerly, Time Warner Inc.)

Between October 16 and October 31, he sent nine tweets referring to the \"caravan\" of migrants making their way across Mexico.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nSince November 6 -- 8 days and counting -- Trump hasn't mentioned the so-called caravan once in a tweet. He has used the word \"border\" a single time -- in a tweet on November 9 in which Trump tweeted out a link to a \"Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States\" that said, essentially, that he was trying to push people entering the country illegally to specified ports of entry.\n\nThat discrepancy between Trump's rhetoric in the runup to the election and his rhetoric after it exposes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what most neutral observers initially suspected: That Trump's decision to seize on the caravan of migrants making their way across Mexico in hopes of entering the United States was 100% a political ploy to rev up his base.\n\nTo read Trump's tweets or listen to one of his speeches at the slew of campaign rallies in the final week of the midterm campaign, you would have thought that the caravan -- a horde of pillaging intruders -- was on the verge of crossing into the United States, intent on destroying everything in its path.\n\n\"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican,\" he told a crowd in Missouri on November 2 . Time and time again over those final days, Trump repeated this mantra: \"This will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravans, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense.\"\n\nAnd to some extent, Trump's strategy worked. Roughly 1 in 4 voters said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, according to the 2018 exit polls ; 75% of that group voted for Republicans in the House while just 23% voted for the Democrat. Fear, as Trump learned in the 2016 election, is an extremely powerful political motivator. There were anecdotes from all over the country as the campaign came to a close in which voters said they were very worried about the group of migrants storming into the United States and endangering them and their way of life.\n\nThis quote, from Carol Shields, a 75-year-old woman living in northern Minnesota, to The New York Times about the idea of members of the group occupying peoples' lake houses in the state is indicative of the effectiveness of the fear Trump stoked.\n\n\"What's to stop them? We have a lot of people who live on lakes in the summer and winter someplace else. When they come back in the spring, their house would be occupied.\"\n\n(Sidebar: While Trump's use of immigration to scare his base into voting clearly had some effect on turnout, it wasn't determinative. Democrats, spurred by their base's deep distaste for Trump, scored major gains at the House, gubernatorial and state legislative levels while holding their own with a very difficult Senate election map .)\n\nTo be clear: There was NEVER any evidence that what Trump was saying about the caravan was true. When Trump began to talk about the migrants -- in mid-October -- they had just crossed into Mexico and were hundreds of miles from the US border. Trump's claim that \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in\" with the group lacked any proof. (Pressed later on that idea, Trump admitted \"there's no proof of anything but they could very well be.\")\n\nBut now, with the election eight days in our rear-view mirror -- and with only a handful of uncalled races remaining -- the bald cynicism of Trump's rhetoric on the migrants, and his decision to send 5,000 US troops to protect the border , is totally revealed.\n\nIf the caravan was such a threat to the country in the middle of October -- so much so that Trump dispatched troops to the border to deal with the \"threat\" -- then how can they be less of a threat today? They're closer to the border today than they were three weeks ago, right? Right. In fact, on Tuesday, the leading edge of the caravan -- those traveling in buses -- reached the border crossing near Tijuana\n\nAnd yet, silence from Trump. If this was truly a major threat to our country's safety and well-being, wouldn't you expect the President of the United States, who built his entire presidential campaign around his tough stance on illegal immigration, to be speaking out forcefully right about now? Of course you would.\n\nThat Trump hasn't said a word about the caravan since the election is proof positive that this was all a political ploy from beginning to end. Trump was worried that the GOP base wasn't as fired up as the Democratic one -- and, rightly, was worried that such a passion disparity could lead to major losses in the 2018 election. So when he saw the news that a group of migrants was moving toward the United States, he seized on it and wouldn't let go. Until, that is, the election ended."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Laura Jarrett, CNN", "title": "DOJ says Whitaker's appointment as attorney general is constitutional", "description": "The Justice Department issued a defense of President Donald Trump's controversial appointment of Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general Wednesday, offering several reasons why the appointment is consistent with the Constitution, federal statutes and past pr\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/whitaker-justice-mueller/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181109111414-01-matthew-whitaker-lead-image-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:10:35Z", "content": "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department issued a defense of President Donald Trump's controversial appointment of Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general Wednesday, offering several reasons why the appointment is consistent with the Constitution, federal sta\u2026 [+1889 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department issued a defense of President Donald Trump's controversial appointment of Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general Wednesday, offering several reasons why the appointment is consistent with the Constitution, federal statutes and past precedent.\n\nThe memo provides a robust legal justification for Whitaker's right to lead the Justice Department, which includes ultimate oversight authority over special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn a 20-page memo addressed to the White House from DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel -- the chief legal interpreter of federal law for the administration -- the department concludes that:\n\n* Whitaker's appointment is consistent with the plain terms of the Vacancies Reform Act, \"because he had been serving in the Department of Justice at a sufficiently senior pay level for over a year\" as the statute requires.\n\n* Whitaker is only serving on a temporary basis, so he wasn't required to be confirmed by the Senate ahead of his selection last week, though the Justice Department acknowledged that situation had not come up in over a century.

But the data underscore the major challenges faced by many of the world's largest economies.\n\nGermany's economy shrank for the first time since 2015 in the third quarter. It was hit by new auto emissions testing procedures that slowed car sales and a decline in exports, partly due to the US-China trade war.\n\nThe car certification bottleneck is expected to ease, but economists say export growth could weaken further because of reduced demand from major trading partners such as Turkey , Russia and China.\n\nJapan is much more accustomed to economic stagnation, and even recessions, but the outlook there is brighter. Its lackluster third quarter was caused by natural disasters, and economists expect consumer spending to spike this quarter ahead of a planned sales tax hike next October.\n\nIn China, the world's second largest economy, new data Wednesday revealed weaker consumption growth, subdued confidence and disappointing credit growth. Economists expect the government to ramp up stimulus measures to mitigate the effects of a trade war with the United States.\n\n\"We believe the worse is yet to come, with growth slowing faster into spring 2019,\" Ting Lu, chief China economist at investment bank Nomura, wrote in a research note.\n\nAnd despite the prospect of a rebound in Germany and Japan before the end of this year, the global economy is also heading for a weaker 2019.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund expects global growth to slow to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% this year.\n\nRisks clouding the global outlook include the trade war and the impact of US interest rate hikes on emerging markets.

community are largely annoyed about how their community has generally been portrayed by mainstream media outlets.\n\nMost feel like depictions of sexual fetishists wearing furry costumes and cavorting at wild parties are inaccurate and downright unfair, say experts.\n\nFor the unaware, we're talking about a worldwide community estimated at hundreds of thousands strong who call themselves the furry fandom.\n\nThey're made up of old and young, all genders, CEOs, blue-collar workers, singles, couples, parents, students, LGBTQ and straight \u2014 all who celebrate fantasy animal characters with human traits.\n\nHow do they celebrate? To each, their own. The different ways run the gamut.\n\nFor example, do you have an unusually powerful fascination with Bugs Bunny?\n\nWell then, you might be a furry.\n\nJUST WATCHED Revealing a furry alter ego Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Revealing a furry alter ego 01:04\n\nMaybe you like to doodle original animal characters that reflect your alter-ego or persona, aka your \"fursona.\"\n\nAgain, you could be a furry.\n\nWhat if you love your animal character so much you want to wear a costume of it?\n\nYou very well may be a furry.\n\nFor many furries, putting on their costume sparks a fascinating metamorphosis.\n\nTake longtime furry Joe Strike. When he puts on his reptilian costume, Strike transforms from self-described \"pretty mellow guy\" to a character he calls Komos.\n\n\"I become very sinister \u2014 very forceful and intimidating,\" says Strike, author of a book on the fandom called \"Furry Nation. \" \"It's so much fun to become that other person \u2014 this kind of mysterious, alluring character. Some women really take a shine to him and it's really a blast.\"\n\nBecause the colorful furry costumes get the most attention in the media, it supports the perception that furries are all about costumes. But they're not.\n\nIn fact, the co-founder of the first furry convention doesn't own a costume at all.\n\nYouTube furry video host Stormi Folf.\n\n\"If you honestly believe that furry fandom is about costuming, then you've missed the point,\" says Rod Stansfield, perhaps better known in the community by his pen name, Rod O'Riley. \"Saying furry fandom is about wearing fur suits is like saying 'Star Trek' fandom is about wearing pointy ears.\"\n\nOriginal 'ConFurence'\n\nIn the 1980s, Stansfield and his partner Mark Merlino \u2014 during visits to science fiction conventions \u2014 realized the furry fandom was becoming a bigger thing of its own. By 1989 they organized an \"experiment\" they called ConFurence Zero at a Holiday Inn in Garden Grove, California: the first known \"furry convention and seminar.\"\n\nAlthough only 65 people showed up, including only two or three in costume, ConFurence Zero started a movement of sorts.\n\nIt gave momentum to the fandom, later resulting in similar conventions such as Califur, Canada's VancouFur , Australia's ConFurgence Eurofurence and Anthrocon, which is now held yearly in Pittsburgh. Last summer's Anthrocon, one of the biggest, drew about 8,400 people, including nearly 2,000 in costumes, according to the event website.\n\n\"We don't feel like furry fandom is something we created, it's something that was there,\" Stansfield says. \"We were just the guys who introduced it to itself. We just came up with a goofy new way for fans to talk to each other \u2014 actually meeting, face to face. People took that and ran with it.\"\n\nThree decades later the fury fandom is much bigger, using the power of the internet to reach out, organize, engage with each other and share \u2014 via videos, podcasts and art.\n\nPocari Roo, Barton Fox and Stormi Folf are just a few of many furries who host video channels on YouTube discussing fursonas, affordable fursuits and other topics. \"I simply want to help the world understand our fandom a little better,\" says Stormi Folf, who prefers to use his fursona \"for reasons of privacy and safety.\"\n\n\"I'm known as a furry but only family and close friends know my real name,\" he said.\n\nMany furry fans create and share art depicting animal characters with human traits.\n\nFurry lingo\n\nIt's a subculture just like any other \u2014 including unique terminology.\n\nFor example, a \"greymuzzle\" is an older member of the furry fandom.\n\n\"Bronies\" are fans of the \"My Little Pony\" toy, TV and movie franchise.\n\nA \"therian\" is someone who feels an intense spiritual identification with a nonhuman animal.\n\nA \"babyfur\" is interested in age play and young or childlike characters.\n\nMilfurs are furries who are current or past members of the military.\n\nHere's one more: Furries who are into costumes are called fursuiters. And yes, #FursuitFriday is a real hashtag on social media.\n\nThe fandom has grown big enough to get the attention of academia. A group of scholars has established a continuing research project at furscience.com tracking furry attitudes and backgrounds by asking them to answer questions on surveys.\n\n\"Demographically, it's mostly white. They tend to be sort of middle class and they tend to be what you think of as nerds,\" says MacEwan University instructor Dr. Courtney Plante, who runs the study along with researchers at Niagara County Community College, Texas A&M University and other universities.\n\nThe project's website says more than 75% of furries are under age 25 and about a third identify as \"exclusively heterosexual.\"\n\nSixty percent of furries who answered surveys reported part-time or full-time enrollment in postsecondary education.\n\n\"They often like video games, computer games, board games, anime, science fiction, fantasy,\" Plante says.\n\nDancing is also big among fursuiters. In addition to costume dance events at conventions, nightspots have been getting involved. For more than a year now the Eagle Bolt Bar in Minneapolis has been hosting \"Suit Up Saturday,\" where 20-30 fursuiters, show up every week, the bar says.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage, 84%, identify as male.\n\nA female artist in the community who calls herself InkTiger says the mostly male fandom hasn't been a big problem for her. \"There's some sexism in the fandom, as there is in any other part of society. I don't think it's any more pronounced in furry than anywhere else.\"\n\nBut what does research say about fursuiters and sexual fetishes?\n\n\"We find that, with most furries and their fur suits, there's no sexual element to it for the vast majority of fursuiters,\" says Plante. \"It's because they want to be a cartoon character in the real world.\"\n\nBut just like any other group, furries acknowledge a small element of sexual activity during gatherings. In the community it's known as \"yiffing.\"\n\n\"Yiffing can refer to anything from affectionate hugging or nuzzling to totally going at it,\" says Strike. \"It's definitely part of the fandom but it's not what the fandom is all about. If I had to throw a percentage on it I would say maybe 15%, give or take.\"\n\nStansfield, co-founder of the first convention, says it's sad the furry fandom is mischaracterized as a \"sex style.\"\n\n\"Everything created by human beings has some degree of what people think is attractive \u2014 and attractive is a big, broad unquantifiable word \u2014 however you define that.\"\n\nCan the furry fandom heal?\n\nA lot of furries have some kind of bullying history. Researchers found they reported \"significantly more bullying than the average person.\" According to furscience.com, 61.7% of furries reported being bullied from the ages 11-18.\n\nCompare that with bullying rates among US students grades 6-12. About 28% have reported being bullied, according to stopbullying.gov . Internationally, a World Health Organization survey of 35 countries found 34% of all young people reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months.\n\nJUST WATCHED There are 'furries' of all ages Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH There are 'furries' of all ages 01:35\n\n\"Research shows that furries benefit from ... interaction with like-minded others in a recreational environment, which is associated with greater self-esteem and greater life satisfaction,\" the website says. Experts don't know if this benefit within furry culture attracts victims of bullying but it could contribute to helping bullying victims heal.\n\nStrike explains it this way: \"When they put on the fur suit and they become somebody else, it is very liberating. You've sort of left behind that human person with all those inhibitions and problems. You become this kind of free spirit. You become somebody else who you're not the rest of the time.\"\n\nThe fandom tends to be shy, Plante says. Costumes make it easier to socialize \"without fear of being judged.\"\n\nBottom line: Research shows that for the most part, they may be more \"normal\" than you think. \"The interesting part of the story is just how surprisingly normal furries can be despite having a strange hobby,\" says Plante.\n\nThe future of furries\n\nThe future looks bright for the furry fandom. Plante estimates the fandom is between 100,000 and 1 million people \u2014 and growing. \"I don't think it will ever become mainstream, because it's an unusual hobby to have. But I think as time goes on, it will be normalized in the way 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars' fans became normalized, in the way 'Lord of the Rings' fans became normalized.\"\n\nIf normalization does come via movies, Stansfield hopes technology will pave the way for it by making it cheaper and easier for furries to make Hollywood-quality films.\n\n\"The turning point will be when we get to the level where a fan can make a Pixar movie in their garage,\" he says. \"When that happens, more and more of the entertainment community is going to notice.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Heather Kelly, CNN Business", "title": "Google wants its virtual assistant in every room of your house", "description": "The Google Assistant Smart Home is a beautiful multi-million-dollar home outfitted with every Google device and connected home gadget imaginable.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/tech/google-demo-home/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181009133950-google-home-hub-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:28:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Inside a beautiful multi-million-dollar house in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company set up a model smart home outfitted with every Google device and connected home gadget imaginable.\n\nThe one-day demo highlighted an assortment of new Google Assistant features coming in the weeks ahead. There are recipe recommendations on smart displays and custom alarms for children recorded by actors from popular cartoons.\n\nThe tour was also a chance to see how Google ( GOOGL ) imagines people living, parenting and even sleeping surrounded by its products.\n\nSmart speakers have given new life to the smart home market, which was struggling to move past its early-adopter beginnings before Amazon's ( AMZN ) voice assistant Alexa came along. Now the major companies, including Amazon , Samsung, Apple ( AAPL ) and Google, are fighting to lure customers into their own ecosystems.\n\nThe assistant personalities are different, but the applications are mostly the same.\n\nIn Google's model home, most appliances are either internet-connected or plugged into a smart plug that lets you turn them on with a voice command. Communication is constant and everywhere \u2014 between rooms and family members who aren't in the house.\n\nA feature lets a member of the household broadcast a message to every room, such as \"I'll be home in 20 minutes, start the rice maker.\" It'll now let the person at home reply, so it's like a phone call or text message conversation but through speakers.\n\nIn addition, Google smart displays will now show recommended recipes based on the time of day and year. If you make a mess while cooking, just ask Google to send out the robotic vacuum.\n\nParenting is the newest hot area for voice assistants, and the Google house was set up to show how it could work for a family with kids. Ask Google Assistant to read your children a bedtime story, and it can tell them stories about Dora the Explorer and PAW Patrol. If you'd prefer to read your kids a book yourself, you can ask Google Assistant to \"read along\" with a book it knows and it will play matching music and sound effects in the background.\n\nParents are increasingly using alarms to help time kids' screen time, tooth brushing or studying. To build on this, Google Assistant is adding alarms voiced by characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and LEGO City. If you want to wake up your children without walking to their room, you could ask Google to turn up the lights or play music in their room while you sip coffee downstairs.\n\nUpstairs in the master bedroom, adults can unwind by asking Google to put their phone on silent mode. The next morning, an alarm will go off and trigger a routine, automatically starting a coffee maker near the bed and reciting the day's weather and headlines.\n\nVoice assistants may have started in a single room for playing music, but Google's house previews a future where almost every room has an always-listening microphone, a speaker, camera and a screen of some sort. (There was no bathroom demo on the tour, but it's safe to say they'll be there soon too.)\n\nThe future Google is selling can seem unnecessary and sometimes pricey, but it could be incredibly convenient for a busy family. Unless the power goes out. Then they'd just have to sweep and parent on their own."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Lion Air pilots were unaware of new features, says expert", "description": "CNN Aviation Analyst Mary Schiavo says the Lion Air pilots in October's deadly crash were unaware of the new safety features on Boeing 737 Max.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/14/ns-nov-14-intvw-boeing-witholds-info-mary-schiavo.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181107150444-02-lion-air-1104-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:25:21Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The coming years will allow us to evaluate where we stand.\"\n\nThe excavations started in the area in 2013 and were centered on the rich Hellenistic and Roman burial sites surrounding the city, where archaeologists discovered nine new tombs this year.\n\nFindings from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the vicinity of Chiliomodi Credit: Greek Culture Ministry\n\nThe team, however, also excavated extensive building facilities in a 672-meter square area for the first time this year, which are believed to be remnants of the ancient city itself.\n\nKorka said that her team found key clues of the city's presence, including children buried in the foundations of walls. \"We found child burials; during the Roman times it was very strict where you bury the dead, and only babies were allowed to be kept inside buildings in the city -- all the rest had to be buried outside,\" she said.\n\nThe team also excavated a series of buildings, where they found organized rooms with housing facilities and door openings.\n\nInside the buildings, archaeologists found portions of clay, marble and stone floors, along with well-crafted walls, some of which were covered in mortar.\n\nBronze Age discovery: Is this Britain's Pompeii?\n\nThey also discovered a large storage jar, a pythamphorae, along with a 3.5-meter section of a long clay pipeline, believed to have been used for sewage.\n\nKorka said that researchers may have also uncovered the presence of an atrium, with architraves, columns and other architectural features located in the interior of the structures. The lead archaeologist described the city's construction as \"luxurious\" and noted that the buildings were \"very strong and very well done.\"\n\nThe ancient city of Tenea was founded approximately 9 miles south-east of Corinth and 12 miles north-east of Mycenae shortly after the Trojan war. The first inhabitants of the city are believed to have been Trojan prisoners of war, who were permitted to build their own town by Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, in the aftermath of the battle.\n\nKorka explained that the team discovered indications of the city's significant wealth, including 200 rare coins dating from early Hellenistic to the late Roman times.\n\nSeveral of these coins belong to the Emperor Septimius Severus (193-211 BC), which indicate that the settlement likely experienced particular economic growth during his dynasty.\n\nKorka said that her team will continue to excavate areas surrounding the current finds, and aim to slowly develop a topographical map of the city. The archaeologists will also focus on new branches of research, including exploring the effects of endemic diseases on ancient populations."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Oren Liebermann, Amir Tal and Andrew Carey, CNN", "title": "Israeli Defense Minister resigns in protest over Gaza ceasefire", "description": "Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman announced his resignation on Wednesday and called for early elections because of his opposition to a ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza that brought an end to the worst fighting since the 2014 war.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/middleeast/israel-defense-minister-resigns-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114113321-01-avigdor-liberman-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:11:42Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman announced his resignation on Wednesday and called for early elections because of his opposition to a ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza that brought an end to the worst fighting since the 2014 war.\n\nCalling the ceasefire \"giving in to terror,\" the hard-line leader of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party said at an afternoon news conference in Jerusalem: \"We are buying quiet for a short time at a very high price for long-term security.\"\n\n\"From my perspective, what happened yesterday -- the ceasefire yesterday -- with all of the arrangements with Hamas, is giving in to terror.

For example, those cities submitted a comprehensive request for information (RFI) from Amazon following the company's site visits, containing a multitude of detailed questions about talent, real estate, regulations and more.\n\nAmazon itself has said it would use the information from the process when considering opening new facilities, such as warehouses and smaller corporate offices.\n\nAnd that's already happening. On Tuesday, the company announced that it would open an East Coast hub in Nashville, which was on the HQ2 short list. It will hire 5,000 workers for the facility, which will focus on customer fulfillment, transportation and supply chain activities. (The announcement came at the same time as Amazon's HQ2 decision : New York's Long Island City neighborhood and Virginia's Arlington will split duty as its second headquarters.)\n\nEven contenders not on the short list are already getting investments from Amazon. Since the HQ2 search started, Amazon has announced fulfillment centers in Spokane, Washington, and Ottawa, as well as a new office in Vancouver with jobs in fields like machine learning and cloud computing.\n\nAmazon also could use the information obtained in the HQ2 process to better pinpoint where the best talent is located in the United States.\n\n\"At the heart of this is talent,\" said UVA's Lenox. \"Having a better understanding of where talent may reside across the US is valuable to them. It may help with future recruiting.\"\n\nData could also give Amazon an advantage in future negotiations with communities, especially if they know what incentives are available.\n\n\"Amazon can go back and say, 'You barked up these incentives for HQ2. But what can you do for me now?'\" University of Toronto's Florida said.\n\nHowever, there could be downsides. For example, cities may not be as willing to offer the same big incentives for a smaller facility and some proposed real estate sites may no longer be available in a few years.\n\nEither way, Amazon walks away a winner. It has two new headquarters to call home, and a wealth of data on where to go next."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Tara John, CNN", "title": "Fianc\u00e9e of Lion Air crash victim takes wedding photos alone", "description": "Intan Syari, the fianc\u00e9e of Lion Air crash victim Rio Nanda Pratama went ahead and took her wedding pictures alone -- fulfilling his final wish for her to do the shoot if he ever failed to return.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/asia/lion-air-crash-fiancee-scli-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114123042-07-lion-air-fiancee-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:01:18Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) November 11 was meant to be the day Intan Syari married her fianc\u00e9.\n\nBut her husband-to-be, Rio Nanda Pratama, was killed in late October when Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the sea near Jakarta, Indonesia, soon after taking off.\n\nOn Sunday, which should have been the couple's happy day, Syari went ahead and took her wedding pictures alone -- fulfilling Pratama's final wish for her to do the shoot if he ever failed to return.\n\nThe photographer told CNN that \"thanks to the strength of her heart the photographs turned out well.\"\n\n\"Even though I feel grief that I cannot describe, I still have to smile for you,\" she wrote in the caption of a series of pictures shared on Instagram . \"I cannot be sad but should be strong like you always told me to be.\"\n\nPratama was killed in late October when Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the sea near Jakarta.\n\nSyari describes Pratama, who was a doctor, in older Instagram posts as her first love.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Lisa Respers France, CNN", "title": "Netflix snags Cardi B, Chance and T.I. for music competition show", "description": "Netflix is getting into the music competition business with some major star power.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/entertainment/cardi-b-ti-chance-netflix/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114072713-ti-cardi-b-chance-the-rapper-split-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:56:05Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Netflix is getting into the music competition business with some major star power.\n\nThe streaming giant has announced that superstar rappers Cardi B, Chance the Rapper, and T.I. will search for the next breakout hip-hop star as part of \"Rhythm + Flow,\" Netflix's first music competition show set to debut in 2019.\n\nThe trio will serve as the main judges for the competition looking for unsigned, undiscovered talent.\n\nThey will be joining forces with additional artists and industry VIPs who will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe three rappers all promoted the news Tuesday on their social media accounts, with T.I. saying the search will go all over, from beauty shops to malls.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Lisa Respers France, CNN", "title": "Pink's husband, Carey Hart, has warning for wildfire looters", "description": "Carey Hart sent a message to those who might take advantage of the evacuations resulting from the California wildfires.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/entertainment/carey-hart-wildfire-looters/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181114124051-carey-hart-pink-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:55:55Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Carey Hart has sent a message to those who might take advantage of evacuations resulting from the California wildfires.\n\nLoot at your own risk.\n\nThe former professional motocross competitor who is married to singer Pink posted a photo on his official Instagram account Tuesday showing armed men, some wearing bandanas and masks to shield the lower part of their faces, standing with a sign that reads, \"Looters will be shot on site.

But they do mean the scientists must redo their calculations.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature on November 1, found that \"ocean warming is at the high end of previous estimates.\" The researchers, led by Laure Resplandy of Princeton University, used precise measurements of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide between 1991 and 2016 to produce an independent estimate of ocean heat uptake over that period.\n\nSince publication, two problems had come to their attention, Keeling said, one of them related to incorrectly treating systematic errors in the measurements of oxygen.\n\n\"We expect the combined effect of these two corrections to have a small impact on our calculations of overall heat uptake, but with larger margins of error,\" said Keeling. \"We are redoing the calculations and preparing author corrections for submission to Nature.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\"\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645

It follows similar warnings made last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which found that the earth will reach the crucial 1.5 degree threshold as early as 2030.\n\n\"The G20 economies actually need to cut their emissions by half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C,\" said Jan Burck, senior adviser at equality NGO Germanwatch, one of the report's authors.

It defends itself as an unbiased home for unfettered speech, but it has taken part in anti-Semitic commentary, deleted tweets show.\n\nSince Gab's inception in 2016, its founders have been open about their intention to create what amounts to a space for right-wing people who feel unwelcome on mainstream social media platforms.\n\n\"Gab welcomes everyone, but sees a unique opportunity to carve a niche in a massively underserved and unrepresented market. We estimate that there are over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist internet users from around the world who are seeking an alternative to the current social networking ecosystems,\" Gab stated in a company filing dated July 11, 2017.\n\nGab's terms of service prohibited \"calling for the acts of violence against others, promoting or engaging in self-harm, and/or acts of cruelty, (and) threatening language or behavior that clearly, directly and incontrovertibly infringes on the safety of another user or individual(s).\"\n\nBrothers allegedly had several guns\n\nA review of records in the District of Columbia showed that four guns were registered to the brothers, including a Remington Arms handgun and a Mossberg Maverick 88 shotgun registered to Jeffrey Clark, according to the affidavit.\n\nIn addition to the weapons Jeffery Clark owns, the affidavit says, officers recovered a Colt .38 special handgun that he surrendered.

In this case, police were more dangerous to him than an active shooter who he apparently subdued,\" Sheley said in a statement\n\n\"The police killing of Mr. Roberson was avoidable.

The Nelson campaign hopes that some sort of machine error or ballot design left their votes out of count. If that is the case, that could mean a new batch of votes. Then come the lawsuits. Nelson's lawyers are pinning their hopes on four specific lawsuits. Every single one of them is directly targeted at finding more votes. The more votes that can be counted, the greater the possibility they can close the gap. On a conference call Tuesday night, Marc Elias, Nelson's lead lawyer, said there is the potential of \"many thousands\" of new votes that could be counted if his lawsuits are successful.\n\nAbout those lawsuits\n\nWednesday is a crucial day. A federal judge will hear arguments in the Nelson claim that Florida's signature match law should be tossed. The law requires people who vote by mail to sign their ballot. That signature must closely resemble the signature first used when they registered to vote. If it doesn't, the vote doesn't count. Nelson's lawyers believe this standard is unfair and disenfranchises a whole host of voters. We may not know immediately how the judge will rule in this case. The hearing could be lengthy -- given the witness list it could go two to three hours. We don't know when the judge will issue his decision, but it is possible that he could hand it down right from the bench. The ruling could provide a big clue as to where these legal battles are headed. A win or loss for either side could foreshadow the direction of all these cases, and as we said before, Nelson needs to win just about everything to have a realistic shot of turning the tide. The signature lawsuit is just one of many lawsuits dealing with similar interpretations or challenges to Florida voter law. On Tuesday, the judge warned that not all the suits will have hearings, and it is quite possible that decisions in any of these cases could come down at any time.\n\nMark Walker -- senator maker?\n\nSpeaking of those lawsuits, the man at the center of almost all of them is Judge Mark Walker, an interesting and independent character. By a quirk in the system, Walker is the only judge in a position to hear cases like these. The original judge had to recuse himself because he was hearing another case involving the Scott administration. A second judge could not be assigned to any of the cases because his son is a county election supervisor. As a result, Walker is presiding over seven cases (and counting?) involving the recount. Walker has a history with Scott. He is an Obama appointee who had the support of Sen. Marco Rubio. He famously forced Florida to extend voter registration deadlines during the heat of the 2016 election in the wake of Hurricane Matthew after Scott declined to do so. Scott's record in front of Walker is pretty poor, but Republicans are hopeful because they believe Walker's track record on election law related matters plays in their favor. It was his ruling on a previous lawsuit related to the signature match standard that led to the existing law. One thing is for sure: his rulings could play a big role in who the next senator from Florida ends up being.\n\nWill the recount be extended?\n\nThe short answer is maybe, but if it is, it won't be for a very long time. The Democrats have filed a lawsuit asking for the deadline to be extended. Elias said on his Tuesday night conference call that there is no \"real rush\" to get the count done because the next senator won't be seated until January. (Yes, that made the hearts of the newly-made, unofficial CNN Tallahassee Bureau stop.) But there is probably no real need for it to go on indefinitely. The vast majority of counties will have their recount done with time to spare. Those who need extra time, may only need a day or two. After Elias scared us into thinking we needed to go Christmas tree shopping in the Florida panhandle, he said the extension needs are \"likely days, not weeks.\" Phew. Regardless, it won't matter under any circumstance unless the Democrats win their court case.\n\nWill the real senator from Florida please stand up?\n\nWe saw Nelson in the flesh for the first time since before the election on Tuesday. He appeared with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and recited the same talking points his campaign has been pushing since it became clear the race was going to a recount. He took no questions. In fact, he has yet to take a question of any kind from anyone since before Election Day. On Tuesday, though, we were reminded that he is still the senator, and those optics are important. Wednesday, it will be Scott's turn. The governor will descend on Capitol Hill in the role of senator-elect. He will appear with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the other new freshmen senators (including Sen.-elect Mitt Romney), and he will vote in leadership elections. It is not as if Scott has been incredibly accessible during this process either. He, too, held a new conference where he took no questions. However, he has conducted some interviews, albeit with mostly friendly outlets, and has stuck to talking points. For one Wednesday in November, it might be almost like Florida has three senators, with Nelson, \"Senator-elect\" Scott and Rubio all on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe future of Brenda Snipes"}, {"source":

Courtesy Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nBIG partner Daniel Sundlin told CNN Travel the hotel's multipurpose roof symbolizes connection, aiming to forge ties between locals and guests, as well as the outdoors and indoors.\n\n\"Quite early in the process we fell in love with this idea of a terrace building that follows the topography, the site is essentially sitting in a slope,\" he says.\n\nInside, there will be two restaurants, a bar, a spa and conference center alongside hotel rooms.\n\n\"Audemars Piguet wanted a hotel that feels more like a guesthouse, than a traditional hotel,\" adds Sundlin.\n\nAll the rooms will be connected by a sloping corridor, designed to mimic a ski trail.\n\nSo how do you ski down the hotel roof?\n\n\"Essentially there's a local cross-country trail just in front of the building,\" explains Sundlin. \"So in the wintertime you will be able to enter the roof terraces directly from the hotel room corridors, and there will be an adjacent space where you can change gear and put your skis on and essentially just ski down the ramp and out into nature. \"\n\nRelated content What a million-dollar ski vacation looks like\n\nSeamlessly connected\n\nThe hotel's glamorous interior. Courtesy Bjarke Ingels Group\n\n\"Being able to ski directly out of your hotel room into the landscape will give plenty of people a seamless and exciting way to explore their surroundings,\" says Sundlin.\n\n\"On the other hand, it will also give the local skiing community direct access to the hotel. \"\n\nIn the summer the slopes will be covered in grass.

names in motorsport.\n\nSince entering Formula One in 1977, Williams has won seven drivers' championships with legendary drivers like Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill.\n\nOne of the most successful names in the sport's history, boasting nine constructors' titles, the eponymous team started by Frank Williams has fallen on fallow times.\n\nThe team's two drivers, Canadian Lance Stroll and Russia's Sergey Sorotkin, have picked up just seven points from 19 races this season.\n\nIt's been 21 years since Williams was last won a title and Pastor Maldonado's victory at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix is its sole triumph in the past 14 seasons.\n\nBut the rebuild has begun. Claire Williams, daughter of Frank, is now deputy team principal while Paddy Lowe, the architect of much of Mercedes' current success, is chief technical officer.\n\n\"The first 20 years of Williams have been a lot better than the second,\" Lowe told CNN Sport, well versed in Williams' glory days having started his F1 journey with the team back in 1987.\n\nHis six-year tenure at the British manufacturer included title wins for Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell and Prost before switching to McLaren, where he enjoyed another period of success followed by his title-winning run at Mercedes.\n\n'The biggest challenge of my career'\n\nBut Lowe has no plans to rest on his laurels as he tries to manufacture a motor racing renaissance.\n\n\"That history is not so significant as it's a long time ago and the sport has changed,\" he said. \"Of course, I have an emotional attachment to back then as that's where it really began for me.\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet ex-Williams racer Valtteri Bottas: Finland's F1 hero Replay More Videos ...

It takes a different way of thinking, and I knew it would be difficult when I took the role one-and-a-half years ago.\n\n\"But even if you're fighting for eighth, ninth and 10th, it's still the same hard work, and there's no lack of complexity in our car compared to the others.\"\n\nThe rebuild is partly built on loyalty from staff and fans alike, who have stuck with Williams through thick and thin.\n\nLowe tells the story of a member of staff who left the company earlier this month after 39-and-a-half years, virtually the entirety of the team's lifespan.\n\n\"At McLaren, you'd had out five or 10-year medals for long service,\" he said. \"At Williams, if you get to 10 years, you're only just getting started.\"\n\nHitting rock bottom\n\nLowe aims to harness that loyalty, a loyalty that Williams herself has occasionally feared would be eroded.\n\nWilliams has a young son, Nate, but its the plight of her team that is giving her the most sleepless nights.\n\nJUST WATCHED Claire Williams: the humble F1 team leader Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Claire Williams: the humble F1 team leader 03:54\n\n\"I constantly think about Williams,\" she said. \"You can never entirely switch that off and, for the first time this year, getting to sleep has been a problem.\"\n\nShe describes the current situation as \"heartbreaking\" having initially thought developments over the winter would see Williams once more be battling the frontrunners.\n\n\"It's just soul destroying to see the team fall back as it has,\" she said. \"But I like a challenge, and we've got that.

California wildfires\n\nFirefighters in Southern California have a brand-new blaze to battle. The Sierra Fire sparked up overnight and is burning through about 20 acres east of Los Angeles County. But there's some good news. The firefight may not be as rough as with other blazes because forecasters predict the swirling winds that have fueled the fires will slowly begin to decrease today, with favorable conditions lasting a couple days.\n\nSo far, 48 people have been killed in the northern part of the state by the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, while two have died in the Woolsey Fire, in Southern California. Officials fear the number will rise as search teams comb through rubble and ashes in the town of Paradise , which was wiped out by the Camp Fire. It's just been a hellish time in California. In the past week, more than 230,000 acres have burned -- more area than Chicago and Boston combined. And in the past 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes , Cal Fire said.\n\n2. White House\n\nNow that the midterms are (sort of) over, it looks like there's going to be some turnover at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And not all of it will be orchestrated by the President. First lady Melania Trump shocked the heck out of everybody when she put out a stinging statement seeking the ouster of senior national security adviser Mira Ricardel . Now, President Trump seems poised to fire her. Ricardel reportedly ran afoul of the first lady after feuding with her staff over her recent trip to Africa (about plane seats and National Security Council resources).\n\nBut that's not all the potential people-moving that could happen. The President is reportedly looking at replacements for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, as well. It's not unusual for a White House to retool after midterms, but this seems more tumultuous.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ...

The so-called draft deal will be discussed today during an emergency meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May's Cabinet. It's not clear just what's in this agreement, but the main sticking point had been over the Irish border. Currently, the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market, so goods passing between them do not need customs inspections. The sides wanted to avoid a \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and Ireland (which will remain in the EU), which would require infrastructure and customs checks. May wanted to strike a deal now to get it ratified by the time Britain is due to leave the EU at the end of March.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sinn F\u00e9in leader: Brexit threatens Irish peace Replay More Videos ...

Now comes shock over the suspects arrested in the crime -- all from another Ohio family. Police arrested four members of the Wagner family yesterday in connection with the shooting deaths of Rhoden family members. Authorities said the Wagners planned the crimes for months, learning the Rhodens' routines, the layouts of their homes and where they slept. The motive for all this violence may have something to do with a child custody dispute, Ohio's attorney general said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Arrests made in 2016 killings of Ohio family Replay More Videos ...

For me it's the year-end finale. I love playing here.\n\n\"The radio interview that happened over a week ago that surfaces now in French, Julien, who is a nice guy, I know him since the junior times, I think all of this has been totally taken out of context.\"\n\nPhotos: How the final was won The trophy was sweet for Roger Federer after he won a 20th major at the Australian Open.

Republicans, on the other hand, will seek to keep the statute in place.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one part of a broader Democratic effort in Florida to fight against certain statutes that have put in dispute ballots they believe should be considered lawfully cast. Democrats, led by top lawyer Marc Elias, have filed at least four lawsuits in federal court, all of which look to either extend the time counties need to recount votes or grow the pool of votes that are legally allowed to be considered by county election officials.\n\n\"All of these cases attempt to bring some common sense to the administration of a recount code that was passed after 2000,\" Elias told reporters on Tuesday, referencing the prolonged presidential recount between Al Gore and George W. Bush.\n\nThe reason for this attention is simple: Democrats trail in the state's top two statewide races, but party officials believe there is a slim chance when all votes are counted they could close the gap and emerge victorious.\n\nThe most pressing race in question is between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and challenger Rick Scott, the Republican governor. Scott led Nelson in the unofficial, pre-recount tally by more than 12,500 votes.\n\nThe gubernatorial contest between Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is a different scenario. DeSantis led Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, and Democrats in the state are cognizant that margin will probably not be overcome in a recount. Still, Gillum withdrew his election night concession over the weekend with a message that every vote should be counted.\n\nElias and Democratic lawyers will argue on Wednesday that more votes need to be considered, telling the judge that Florida's signature match law disenfranchises the ill and elderly, people of color and young voters. And, in a preview of what could be the heart of the argument on Wednesday, Elias told reporters on Tuesday that the people judging the signatures are not experts and that there are a host of reasons people have different signatures.\n\n\"There are any number of reason why signatures don't match from one to another,\" he said, citing whether people use a middle name, nicknames, went slow or fast or used a maiden name vs. married name.\n\n\"When you look at those laws and you look at the affect they have, they are not effective anti-fraud measures, what they are is disenfranchisement measures,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have long believed that the Democratic strategy on the recount was to turn this process into a legal battle.\n\nRepublican lawyers are expected to go after Elias on Wednesday, particularly on whether he is making one argument in Florida that conflicts with one he is making in Arizona, where Democrats are also litigating similar laws on mail in ballots and signatures.\n\n\"Democrats in Arizona are using the opposite and contradictory argument to the one they plan to use in court tomorrow in Tallahassee,\" Scott's campaign said in a statement on Tuesday. \"For them, this isn't about following the law and it isn't about having a free and fair election. This is about getting rid of Florida laws they don't like.\"\n\nMembers of the Scott campaign are frustrated because they feel like they are playing by Florida's rules. These laws were purposely re-written and hashed out in the wake of the 2000 presidential election recount. They argue the legal strategy by Elias and company is specifically designed to undo Florida law, piece by piece.\n\nIn addition to the signature match lawsuit that will be heard Wednesday, Elias and Democrats have filed three other legal challenges that are making their way through the federal legal system in Florida.\n\nNelson's campaign and the Democratic Party's Senate campaign arm sued in federal court on Tuesday to lift the deadlines on the statewide recount taking place in Florida, arguing that they are \"arbitrary\" and \"impose a severe burden ... on the right to vote.\"\n\nIf successful, the suit would do away with the Thursday deadline for the machine recount to provide counties with enough time to recount all votes.\n\n\"We have asked the federal courts to take the common-sense steps to ensure that every county has a chance to complete those phases of a recount without interruption,\" Elias said.\n\nThere are signs at least some counties may not finish the recount by the Thursday deadline. Late on Tuesday, old and overheated vote counting machines in Palm Beach forced election officials there to start over their count of early vote ballots, erasing more than a day's worth of work.\n\n\"We're disappointed by the mechanical problems that are going to cause a further delay in the recount,\" Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told reporters Tuesday night. \"It became evident through the vigorous pace of counting that the machines used for the recount were starting to get stressed.\"\n\nBucher said that 179,000 early voting ballots did not tabulate properly and must be counted once more. She did not specify how long this would set back the county's timetable, but the set back is almost certain to dampen confidence Bucher had in finishing at least the Senate portion of the count by Thursday.\n\nDemocrats have also filed suit to ensure vote-by-mail ballots postmarked before Election Day that didn't make it to election officials on time are counted.\n\n\"It is not reasonable for peoples' votes to be taken away from them and for them to be disenfranchised based on the speed with which the US Postal Service can deliver these ballots,\" Elias said. \"There is no reason why a Floridian in Ottawa ought to have their ballot counted when a retired veteran in Pensacola who mailed the ballot on the same day and it didn't get here in time shouldn't.\"\n\nAnother suit seeks to clarify how a voter's intent is judged when they incorrectly fill out a ballot.\n\nThe crux of Elias' case seeking to clarify a voter's intent is twofold: The lawyer is partly questioning how people mark their ballots, especially in those cases where they are either deemed to have marked too many names or those where they marked too few, and how they note they made a mistake and want to change their vote.\n\n\"We can't deny people a right to vote because they choose to put Xs in some, oval, circle some names or fill in some ovals,\" Elias said before decrying the fact that Florida law requires people to write on their ballot that they made a mistake in voting, not just crossing out a vote.\n\n\"It says you can't cross out an errant vote with some marking, you have to use words,\" he said. \"A rule that says you can't cross out an errant vote and you have to use words is simply nonsensical.\"\n\nElias argued that these laws are \"discriminatory\" and unfairly impact people who don't use English as a primary language and people who are illiterate.\n\nAll of this has clearly annoyed Scott's team, who have taken an aggressive posture on Democrats broadly, but on Elias in particular.\n\nAides close to Scott believe that Democrats are attempting to re-write the rule book. That frustration has turned into accusations of possible fraud.\n\nScott aides often make it clear that Scott himself has never directly claimed there is fraud, but instead has said there is a \"possibility that fraud exists.\" They firmly believe that these lawsuits have the potential to change Florida law in a way that opens the door to problems down the road.\n\nThe Scott campaign hopes that argument resonates with voters as well.\n\n\"While Bill Nelson and his D.C. lawyer continue to file frivolous lawsuits attacking Florida's laws,\" Chris Hartline, a Scott campaign spokesman, said Tuesday, \"Senator-elect Rick Scott will remain focused on actually respecting the will of the voters.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Clare Foran and Ashley Killough, CNN", "title": "House GOP holds leadership elections to pick Paul Ryan successor", "description": "With House Speaker Paul Ryan headed for the exits, House Republicans will meet Wednesday to elect a new GOP leader for the next session of Congress.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/house-republican-elections-leader/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150930142852-kevin-mccarthy-steve-scalise-september-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:00:13Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) Rep.

But let me be very clear, if their agenda is simply investigations, impeachment, and not focused on the hardworking American public, we will be there to defend the American public,\" McCarthy said.\n\nTrump and McCarthy have spoken about leadership races recently, territory that Presidents usually avoid so not as to seem like they're alienating members of their own party. In private conversations, the President pushed for Jordan and another close conservative ally -- Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina -- to have the top Republican positions on key committees, according to a source familiar. McCarthy doesn't dole out those positions -- that's for the House GOP Steering Committee -- but plenty of people on the Steering Committee are loyal to McCarthy and would heed his word. As of Wednesday afternoon it was not clear where Jordan or Meadows would land.\n\nMeadows told reporters on Wednesday that he believes Jordan has \"earned\" the spot of ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"I think Jim has earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary, but that's not my call. That's going to be the Steering Committee's call, and certainly as we look at that they will be making those decisions after Thanksgiving,\" he said.\n\nPolitico first reported Wednesday that Trump has privately pushed McCarthy to make a deal with Jordan.\n\nA separate source confirmed to CNN that Jordan is interested in the ranking member position on the Judiciary Committee in order to check Democratic investigations that will be led by Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York.\n\nIn his race for minority leader, McCarthy positioned himself as a close ally of Trump. In a letter announcing his bid , he wrote, \"We need to lay the groundwork to regain the majority so that we can continue working alongside President Trump to fulfill our promise to fundamentally change Washington. I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again.\"\n\nAs minority leader, McCarthy will become the most visible face of opposition to the incoming Democratic majority. The next minority leader will have to decide whether and when the GOP minority might work to find common ground with Democrats and could also come under increased scrutiny from the President as the administration itself goes under a microscope in the new Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe leadership election comes as incoming freshmen lawmakers are in town for orientation.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, McCarthy said he does not believe that the President is to blame for House Republicans losing their majority, but he conceded that the party has work to do to improve its standing with voters, particularly in suburban areas.\n\n\"History is against us,\" he said. \"Any President in their first off-year election, on average, loses more than 30 seats.\"\n\nBut McCarthy added, \"We took a beating inside the suburban areas. We're going to have to work harder. I think our message is going to have to be clearer. Our ideas are going to have to be stronger. We realize that, and we will work toward that effort.\"\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "\u062a\u0633\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u062f

Their energy, perspective and determination will reshape one of the power centers in a man's town. These are the stories of Badass Women all around Washington . \u2014 Dana Bash, Bridget Nolan, Rachel Smolkin & Abigail Crutchfield\n\n(CNN) Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers was Cathy McMorris when she was first elected to the House in 2004.\n\nThirty-five years old and single, she headed to Washington for a new powerful job as a Republican congresswoman from Washington state -- and didn't know if having a family would happen for her.\n\n\"I expected finding a husband, finding a partner would be even more difficult with me in this position,\" McMorris Rodgers remembers.\n\nTo be sure, not all women are looking for a partner. Not all women want to have children. But McMorris Rodgers did. And like so many working in any profession -- never mind in Congress -- she worried that adding mother to her title could pass her by.\n\nThe reality of a woman's biological clock is a theme we unwittingly began exploring with this series, after Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao bravely admitted to us that she felt as though she missed out on having children , and often tells younger women not to make the mistake she did of not thinking it through.\n\nBut that is not McMorris Rodgers' story. During her first term in Congress she met now husband Brian Rodgers at a barbeque back home in Spokane.\n\n\"I so admire Brian,\" she grins, speaking with CNN for a recent interview. \"He is confident in who he is. He knows what's important to him, and he's comfortable with me, and he supports me wholeheartedly.\"\n\nHistory Making Mom\n\nCathy McMorris Rodgers is now the only woman in history to give birth three times while serving in Congress. In fact, she was the first to do it twice as well.\n\nShe still remembers telling then-House Speaker John Boehner that she was pregnant with her third at age 44.\n\n\"He looked at me, and he's like 'really?'\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful it happened, I'm grateful to be a mom, and I feel like I came very close to missing on that,\" McMorris Rodgers says. \"And in some ways it's the hardest thing that I've ever done and yet I think it's the best thing that I have done.\"\n\nHer first pregnancy was easy, until the end. During a routine ultrasound doctors spotted a blockage called \" duodenal atresia \" and McMorris Rodgers was warned that one out of three babies with that disorder is born with Down Syndrome. Her son Cole was part of the one in three.\n\n\"When I got the news it was tough, it's just not what you expect and in that moment, it's overwhelming, and part of it is just the fear of the unknown,\" McMorris Rodgers explains. \"And I wondered how I would ever talk about it even, and yet today I'm grateful, I am grateful for Cole. He brings me such joy, I am grateful for the influence that he's had on my life.\"\n\nHaving a child with disabilities has opened her eyes not just as a mother, but a lawmaker. She has worked to pass legislation like the so-called ABLE Act, which allows people with disabilities to open tax free savings accounts to help pay for their care.\n\n\"It's given me a whole new purpose and a passion for what I do on Capitol Hill and I find a lot of fulfillment in just knowing that I'm making a difference, not just for Cole, but millions of others who just happen to have a disability,\" she says.\n\nBack into the fight\n\nShe says her husband Brian sometimes acts as a boxing coach, which can come in handy in Washington.\n\n\"I'll retreat to my corner, and he'll clean me up and encourage me and then send me back into the fight,\" she says.\n\nHer most recent fight? Seeking re-election in her eastern Washington state district, which was harder this time around than it had been for her in the past ( CNN projects she won with just over 55% of the vote ).\n\nAnd the House Republican Conference Chair -- the highest ranking Republican woman -- made the decision not to run again for Republican leadership, after Steve Scalise announced he was going to run for House minority whip, a position McMorris Rodgers had been considering seeking. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming ran unopposed for the position McMorris Rodgers held for five years. McMorris Rodgers has since said she'll pursue a top position on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nStill, as we walk through her neighborhood in Spokane, she talks about growing up on a farm in Kettle Falls, Washington, where no one in her family had attended college. She was the first.\n\nAnd McMorris Rodgers remembers her 25-year-old self -- who had to be prodded to run for office in the first place.\n\n\"I had a lot of doubts and like a lot of women I told myself every reason why I shouldn't do it,\" she remembers.\n\n\"Some individuals who encouraged me, who saw something in me that I didn't see in myself and tapped me on the shoulder and say, 'Cathy, we think you should do it, we think you have something important to offer,' and I'm grateful for that,\" she adds.\n\nShe is hardly alone. Women, whatever their profession, tend to have a harder time feeling ready for a job, even though in most cases they are more than prepared.\n\n\"I think there's something in us that ... sometimes we're our own worst critic and instead of really focusing on what we have to offer and celebrating who we are, and our strengths, we can get caught up on the things we shouldn't be focusing on,\" she notes.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers is trying to make sure the new generation of women running for Congress has the help and the nudge that she appreciated so many years ago.\n\n\"I have made it a priority especially since I've been elected to Congress to reach out to other women and to do likewise because in recruiting women to run for office I hear them saying the same thing that I told myself,\" she says. \"And yet it's very important that they be encouraged to take that step.\"\n\nHow do you do it all? When will we stop asking?\n\nMcMorris Rodgers often is asked how she does it all. A key answer is that her husband, a retired naval commander, is now a stay-at-home father.\n\n\"He'll tell you it's harder than anything he did in the Navy,\" she says with a smile. \"And yet, I'm so grateful that he's doing that for our kids. He is carrying that load and being with them day in and day out. I mean it puts my heart at ease, those times when I am away longer than I would like to know that the kids are with Brian.\"\n\nShe is happy to serve as a role model for working moms, and hopes her story can inspire other women to follow in her footsteps.\n\n\"Whenever I talk to another woman whether they're married, or not, have kids, the first question they asked me is 'how do you do it?' And it's a lot of other people that make it possible, but if I can do it other women can do it,\" she says.\n\nBut McMorris Rodgers looks forward to the day when women like her aren't asked that question: how do you do it all?\n\n\"Men have done it one way and we become accustomed to the way that men may approach serving in Congress, having families, doing their roles. And women are going to do it a little different, and so it's still somewhat new,\" she explains.\n\n\"Sometimes we get caught up in how someone is doing it rather than just being focused on, wow she's she's getting it done, she's making a difference,\" she says.\n\nShe's admits -- that may take some time."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Un avi\u00f3n de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea de EE.UU. se estrella en Texas y deja un piloto muerto y otro herido", "description": "Un piloto muri\u00f3 y otro fue hospitalizado despu\u00e9s de que un avi\u00f3n se estrellara en una base de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Estados Unidos en Texas.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/14/un-avion-de-la-fuerza-aerea-de-ee-uu-se-estrella-en-texas-y-deja-un-piloto-muerto-y-otro-herido/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/cnn-base-texas.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:50:35Z", "content": "(CNN) - Un piloto muri\u00f3 y otro fue hospitalizado despu\u00e9s de que un avi\u00f3n se estrellara en una base de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Estados Unidos en Texas.

Our team believes we can make a run as long as we want to. There's no reason why we can't,\" he said.\n\nDespite his side's purple patch, Pulisic has been frustrated for the last few weeks.

They are, it has been said, making being smart \"sexy.\"\n\nOn one side of the board is reigning champion Magnus Carlsen, a 27-year-old Norwegian who, aged 14, was described by the Washington Post as the \"Mozart of chess.\" He models for G-Star, has endorsed Porsche, beaten Bill Gates in nine moves and 12 seconds, and is the highest-rated chess player in history. Forbes estimates his net worth at more than $8 million.\n\nAiming to topple one of the greats is challenger Fabiano Caruana -- the first American to compete for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972. He is the world No.2 and is described as having superhuman powers of concentration. By the end of this month he could be world champion.\n\nChess has not been this fascinating since Fischer, the first western world champion in the modern era, took on Soviet Boris Spassky at the height of the Cold War in 1972 in what was seen as a clash of east versus west, a battle between capitalism and communism.\n\nThere has not been a match between players this closely ranked in almost three decades.\n\nMagnus Carlsen (left) is reported to be worth more than $8M.\n\nCaruana, one year Carlsen's junior, has likened chess to MMA and boxing. Those who furrow their brow at such comparisons need only have watched the opening contests of this month's 12-game title fight in the English capital to perhaps alter their perceptions.\n\nThe opening match lasted an agonizing seven hours before ending in a draw. The next day the evenly matched rivals faced up again. There is not much time for rest during 19 days of mental combat. In the second game it was Carlsen, in his own words, who was left to \"beg for a draw.\" Monday was a third straight tie of the showdown and on Tuesday there was no separating them either.\n\nFour games down and deadlock -- 2-2. The tension teeth-clenchingly high. Millions around the globe transfixed.\n\nIf players are tied after 12 classical games, it will go to a tie-breaker -- a series of games under shorter time controls.\n\nUnder such pressure the pulse quickens, the mind whirrs, which is why Italian-American Caruana has made sure he is in peak mental and physical condition for the tournament. When time allows he will be pounding the treadmill between bouts and searching for Zen-like calm to soothe the mind.\n\n\"I have taken a liking to yoga recently, I've been practicing quite a lot. It's important to try to counteract the negative, physical effects of chess -- sitting down for so long under a lot of strain and mental stress,\" says Caruana, speaking to CNN Sport last week on the eve of the championship.\n\nCaruana is nerdy, but stylish, wearing a grey T-shirt and a bomber jacket made by the American designer Thom Browne for an afternoon of answering questions from journalists who have traveled to England from around the world. Though he left New York for Spain aged 12 and has not, he says, returned to the city where he spent much of his childhood for a while, his Brooklyn accent remains strong.\n\nCaruana is a dual national and represented Italy before switching alliegances to the US.\n\nFocusing on the physical as well as the mental is not new for elite players, he says. The answer to the old argument of whether chess is a sport is irrelevant. Playing for such extensive periods takes its toll. After the \"Moscow Marathon\" between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov in 2000, which lasted five months and 48 games, Karpov told a Russian magazine he had lost 10kg in weight.\n\nCarlsen is lithe and watches what he eats, while Caruana -- who describes himself as a decent runner -- is no different.\n\n\"When I was a kid I was encouraged by my parents to exercise and stay in shape. It was only more recently that I took it upon myself and became interested and really wanted to take care of myself,\" says Caruana, who first played for the land of his Italian mother before switching allegiances to the US.\n\n\"I understood that chess can be physically demanding, although it doesn't seem like it. When you're under a lot of stress and your heart is racing and you're just sitting down and there's no outlet for it you really need to be in good shape to make sure it doesn't get to your head.\n\n\"If you're crashing at the board you won't be able to play so I think pretty much all the top players these days are very aware of the necessity to be in good shape.\n\n\"I've tried to improve my cardio, I've done a lot of running and interval training to try to improve my cardiovascular system. I've had trainers in the past, but because I travel so much it's kind of hard to have someone there to monitor what I'm doing so I also have to take it upon myself to make sure I know how to exercise and know what I need to do.\"\n\n\"As a kid I found myself staring at the ceiling during a game.\"\n\nIt was an English journalist who described Caruana as having superhuman powers of concentration. The bespectacled New Yorker, who in 2007 became the youngest American-born grandmaster in history less than two weeks before his 15th birthday -- a mark since beaten by Sam Sevian -- laughs at such a description.\n\n\"At the board, I turn everything off and focus on that. I think that's years of training, through playing and trying to not let mind wander,\" he replies with a smile.\n\n\"As a kid, I found myself staring at the ceiling during a game and wouldn't be thinking about chess at all, but through so many years of playing chess at a high level I've learnt to focus. I haven't really had to consciously try to do it, it's sort of just happened.\"\n\nAfter four moves in any game of chess there are already a billion possible placement of the pieces.\n\nThe American was first introduced to chess aged five in an after-school program to help with his concentration. He lost all four of his first games, but quickly began to show promise by defeating older players and, in 2004, the family relocated to Spain so that the young prodigy could train with better instructors and play higher-quality opponents.\n\nIn admitting he was not enthusiastic about moving to Europe, the New Yorker chuckles: \"When you're 12 years old your parents don't really ask you.\"\n\nHome-schooled in Spain, Caruana would practice for 10 hours a day on non-school days, but he does not regard it as a childhood lost.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I've made any great sacrifices,\" he says.\n\n\"When I was a teenager I guess I sacrificed on school and having the normal life of a teenager and having traditional education, but I've been quite fortunate. I haven't had to make big sacrifices for my chess. I've had a relatively smooth road with the support of my parents to be able to devote myself to it.\"\n\nHis parents reportedly estimate they spent as much as $50,000 a year paying for coaches and training before their son started making money in his late teens.\n\nHe will leave London considerably richer whatever happens in the final. There is a $677,000 prize for the winner, while the loser will walk away with $451, 000. And there's sponsorship to boost the coffers, too. For Caruana, plans are afoot to launch a chess board line and apparel, while tech companies, sports brands and start-ups have shown interest in associating with the grandmaster.\n\nIn explaining the increasing interest in his client, Caruana's manager Eric Kuhn tells CNN Sport that chess is at the \"center of the zeitgeist\" and that the players \"represent everything that is now.\"\n\nAsked whether he felt he was playing for America, Caruana said: \"I try to approach tournaments as an individual. If I have success I would like to share it with the US.\"\n\nDuring a press conference comprising about 200 representatives of the media, Caruana was asked last week how he would describe himself, being that he was playing \"the Mozart of chess.\" \"My musical tastes lie more outside classical music, so I'd probably pick someone in the hip-hop or rock genre,\" he said.\n\nBoth Caruana and Carlsen give chess a modern twist and their rivalry is the sort which elevates a contest to a wider audience. Some report that the pair aren't fond of each other -- In August, Carlsen made a shushing gesture when he played the American. With this world championship being so a close, all the elements are in place for a great spectacle.\n\nThe intuitive Carlsen, a grandmaster since 13, a world champion since 2013, is the favorite. But Caruana, described as a brilliant all-rounder, is on a hot streak, having beaten seven other top players to win the Candidates Tournament in Berlin in March. His official rating of 2,838 is just three points behind his opponent.\n\nMagnus Carlsen has been the world champion since 2013.\n\nWhen asked whether he saw himself as the favorite or underdog, much to the amusement of the assembled journalists, a smiling Carlsen replied: \"It has been a while since I have considered myself an underdog, to be honest.

Now, amid a growing clamor of dissent, Theresa May must sell it to her own side. Britain's Prime Minister and her closest aides spent Tuesday evening in a succession of one-on-one meeti\u2026 [+3398 chars]", "fulltext": "London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will attempt to sell her divorce deal from the European Union to the House of Commons Thursday as a divided country examines the finer details of the 585-page draft document.\n\nStanding outside Downing Street late Wednesday, May announced that she had won the backing of her senior ministers after a debate that had lasted five hours. \"This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead,\" she said.\n\nHours earlier, there had been talk that some mutinous members of her Cabinet might resign and that remained a possibility on Wednesday night. Even as the meeting drew to a close, rumors swirled in Westminster that May could face a vote of no-confidence from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.\n\nDifficult decisions made\n\nBut on the steps of Downing Street, May seized the upper hand. She acknowledged the debate had been difficult, and that decisions had not been taken lightly.\n\n\"I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest. And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom,\" she said.\n\nMay's success in facing down a rebellion -- at least for now -- marked a pivotal moment for her leadership. Cabinet backing gives the Prime Minister crucial breathing space, but her troubles are far from over. May must now get the deal through the House of Commons, where her Conservative Party does not command a majority, and opponents smell blood.\n\nThursday's front pages reflected the difficulties ahead. The Financial Times predicted a \"backlash\" following the \"ferocious Brexit battle,\" while the Daily Mail focused on the Prime Minister's defiant tone with the headline, \"I stand to fight.\"\n\nThe Guardian, which had supported Remain, pointed to the divisions that May's Brexit plan had created under the banner \"a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation.\"\n\nKnives are out\n\nThe Conservative Party is deeply divided between hardline Brexit supporters and others who voted to remain in the EU, and Wednesday's breakthrough is only the beginning of what is expected to be a protracted and painful political process.\n\nChief among hardliners' concerns is that the agreement will tie the UK to the EU's customs union and parts of the single market free-trade area for years to come, without any say in how the bloc is run.\n\nA sign of the peril faced by May came at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons earlier Wednesday, when one of her own MPs, Peter Bone, accused her of \"not delivering the Brexit people voted for.\" Bone said May would \"lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\"\n\nOne of the Prime Minister's most vocal rivals, arch-Brexiter and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, was critical of the proposal.\n\nIn a statement, he said that \"the proposed agreement will see the UK hand over \u00a339 billion ($50.7 billion) to the EU for little or nothing in return.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was not without her supporters, however. Brandon Lewis, Chairman of the Conservatives & Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth, said in a tweet that May's deal is \"absolutely the right deal for Britain. It gets people what they voted for -- control of our money, borders and laws.\"\n\nCorbyn slams 'shambolic negotiations'\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, laid into the PM's deal. \"After two years of bungled negotiations, from what we know of the government's deal, it's a failure in its own terms,\" Corbyn said, repeatedly describing the negotiations as \"shambolic.\"\n\nHe slammed May for offering a choice between a \"botched deal and no deal.\" It seems unthinkable that his party would support May's deal when it comes to a vote.\n\nPro-Brexit supporters demonstrating in Whitehall, near the UK Houses of Parliament in London, on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Thursday morning, shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said that the document was a \"failure of negotiation.\"\n\n\"We've read and analyzed all 500 pages -- it's a miserable failure of negotiation.\"\n\nHe said there was \"huge detail\" about \"issues like the backstop which the government says it doesn't intend to use,\" but said it was \"vague\" in other, key areas.\n\n\"For the future relationship, what it does intend, it's seven pages, it's vague in the extreme. Only three of those are about the future economic relationship.\"\n\n\"We talk about blind Brexit but this is about the blindest of blind Brexits.\"\n\nScottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said late Wednesday that she had had a telephone conversation with May in which the PM had promised that Scotland's \"'distinctive' interests had been protected,\" but contested that interpretation.\n\nNot long off call with PM. She tried to tell me Scotland's 'distinctive' interests had been protected. I pointed out that there isn't a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage. \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) November 14, 2018\n\n\"I pointed out that there isn't a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage,\" Sturgeon tweeted.\n\nThe Prime Minister's deal is absolutely the right deal for Britain. It gets people what they voted for - control of our money, borders and laws. pic.twitter.com/3ZRgLv3OOo \u2014 Brandon Lewis (@BrandonLewis) November 14, 2018\n\nPotential stumbling block\n\nOpponents of the deal take issue with the part of the agreement that deals with the border between Ireland, which remains in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK.\n\nCritics say the border agreement would, at least temporarily, tie the UK to the EU's trading rules without a way out.\n\nRees-Mogg called the different treatment of Northern Ireland \"unacceptable\" and said that locking the country into EU customs rules was \"profoundly undemocratic.\"\n\nMay must now attempt to secure the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs prop up her minority government. DUP leader Arlene Foster said in a statement on Wednesday that the party's \"desire for a deal will not be superseded by a willingness to accept any deal.\"\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in a tweet that he was \"pleased\" that a deal had been reached but that his government \"regrets\" the UK's decision to leave the bloc.\n\n\"I am pleased an agreement has been reached between EU and UK negotiators on a draft Brexit Withdrawal Treaty. While I welcome these developments, Brexit is not our policy and is something we regret. However, we respect the vote of the people of the UK.\"\n\nBut May insisted that she felt the draft withdrawal agreement was \"the best that could be negotiated.\"\n\nShe also made it clear that if Brexit-supporting MPs in her own party conspired to kill the deal, they could end up destroying their ultimate goal of leaving the EU.\n\nThe choice, she said, was stark: \"This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union; or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThat line was intended as a warning to rebels that if they vote down her deal, they risked precipitating a political crisis that could end with a second referendum. It was the first time that May had acknowledged that Brexit could, in theory at least, be stopped.\n\nNext step\n\nMay's strategy is to seize the momentum. With the UK Cabinet now in line, an emergency summit of the EU council -- the 28 member states that make up the European Union -- is likely to be called for November. At this summit, the member states will agree to the withdrawal text, allowing it to move to legislative chambers of both the EU and the UK.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, welcomed Wednesday's developments. \"This agreement, is a decisive, crucial step on concluding these negotiations,\" he said. \"It is also the achievement of a methodology which has been a negotiation carried out in transparency from the word go and fully in respect of our respective mandates.\"\n\nEU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt echoed the sentiment, saying in a tweet that while he hoped \"one day the UK will return\" that \"in the meantime this agreement will make a Brexit possible, while maintaining a close relationship between the EU and UK.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn",

We all just need to be patient,\" she said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California Jacob Saylors, 11, walks through the burned remains of his home in Paradise, California, on Sunday, November 18.

It was 85% contained by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWinds were \"particularly strong\" Wednesday morning but weakened during the day, meteorologists said. The forecast calls for light winds Thursday and Friday, but brisk winds are expected to return Saturday night.\n\nThe chance of precipitation -- next week -- has increased, forecasters said.\n\nA look at the wildfires' astonishing numbers\n\n\u2022 Camp Fire: The Camp Fire has destroyed 8,650 homes and The Camp Fire has destroyed 8,650 homes and scorched 138,000 acres in Northern California .

It's not a federal issue. This is an American issue of managing our forests,\" he said.\n\nZinke cited several reasons for the increase in devastation including dead and dying timber and beetle infestation. He stopped short of blaming climate change.\n\nHe said prescribed burns are a start and that \"the best scientists are looking at best practices.\"\n\nAfter viewing the decimated town of Paradise, Long said a lot of planning will go into reconstructing the town.\n\n\"This is a very complex disaster.

The announcement triggered protests and violence leaving one person dead.\n\nWickremesinghe denounced Sirisena's attempt to remove him from office and refused to leave the official prime minister's residence, claiming the president does not have the power to take such action.\n\nSirisena had attempted to prevent a vote of no-confidence by dissolving Parliament until December 7, however, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court overturned the president's controversial decision and ordered an interim order, paving the way for fresh elections.\n\nIn a move that showed that he was potentially softening his hard stance, Sirisena invited his ousted Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, leaders of his party and those associated for talks Wednesday evening.\n\nSpokesman Mahinda Samarasinghe declined to comment on the meeting, but told CNN: \"The President will act constitutionally and within the framework of the law of the country.\"\n\nSri Lanka's former president and newly appointed prime minister Mahinda Rajapakse (C) attends the parliament session in Colombo on November 14, 2018.\n\nPassed by voice, not by name\n\nThe passing of the no-confidence motion comes as a major blow to Sirisena, demonstrating that his appointment of Rajapaksa does not have the majority backing of the 225 seat Parliament.\n\nContrary to the usual practice, notice of the motion was given Wednesday morning and taken up for discussion immediately after.\n\nHowever, such was the commotion inside the House Wednesday, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was prevented from taking the vote by name, as is standard, and instead forced to take a vote by voice.\n\nThe resolution, which was passed by a majority, was moved by left wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and law maker Vijitha Herath.\n\nThe United National Party of ousted Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the Tamil National Alliance and smaller Muslim parties all supported the no-confidence motion.\n\nThree newly sworn cabinet ministers and a state minister also crossed over to the opposition benches in support. Both Rajapaksa, as well as his ousted predecessor Wickremesinghe were present during the vote.\n\nSri Lanka's ousted prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe (L) looks on during Wednesday's parliamentary session, November 14, 2018.\n\nInstability in Colombo\n\nViolence erupted in the capital at the end of October when crowds loyal to the President attempted to prevent the recently deposed petroleum minister Arjuna Ranatunga from entering a government building in Colombo.\n\nAs crowds surged around Ranatunga, a former Sri Lankan cricket captain, the official's bodyguards opened fire, killing one person and injuring three others.\n\nRanatunga subsequently claimed that his bodyguards opened fire because the crowd was \"trying to kill\" him.\n\nOne bodyguard was nevertheless taken into custody and an investigation is underway, police spokesperson Ruwan Gunasekera confirmed."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "Cient\u00edficos votan para definir una nueva forma de medir un kilogramo", "description": "Durante m\u00e1s de 100 a\u00f1os, Par\u00eds ha sido hogar de Le Grand K, un bloque de metal que define el peso exacto de un kilogramo.

Kilmer lost her own mother as a teenager and was determined to get more time with her only child.\n\nKilmer searched for experimental treatments, opting for an unproven approach in which researchers select drugs based on the genes in patients' tumors. Doctors have selected her treatments for the past three years based on the unique, ever-changing DNA of her cancer cells. Now 41, Kilmer has responded better than anyone dared to hope. Her cancer has gone into hiding; her tumors are no longer visible on medical scans.\n\nKilmer's insurance company calls it experimental. As a consequence, her insurer has covered only a fraction of her care, forcing Kilmer to make an agonizing choice: stop taking a drug that costs nearly $17,000 a month or pay out-of-pocket, burdening her family with tremendous debt.\n\n\"When you are looking at your daughter, you ask yourself, 'Do I take a medication that might allow me to see her graduate high school?'\" asked Kilmer, of Spearfish, S.D. \"Or do you stop taking it to avoid causing her financial harm?\"\n\nKristen Kilmer, at home with her family, was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer at age 38.\n\nThe high cost of cutting-edge tests and treatments is threatening to keep precision medicine -- one of the most celebrated areas in cancer research -- out of reach for many patients. Patients who pay for these new treatments on their own \"could be in debt for decades,\" said Dr. Scott Ramsey, director of the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research in Seattle.\n\nAlready cancer care is hugely expensive. A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that 42 percent of patients depleted 100 percent of their assets -- an average loss of $92,000 -- within two years of diagnosis.\n\nPrecision medicine involves running expensive tests called genomic sequencing, which scan the DNA of tumors to find mutations that might be susceptible to available drugs. Although the field is relatively new, hundreds of thousands of cancer patients have had their tumors sequenced to identify cancer-related mutations, according to testing companies\n\nMedicare, the government insurance plan for people 65 and older, announced in March that it will pay for genomic testing for people with advanced cancers -- a decision that could add $2.5 billion to federal health care costs, according to a May analysis in Health Affairs\n\nFew private insurers cover the tests, leaving some patients with surprise medical bills.\n\nCarrie Wyman, who also has advanced breast cancer, discovered that her insurance plan doesn't cover genomic sequencing only after she received a $5,800 statement.\n\n\"I just assumed it would be covered,\" said Wyman, 50, a resident of La Plata, Md., who has six children and stepchildren. \"I was blindsided, to be honest with you.\"\n\nLooking For Financial Assistance\n\nYet paying for that initial test is just the beginning. As Kilmer learned, finding the money for ongoing treatment is far more challenging, said Dr. Gary Lyman, who studies way to improve health care quality at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n\nIn some cases, genomic tests match patients to experimental drugs available only in clinical trials. Although these trials sometimes provide free medications, many cancer patients can't afford to travel to participate in them. Kilmer drives 12 hours round-trip every month to participate in a clinical trial in Sioux Falls, S.D. The expenses add up quickly, she said.\n\nKristen Kilmer spreads out her daily medications, including Lynparza, center, which costs nearly $17,000 per month.\n\nKilmer's genomic tests identified a rearrangement in the PALB2 gene. Preliminary studies suggest that tumors with this genetic rearrangement could be susceptible to the drug Lynparza, but those effects haven't been definitively proven in large-scale studies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Lynparza only for breast cancer patients with a mutation called BRCA.\n\nLegally, doctors can prescribe Lynparza \"off label\" to anyone with cancer. But insurance programs are reluctant to cover off-label treatments, unless they're specifically recommended in expert guidelines.\n\nKilmer has spent much of the past three years battling insurance officials and begging drug companies for financial assistance. The drugmakers have been generous, allowing her to take a rotating cocktail of experimental drugs for free because of her modest income.\n\nIn September, however, AstraZeneca decided to end Kilmer's financial aid. Kilmer appealed the drug company's decision.\n\nPaying thousands of dollars a month is not an option, Kilmer said. Her family already carries significant credit card debt from earlier cancer treatments. She estimates that she has spent about $80,600 out-of-pocket treating her illness, including $23,600 on her early breast cancer therapy and $57,000 treating metastatic disease.\n\nKilmer said she would rather stop taking Lynparza than financially burden her daughter and husband, a truck driver.\n\n\"It's not worth it,\" Kilmer said. \"I will not put my family into that kind of debt.\"\n\nUncertain Benefits\n\nInsurers say costs aren't their only concern. Evidence is lacking that the precision medicine approach will work consistently, they argue.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said genetic sequencing remains unproven.\n\nCathryn Donaldson, the group's spokeswoman, described recent scientific advances as \"remarkable and noteworthy.\" But she said insurers \"need a more definitive answer\" about whether the tests help the average patient live longer.\n\nKristen Kilmer said she'd rather stop taking Lynparza than financially burden her family.\n\nThe South Dakota State Employee Health Plan -- which runs Kilmer's insurance plan -- said it bases its coverage decisions on science and reviews \"published, randomized data about the safety and efficacy of the requested drugs.\"\n\nAlthough genetic testing has become the standard of care for melanoma and a common type of lung cancer, no one knows if genomic sequencing will extend the lives of people with other types of cancer, said Dr. Carolyn Presley, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nWithout insurance coverage, some cancer patients simply give up on treatment.\n\nstudy of more than 1,000 women with advanced breast cancer -- presented at a September meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology -- found that 54 percent had stopped or refused treatment due to cost. The women in the study may have been more vulnerable than most, because 30 percent were uninsured, about twice the national rate\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn an August study in JAMA , researchers found that relatively few of those who hoped to benefit from precision medicine actually ended up on a medication. Just 15 percent of those who underwent genomic sequencing ended up taking a targeted therapy, according to the study. The study didn't ask participants why they failed to get a targeted drug, but Presley, the lead author, said it's likely that some patients couldn't afford them.\n\n\"We're finding the mutations, but patients aren't getting the drugs,\" Presley said.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Steven Jiang and Yong Xiong, CNN", "title": "Paris to Shanghai via Siberia: Passengers take three planes and three days to get home", "description": "When passengers for Air France flight AF116 boarded their aircraft in Paris last Saturday night, they expected to land in Shanghai on Sunday evening after an 11-hour journey.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/asia/china-air-france-russia-trnd-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170804101724-air-france-plane-file-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T08:45:32Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Beijing (CNN) When passengers for Air France flight AF116 boarded their aircraft in Paris last Saturday night, they expected to land in Shanghai on Sunday evening after an 11-hour journey.\n\nInstead, for three days, more than 200 passengers became stuck in a remote town in Siberia, where overnight temperatures plunged to nearly -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe original Boeing 777-300ER plane was diverted to Irkutsk on Sunday after experiencing \"a technical problem\", Air France said in a statement.\n\nThe plane landed safely after reporting smoke in the cabin and none of the 280 people on board were hurt, Russian news agency Sputnik cited a local airport official as saying.\n\nAfter realizing repairs couldn't be done quickly enough on the ground, the airline sent a second B777 from Paris to the Russian city to pick up the stranded passengers.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "olivertapia", "title": "La impactante foto de lo que qued\u00f3 de la casa de Miley Cyrus y Liam Hemsworth tras incendios en California", "description": "Miley Cyrus y Liam Hemsworth perdieron su casa en uno de los incendios que afectan California.

Wotif\n\n\"I could not think of a better way to capture the fun and excitement of visiting our region, especially after the Chinchilla Melon Festival, than by having your photo taken with our newest tourist attraction,\" Paul McVeigh, mayor of Western Downs Regional Council, said in a statement.\n\nRelated content 10 of Australia's best beaches\n\nStanding 9 meters wide (29 feet) and 3 high (nine feet), the \"Big Melon\" is located next to the town's visitor center.\n\nEvery two years Chinchilla hosts MelonFest, a celebration of the region's watermelon-growing industry which is attended by more than 15,000 visitors, according to the town.\n\nThe watermelon was built as part of Australian travel site Wotif's \"Next Big Thing\" campaign, in celebration of their 18th birthday, where thousands of Australians submitted their suggestions for what should be the country's next large-scale roadside attraction.\n\nAccording to Wotif, the \"Big Melon\" beat out the \"Big Peanut,\" suggested for Kingaroy in Queensland, and the \"Big Tulip\" in Mittagong, New South Wales.\n\nRelated content How this Australian Instagram account amassed 3.2 million followers\n\nWotif Managing Director Daniel Finch said in a statement that the company had been inundated with votes from each of the contending towns. \"It goes to show the significance of 'Big Things' in Australia and how sentimental Aussies are about them,\" he said.\n\nMayor McVeigh said he was excited to have Chincilla finally on Australia's \"Big Things\" tourist map."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"},

Kyi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Singapore. \"I'm anxious to hear about the progress you're making in holding those accountable who are responsible.\"\n\nIt comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp. The Myanmar government has repeatedly denied that its soldiers deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya.\n\nPence also brought up the jailing of two Reuters reporters who were sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty in September of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "moataz", "title":

anxious to hear about the progress you're making in holding those accountable who are responsible.\"\n\nIt comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp. The Myanmar government has repeatedly denied that its soldiers deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya.\n\nPence also brought up the jailing of two Reuters reporters who were sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty in September of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act.\n\nRead More"}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Chris Boyette and Madeline Holcombe, CNN", "title": "In reversal, Texas board votes to teach students about Helen Keller, Hillary Clinton", "description": "Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller are back on the lesson plan after a vote by the Texas Board of Education.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/us/texas-curriculum-hillary-clinton-helen-keller-trnd/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131212085221-helen-keller-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:59:07Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller are back on the lesson plan after a vote by the Texas State Board of Education.\n\nThe committee voted 12-2, with one abstention, on Tuesday to continue teaching students about Clinton in high school history classes, according to State Board of Education Director Debbie Ratcliffe. The board also voted to keep Keller on the curriculum.\n\nThe vote reverses a September preliminary decision to cut the women, along with 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater and several other historical figures, from the required curriculum. The board said then that the change was intended to streamline the curriculum for its 5.4 million students at the recommendation of volunteer work groups.\n\nThe thinking was that less content would allow teachers to take deeper dives into certain topics, rather than emphasizing such things as the memorization of dates, Donna Bahorich, chairperson of the Texas State Board of Education said in a statement in September.\n\n\"Texas simply has too many learning standards, required to be taught and assessed on state assessments, for educators to cover in a year,\" she said.\n\nRead More"},

A new day of firing and fury culminating in a staggering power play by first lady Melania Trump deepened already historic dysfunction in the administration on\u2026 [+7675 chars]", "fulltext": "Washington (CNN) In this White House, no one knows when the ax will fall or who will be swinging it.\n\nA new day of firing and fury culminating in a staggering power play by first lady Melania Trump deepened already historic dysfunction in the administration on Tuesday, leaving top officials blindsided and confused.\n\nEven compared with the senior staff knifings, bureaucratic turmoil and raging chaos that passes for normality in President Donald Trump's White House, her sudden move against a top foreign policy official was a bombshell.\n\nIn a public statement that came out of nowhere, the first lady's office warned that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel , with whom she reportedly clashed over a recent Africa trip, \"no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nHer dramatic intervention sparked speculation that the first lady was at odds with her husband, was overstepping her role and that the East Wing was going rogue. Melania Trump had already said in an ABC interview last month that she didn't trust some White House staffers. Now, she was doing something about it.\n\nOne person told CNN that, incredibly, Trump, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders had no idea the statement was coming.\n\nA source told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that Trump -- who often finds it difficult to fire people in person despite his schtick on NBC's \"The Apprentice\" -- had decided that Ricardel has to go, though she was being given time to clear her desk.\n\nBut as is often the case in this poorly run White House, there was uncertainty at first over Ricardel's actual fate. It was not clear on Wednesday morning whether she had been officially dismissed, whether she would show up for work as usual or if she might be found a spot elsewhere in the administration. Later Wednesday, Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIt's not unusual for unease to stalk the White House after a midterm election loss, as staffers exhausted by the first half of the President's mandate give way to fresher troops. And Tuesday was not the first time a first lady has leaned on her husband over a staffer she finds irksome.\n\nBut this President's mercurial temperament and the nest of vipers that is his West Wing has inflicted more nerve-rattling pressure on his staff than is normal even in the White House, where crises are always just around the corner.\n\nThe current turbulence and sense of presidential norms being shattered by an emotional and erratic president feels different and more consequential than the wild staff intrigues of early in the presidency. It's beginning to raise real questions about what is in store for the nation over the second half of Trump's term.\n\nSeveral Cabinet members -- including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen -- are being targeted by whispering campaigns, leaks and speculation about their fates as trial balloons float about possible replacements.\n\nKelly, who has survived several rounds of scuttlebutt about his often supposedly imminent departure, is said to be heading for the exit again. And leaked reports that Trump sees Ryan Zinke as vulnerable to Democratic oversight have weakened the Interior secretary's position.\n\nTrump is meanwhile digging in on his constitutionally questionable appointment of Matthew Whitaker, a critic of Robert Mueller, to oversee the special counsel probe as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions was fired.\n\nSanders had been expected to leave, along with her deputy Raj Shah, but their status remains uncertain.\n\nMore than the usual staff turmoil\n\nTrump uses pandemonium as an instrument of personal power, leaving everyone off balance and unsure of what will happen next, while he sits in the center of the storm ready to make his next move.\n\nSowing disruption in Washington, while confounding the political establishment and perceptions of how a White House should be run, allows the President to keep faith with his political base.\n\nSo palace intrigue has been part of the administration from the start, along with media narratives that Trump is running his White House like a reality show and is constantly firing off distractions for reporters to chase.\n\nIt seems certain that Trump will emerge from this highly charged moment with fewer constraints if senior staffers who have tried to keep him within the bounds of presidential custom and the law depart.\n\nHe may have more latitude to follow an unpredictable course in which he sometimes seems to brush up against governing conventions and constitutional guardrails he often doesn't seem to even know are there.\n\nThis could be an increasing problem when the administration faces a sudden burst of investigations from the new Democratic House, a reality for which lax oversight by Republicans has left it deeply underprepared.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nAnd there is a good chance that Trump becomes even more distracted by the Mueller investigation with speculation heating up about possible new indictments and the contents of the special counsel's long awaited final report.\n\nOn Tuesday, with his White House in uproar, he was sitting down with his lawyers to answer written questions posed by Mueller -- a potential critical moment for his presidency.\n\nAmazingly, the President is yet to face a major international crisis that he did not precipitate \u2014 like a close military call with a major adversary or a financial crash, that will require focused, unambiguous leadership and a crack team operating with unity and purpose. That seems an unlikely prospect in this White House.\n\nThere must also be questions, given the ever more fractious nature of life in his administration, whether top-level staffers on the GOP bench who might be persuaded to serve are going to have second thoughts.\n\nAfter all, officials like Nielsen and Kelly have put their own reputations on the line, defending the President's controversial policies on immigration, only for him to turn on them in the end.\n\nRight now, the only White House staffers who might consider themselves safe are his kin: his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nBut the danger of running a West Wing on the nepotistic model of Trump's business has been made clear recently with the crisis over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The assassination, which caused global outrage, is being widely blamed on Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince on whom Kushner -- going around the State Department -- anchored Middle East policy.\n\nMelania Trump shows her power\n\nTuesday's swoop by the first lady was remarkable. In a show of force apparently brewing for days, she made Ricardel's position untenable.\n\nIn a dash of added intrigue, Melania Trump twisted the knife with national security adviser John Bolton, who has forged his own deserved reputation as a ruthless bureaucratic assassin, out of the action -- nearly 10,000 miles away in Singapore.\n\nIt was not the first time a senior West Wing staffer paid the price for falling out with a first lady.\n\nGossip often bubbled over ill will between Nancy Reagan and ex-White House chief of staff Don Regan. George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir about clashes with Hillary Clinton when he served in her husband's White House. And there was often talk of tension between Michelle Obama and her husband's first press secretary, Robert Gibbs.\n\nBut it's hard to find a precedent for the public, categorical, felling of Ricardel by Melania Trump, a strike that exemplified the first lady's willingness to throw around her political weight.\n\nStill, Marc Short, Trump's former congressional liaison, told CNN's Erin Burnett that while her move was unprecedented, it was not likely to start a new trend.\n\n\"I think you will find out over time that this is probably an exception and that the first lady probably had reasons,\" he said.\n\nSome White House sources painted a picture of Ricardel as tough to work with and said she had picked a lot of fights since coming aboard in April.\n\n\"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone,\" said another official.\n\nStill, Ricardel has not yet had the chance to tell her own story.

More public engagements, more international tours and daily paperwork that often keeps him at his desk late into the night.\n\nTo mark the prince's birthday, CNN was invited to his Dumfries House estate in Scotland while he was visiting and to West Africa on an official royal tour.\n\nPrince Charles poses for an official portrait to mark his 70th birthday in the gardens of Clarence House\n\n\"I think you would easily understand the Prince of Wales if you came here,\" Kenneth Dunsmuir, director of the Prince's Foundation, the umbrella group for Charles' public projects, told CNN standing outside Dumfries House. \"It's very evident you can see very clearly what his work is and the variation of work, the variety that you see on the estate.\"\n\nThe house is best imagined as a fairytale 18th-century mansion at the center of a vast, immaculate estate with outbuildings humming with community activities. There are no gates. Members of the public roam freely and it's not uncommon for them to encounter Charles himself as he goes about his inspections.\n\nThe Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland.\n\nCNN was shown a high-tech science lab nestled among trees, for visiting school groups, and an organic rare-breeds farm where the pigs live in plush, thatched pigsties. In a renovated barn, unemployed adults were learning traditional crafts. All the projects speak to social and ecological issues close to the prince's heart.\n\nThe Prince's Trust is also well represented here with initiatives to support disadvantaged young people and help get them into work -- something desperately needed in nearby towns that have never fully recovered from the collapse of the coal mining industry in the 1980s.\n\nInside the house itself is a priceless collection of furniture bought directly from the cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale in the 1750s by the fifth Earl of Dumfries. The collection contains what's reputed to be the most valuable item of furniture in the world, a cabinet valued by the estate at $30 million. One of the chairs in use during CNN's visit turned out to be worth a million dollars. When asked why such a valuable chair was being treated so casually, a member of staff replied: \"Because they are here to be used.\"\n\nPhotos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Photos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Prince Charles poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Prince Charles stepped in to save the estate from the seventh Marquess of Bute who couldn't afford the upkeep. It was renovated and reopened by the prince as a visitor attraction.\n\nDumfries House is now the second-largest employer in the county, after the local authority, and has even funded a new town hall and outdoor swimming pool in the nearby town of New Cumnock. Every Friday, the prince is sent a report on the estate running to dozens of pages and he returns it with notes the next morning.\n\n\"The signs were there from young adulthood -- his concerns about social issues, community issues and ecological issues,\" Dunsmuir said. \"All that's happened is that he's got more and more involved and has had the time to develop these ideas and take them further, due to the length of time that he's been Prince of Wales. What I'd like to think is that in bringing together so many strands into the Prince's Foundation of his charitable initiatives, that this (Dumfries House) is a fantastic physical legacy of that work that will always be here and always remain.\"\n\nWhile Dumfries House may be the project that best symbolizes Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales, we shouldn't take it as an indication of what sort of king he will be. A senior aide said the prince feels a duty to use his platform now to promote his causes before he becomes head of state. He knows the two roles are distinct and it is \"his clear wish and intention to change his approach in the next role.\"\n\nWithout doubt, he has a lot to live up to. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is revered for the way she has steadily gained popularity during the course of her reign despite the collapse of the British Empire and a general loss of deference in society. She has modernized and stayed relevant by embracing public walkabouts, mass media and charitable work. She has rarely expressed any opinions, let alone political views, so we never know quite what she is thinking.\n\nWe know what the Prince of Wales thinks about a wide range of issues so he is already a more divisive figure and that won't simply be forgotten when he takes the throne.\n\nHe was ahead of his time on many issues, warning as far back as the 1970s of the dangers of climate change before it became a mainstream issue, and he continues to do so now when, for many, it's become a political issue.\n\nA giant portrait of Prince Charles outside a Young Entrepreneurs Event in Accra, Ghana, on November 5.\n\nAt a speech in Accra, Ghana, last week, the Prince said, \"I know, Mr. President, that you share my determination that the Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep-seated and deeply integrated. No issue is more pressing, it seems to me, than that of climate change. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provided stark and alarming evidence that even 1.5 degrees of warming will mean catastrophic damage to the planet's ecosystems, sent a clear signal that we must all surely heed.\"\n\nCharles will become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.\n\nHe made the case again in Nigeria with a group of powerful regional leaders. After the meeting in Abuja, the Emir of Kano was positive about the Prince's interventions, telling CNN: \"He's been talking about climate change. He's been talking about demographic implosions. He's been talking about town planning and we do not make the connection between these three issues, for example, and some of the conflicts we see.\"\n\nPrince Charles attends a meeting with regional leaders in Abuja on November 6.\n\nThere was particular interest in his work on youth unemployment, which is rife in the region, though the prince wasn't able to see as much of the country as he had hoped, to his frustration. Because of security concerns, the British government called off a visit to Jos, a city in Central Nigeria that has been the scene of deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.\n\n\"The only sad thing for me was not being able to go further into other parts of Nigeria,\" Prince Charles told CNN. \"It is such a vast country and obviously there are so many other states and interesting areas. I know many are facing different challenges and other opportunities, so it was a pity not being able to do that, but otherwise it's always marvellous coming here because people are so friendly. I'm always intrigued by the way so many of these young, for instance, are developing really interesting ideas that they can turn into businesses and things like that, helping to tackle some of the real issues we face, particularly around the environment and waste and goodness knows what else. Very ingenious characters.\"\n\nAt 70, Prince Charles has given his future role \"a lot of thought,\" the senior aide told CNN, particularly what he will and won't be able to speak about, but it \"doesn't weigh heavily\" on his shoulders.\n\nIf he feels any pressure, it appears to be completing his work as Prince of Wales, which is a role he has made his own. He's redefined the responsibility that comes with being heir and in that sense he has already left a legacy."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jenni Marsh, CNN", "title": "Prince Charles turns 70, releases official family photograph", "description": "The heir to the British throne is seen looking relaxed in the Clarence House gardens with his dynasty as he reaches the \"alarming\" age.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/14/uk/prince-charles-70-photo-gbr-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113194649-prince-charles-70th-birthday-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T05:13:14Z", "content": "(CNN) Britain's Prince Charles has released a candid family photograph, as the heir-to-the-throne celebrates his 70th birthday.

Hide Caption 52 of 52\n\nLandmark birthday\n\nEarlier this month, Charles spoke for the first time about what sort of king he will be in a BBC documentary celebrating his 70th birthday.\n\nThe king in waiting promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once he takes on the role of the monarch.\n\n\"You know, I've tried to make sure whatever I've done has been nonparty political, but I think it's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir,\" said Charles.\n\nAs heir to the throne, Charles has written to ministers -- and even the prime minister -- on subjects close to his heart. He has spoken out on issues such as the environment and modern architecture -- he once called a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London a \"monstrous carbuncle.\"\n\nThe proposals were later dropped.\n\n\"So, clearly ... I won't be able to do the same things I've done you know as heir, so of course you operate within the ... the constitutional parameters. But it's a different function,\" he said in the film, titled \"Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70.\"\n\nAfrica tour\n\nPrince Charles and his wife Camilla, earlier this month undertook a nine-day tour of West Africa. The royal couple visited Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia to celebrate the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth.\n\nCharles will become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.\n\nIn Accra, Ghana, once the embarkation point for many Africans traded as slaves, the prince condemned the modern slave trade, saying: \"We have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery.\"\n\n\"The royal visit will celebrate the UK's dynamic, forward-looking partnerships with these Commonwealth Nations on a range of shared priorities,\" Clarence House said in a statement.\n\n\"The visits will highlight key themes in these relationships, including the importance of our Commonwealth ties.\""}, {"source": {"id":

I can't go back in time,\" Zeigler said, the station reported.\n\nZeigler was sentenced to two to 10 years for assault with intent to do great bodily harm and two years for possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony.\n\nAn Oakland County jury convicted Zeigler last month.\n\nOn April 12, Brennan was walking alone to school after missing the bus. The teenager said he trekked the four miles to Rochester High School in Rochester Hills, about 20 miles north of Detroit, but got lost and knocked on several doors, including Zeigler's home.\n\nA home security video of the shooting showed Zeigler firing at Brennan who ran away from the Michigan man's door. Brennan was not wounded.\n\nZeigler had intended to scare the teenager away, but the gun went off, his attorney Robert Morad told CNN in an interview. During the trial, Zeigler said he tripped and the shotgun accidentally went off, according to WDIV.\n\n\"It's been a terrible case for all the people involved, and my client wishes he could go back in time and change what happened. But he can't,\" Morad said. \"He is obviously very sorry for what happened.\"\n\nJeffery Zeigler, in a photo provided by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office\n\nZeigler was a Detroit firefighter for 24 years, according to Morad. He left the fire department in 2013, after rising to the rank of lieutenant, because of disabilities due to injuries suffered on the job.\n\nBrennan's mother has said she believes there was a racial component to the case, according to WDIV. Zeigler is white.\n\n\"I tried to keep race out of it but we all know that's ... what it was,\" Lisa Wright said Tuesday, according to WDIV.\n\nShe added: \"If there was a button that I could press for me to pick what color I could be -- just so I wouldn't have to deal with this type of stuff -- I would have to be your color ... so I could survive,\" she told reporters."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Losing GOP incumbent calls out Trump", "description": "Rep.

La sinergia ser\u00e1 extraordinaria\u201d.\n\nBajo los t\u00e9rminos del acuerdo, Amazon se comprometi\u00f3 a organizar ferias de empleo y continuar talleres para inquilinos de vivienda p\u00fablica durante tres a\u00f1os a partir de 2020. Posteriormente, \u201ccolaborar\u00e1 de buena fe\u201d con medidas adicionales. La compa\u00f1\u00eda tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 en programas de capacitaci\u00f3n en tecnolog\u00eda de ciudad para residentes de viviendas p\u00fablicas.\n\nSin embargo, Ocasio-Cortez se uni\u00f3 a un coro esc\u00e9ptico que ya incluye al senador estatal Michael Gianaris y al concejal de Queens Jimmy van Bramer, quienes expresaron su oposici\u00f3n a cualquier reducci\u00f3n de impuestos para Amazon.\n\nEste martes, el asamble\u00edsta del estado de Nueva York Ron Kim dijo que planea presentar un proyecto de ley para bloquear el acuerdo de Amazon y redirigir los subsidios a disminuir la deuda de los estudiantes.\n\nLos pol\u00edticos locales y estatales podr\u00edan tener m\u00e1s poder para rechazar esos incentivos para la compa\u00f1\u00eda, tras las elecciones de la semana pasada en las que los dem\u00f3cratas de Nueva York recuperaron el Senado estatal.\n\nDesde su posici\u00f3n como representante en el Congreso de la zona circundante, Ocasio-Cortez tiene poca autoridad sobre el acuerdo. Pero sus tuits del lunes y el martes frente al tema revelaron su poder como progresista a la hora de reunir activistas y funcionarios locales para influir sobre c\u00f3mo se implementa el acuerdo, incluida la responsabilidad de Amazon.\n\nEn el resto de sus mensajes en Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez describi\u00f3 las demandas que suelen aparecer en los acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios negociados entre los desarrolladores y los residentes locales, tales como empleos bien remunerados, protecciones para los sindicatos e inversiones en infraestructura del vecindario. Long Island ha experimentado un ritmo vertiginoso en la construcci\u00f3n de apartamentos de alta gama en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, lo que ha disparado los precios de las viviendas.\n\n\u201cEl desplazamiento no es desarrollo comunitario. Invertir en condominios de lujo no es lo mismo que invertir en personas y familias\u201d, escribi\u00f3. \u201cArrastrar a la gente de la clase trabajadora fuera de una comunidad no mejora su calidad de vida\u201d.\n\nEn su anuncio, Amazon dijo que crear\u00eda espacio para una incubadora de tecnolog\u00eda y una nueva escuela p\u00fablica en Long Island. A trav\u00e9s de un acuerdo de pago en lugar de impuestos, la compa\u00f1\u00eda invertir\u00e1 en mejoras de infraestructura de vecindarios y espacios verdes. No mencion\u00f3 disposiciones para viviendas asequibles.\n\nUn portavoz de Ocasio-Cortez no respondi\u00f3 inmediatamente a una solicitud para comentar sobre esta historia.

And I ran up and down the length of the train showing people my cartoons. I remember that as a really strong memory between me and my mother.\"\n\n\"Let's Make a Deal\" (2018) by Jim Carrey Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nIn this way, Carrey's recently opened exhibition of his political cartoons at Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles \"is really a revisitation, a re-gifting of my childhood. It's become a political thing at the moment because I think that's necessary. But it's a thing that's been in my life, my whole life.\"\n\nThe show, titled \"IndigNation,\" features 108 drawings from Carrey's Twitter feed, where the works where originally shared, from roughly 2016 to the present. The wall labels echo the tweets that accompanied the drawings.\n\nObama 'Hope' artist: Trump is 'dangerous'\n\nAs a highly subjective document of a fraught political moment, it's a fascinating timeline, mainly depicting the president as a clown, a cyclops, a pig, a witch and a kinky ice cream-eater among other unflattering personages, alongside more flash-in-the-pan political figures.\n\nOne drawing from early this year disfigures Trey Gowdy, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, as a slack-jawed rat set against a background of red and blue scribbles, alongside the caption-tweet : \"Another RAT leaps from the sinking ship! Swim Willard! Swim! #TreyGowdy.\" (One has to dig deep into the news cycle memory to recall that Gowdy was one of the first Republicans to publicly defend the FBI's investigation into Russian intervention in the 2016 election.)\n\nOther sundry figures that briefly burst into headlines over the past two years are similarly subject to the invective of Carrey's colorful cartoons. Former political consultant Rick Gates, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, national security adviser John Bolton are all presented with much censure but little context. The show feels less like a critique than a reaction to -- and some ways an enactment of -- the disorienting political circus that sparked it.\n\n\"I have many friends who are connected in the media world and I get a lot of information from a lot of sources,\" Carrey said when asked where he gets his news from, \"but I also watch the other side, to great chagrin, from time to time. It is about weird sides and misinformation and this strange pseudo structure we're living in, where half the people believe a completely different story.\"\n\n\"Greedzilla\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nThe world of Jim Carrey's political cartoons, where an Ace Ventura avatar gleefully rides atop an elephant with Trump's sons impaled on its tusks, relates only loosely to the history of art, or even the political cartoon itself. The latter is often a finely tuned metaphor, turning drawing into a narrative infographic. The reactionary force of \"IndigNation,\" which has been the source of much of its praise, produces something different: revenge caricatures and revisionist fantasies.\n\n\"There's a little bit of a push that has to happen with someone like me,\" Carrey admitted. \"People have to get over a preexisting prejudice about coming from a supposedly different line of work. But it's not a different line of work to me.\"\n\n\"The Great Spewdini\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nIt's true. Carrey's staggering talents as a comedian, actor and entertainer are undeniable and seemingly impossible to disentangle from any critique of his work as a visual artist.\n\nStripped of the context of his celebrity aura, the drawings and paintings resemble much of what can be found stacked on the blankets of any street artist hawking their wares on Venice Beach, or hung on the walls of a college town coffee shop or inked in the pages of an angry teen's notebook. Which makes \"IndigNation\" more compelling as a case study in the ethics of attention than anything else.\n\n\"Capitalism with a Conscience\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nTaylor Swift expressed support for Democratic senate and house candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in her home state of Tennessee (the former lost, while the latter was reelected), reportedly causing a spike in voter registration. And, at the 11th hour, Beyonc\u00e9 Instagrammed her support for Beto O'Rourke, whose campaign to represent Texas in the US senate failed to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Ted Cruz by a tiny margin. The irony that conflating politics with entertainment has forced us to enlist entertainers into politics is not lost on Carrey\n\n\"We're electing actors. I hate it. God bless him, he's a wonderful guy, but I don't want to see The Rock be our president ... I don't think I'm going to be stumping for anybody,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh Say Can't You See\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nBut being a celebrity does come with a certain amount of influence. Does he feel a responsibility toward that influence?\n\n\"I feel lucky,\" he said. \"I feel lucky to be in one of the last industries on Earth where people can tell the truth.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "(CNNEspa\u00f1ol.com)", "title": "La temporada final de 'Game of Thrones' se estrenar\u00e1 en abril", "description": "La cadena de televisi\u00f3n por cable premium hizo el anuncio en un tr\u00e1iler de la esperada temporada final, que constar\u00e1 de seis episodios.", "url": "https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2018/11/13/la-temporada-final-de-game-of-thrones-se-estrenara-en-abril/", "urlToImage": "https://cnnespanol2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/181004002931-game-of-thrones-iron-throne-cersei-super-tease.jpg?quality=100&strip=info", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T03:47:50Z", "content": "(CNN) - Todo ha estado llevando a este momento.

Richard Sokolsky is a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Among the most magical urban myths floating around the Trump administration is that Saudi Arabia is America's strategic partner and the relationship is simply too big to fail. Sadly, that relationship is already failing.\n\nIndeed, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), Saudi Arabia has willfully pursued policies that have undermined both American interests and values. Worse still, the Trump administration envisions a role for Saudi Arabia in its Middle East strategy that can only disappoint.\n\nIn recent weeks, Turkish authorities have accused the Saudi regime of responsibility for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed rogue operatives for the killing and dismissed a number of high-ranking officials.\n\nThere's no doubt that Saudi Arabia is important to the United States. Preserving global access to its oil, avoiding the chaos that would be unleashed if the kingdom collapsed or became a failed state, and cooperation on counter-terrorism are clearly core US interests.\n\nBut to concede these interests doesn't mean Saudi Arabia is a reliable security partner of the United States or that Riyadh is America's strategic ally. Saudi Arabia is in fact a repressive police state that has long exported a strain of Islam supportive of Islamic jihadi terrorist activity and that ideologically has been hostile to America, the West, Jews and Christians.\n\nMBS has made an effort to restrain religious extremism. But he's also launched a major crackdown to concentrate absolute power, repress civil society and journalists and jail or intimidate his opponents.\n\nAs for promoting US interests, the past year and a half reads like a DIY manual in undermining them. The detention of the Lebanese Prime Minister, in an apparent bid to force his resignation, has only strengthened Hezbollah. Bin Salman's disastrous boycott of Qatar made it more difficult for the Gulf Cooperation Council to stand up to Iran and has driven Doha and Tehran closer together, and his failed military campaign in Yemen has created instability, polarized the region and expanded rather than contracted Iranian influence (and given ISIS more room to maneuver).\n\nSaudi Arabia has proven to be too weak and incompetent to be a bulwark against Iran; on the contrary, it has been an enabler of Tehran's influence.\n\nThe Trump administration, and especially the President, have argued that punishing Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi would jeopardize the much ballyhooed $110 billion arms sales package that was announced last year in Riyadh. This is baloney. Of this amount, the Washington Post reported , there were many suggestions of intent to purchase weapons and \"six specific items, adding up to $28 billion, [of which] ... all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration.\"\n\nThe rest comprise a Saudi pipe dream of future purchases, not signed contracts, most of which are unlikely to reach fruition because of Saudi budgetary pressures. Moreover, in the unlikely event that the Saudis put their money where their mouth is, Trump's claims that it would produce 500,000 to one million jobs in the American defense industry are \"fake facts.\"\n\nThe real facts are: 1) the Saudis need US weapons and equipment more than we need to sell them, in part because they demonstrate the US security commitment to the kingdom; and 2) it would be very difficult and expensive for the Saudis to make good on their periodic threats to \"buy foreign\" if they can't get what they want from the United States.\n\nThen there's the much trumpeted claim the Saudis are always there when you need them on oil prices. There are many examples of the Saudis bucking US interests when it came to oil supply, including its leadership of the 1973 Arab oil boycott, its expansion of output to drive down prices in an effort to hurt the US oil fracking industry, and its decision this week to reduce supplies to drive prices up.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether, on another occasion, the Saudis would move to increase supplies in the wake of a very tight market. If they did so, it would be a calculation driven by a Saudi-first, not an America-first, oil policy.\n\nFinally, there's the administration's conviction that the Saudis are integral to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. There's no doubt that MBS has warmed up to the Israelis, largely because of their common interest in checking Iran and Sunni jihadists. But direct and under-the-table contacts are a far cry from open meetings or support for a US peace plan that on issues like Jerusalem and borders violates the Arab consensus and could hand Iran and Sunni Muslims a propaganda windfall if the plan is too aligned with the needs of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nKing Salman \u2014 MBS' father -- has reined in his son on this issue and publicly identified conditions that would be needed to gain Saudi support.\n\nIn response to the killing of Khashoggi, the Trump administration has doubled down on the US-Saudi relationship and would love to find a way to sweep this crime under the rug. Washington need not abandon the relationship, but it needs a serious reset. MBS has become more of a liability than an asset for Washington, and we should not be enabling or coddling him.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia wants to continue its reckless policies abroad and despotic behavior at home, it's free to do so, but not with American support. And that means imposing harsh costs on the Saudis for the killing of Khashoggi and serious efforts to end the kingdom's destructive and inhumane policies in Yemen."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "herbertholguin", "title": "'Detective Pikachu': el tr\u00e1iler de la pel\u00edcula divide a seguidores de Pok\u00e9mon", "description": "En la primera pel\u00edcula de Pok\u00e9mon ambientada en el mundo real, Pikachu habla y es un detective.

Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Filemon Vela of Texas, contended that their private conversations revealed that Pelosi would soon learn that she lacked backing within the full House to be elected speaker next year -- despite her confidence that she would lock down the necessary support.\n\n\"I am 100% confident we can forge new leadership,\" Vela told CNN.\n\nAsked how confident they were that they could defeat Pelosi, Moulton also said: \"100%.\"\n\nThe Pelosi detractors are circulating a letter and trying to accumulate enough signatures to showcase the breadth of the Democratic opposition to Pelosi. The strategy is this: Show that the California Democrat lacks support after new and current members commit to voting for another candidate on the floor. At that point, they hope, Pelosi will see the writing on the wall, step aside and allow new candidates for the speakership to emerge.\n\n\"We are trying to do the right thing for the party by solving this ahead of time,\" Moulton said.\n\nThe goal, they said, is to release their letter as soon as this week or at least before the Nov. 28 leadership elections in the House Democratic Caucus. Pelosi will have to win a majority of support within the caucus to be nominated as speaker -- something that is virtually assured -- before the full House votes for a speaker in January, where the numbers will be critical.\n\nSupporters of Pelosi are deeply skeptical about her critics' predictions, expecting she will get enough votes to become speaker and will overcome the opposition from the small minority of rabble-rousing Democrats. No candidate has emerged to take her on, with even her opponent after the 2016 elections, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, saying he had no plans to jump in at the moment.\n\n\"Leader Pelosi is very confident in her support among members and members-elect,\" said Drew Hammill, her spokesman.\n\nFor days, Pelosi herself expressed no doubt she'd be elected speaker.\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" she said on CNN last week when asked about her level of confidence.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whom many Pelosi detractors want to run for speaker, said he believes Pelosi will get the 218 votes she needs -- and insisted he was focused on his race for Democratic Caucus chairman, rather than a bid for the speakership.\n\n\"Never count out Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. \"Nobody within the Capitol dome is a better vote counter than the once and future speaker of the United States House of Representatives.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Marcia Fudge, a vocal Pelosi critic, said she's not ruling out a potential challenge against the Democratic leader.\n\n\"I have ruled out nothing,\" she said, adding that she's getting encouragement to run from \"a number\" of people. \"But what I'm saying to you is I haven't really given it any thought.\"\n\nThe current split in the House next year is 225-200, with Democrats holding the advantage, and with 10 races still outstanding, it's very likely that the Democratic majority will still grow. According to a CNN tally, 10 incoming freshman have said they'd oppose Pelosi, while 13 incumbents have vowed to oppose her.\n\nBut it's unclear if those members might vote against her in the caucus yet vote for her on the House floor. After the 2016 elections, 63 Democrats opposed Pelosi in the leadership races but nearly all of them voted for her later on the floor.\n\nJUST WATCHED Pelosi: I'm the best person to be speaker Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi: I'm the best person to be speaker 01:19\n\nAfter this month's vote, the Democratic candidate for speaker will face off against the Republican candidate for speaker in January. House rules say the candidate who wins the race must secure a majority of votes from the members who attend and actually cast votes for a candidate. So if members skip the vote or decide to vote \"present,\" that would lower the threshold below 218 to win the speaker's election, something that could help Pelosi if her critics decide to skip the vote rather than vote against her.\n\nMoulton and Vela insisted that none of the detractors would do that.\n\n\"I'm confident that at this point, we have a number of current and incoming members committed to going to the floor and voting for someone else and not voting present,\" Vela said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from lawmakers."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Embattled Florida election official speaks out", "description": "Brenda Snipes, the embattled Broward County elections supervisor, responds to Republicans in Florida and nationally who are trying to paint the statewide recount as a Democratic effort to steal the election.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/11/14/brenda-snipes-broward-county-elections-sot-vpx-cpt.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113214237-brenda-snipes-11-13-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:54:31Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

This famous West Hollywood road, dotted with marquee signs and patrolled by paparazzi, is where entertainment intersects with the American dream.\n\nAnd at 11pm on a Saturday at The Laugh Factory, it's also where Iranian-American comedian Maz Jobrani takes the stage. His aim is to give the audience relief from a tough week and from an even tougher political environment.\n\nFrom Trump jokes to dad jokes, no topic is taboo for Jobrani. His set covers his heritage, which has become a pillar of his standup, and his latest Netflix special \"Immigrant.\"\n\n\"Throughout my life and throughout my comedy I've talked about being Iranian, about being an immigrant. And I am very much in support of immigrants in America,\" says Jobrani.\n\nA new life\n\nIn 1978, when Jobrani was six years old, his family moved to the United States from Iran, as that country's revolution gathered steam.\n\n\"My father was on business in New York. He asked my mom to bring my sister and I out during winter break. I always say we packed for two weeks and we stayed for 40 years,\" he says.\n\nMaz Jobrani with his father in Iran (L) and in the United States at the age of eight (R).\n\nJobrani grew up in Northern California playing baseball and watching American cartoons, but also speaking Farsi and eating Persian food.\n\n\"The truth is, I never felt American enough and I never felt Iranian enough. I was always in between,\" says Jobrani.\n\nIt's this \"in between\" feeling that makes Jobrani's comedy so relatable. He's able to touch on a wide array of subjects that apply to many cultures.\n\nJobrani believes his brand of humor is universal. \"Jokes that you do in America will work in Saudi Arabia or in Jordan, or in Stockholm. It works all around the world,\" he says.\n\nThe American dream\n\nInspired by American comedian Eddie Murphy, Jobrani knew he wanted to be a performer from childhood.\n\nHe participated in drama classes throughout high school but when the time came for college applications, his parents pushed for a more conventional career path and persuaded him to study law. Later, while undertaking a PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, Jobrani took up acting again.\n\n\"I felt alive on stage. And whenever I would go to my political science classes, I felt kind of bogged down,\" he says.\n\nHe dropped out during the first year of his PhD. His mother was shocked -- and tried to persuade her son to become a mechanic.\n\n\"She said: 'Nobody needs an actor,'\" recalls Jobrani. \"My mom came from a revolution -- she thought you need to learn a skill so that if there's ever a revolution in America, you can go to Argentina and fix cars.\"\n\nComedy with a message\n\nJobrani honed his comedy skills at open mic nights, drawing on his personal experiences to develop his act. In the early 2000s, his career catapulted when he began touring with other Middle Eastern comedians under the title \"Axis of Evil\" -- a name designed to lampoon the term used by US president George W. Bush to describe states accused of sponsoring terrorism.\n\nMaz Jobrani's memoir, \"I'm Not a Terrorist But I've Played One on TV,\" was published in 2015.\n\nThe Comedy Central television channel picked it up and the group became a positive voice for Middle Eastern people in the wake of 9/11.\n\nSince then, Jobrani has had five TV standup specials, played roles in TV shows and movies, and penned a book called \"I'm Not a Terrorist But I've Played One on TV.\"\n\nOver the years, his comedy has mined other aspects of his identity -- dad, husband, Los Angeles resident.\n\nBut he says many of his jokes are still dedicated to one simple mission: making people see \"immigrant\" as a good word."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jeremy Diamond, CNN", "title": "President Trump to announce support for criminal justice overhaul proposal", "description": "President Donald Trump is expected to throw his support behind bipartisan criminal justice legislation during an event at the White House on Wednesday, two sources close to the process said.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/politics/trump-support-criminal-justice-overhaul/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180302121601-17-jared-kushner-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T02:12:17Z", "content": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to throw his support behind bipartisan criminal justice legislation during an event at the White House on Wednesday, two sources close to the process said.

Regrettably, that did not appear to happen in this case.\"\n\nMatey is the latest in a string of nominees with controversial resumes that have punctuated a record-breaking push by the Trump administration to reshape the federal judiciary in a conservative mold.\n\nAlong the way, a handful of nominees have had their nominations withdrawn, including one tapped for a circuit court, Ryan Bounds, whose past writings were considered by lawmakers to be insensitive.\n\nThe Senate has so far confirmed 29 of President Donald Trump's nominees for powerful appellate judgeships, a feat underpinned by close coordination among Senate Republicans, the White House and outside legal groups.\n\nMatey, who also served in the US Attorney's Office in New Jersey under Christie, was recommended to the White House for the seat on the federal bench by his former boss, according to a questionnaire Matey submitted to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs an assistant US attorney, Matey prosecuted white-collar crime and health care fraud cases, including a 2009 case involving a financial adviser convicted of swindling his clients out of more than $9 million. In 2010, Matey followed Christie to the state's capital, ultimately becoming a deputy chief counsel to the popular Republican.\n\nChristie, a close Trump ally, has in recent days been mentioned as a potential attorney general nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, Matey denied involvement in a list of other Christie scandals ticked off by Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat.\n\n\"So many of the scandals it's hard to -- we don't have time to go through all of them,\" Leahy said.\n\nMatey's involvement in the fallout of Bridgegate, a political retribution scheme that saw lane closures on a section of the George Washington Bridge snarl traffic in Fort Lee, New Jersey, appears limited -- reports prepared for the state Legislature and governor's office mention only an internal questioning of a Christie aide he made as the scandal emerged.\n\nMatey was also behind the firing of one of the Christie aides later indicted for her role in the scandal, according to the 2016 book \"American Governor: Chris Christie's Bridge to Redemption,\" by Matt Katz, who covered Christie's administration for years.\n\nTwo former officials linked to the governor's office were sentenced last year after being found guilty of federal conspiracy and fraud charges. An appeal of the case is before the 3rd Circuit, which is based in Philadelphia.\n\nMatey's hearing Tuesday came despite the disapproval of his nomination by his home state senators.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday protested the eschewing of that norm, referred to as the \"blue slip\" process, which has under recent committee chairmen allowed members of the party in opposition to the White House to block judicial nominees.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, repeated his stance on the blue slip process in an opening statement.\n\n\"My policy is that unreturned or negative blue slips will not necessarily preclude a hearing for a circuit-court nominee, unless the White House failed to consult with home-state senators,\" Grassley said, contending that it was consistent with decades of past committee leadership.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a member of the Judiciary Committee, pushed back on Grassley's assertion that the White House had meaningfully consulted with him on the nomination and said it was \"insulting\" that Trump aides had not set up a meeting between him and Matey ahead of the hearing.\n\nSome outside groups have expressed concern about Matey's involvement in the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal group that has held behind-the-scenes sway in the selection of judges and Supreme Court justices in the Trump administration. Matey has been a member of the group since 2001 and he led his state's chapter for several years, according to the questionnaire he submitted to the Senate.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, Vanita Gupta, the former acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division under the Obama administration, called Matey a \"conservative ideologue\" and dinged the Federalist Society as an \"out-of-the-mainstream legal organization.\"\n\nGupta, now the head of the DC-based Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, also criticized Matey for writing in his committee questionnaire that he had performed no pro bono legal work since becoming an attorney.\n\nShe said Matey was the only Trump judicial nominee to say that he had provided no free legal services outside of his professional duties.\n\nPressed on his lack of pro bono experience in Tuesday's hearing, Matey said his years in public service had \"constrained my position to take on outside clients,\" but he detailed past work that had affected under-served communities, including a prison re-entry program he started at a hospital in Newark where he was general counsel after leaving the governor's office in 2015."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Prince Charles visits West Africa", "description": "At 70, Prince Charles demonstrates with his recent tour of West Africa that he has no intentions of slowing down.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/11/14/prince-charles-trip-west-africa-max-foster-pkg-vpx.cnn", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113192914-prince-charles-visit-west-africa-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T01:29:44Z", "content": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

She loved it, but being on the other side of the world meant missing the weddings of many of her close childhood friends.\n\nAbout three years ago, Parkanyi found herself back in Hungary chatting with a woman who told her about the dozens of weddings she was attending that summer.\n\n\"She also shared that a few years back, she attended a traditional Indian wedding in India, and that it was the most amazing experience of her life,\" says Parkanyi.\n\nJoinMyWedding was started two years to hook visitors up with couples-to-be.

Couples would have to be keen to host strangers on the biggest day of their lives.\n\nJoinMyWedding's co-founder says she thought there would be a market for initiative. Courtesy JoinMyWedding.com\n\nThis was another reason why concentrating on Indian weddings made sense.\n\n\"We looked at different countries and India seemed the best option, because people there are really open to open up their wedding,\" says Parkanyi.\n\nPlus, nuptials in India are usually on a pretty huge, grand scale -- think thousands of guests -- and the wedding industry there is flourishing.\n\nThe company has familiarized itself with the myriad traditions associated with wedding ceremonies in India. Courtesy JoinMyWedding.com\n\nIt's also been very important for Parkanyi and her team to familiarize themselves with the traditions associated with Indian weddings of all religions.\n\n\"They are beautiful and amazing, but they are all different,\" she says.\n\nShe spoke to over 400 couples to familarize herself with proceedings, and says she's still learning.\n\nParkanyi has a background in the digital startup space -- she ran a women's network called Women as Entrepreneurs in Australia.\n\n\"That's my background.

They were not sure how to treat them or anything,\" she recalls.\n\nBut once her international guests arrived -- and they were respectful, interested and engaged -- everything worked out.\n\nThe experience costs guests $150 USD for one day or $250 for 2-3 or more.

She will move to a different job in the administration.\n\nIn those few months on the job, Ricardel generated a long list of enemies and developed a reputation for shouting at subordinates, plotting against White House officials she disliked and leaking stories about her administration opponents to the press. One source familiar with the situation said Ricardel's firing is due in part to her \"bullying\" of aides both above and below her.\n\nCurrent and former colleagues of Ricardel paint a picture of a committed conservative and national security expert with a strong personality. One former colleague described her as someone who doesn't \"suffer fools\" or have a nuanced touch when it comes to navigating the shoals of internal politics. A White House official was blunter, describing the California native as ideologically driven and \"obstinate\".\n\nEnemies\n\nThe former State Department and Pentagon official made enemies of heavyweights within the Trump administration, feuding with chief of staff John Kelly, his deputy Zach Fuentes, and locked horns with Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to people familiar with the White House intrigue.\n\nBut her spat with the first lady's staff over Mrs. Trump's trip to Africa -- apparently over seating on the plane and the use of National Security Council resources -- seems to have earned her the enmity of the person who may wield the most weight with Trump: his wife.\n\nThe President told people on Tuesday that he had made the decision to fire Ricardel, but that he was giving her time to clear her desk, making her the latest in a long list of high ranking officials who have left or been booted from the Trump administration.\n\nRicardel did not return requests for comment.\n\nRicardel was raised in Pasadena, the child of a Croatian immigrant and went on to study at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and then do doctoral work at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\nLong experience\n\nShe went on to hold positions in three Republican administrations, working in the departments of State, Defense and Commerce, as well as acting as an aide to then Republican Senate leader Bob Dole. She has also worked in the private sector, including at Boeing, before becoming a member of Trump's presidential transition team as a Pentagon adviser.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, who was in Singapore when news of Ricardel's dismissal broke, said when he tapped her to be his deputy in April that she \"has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues.\"\n\nAnd yet repeatedly during Ricardel's tenure, news stories trickled out of the troubled White House that suggested she wasn't managing teams or working within them particularly well.\n\nMost famously, she clashed with Mattis during the transition. Ricardel blocked some of his picks for Pentagon positions because they included former Obama administration officials who she felt were not strict Republican loyalists, multiple defense officials have told CNN.\n\nMattis then blocked Ricardel from getting a high level job at the Pentagon. In the months since Ricardel's arrival at the NSC, White House sources have repeatedly leaked stories to the press saying that Ricardel and Bolton were spreading rumors about Mattis' imminent departure in an effort to pressure the Pentagon chief to leave.\n\nBolton and Ricardel allegedly believe that Mattis is not \"ideologically aligned\" with Trump, according to Foreign Policy magazine, which quoted a former official saying that the two were trying \"to build the sense that he is done for.\"\n\nA former Trump transition official who is close to Ricardel said Ricardel thinks Mattis \"never should have been appointed and thinks he's a Democrat and tells anyone who will listen.\"\n\nRicardel also had a fraught relationship with Kelly and Fuentes, according to people familiar with the matter.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) By all accounts, Mira Ricardel has not made a lot of friends in the Trump administration. A key member of national security adviser John Bolton's team, she was brought in in April to help him shake up the national security staff. In the past, she had butted heads with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly not a fan, two former White House officials told the Washington Post .\n\nNow it appears that she has learned, quite publicly, that the one you really don't want to mess with is the first lady.\n\nIn another episode of \"Survivor: West Wing,\" Melania Trump went public Tuesday with her personnel concerns about Ricardel, in the process undermining the national security staff and -- not to be forgotten -- our national security. Indeed CNN reported Tuesday afternoon that \"a White House official confirmed ... that Trump has told people that Ricardel will be fired, but she has been given some time to clear out her desk.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nThe once private dispute between the first lady, her staff and Ricardel broke into the open this week after news reports that Ricardel had challenged some request from the first lady's office about Melania Trump's recent trip to Africa. CNN reported that a person familiar with the most recent dustup said \"Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.\"\n\nMelania Trump's spokeswoman issued a statement Tuesday that \"(i)t is the position of the office of the first lady that she [Ricardel] no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nSo, let me make a few things clear. First, Ricardel may have been behaving badly regarding the Africa trip; there are some suggestions in news reports that she deliberately withheld national security resources from the first lady's office. Second, Melania Trump has every right to relate her disdain for bad behavior to her husband or Bolton and to ask for a staffer's resignation over not sufficiently respecting the first lady's duties.\n\nBut what is not acceptable, and indeed dangerous, is the extent to which Melania Trump used her status as a family member \u2014 unelected, unappointed and unqualified \u2014 to dictate national security personnel decisions, in public, as if there are no global consequences to such action.\n\nAnd, in this regard, the first lady was acting very -- Trumpish.\n\nThere is a great deal of this sort of behavior in this White House \u2014 the people's house. The President, her husband, wants a military parade (eventually). Jared Kushner, Melania Trump's son-in-law, wants to guide Middle East politics while continuing his business deals with those very same nations.\n\nEarlier in the administration, Ivana Trump, Melania Trump's husband's ex-wife, said she was considered for (and turned down) the post of ambassador to the Czech Republic. And Ivanka Trump, her daughter-in-law, just received initial approval for 16 new trademarks from China, while experts on trade are trying to avoid a tariff war.\n\nAll these are examples where the line between national security and Trump family interest are blurred, if not essentially invisible. There are no American interests for the first family, only Trump personal or financial interests.\n\nAnd there is likely to be more drama poured into the security mix in coming days. Sources in the White House made it clear Tuesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen's days in her job are numbered. And John Kelly, the chief of staff, may also be booted, sources told CNN.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMelania Trump's actions are consistent with the mercurial management preferences of the Trump family; indeed, the President is keen on calling the defense apparatus that exists to protect America \"my generals.\" The family has turned national security -- once, not so long ago, immune from the political backstabbing and favor-grabbing that animate the political side of the White House -- into its own TV-style drama. The first lady felt no need to hide that that was exactly the way she was handling things.\n\nBolton, who hired Ricardel, doesn't have many options. Melania Trump has spoken. This is no longer our national security hard at work to protect the American public. It is a denigration of the career staff and (whether you like him or not) the NSA's Bolton. In public.\n\nDear world, this is America's security apparatus. Fear us? Respect us?

But for months, experts have been warning the city isn't ready, and concerns remain over costs, infrastructure and security.\n\nThis is the first time Papua New Guinea (PNG), the poorest of the 21 countries in APEC, has hosted the summit. PNG ranks 110th worldwide for GDP, with an economy roughly the size of Cyprus or Afghanistan, according to the World Bank, and far behind richer APEC nations like Australia or China.\n\nSome leaders won't even be staying in the PNG capital -- often ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world -- and instead are flying in and out of the country via the Australian city of Cairns, across the Coral Sea.\n\nOther leaders are staying away altogether. US President Donald Trump decided not to attend the summit, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place, though Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Xi Jinping will both be in PNG.\n\nViolence and disorder\n\nIn June, PNG's government declared a nine-month state of emergency and sent in the military following intensive violence in the Southern Highlands province (SHP), where rioters looted businesses and torched a government plane and court buildings. One commentator described the situation in parts of the country as close to \"civil war.\"\n\n\"The full scale of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea is difficult to assess, given the limited coverage and poor quality of police and other data,\" academic and PNG expert Sinclair Dinnen wrote in a report for Australia's Lowy Institute in December . \"Levels of unreported crime, including rape and other sexual offenses, are extremely high, particularly in rural areas where access to police is limited. Significant variations exist between urban and rural settings, as well as within regional, rural, and urban contexts.\"\n\nIn part, violent crime is driven by the proliferation of illegal firearms, both homemade within PNG and smuggled in from neighboring Indonesia.\n\nSince the 1990s, fear of crime and widespread instability has seen a \"flourishing of non-state security providers\" seeking to fill the gap, according to a World Bank report\n\nBut while some of these firms have helped provide vital services to businesses that the local police or government simply are unable to, officials have warned that this booming private industry may be compounding the very problems it is intended to correct.\n\n\"There is a huge gap between the state's ability to deliver public safety and the society's need for collective peace and order,\" a 2013 government report said. However, it warned that the growing presence of foreign private security firms \"undermines the state's ability and authority\" to deliver these services.\n\nRegional militaries have largely stepped in to fill the gap, with both New Zealand and Australian providing training and resources to their PNG counterparts.\n\nThis photo taken on November 5, 2018, shows Papua New Guinea security forces on parade in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nPutting PNG on the map\n\nFor the PNG government, APEC seems like a silver bullet to many of its problems, raising the country's profile and helping it break free of a reputation for chaos and danger that has dogged it for decades.\n\nBut some critics have warned that the meeting of regional leaders could do the very opposite, exposing systemic issues within PNG and embarrassing it in front of the world.\n\nAs far back as 2016, opposition lawmakers were urging the government to \"swallow its pride\" and cancel the summit, saying it would be a waste of resources.\n\nFormer PNG Prime Minister Mekere Morauta in July accused the current government of converting the two-day summit into a \"cargo cult.\"\n\n\"APEC will not solve PNG's problems such as the rampant corruption, high unemployment, escalating crime, deteriorating state of health centers and hospitals as well as classrooms, roads, telecommunication and transport services,\" he said.\n\nMany were particularly enraged by the government's purchase of 40 custom-made Maserati cars -- which were flown in from Italy -- for leaders to use while they're in Port Moresby.\n\nNeighboring Australia is bearing a large part of the bill for the summit -- upwards of $90 million (130 million AUD), according to the ABC -- as is China, which has been significantly increasing its footprint in the Pacific , to no small concern in Canberra and other regional capitals.\n\nPapua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill gives a talk at the Lowy Institute in Sydney on May 14, 2015.\n\nCritics of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, who has been dogged by accusations of corruption for years, have accused him of seeking to distract from other issues with the splashy international conference, a repeat, some said, of the 2015 Pacific Games.\n\n\"Three years later, some of the South Pacific Games venues are still to be completed, others are not open to the general public, and many have been closed temporarily due to unpaid service bills accumulated from the Games,\" according to Watna Mori , director of PNG Presence, a consultancy firm. \"This is an example of what may happen to the infrastructure being built now to host the APEC summit.\"\n\nLast month, opposition lawmakers called for a nationwide stay at home strike over high government spending and alleged corruption in the run-up to APEC.\n\nAt a forum in Brisbane in May, O'Neill defended his government's focus on APEC, saying the summit would put PNG on the map, ensuring \"everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is\" and not confuse it with an African country.\n\nThis photo taken on November 4, 2018, shows the Australian warship HMAS Adelaide moored off APEC Haus in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nHeavy security presence\n\nO'Neill's government has pulled out all the stops to ensure the summit goes off without a hitch, and residents of the capital can expect a massive security presence while world leaders are visiting PNG.\n\nPolice have vowed to crack down hard on any unlawful public assembly or protest around the summit, with Deputy Police Commissioner Jim Andrews saying in a statement last month that \"all public servants including members of the Constabulary are duty bound and obligated towards ensuring that government efforts geared towards the 2018 APEC Summit is cohesively supported and maintained.\"\n\nAndrews warned police \"would not hesitate to arrest and detain opportunists and trouble makers who defy lawful authority by disturbing peace and good order in the community.\"\n\nAlongside local police and military, many of the troops providing security for the summit will be foreign. Australia has sent 1,500 soldiers to Port Morseby, along with a Royal Australian Air Force squadron patrolling the country's airspace, and the helicopter carrier HMAS Adelaide, which is currently moored off the city.\n\nThe US Coast Guard has also deployed around 95 troops to PNG, their boats are already patrolling parts of the waters around Port Moresby which have been declared restricted areas during the summit.\n\n\"The safety and security of the maritime environment surrounding Port Moresby will be critical during Leaders' Week. Australia is pleased to enhance PNG's maritime security arrangements for APEC by providing these capabilities,\" Australia's Minister for Defense Christopher Pyne said earlier this month.\n\n\"This support is a clear demonstration of Australia's close and longstanding defense relationship with PNG and the interoperability our defense forces have developed over a number of decades.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": null, "title": "Dave Chappelle photobombs engagement photos", "description": "Tommy Saunders and Emily Eldridge were enjoying a photo shoot in Yellow Springs, Ohio, when Dave Chappelle hopped in on the couple's engagement photos.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2018/11/13/dave-chappelle-photobomb-engagement-photos-sot-vpx.hln", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113095245-dave-chappelle-photobomb-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:25:21Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Dave Chappelle photobombs engagement photos\n\nOn the Story with Erica Hill\n\nTommy Saunders and Emily Eldridge were enjoying a photo shoot in Yellow Springs, Ohio, when Dave Chappelle hopped in on the couple's engagement photos."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Analysis by Z.

Vladimir Putin, for instance, was re-elected earlier this year with more than 76% of the vote and more than 67% turnout.\n\nThat's a good solid result for the Russian President. Probably too good to be true. International election monitors said at the time that it was \"overly controlled\" and \"lacked genuine competition.\" No US presidential candidate -- even in the most remarkable of landslides -- has ever gotten more than 61% of the popular vote, and no US election in more than 100 years has drawn 67% of the voting population.\n\nBut President Donald Trump congratulated Putin on the win and wouldn't criticize the questionable results, which is odd given he's cried voter fraud both about the 2016 election that put him in the White House and the close results in Florida and Arizona during this month's midterms.\n\nFar from offering congratulations to rival Democrats, Trump has spent more time challenging the results in individual races, complaining about fraud where there's no evidence any exists and instilling doubts about the integrity of the vote in people's minds, while their confidence in American elections had already been dropping.\n\nThere's no evidence in the US of widespread voter fraud, despite what Trump said of the last two elections ; whereas in Russia this year there were actual videos of poll workers stuffing ballot boxes.\n\nAmericans are generally comfortable with the state of US elections. A Pew survey in October found 82% of Americans very or somewhat confident their votes in their communities would be counted as they intended in November.\n\nThey were a bit more leery of elections nationwide: 25% were very confident, 47% were somewhat confident, 21% were not too confident and 6% were not at all confident. But that's still a combined 72% of the country very or somewhat confident their votes would be counted as they intended.\n\nBut what's interesting is that while Americans are still broadly confident their own votes will be counted, they have become a lot less \"very confident.\" Between 2008 and 2016 -- there is no Pew data for the elections in between -- the percentage of people answering \"very confident\" dropped 8 percentage points. It was over 60% in 2004 and has been under 50% the last two elections.\n\nAll of that was before Trump and Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott in particular started alleging fraud and theft by campaign officials, particularly in Florida, who were taking a long time to count votes. Or before Democrats, including Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who is behind in vote counts, started challenging recount rules. In Florida, in particular, this election is turning into a legal mess.\n\nBoth Scott's bid for Senate and the governor's race to replace him are destined for recounts.\n\nTrump was also crying fraud at the US Senate election in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally led in votes after election night but has fallen behind as absentee votes were counted. McSally has since conceded the election, but Trump has not walked back his tweet implying voter fraud there. He has started to focus instead on pressuring the Democrats in Florida to concede.\n\nAmericans were more concerned in the Pew report about hacking of elections. Less than half (45%) were confident that US elections are secure from hacking or other technological threats. Just 8% said they were very confident US elections are secure in that way.\n\nAll of that Pew information, by the way, was from before the close races on Election Day led the President to accuse local officials in multiple states of fraud and trying to steal votes.\n\nHis allegations can only inflame what was already a partisan split. Another tidbit from Pew's report is that majorities of both Democrats (64%) and Republicans (56%) say the opposing party has little or no commitment to fair and accurate elections in the US.\n\nThe American form of democracy has plenty of issues. A patchwork of standards governing elections makes voting in Florida a very different thing from voting in California. The Electoral College is tilted toward rural states; the candidate with more votes has lost the presidency because of the Electoral College twice. Efforts to make it difficult for certain people to vote are viewed either as voter suppression or voter security, depending on one's political view.\n\nTrump voters back in 2016, when he was railing that the election was rigged against him, were more likely to tell Pew they had little or no confidence the election would be open and fair.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats held nothing back in their recent allegations of voter suppression against then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican who now leads Democrat Stacey Abrams in their bid to become governor.\n\nRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election led the group Freedom House, an independent watchdog organization that ranks nations by political freedom, to downgrade its score of US freedoms from 89 to 86 on a scale of 100. The US is still among the 45% of countries it places in the \"free\" category, along with most of South America and Europe. Russia, China and most of Africa and the Middle East are classified as \"not free.\"\n\nNone of that big picture stuff seems to matter to Trump as he tweets his grievances at local officials in Florida.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the percentage of countries that Freedom House places in the \"free\" category to 45%."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Eric Schnurer", "title": "Justice Roberts, pay attention to what Brian Kemp did", "description": "Recent attempts at voter purging and suppression in Georgia, North Dakota and elsewhere prove why Congress needs to revive the Voting Rights Act, writes Eric Schnurer.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/opinions/reenact-new-voting-rights-act-schnurer/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181101114340-cnn-special-report-voter-suppression-democracy-in-peril-ron-7-00002105-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:16:36Z", "content": "Eric B.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?\" the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes was often quoted as asking. This is a question we ought to be asking of Chief Justice John Roberts and Congress in the wake of the 2018 elections -- most notably in Georgia.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), gutting enforcement of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act, or VRA, elevated Keynes' supposed dictum to the level of constitutional mandate. The court ruled that the provisions of the VRA, requiring states with histories of voting rights violations to submit themselves to federal preapproval of any changes in voting procedures or electoral rules, were deemed unconstitutional because of changes in the underlying facts.\n\nIn Roberts' telling, interference with African-American voting rights in the South was ancient history, successfully swept away by the VRA itself, not to mention a New South where torch-lit Klu Klux Klan marches with Confederate battle flags were things of the past. When the facts change, Roberts asserted, the court must change its mind as to a law's constitutionality.\n\nIf Roberts and the court's majority mean what they say, then they need to change their minds again after last week's developments.\n\nNever mind that, in the decade preceding the court's Shelby County decision, Georgia had continued adopting voting changes that the US Department of Justice found discriminatory roughly once every three months.\n\nSince then, Georgia has pursued voting restrictions disproportionately affecting African-Americans and other minorities with renewed vigor: It closed 214 polling places , for example. Then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp took the lead on aggressive voting-reduction efforts, purging the voting rolls of over 1 million primarily minority voters and instituting an \"exact match\" requirement that removed voters for any clerical errors or misspellings.\n\nWhen this policy was struck down by the federal courts, it was essentially just re-enacted by the Georgia Legislature at Kemp's urging. (The Brennan Center for Justice, for example, has found that both reduced numbers of voting machines and increased voter purges disproportionately affect minority voters.)\n\nKemp even expressed \"concern\" to donors at a private dinner earlier this year that Democrats would defeat him \"especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote.\" No wonder: His African-American opponent, Stacey Abrams, had launched her career by organizing people to vote.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, Kemp -- still overseeing the voting in his own election -- threw out or held up thousands of absentee ballot applications, a majority of which turned out to be from African-Americans, until ordered to cease and desist by the federal courts.\n\nThat didn't stop a record shortage of voting machines in black precincts on Election Day, or -- and this is really the most eye-rolling of all -- what machines there were from running out of battery power in the middle of voting. Even by such means, Kemp (as of this writing) was barely able to cling to a narrow majority.\n\nThe larger point is that none of this occurs in a vacuum. As everyone knows, Georgia and other states have a long history of racial oppression -- but just because it's long doesn't mean that it's dead.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Congress enacted several constitutional amendments that outlawed slavery (the 13th), established due process and equal protection under the laws for all Americans (the 14th) and prohibited racial discrimination against the right to vote (the 15th).\n\nThese amendments, in more-or-less identical language, expressly grant Congress the \"power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\" Under that authority, Congress had reauthorized the VRA's preclearance provision, and the formula for determining those states and localities to which it applied, as recently as 2006 -- only seven years before Roberts found it terribly outdated.\n\nRoberts' approach ignores -- in fact, rejects -- the continuing relevance of the Civil War and the history of the Confederate States in construing those Civil War Amendment guarantees. Whatever the real-world relevance of Confederate history to US today, its relevance to the Constitution -- and, particularly, the Civil War Amendments -- is central: It was the sole animating reason for the three amendments that dramatically reshaped federal authority over the states. That history matters.\n\nListen, for instance, to those defending President Donald Trump's position opposing birthright citizenship: They assert that these amendments were concerned entirely with the former Confederate states' treatment of African-Americans, not our current conditions (and, hence, not intended to protect undocumented immigrants).\n\nIn short, conservatives and self-styled \"originalists\" ought to be (and usually are) the first to agree that historic rather than current conditions should dictate Congress' scope of action. As such, the mechanism to sweep away any constitutional deadwood isn't court fiat -- it's an amendment.\n\nBut let's assume that Roberts was correct -- and intends to be consistent -- that the Constitution requires keeping pace with today's realities. The more important issue in the Shelby County decision, then, is the contention by Roberts and the court's majority that the facts had changed and so, too, had the VRA's constitutionality.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPerhaps the chief justice was correct that, by 2013, the VRA's concerns with racial discrimination in voting had been rendered anachronistic by its own success. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg trenchantly observed in her dissent , however, \"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\" It's now also clear, to continue Ginsburg's metaphor, that putting your umbrella away when it's not raining, as Roberts would have it, is usually sufficient itself to provoke a cloudburst.\n\nAnd so it has. Since the Shelby County decision, increased restrictions on voting have been enacted in many states where Republicans reign. But nowhere have attempts to shut down the black vote been as widespread -- and the result as transparent -- as in Georgia.\n\nOnly someone willfully blind to all this would fail to see that exactly the same behaviors have rearisen in exactly the same places as before. The Roberts Court majority -- or, if it turns out to be so utterly disingenuous, then Congress itself -- needs to revisit Shelby County today and reinstate the VRA in the form Congress enacted it. After all, the facts have clearly changed back to, well, what they always really were."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Ben Westcott and Yong Xiong, CNN", "title": "Young Marxists are going missing in China after protesting for workers", "description": "Fear is sweeping through the campuses of China's elite universities following a nationwide government crackdown aimed at silencing left-wing student activists, who had been campaigning for greater rights and protections for ordinary workers.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/asia/china-student-marxist-missing-intl/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171108101207-forbidden-city-tease-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:13:33Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Hong Kong (CNN) Fear is sweeping through the campuses of China's elite universities following a nationwide government crackdown aimed at silencing left-wing student activists, who had been campaigning for greater rights and protections for ordinary workers.\n\nSince August at least nine young Chinese labor advocates have been forcibly detained in major cities across the country, a sharp escalation in Beijing's campaign against student activism on university campuses.\n\n\"The whole of Peking University is like under the white terror now, (the security guards) will come after you even if you were just at the scene where the student activists were distributing leaflets,\" a student at the prestigious Peking University told CNN Tuesday.\n\nOn Friday, one graduate, Zhang Shengye, was attacked and dragged into a car at the Beijing university by several people in black jackets, according to a widely circulated open letter.\n\n\"Someone used his arm to put me in a headlock and pushed me forward ...

(Zhang's) crime was essentially to draw attention to the fact that another student had disappeared,\" Friedman, the American professor, told CNN.\n\n'Wave of repression'\n\nFriedman's university, Cornell, cut ties with China's Renmin University in October over growing questions around academic freedom in the country, as well as concerns for the safety of exchange students.\n\n\"The wave of repression we're in is not just the last few weeks. It's a very conscious strategy on the park of the state to close a space for academic freedom,\" he said.\n\nFriedman said Chinese students were being strongly pushed to study Marxism in universities, in juxtaposition to banned Western ideologies considered dangerous by the government, such as democracy or liberalism.\n\n\"Now they're taken it to heart, the government is cracking down quite significantly. In some ways, this is the government's own making,\" he said.\n\nThe arrests came shortly after the arrival of a new Communist Party chief at Peking University, Qiu Shuiping, who was formerly the top state security official in Beijing between 2013 and 2014.\n\nAnalysts at the time pointed to Qiu's appointment as an indication the Communist Party wanted to pull the student community at the university into line.\n\nDespite the disappearances and the attacks, not all the left-wing activists are giving up. Renaming their group from \"Finding Yue Movement\" to the \"Missing Peking University Alumni Watchers,\" labor rights advocates released another open letter on Sunday calling for their former members' release.\n\n\"We can't let those who collected firewood for others be frozen to death in the snow, and we can't let those who created the path of freedom be trapped in the thorns,\" the letter said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Lydia DePillis, CNN Business", "title": "Helipads and everything else Amazon is getting out of its deals with New York and Virginia", "description": "When Amazon started looking for a second headquarters location more than a year ago, the company asked cities to put their best offers on the table \u2014 in cash.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/business/amazon-hq2-subsidies/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113083812-20181113-amazon-location-gfx-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:08:52Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Washington D.C. (CNN Business) When Amazon started looking for a second headquarters location more than a year ago, the company asked cities to put their best offers on the table \u2014 in cash.\n\n\"Incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process,\" the initial request read.\n\nThe victors, New York and Virginia, delivered. The final deals revealed on Tuesday showed they provided total incentives worth about $2.8 billion total \u2014 extraordinarily generous offers to a company whose profits in 2017 totaled $3 billion on $178 billion in revenues, and whose founder Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest man in the world.\n\nThat number only reflects the value of subsidies if Amazon hires the expected 25,000 employees in each location. If the company were to add 40,000 employees, and also win additional New York City tax breaks afforded to all companies that meet certain qualifications, the total amount of subsidies could go as high as about $5.5 billion.\n\nAmazon's requested perks include not just money, but a helipad at its planned new locations in Long Island City and National Landing \u2014 a tall order, given that Crystal City currently falls within a flight restricted zone where the only allowed flights are those that go through the airport or have to do with law enforcement and the military.\n\n\"I was surprised the package wasn't bigger,\" said John Boyd , a site selection consultant who wasn't involved in the Amazon search. \"For a high-cost market like Long Island City, incentives are a necessarily evil.\"\n\nAmazon has long been a master of extracting tax incentives by playing local governments off one another as they vie for fulfillment centers, offices, and other sources of jobs.\n\nFor its headquarters, the company didn't go with the richest offer.\n\nMaryland had pledged $8.5 billion for sites just north of Washington D.C. and New Jersey had offered a $7 billion package if Amazon located in Newark. Those offers were predicated on a single headquarters with 50,000 jobs rather than the existing split deal with 25,000 in each location, but still would have blown the New York and Virginia offers out of the water \u2014 a signal that Amazon was not willing to compromise on access to technical talent.\n\nSome of the incentives are subject to approval by state and local legislative bodies, setting up a likely political fight over how much public money to give away in exchange for thousands of high-paying tech jobs.\n\nAlready, a New York state legislator has signaled he plans to introduce a bill to block the deal by phasing out the economic incentive statutes upon which the agreement is based.\n\n\"There is a much better way of allocating our taxpayer's money that will directly help the communities,\" said New York State Assemblyman Ron Kim, who represents parts of Queens.\n\nVirginia's offer: $22,000 per job\n\nThe bulk of Virginia's tax incentives come in the form of a cash grant of $22,000 for each job added over the next 12 years, as long as the average annual wage of those jobs is at least $150,000 \u2014 a total of $550 million if Amazon adds the 25,000 jobs it says it will, and up to $750 million it if adds more jobs on top of that.\n\nThe funds, which have to be appropriated by the Virginia General Assembly, are designed to decrease slightly in value if more than 10% of the new hires are focused on federal government contracts.\n\nIn addition, Amazon will receive $23 million cash from the local Arlington County authorities based on an expected increase in hotel taxes, which needs to be approved by the County Board.\n\nAnother $28 million in forecast property tax revenues will be dedicated to infrastructure investments around National Landing, the new branding for the collective developments of Potomac Yards, Pentagon City and Crystal City, all across the Potomac River but still within view of downtown Washington DC.\n\nThe agreement with Arlington County also pledges assistance in securing the necessary approval for a helipad on Amazon's new campus.\n\nVirginia's memorandum with Amazon pledges a maximum of $195 million of state investment to pay for transportation projects in the area, including a pedestrian bridge to connect the neighborhoods to nearby Reagan National Airport, which is separated from Amazon's new home by a highway.\n\nVirginia pledged a few other goodies, such as a commitment to \"regulatory flexibility\" in order to allow new technologies to operate in the area, as well as confidentiality for \"all materials, communications, data, and information related to this Memorandum.\" That could mean testing of everything from drones to autonomous delivery vehicles, which Amazon has been developing at its Seattle headquarters.\n\nNew York's offer: $48,000 per job\n\nThe combined offer from New York State and New York City is considerably richer than the one offered by Virginia, and does not require approval by any local or state legislative body.\n\nThe incentives offered for Amazon's Long Island City campus total $1.5 billion if the company hires 25,000 people, and up to $1.7 billion if it hires 40,000 people, which mostly reflects a $48,000-per-job tax credit for every position as long as the average salary is at least $150,000.\n\nThere's another cash grant of $325 million based on the company occupying a certain amount of office space.\n\nThe agreement also pledges assistance in securing a helipad, with flights limited to 120 per year and limited to company executives.\n\nWhen asked why New York's bid was so much higher than Virginia's at a press conference on Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out that Virginia's personal income tax is lower than New York's. \"I don't know how they calculated it, and what they actually calculated,\" Cuomo said. \"So I don't have an idea about how they put together their transaction.\"\n\nWhile the New York deal is worth more for Amazon, it also comes with more requirements than the Virginia agreement.\n\nFor example, Amazon pledged to create space for a tech startup incubator, artist studios, and public open space. The agreement also includes requirements for participation by minority and women-owned businesses in the construction process.\n\nThe state, the city, and Amazon pledged to kick in $5 million each for workforce development initiatives, such as technology training programs targeted at local public housing residents and high school students \u2014 which, of course, also furthers Amazon's goal of staffing up in a tight labor market.\n\nDon't forget Nashville\n\nAlthough it wouldn't qualify as a \"headquarters,\" Nashville won 5,000 jobs, with Tennessee kicking in $102 million in tax incentives including a job subsidy worth $13,000 per head.\n\nBoth the city and the state components of the incentive package will have to be approved by various legislative bodies."}, {"source": {"id": "cnn", "name": "CNN"}, "author": "Jill Filipovic", "title": "Wisconsin teens' apparent Nazi salute is a terrifying sight", "description": "A viral photo of a group of young men raising an apparent Sieg Heil salute should be a moment of reckoning for the community that raised them up, and the country that too often tacitly or even explicitly overlooks or endorses bigotry writes Jill Filipovic.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/opinions/wisconsin-teens-apparent-nazi-salute-filipovic/index.html", "urlToImage": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181113094217-unblurred-baraboo-high-school-nazi-salute-super-tease.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:05:19Z", "content": "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in Washington and the author of the book \" The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.\" Follow her on Twitter.

It's of high school students in Wisconsin, and it was taken last year for the prom. It has gone viral and, of course, with good reason:\n\nWhen we've seen historic WWII photos of this sort, they have served to remind us not just of the mass genocide of Jews, people with disabilities, Roma people, LGBT people and other minorities, but of the dark fact that an entire nation got behind that genocide. And that a sophisticated government waged an effective propaganda campaign that relied on a long-existing chauvinism of white Germanic Christian superiority. And that while of course not every single German was on board, a great many were culpable.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump cheered Senate victory; so did supremacists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump cheered Senate victory; so did supremacists 03:13\n\nThe rise of Adolf Hitler, and the Holocaust that followed, was not the story of a malleable but ultimately innocent populace exploited by a powerful and malevolent few. It was instead a story we always see with autocrats, dictators and genocidaires: one of a powerful few backed by a malevolent many.\n\nSome who are sympathetic to the Wisconsin students -- white non-Jews, one imagines -- will be tempted to write this off as teenage antics for which the young men should not pay a significant price. One of those people appears to be Peter Gust, the motorcycle photographer who took the photo and posted it on his website. I can imagine that many people saw the photo and wondered if this could have all been avoided if there was an \"adult in the room.\" It turns out there was.\n\nGust claims the photo is \"innocent,\" and is actually of the kids waving goodbye to their parents (I don't know how people wave in Wisconsin, but I've never seen it done like that). Gust has also taken the photo down and complained about \"jerks\" who are being online bullies -- by which he apparently meant the people angry about the photo, and not the teenagers who appear to be making a Nazi salute.\n\nThe photo was also tweeted on a parody account called @GoBaraboo with the caption \"We even got the black kid to throw it up.\" If the photo was of an innocent group wave, why would it be notable that the one African-American kid participated?\n\nThe school administration is now investigating, and Baraboo police tweeted that they are assisting. It's unclear why police would be involved with this -- throwing up a Nazi salute is disgusting and offensive, but it is not and should not be illegal. Still, the school needs to take this seriously. That doesn't mean just a slap on the wrist. The school should have a policy on racist bullying (and if it doesn't, it needs to implement one immediately), and the students should face meaningful consequences -- suspension at the very least, and certainly alerting any colleges to which these students have been accepted.\n\nJUST WATCHED Student speaks out against Nazi salute photo Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Student speaks out against Nazi salute photo 02:55\n\nRight-wing terrorism, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorism, is the biggest domestic terror threat Americans now face. Is each student who raised a Nazi salute in that photo a potential terrorist? Of course not. But this is not merely youthful hijinks. We don't know why these particular young men went along with this pose, but it bears a chilling similarity to the gesture of genocidal regimes that many white supremacist terrorists display. It's no joke.\n\nThis should also be a moment of reckoning for the community that raised up these young men. They didn't have to learn the Sieg Heil salute at home to have grown up in a culture that tacitly or even explicitly overlooks or endorses bigotry. At least one student wrote to a reporter that bullying and bigotry are par for the course at Baraboo High School.\n\nOne has to wonder what messages these teens absorbed from the authority figures and adults around them (not to mention the adults in the White House ) to conclude not only that throwing up a Nazi salute would make for a great photo, but also that it would be funny to tweet and share it.\n\nFor more opinion...

It lived online for many months \u2014 and only now when it is under public scrutiny has there been a reaction. The Twitter account on which it was shared Sunday night \u2014 on Armistice Day \u2014 has now been made private. What does this incident say about the values of these young men as they leave high school and enter the adult world?\n\nRepudiating hatred and bigotry must happen at home. But we also need leaders and authority figures, from teachers to the President of the United States, to model goodness, open-mindedness and intolerance of hate and bigotry. On that, we are failing, from Wisconsin to Washington."}]
