(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe University of Maryland sought this week to assuage concerns that adenovirus infections at the school might be tied to mold exposure, writing that it appeared there was \u201cno consistent connection\u201d between the two health concerns. A U-Md. student died Sunday of an adenovirus-associated illness.\n\nThe university\u2019s health center on Monday posted online a set of frequently asked questions about adenovirus. Earlier this semester, U-Md. dealt with mold in a campus dormitory \u2014 a problem that forced students to temporarily relocate to hotels. One of the questions posted online addressed concerns of a possible connection between mold and the virus.\n\n\u201cThe cases of adenovirus-associated illness on campus have been seen both in students living on and off campus and among students in residence halls affected by mold and not,\u201d the website said. \u201cAs such, it appears that there is no consistent connection between mold exposure and the incidents of adenovirus infection affecting UMD students.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said no link exists between mold and adenovirus. That virus usually spreads from one infected person to another, the CDC said. That can happen through touching or shaking hands, or coughing and sneezing. It also spreads when people touch objects or surfaces on which the virus has landed, and proceed to touch their mouth, nose or eyes before washing their hands.\n\nThe university on Tuesday said a student had died of an adenovirus-associated illness. The student, identified as 18-year-old Olivia Paregol, had lived in Elkton Hall, a dorm on the College Park campus where mold was discovered this year. Paregol, a freshman at the university, was from Howard County, Md.\n\nMaryland learned on Nov. 1 that a student was dealing with adenovirus, David McBride, director of the University Health Center, said in a statement this week. University officials worked with the state Department of Health and Prince George\u2019s County Health Department to monitor for cases since that discovery.\n\n\u201cThe health center staff has been on high-alert and we have reached out to medical facilities in the area to heighten awareness of this illness,\u201d McBride\u2019s statement said.\n\nSince the first case emerged, McBride wrote, five more cases of students with \u201cconfirmed adenovirus-associated illness\u201d have been reported. And one specimen, sent to federal officials for testing, showed an adenovirus strain that can lead to more serious health problems.\n\nAdenovirus-related illnesses are usually treated with rest, fluids and medicine to reduce a fever, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, vigilance is extremely important for those with chronic medical problems like asthma, diabetes or illnesses that lower your immune system or if you take medicine that lowers your immune system,\u201d McBride said in the statement.\n\nConcerns about mold have lingered this year on the College Park campus, where mold was reported throughout Elkton Hall, home to more than 500 students. The problem, which occurred earlier in the semester, worsened because of \u201csignificant rain and high humidity in our area,\u201d according to a university statement at the time.\n\nTo deal with the mold concerns, Maryland officials hired contractors, cleaned and replaced furniture and installed \u201ccommercial-grade dehumidifiers\u201d in hallways. Students were temporarily relocated, a decision the university said it made \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nA university spokeswoman on Wednesday said the Elkton cleanup was completed in mid-October."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Here's something I'd be thankful for: Ridding football of racial slurs - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Here's something I'd be thankful for: Ridding football of racial slurs Washington Post Thanksgiving, as most Americans know, is the day we commemorate the bountiful harvests that brought together the newly arrived Pilgrims and members of the W\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/heres-something-id-be-thankful-for-ridding-football-of-racial-slurs/2018/11/21/455be8da-edc3-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EIwkwnXn24wnrrliUKJOhMksH3I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ERG7CJXF3AI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T23:11:31Z", "content": "Jefferson Keel is president of the National Congress of American Indians.

And how will many Washington-area residents celebrate their holiday? By watching their local professional football team, bearing a slur against Native people as its name, compete \u2014 against the Dallas Cowboys, no less.\n\nFifty years ago, the National Congress of American Indians, a national governing body formed to express Indian Country\u2019s unified will, took a groundbreaking step to foster a better understanding of how disparaging words and symbols dehumanize Native people. Through resolution, it launched a formal campaign to teach the public about how Native-\u201cthemed\u201d names and mascots harm Native people socially, psychologically and academically, and to eradicate those names and mascots from the sports landscape once and for all.\n\nSince then, the NCAI, tribal nations and thousands of partners have succeeded in eliminating more than two-thirds of these mascots from sports at all levels. In January, in a watershed moment, Major League Baseball announced that its Cleveland franchise would retire its grotesque \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d caricature. And this month, students at one of Canada\u2019s most prestigious universities overwhelmingly voted to replace the university\u2019s \u201cRedmen\u201d mascot.\n\nYet the R-word racial slur of the Washington football team remains, an antiquated vestige of a less enlightened past, despite the team\u2019s desperate ploy to make its fans and Americans believe that the name somehow honors Native people.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. There is no honor in this slur, and history proves there never has been. As we have experienced, this slur is about hate, making us feel less than, and diminishing our rightful place as sovereign nations with the ability to control our own lives and futures.\n\nConsider its genocidal origins, epitomized in an 1863 Minnesota newspaper article promoting that state\u2019s policy to exterminate its Native inhabitants: \u201cThe State reward for dead Indians has been increased to 200 dollars for every red-skin sent to Purgatory. This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth.\u201d\n\nWitness its adoption by team owner George Preston Marshall, an avowed racist who fought fervently against integrating African American players. Backed by white supremacists with slogans such as \u201cKeep Redskins White,\u201d Marshall was ultimately forced to add African American players to his team in 1962, seven years after the rest of the league. Upon his death, his will mandated that none of his money be used for \u201cany purpose which supports or employs the principle of racial integration in any form.\u201d\n\nObserve how it has long been used as a weapon of animosity and ridicule. In one of countless stories we have heard from Native people, National Museum of the American Indian director Kevin Gover recalls: \u201cGrowing up in Oklahoma, it was a racist taunt that was deployed against Indian kids like me, and Indian adults for that matter. I don\u2019t feel honored by the word.\u201d\n\nReasonable people open to learning these facts and stories recognize the need, as NAACP President Derrick Johnson put it, to throw this \u201cdictionary-defined racial slur into the dustbin of history, where it belongs.\u201d Reasonable people see the hypocrisy of the Washington team clutching to its mascot when the National Football League wouldn\u2019t dare name a new franchise the \u201cBlackskins,\u201d \u201cYellowskins\u201d or \u201cBrownskins\u201d to denote other peoples of color. Reasonable people understand that to reassociate this slur with Robert F. Kennedy by relocating the team\u2019s home field to the old RFK Stadium site \u2014 next to a new memorial in his name \u2014 would desecrate Kennedy\u2019s legacy of racial justice that placed Native people at its core. Reasonable people get that it\u2019s about making a simple, moral choice to be on the right side of history.\n\nYet current team owner Daniel Snyder feels he shouldn\u2019t have to get it. He believes that his billionaire status and the popularity of the product he peddles absolve him from extending a modicum of respect to tribal nations and peoples. He is betting that through a few, window-dressing donations to tribal communities , coupled with annual exercises in disingenuous pageantry such as this month\u2019s \u201cAmerican Indian Heritage Month\u201d charade at FedEx Field, he can avoid doing what a growing number of Americans understand is the right thing to do.\n\nTribal nations fight against these mascots because they demean us and dismiss the fact we are still here. Despite everything done to us, we have persevered, and more and more we are thriving. We are 6 million people and 600 nations strong, and we are perfectly capable of telling our own stories of who we were and who we are today. We don\u2019t need others to tell the world about who they think we are through offensive mascots that do nothing but dishonor and misrepresent us.\n\nIt is long past time for Snyder and the NFL to be reasonable and do the right thing.

The apparent cease-fire between the U.S.-backed coalition and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels comes as both sides have agreed to attend U.N.-backed peace talks Mattis said would be held in Sweden in \u201cvery, very early December.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, in an extraordinary statement Tuesday, cited potential profit from U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the kingdom\u2019s investments in this country as primary reasons for the United States to move past the Khashoggi controversy.\n\nHe discounted a CIA assessment, reported by The Washington Post last week, that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, saying \u201cmaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMattis did not mention Trump\u2019s statement but said that he did not think that Mohammed\u2019s involvement \u201chas been fully established either by the CIA or the Saudi government.\u201d Trump said the United States \u201cmay never know all the facts surrounding the murder.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a Tuesday interview published by the London-based, Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that the kingdom\u2019s investigation of the killing was continuing but that \u201cthe Saudi leadership, represented by King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed, are a red line, and we will stand against attempts to undermine or harm them.\u201d\n\nMedia reports about the CIA determination, Jubeir said, \u201care leaks that are not based on damning evidence. At any rate, we in the kingdom know that such claims are completely baseless.\u201d The Saudi government has repeatedly denied that Mohammed had knowledge of or involvement in the killing. It said it has charged 11 Saudis \u2014 agents it said were authorized by a lower-level official only to nab Khashoggi and bring him back to the kingdom \u2014 with killing him.\n\nAsked about possible negative repercussions on U.S. arms sales and defense assistance, which bipartisan bills before Congress aim to halt over the Yemen war and the Khashoggi killing, Jubeir said that \u201cwe prefer to be armed by our allies, but Saudi Arabia\u2019s commitment to defend its land and people obligates it to obtain the weapons it needs from any source.\u201d\n\nTrump, in his statement, said that if the United States did not sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, long the world\u2019s largest purchaser of U.S. defense equipment, the Saudis would turn to Russia and China.\n\nJubeir criticized what he called a \u201cmedia campaign and politicization\u201d designed to undermine Saudi Arabia\u2019s standing in the world. He was particularly critical of Turkey, whose government has indirectly accused Mohammed of ordering the killing, which took place during a visit Khashoggi made to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe foreign minister said the kingdom was \u201ckeen on preserving this strategic relationship and historic partnership\u201d with the United States \u201cthat has extended for over seven decades.\u201d\n\nBut statements from Ankara, he said, are \u201ccreating a rift in our ties\u201d with Turkey.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met in Washington on Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, the White House national security adviser. Cavusoglu said evidence his country has amassed \u201cis not pointing to anybody. But we are pretty sure these people didn\u2019t come by themselves and somebody instructed them,\u201d he told reporters, referring to the 15-member team of Saudi agents who both countries agree carried out the killing.\n\nKhashoggi, who moved to Virginia last year out of what he said was fear for his safety in Saudi Arabia, was a contributing columnist for The Post whose columns were often critical of Mohammed.

Only her father, Otto Frank, survived.\n\n\u201cOf course we did not change the hiding place itself \u2014 the annex \u2014 which is the most authentic place where Anne Frank was in hiding and where she wrote the diary,\u201d Leopold said.\n\nIn a major overhaul spanning two years, the museum got a new entrance and changes to rooms including the darkened space that displays the iconic books that made up Anne\u2019s diary.\n\nThe museum also has revamped the way it tells the story of the Frank family, and by extension the Nazi persecution of Jews.\n\n\u201cWhat we tried to do is ... use the family history as kind of a window onto a larger history,\u201d said Tom Brink, the museum\u2019s head of publications and presentations.\n\nThat larger history includes the Nazi-occupied Dutch capital during the war \u201cand, of course, European history because all Europe was affected by the Nazi rule,\u201d Brink said.\n\nAs well as the physical changes, the museum now has an audio tour which pieces together fragments from the diary, family stories and historical perspective. That allowed curators to keep physical exhibits sparse while still explaining the Franks\u2019 story and putting it in historical context.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to preserve the character of the house, which is very much its emptiness,\u201d said Leopold. \u201cI think its emptiness is probably the most powerful feature of the Anne Frank House.\u201d\n\nFor example, a room that served as the office for Anne\u2019s father\u2019s company used to contain office furnishings. Now it is virtually empty with just a few photos on the wall. One shows a group of Jewish men in Amsterdam kneeling, their hands on their heads, watched over by a Nazi soldier carrying a rifle.\n\nOn another wall is a map drawn up by Amsterdam civil servants for the city\u2019s Nazi occupiers with black dots representing the places where Jews lived.\n\nThe museum remained open throughout the renovations. Dutch King Willem-Alexander will formally open the refurbished landmark on Thursday.\n\nAfter the war, Otto Frank had his daughter\u2019s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into more than 70 languages. The building housing the secret annex was turned into a museum in 1960.\n\nTelling Anne\u2019s story remains relevant more than 60 years after Anne and her sister both perished in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp after contracting typhus.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the head of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, warned at a conference in Vienna that \u201cJewish communities in Europe are increasingly concerned about their security and pessimistic about their future.\u201d\n\nLeopold said the museum, which receives 1.2 million visitors annually, has an important role to play in combatting anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cWe run a museum and we know how powerful the influence of this museum is,\u201d he said. \u201cA visit ... really has a huge impact on young people and encourages them to fight discrimination, anti-Semitism, racism in their own communities.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

See the video above for a sampling compiled by the Fix.\n\n\u201cThis is about America first. They\u2019re paying us $400 billion-plus to purchase and invest in our country,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cIt means hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of investment and product . . . it\u2019s about Make America Great Again, it\u2019s about America first.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to distort the facts for his own political ends was perhaps not as surprising as his willingness to distort them to give Saudi\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cover.\n\nThe $400 billion Trump cited Tuesday is significantly higher than publicly available estimates, includes deals not yet completed and includes investments announced before Trump had even won the presidency. Last month, The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker found only $28 billion of the claimed $110 billion in deals were signed, all under the Obama administration, and the AP reported Tuesday that the Pentagon had only confirmed $14.5 billion in orders, but even those are not official yet.\n\nThe \u201chundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d Trump cited Tuesday is significantly higher than the 40,000 Trump announced last March or the potential support for \u201ctens of thousands of new jobs\u201d the White House outlined last May.\n\nThe list goes on, but it is far from the first time Trump has continuously exaggerated his own administration\u2019s official numbers.\n\nTo hear Trump tell it, the number of new manufacturing jobs could be 600,000 (it is less than that).\n\nThe number of new steel mills could be six. Or seven. Or eight. (U.S. Steel is restarting two mills).\n\nCarrier was supposed to bring back 1,100 jobs. Then it was 800.\n\nAnd a southern border wall was only supposed to cost $4 billion. Then it was $10 billion. Now Trump wants taxpayers to dole out $25 billion. We don\u2019t really have a good estimate of what it would actually cost.\n\nFor a president who routinely doubted the official unemployment rate on the campaign trail (\u201cIt could be as high as 42 percent,\u201d Trump said in September 2015) before touting the same unemployment rate in office, his willingness to stretch the truth for his own gain is nothing new. But his willingness to stretch the truth in defense of blatant human rights abuses may be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d Trump said of Khashoggi\u2019s murder Tuesday. \u201cBut it\u2019s \u2014 it is what it is.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Manny Machado tries to explain his controversial 'Johnny Hustle' remark - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Manny Machado tries to explain his controversial 'Johnny Hustle' remark Washington Post No, he's not \u201cJohnny Hustle.\" He's Manny Machado, the free agent shortstop in line to sign one of the wealthiest contracts in Major League history this off\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/21/manny-machado-tries-explain-his-controversial-johnny-hustle-remark/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gt6Ox5z5Hh7hIpNaZG-ubgPCW3k=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AMXNF4W3CYI6RC5MX7QB7TODUY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:59:28Z", "content": "No, hes not Johnny Hustle.\" Hes Manny Machado, the free agent shortstop in line to sign one of the wealthiest contracts in Major League history this offseason.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at an election watch party in Boston on Nov. 6. (Michael Dwyer/AP)\n\nIf you live outside of Iowa or New Hampshire, you may have missed the news that likely 2020 candidates are already making the rounds, political raccoons sniffing at doors and pawing at food containers looking for a nibble. It\u2019s part of the process, of course, this prodding, and some subsection of the people whose trips to Manchester and Dubuque spur raised eyebrows from political reporters won\u2019t ever end up throwing a hat in the ring.\n\nBut most will. And for the pizza shops and diners and car rental agencies and hotels and gas stations of those early-to-vote states, that means a slow trickle of cash that will soon become a deluge.\n\nHow much of a deluge? It\u2019s hard to say. The money that\u2019s being spent now isn\u2019t being spent by a political campaign, because, in most cases, a political campaign for the presidency doesn\u2019t yet exist. But as the primaries approach, it seemed to us, the scale of that spending should be detectable by looking at where and when money gets spent.\n\nSo we pulled data from the Federal Election Commission for the past 13 years, breaking down every campaign expense filed with the commission by state and month. Because some states have much larger populations than others, we compared the spending in each state to the state\u2019s population.\n\nThe results looked like this.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThanks, D.C., for breaking the curve.\n\nThanks to the plethora of lawyers and campaign organizations centered in our nation\u2019s capital and its relatively low population, the District of Columbia is consistently the place where the most federal political spending per person occurs. So let\u2019s take that out of the mix.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nYou\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve identified each election since 2006 as either a midterm or a presidential election (associated with November of the year) and identified the primaries by labeling the January of the presidential-election year.\n\nA few states stand out. Massachusetts, for one, and D.C.-adjacent Virginia, for another. There are other isolated spikes, such as Connecticut and Montana (thanks to last year\u2019s special election). But note that purple line: New Hampshire. In 2008, 2012 and 2016, it rises above the pack. Iowa, the black line, doesn\u2019t as noticeably.\n\nIf we separate the regular early-voting states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 we can see that in the run-up to the primaries, these states see more spending per capita than the rest of the country, on average.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThis is still per capita, though, which doesn\u2019t tell us much about real dollars. For example, Texas saw tens of millions in spending this year, thanks to the Senate contest in that state \u2014 but because the state is so big, it barely registers on the graphs above.\n\nTo determine how much Iowa and New Hampshire (in particular) get from the primaries, let\u2019s compare how much money is spent in each state during the primary season with how much is spent overall.\n\nWhen we do that, the distribution looks like this.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIn other words, while less than a fifth of the total political spending in most states happens in the year spanning April of the year before the campaign through March of the presidential year, the figure is more than a third in Iowa. In New Hampshire, slightly less.\n\nSo how much less money would Iowa and New Hampshire see if primary-season spending in those states was an equivalent percentage as in the rest of the country?\n\nState Primary spending Total spending Adjusted primary Difference Iowa $62 million $180 million $32 million (18% of total) -$29 million New Hampshire $57 million $205 million $37 million (18% of total) -$20 million\n\nThis is a rough calculation, excluding spending that isn\u2019t reported in all states, including those early-voting states. But if primary-season spending in Iowa and New Hampshire was the same percentage of total spending as in other states, it would mean those states saw nearly $50 million less than they did from 2005 to 2018.\n\nOr, to go back to our other metric: $9 less per capita in Iowa and $15 less per capita in New Hampshire.\n\nNo wonder they fight so hard to go first.\n\nUpdate: Although, after this piece published, a Twitter user noted that much of the spending is on television ads -- money which often flows through local stations back to corporate parents. It\u2019s certainly true that, no matter what state goes first, giant conglomerates will keep doing OK."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "6 killed in Haiti after police say govt car loses control", "description": "A Haitian government car has gone out of control into a group of people, killing at least six and further inflaming unrest in a capital wracked by violent protests", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/6-killed-in-haiti-after-police-say-govt-car-loses-control/2018/11/21/f0adacd0-edd4-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:32:27Z", "content": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti A Haitian government car went out of control into a group of people on Wednesday, killing at least six and further inflaming unrest in a capital wracked by violent protests.

Temperatures ultimately fall to morning lows ranging across the 20s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thanksgiving): It\u2019s a frozen and gusty start to the day. The good news is sun dominates and wind wanes. Neither does much to help us stay warm. High temperatures are mainly in a near-30 to mid-30s zone.

The site has been dogged in its coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte since his inauguration in 2016, drawing particular attention to the deadly drug war encouraged by Duterte that has left thousands dead. In September, as Rappler reported, Duterte even apparently confessed to the \u201csin\u201d of \u201cextrajudicial killings.\u201d\n\nRappler\u2019s coverage has prompted Duterte\u2019s government to target the media organization. Labeling Rappler \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 Duterte has been called the Philippines' Donald Trump \u2014 he banned the organization from covering the presidential palace, and the government has accused the site of evading taxes.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Ressa spoke at a dinner hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit organization that works to protect press freedom and to defend journalists targeted by governments and other hostile groups. Her speech centered on Rappler\u2019s contentious relationship with the Philippine government but offered a multipart call to action identifying ways in which her situation mirrored the erosion of press freedom in the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is an existential moment for global power structures, turned upside down by technology,\u201d her speech began. \u201cWhen journalists globally are under attack. When power structures are shifting. Our problems are partly caused by yours: American social media technology platforms, once empowering, now weaponized against journalists, activists and citizens, spreading lies across borders; and, a president so much like ours whose attacks against the press (and women) give permission to autocrats (like ours) to unleash the dark side of humanity and extend their already vast powers with impunity, especially in countries where institutions have crumbled.\u201d\n\n\n\nA guard opens a door at the office of Rappler in Pasig, Philippines, on Jan. 15. (Dondi Tawatao/Reuters)\n\nFour of Ressa\u2019s six points of advice have resonance beyond the community of journalists to whom she was speaking.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stay quiet when you are attacked. The exponential lies on social media, coupled with the president\u2019s words, manufacture truth. Silence is consent.\u201d The president to whom she was referring was Duterte, but there\u2019s an obvious parallel to the behavior of President Trump. The link between misinformation spread on social media and misinformation offered by elected officials was a constant theme, and Ressa\u2019s lesson was explicit: Challenge it whenever it\u2019s encountered.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue reporting without fear or favor. And \u2014 you heard these words here last year from my former colleague Christiane Amanpour: \u2018We need to be truthful, not neutral.\u2019 \u201d For those not intimately familiar with internal journalism debates, Ressa is advocating a particular and increasingly popular position. It is the job of reporters to present accurate facts about the world, but there can be a tendency to want to demonstrate objectivity by coupling criticism of one political perspective with criticism of the opposing view.\n\nThat\u2019s a zero-sum approach to objectivity, based on the assumption that there are always fair ways to even the scales of objectivity. Her point is that it isn\u2019t always possible to demonstrate equal critiques to both sides of an argument and that, instead of being determinedly equal in critique, the objectivity should derive from thorough accuracy.\n\nIn another context, it\u2019s the difference between arguing that there are \u201cgood people on both sides\u201d and saying that those advocating racist viewpoints are bad. The media broadly accepts that criticism of racist or white-nationalist views don\u2019t need to be counterbalanced with David Duke\u2019s point of view, but it has, at times, been wary of extending that same sense of accuracy to other issues.\n\n\u201cWe need to build global alliances because information is the currency of power, manipulated by global players. You have the Mueller investigation here: Well, if Russia is doing B to C; China is doing B to B.\u201d The analogy she draws here is interesting.\n\nThere are several types of business that exist, including those that market directly to customers \u2014 B to C, or business to customer \u2014 and those that market to other companies \u2014 B to B. (Think of a firm that consults with businesses about their human resources processes, for example.)\n\nHer point is that while Russia tried to influence U.S. politics by targeting American voters and seeking to divide Americans directly, China is exporting the digital tools it uses for repression to other countries. She pointed to a report from Freedom House that isolated China\u2019s role in this regard.\n\nFrom that report:\n\n\u201cChina was once again the worst abuser of internet freedom in 2018, and over the past year, its government hosted media officials from dozens of countries for two- and three-week seminars on its sprawling system of censorship and surveillance. Moreover, its companies have supplied telecommunications hardware, advanced facial-recognition technology, and data-analytics tools to a variety of governments with poor human rights records, which could benefit Chinese intelligence services as well as repressive local authorities.\u201d\n\nRessa\u2019s response? A partnership among countries that can act more directly as a bulwark against the spread of anti-freedom tools.\n\n\u201cWe need to hold tech platforms to account. They need to move away from just business growth \u2014 they are now the world\u2019s largest distributor of news so they have to take on the responsibilities journalists had as gatekeepers. They cannot allow lies to spread. They need to protect the public interest \u2014 and the public sphere where democracy happens.\u201d Much of Ressa\u2019s commentary centered on Facebook. At one point in her speech, Ressa described the company as \u201cessentially our Internet,\u201d given the social media giant\u2019s centrality as an information-sharing system in the country.\n\nHere, she centers on another current debate: how and when Facebook should monitor and censor untrue information on its platform. Her argument isn\u2019t centered on Facebook\u2019s scale, necessarily, but instead on its ubiquity, particularly in countries such as the Philippines. The United States regulates systems of information distribution like the television airwaves and radio in a way that it doesn\u2019t Facebook. There are practical reasons for that, including, again, the scale at which Facebook operates.\n\nBut she offers a very pointed critique: Facebook is prioritizing its business model over the global role that it fought so hard to achieve. It\u2019s an echo of a recent report in the New York Times that outlined a similar case against the company \u2014 including allegations that the company had \u201cemployed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros\u201d and \u201ctapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nThis is not a simple problem to address from a technical standpoint. Her point was that eradicating falsehoods should be seen as a preeminent focus of the company, not simply as something that is eroding profit margins.\n\nThe undercurrent of Ressa\u2019s speech was that she was speaking to the United States from a bit farther down a path which both the Philippines and the United States were walking. Hence the first point of advice she offered.\n\n\u201cThe time to fight for journalism, for our Constitution,\u201d she said, \u201cis now.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "2 sons of former Panama president detained in US", "description": "Panama's chief prosecutor says two sons of former President Ricardo Martinelli have been detained in the United States", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/2-sons-of-former-panama-president-detained-in-us/2018/11/21/d32f390c-edcb-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:27:12Z", "content": "PANAMA CITY Panamas chief prosecutor says two sons of former President Ricardo Martinelli have been detained in the United States.

(Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg News)\n\nFormer president Barack Obama on Tuesday pushed back against the notion that Democrats need to elect a candidate of a certain race or gender to beat President Trump in 2020, as some in the party have argued.\n\nObama weighed in on the choice Democrats face in a wide-ranging podcast interview with his former top strategist David Axelrod at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. Axelrod is a CNN commentator and the institute\u2019s director.\n\nAsked about those who say the party would make a mistake in selecting another woman or candidate of color as its presidential nominee, Obama responded, \u201cThat kind of stuff, I don\u2019t buy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect to going forward, the idea that there\u2019s some demographic or profile of a particular candidate that is the optimal one or the ideal one, that\u2019s just not how I\u2019ve seen politics work,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI think people respond to candidates who speak to the moment in some fashion.\u201d\n\nNeither Obama nor Axelrod mentioned any names, but several potential White House contenders have recently weighed in with their thoughts on the ideal profile for a Democratic candidate \u2014 in one case, even before the 2018 midterm elections had concluded.\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti said in an interview with Time magazine last month that he believes a white man would have the best chance at winning.\n\n\u201cI think it better be a white male,\u201d said Avenatti, who is openly mulling a White House bid. \u201cWhen you have a white male making the arguments, they carry more weight. . . . Should they carry more weight? Absolutely not. But do they? Yes.\u201d\n\nCritics swiftly denounced the comments as perpetuating racist and sexist stereotypes. Avenatti defended himself in a tweet in which he said he has \u201cconsistently called on white males like me to step, take responsibility, and be a part of stopping the sexism and bigotry that other white males engage in.\u201d\n\nAnother potential contender, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), also came under fire after an interview this month with the Daily Beast in which he said that there are \u201ca lot of white folks out there\u201d in Florida and Georgia \u201cwho are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African American.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think next time around, by the way, it will be a lot easier for them to do that,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) in Florida and former state House minority leader Stacey Abrams (D) in Georgia narrowly lost their gubernatorial bids this month. If elected, Gillum and Abrams would have become the first black governors of their respective states. A Sanders spokesman later clarified in a statement to NPR that the senator was speaking about racist attacks made against both candidates.\n\nAndra Gillespie, a political-science professor at Emory University, recently told The Washington Post that Abrams\u2019s strong showing in Georgia should silence the faction of Democrats and progressives who were \u201cworried about whites not voting for a black candidate.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the 2020 field is playing out against the backdrop of a newly elected Congress in which women and nonwhite lawmakers will constitute a majority of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s \u201cAxe Files\u201d interview with Axelrod, Obama cited his 2008 victory as well as Trump\u2019s in 2016 as examples of how generalizations about the chances of certain candidates proved wrong.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how all these various factors are going to converge until you try,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did, however, contrast his view of the nation with what he described as that of the current president.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s unique about America is our aspirations to be a large, successful, multiracial, multicultural, multiethnic, multi-religious, pluralistic democracy,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s President Trump\u2019s vision?\u201d Axelrod asked.\n\nObama responded without hesi\u00adta\u00adtion.\n\n\u201cNo. Obviously not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have contrasting visions about what America is.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nElizabeth Spiers is the chief executive of the Insurrection , a progressive digital messaging firm.\n\nIvanka Trump arrived Tuesday at the annual White House turkey pardon with her three children in tow as musicians played Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWhat a Wonderful World\u201d \u2014 a song about unity that would be perfectly appropriate for a Thanksgiving celebration designed to align everyone around the notion that not all turkeys deserve to die for the benefit of American gastronomes.\n\nBut much like the selected turkeys, Trump was playing a role. She is a cultural emissary for her father, the president, but she also often appears as his formal proxy in her role as a senior White House adviser.\n\nSo it was all the more remarkable that she has spent this week pleading ignorance for her failure to use proper channels for secure email communications. Her father, after all, spent most of 2016 talking about someone else\u2019s emails. Once ensconced in the White House, thanks in part to Hillary Clinton\u2019s own electronic correspondence habits, the first-daughter-slash-senior-adviser proceeded to send hundreds of emails via private channels in 2017, a good year after the American public was subjected to more literal words in mainstream newspapers about Clinton\u2019s emails than all of Trump\u2019s scandals combined, according to researchers at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center.\n\nTrump claims she didn\u2019t know that her use of a private email account for government business was improper. For that claim to be credible, Trump would have to argue that she somehow missed all the news about the 2016 campaign or that she was too oblivious to understand the implications of it. So the simplest explanation is that she thinks the rules that applied to Clinton don\u2019t apply to her.\n\n[Ivanka Trump wants power with no accountability]\n\nTo be fair, this is no surprise. Research suggests that ultrarich people genuinely believe that the rules don\u2019t apply to them, and the rich tend to break rules and violate norms more frequently as a result. They have reduced levels of empathy, because they\u2019re not accustomed to having to depend on others to lead fruitful, prosperous lives. They have very little understanding of the value of things like sacrifice for the greater good or, well \u2026 public service for its own sake.\n\nPresident Trump appears to believe the rules don\u2019t apply to him, either \u2014 or else he would have, as every other president in the past four decades has done, put his assets into a blind trust upon taking office and released his tax returns. He also reportedly uses unsecured phones despite warnings that Russia and China are probably listening in.\n\nAnd like her father\u2019s, Ivanka Trump\u2019s own violations of norms and laws extend well beyond communications security. For instance, Ivanka has, reportedly, personally pocketed $3.9 million in profits from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the foreign proceeds of which are supposed to be remitted to the U.S. Treasury. And this is a violation for which we can publicly account: We have no idea how much money she is or isn\u2019t making overall. The entire Trump family is accustomed to operating from behind a protective wall of lawyers, PR people and secretive LLCs that mask the origins of their financing and the manner in which they choose to conduct business. No wonder email rules don\u2019t seem to apply to her: Actively avoiding transparency might not be the norm for the Oval Office, but it is for commercial real estate and for the Trump family.\n\nThis particular angle could well be the entire game for her. The outcomes of her tenure in the White House are very measurable in terms of accrual of money and power to Ivanka Trump. They are less apparent if we evaluate her in her role as senior White House adviser and public servant. What has she done for Americans that justifies paying for the travel, office, resources and access that she enjoys solely as a result of occupying a job for which she has no obvious qualifications beyond being the president\u2019s daughter?\n\nThe answer is nothing, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because she didn\u2019t take the job seriously in the first place. It has never been her primary mandate. Her official travels have been built around her business objectives and self-aggrandizing projects that allow her to network with people she couldn\u2019t access before her father became president. A state dinner with the president of China comes in handy when you\u2019re waiting on trademark approvals and your company manufactures clothing there, despite your public cheerleading of American workers and American-made products. And it\u2019s fine to give sunny speeches about women\u2019s empowerment in Saudi Arabia, one of the most repressive regimes in the world, if you have Saudi business partners who\u2019ve just handed you $100 million for an investment fund.\n\n[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump\u2019s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]\n\nThe reality is that Ivanka claims to care about working women but has done nothing to stop or even mitigate her father\u2019s administration\u2019s policies that harm them.

Numerous human rights violations have been blamed on the military for actions conducted in the name of security.\n\nLopez Obrador has been among those calling for demilitarization, but said he had not fully realized how hopelessly corrupt civilian law enforcement agencies were.\n\nHe also defended the armed forces, saying that the military\u2019s infamous human rights violations were \u201con the orders received from civilian authorities\u201d and that its leaders had good backgrounds.\n\nLopez Obrador said he had looked at nearly three dozen active generals and found that some were the sons of farmworkers and mechanics. \u201cThe chiefs of the armed forces are not part of the oligarchy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe populist said he decided to create a national guard because he didn\u2019t see relying on the police alone as an option.\n\nA national guard would include military police and some federal police.\n\nA separate referendum is already scheduled for this weekend.

Cindy Hyde-Smith (R), who was appointed earlier this year and is running for election against Democrat Mike Espy, threatens that perception. To critics, seeing one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians making such racist comments seems to confirm the worst stereotypes about Mississippi.\n\nEspy, who served in the Clinton administration as the nation\u2019s first black agriculture secretary, is by all accounts an underdog in the typically bright-red state. The question of whether the South was ready to put a black person in such a high statewide position was a major topic in the midterm elections, as nearby Southern states Florida and Georgia almost sent black candidates to their governor\u2019s mansions.\n\n\"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row\"- Sen.

She also attracted attention after a photo went viral of her dressed in the paraphernalia of the Confederate soldiers who fought to keep black people enslaved.\n\nAt a Tuesday debate between the candidates, Espy said Hyde-Smith\u2019s words damaged the reputation of a state that has worked hard to put its racist past behind it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given our state another black eye that we don\u2019t need,\u201d Espy said. \u201cIt\u2019s just rejuvenated old stereotypes, you know, that we don\u2019t need anymore. And we have companies like Walmart that wrote you today and told you that your comments did not reflect the values of their company.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith apologized for her comments at the debate but blamed her opponents for misinterpreting them. She said: \u201cThis comment was twisted, was turned into a weapon to be used against me, a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That\u2019s the type of politics that Mississippians are sick and tired of.\u201d\n\n[Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith apologizes to anyone \u2018offended\u2019 by comments about public hanging]\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump points out, Hyde-Smith\u2019s words and the photos uncovered Tuesday of her displaying Confederate memorabilia may not harm her electoral chances at all.\n\nBut some residents eager to shed the perception that Mississippi is not a welcoming place for black voters \u2014 the state has the highest percentage of black Americans in the United States \u2014 find nothing in Hyde-Smith\u2019s words suggesting that she has the same goals.\n\nJayda Fountain, a business owner in Terry, Miss., doubts that Hyde-Smith can adequately represent the state\u2019s black residents. She said: \u201cCongress is meant to be a representation of the people. If Cindy Hyde-Smith goes back to that Senate seat, I guess we should all just buy nooses because that is how she wants us to be represented. Voter suppression is real, her comments are real as far as her feelings are concerned, and racism is still real.\u201d\n\nAnd Dixie Moody, a teacher in Hattiesburg, Miss., said Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments further harmful views of a state that doesn\u2019t often get positive news coverage.\n\n\u201cI do see her comments as a negative reflection of who Mississippians are. We are already viewed as a racist state, and her comments further perpetuate that image,\u201d Moody said.\n\nPresident Trump defended Hyde-Smith, claiming that her statement was said in \u201cjest\u201d and calling it a \u201cshame\u201d that Hyde-Smith was being criticized over the hanging comment. And Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R), who is supporting the senator, attempted to pivot the conversation away from lynchings to abortions in the black community.\n\n\u201cSee, in my heart, I am confused about where the outrage is at about 20 million African American children that have been aborted. No one wants to say anything about that. No one wants to talk about that,\u201d he said at a news conference last week, according to the Jackson Free Press.\n\nJemar Tisby, a history doctoral candidate at the University of Mississippi, told The Fix that residents he has spoken with view Hyde-Smith\u2019s actions as an embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step backwards and demonstrates the ongoing racial obstinacy of the Mississippi and national GOP,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press Election Day voter survey, nearly 6 in 10 \u2014 57 percent \u2014 white voters supported Hyde-Smith. Only about 1 in 5 \u2014 21 percent \u2014 backed Espy. The overwhelming majority \u2014 83 percent \u2014 of black voters supported Espy. But as The Washington Post\u2019s Matt Viser reported, black voters make up only 38 percent of the population in Mississippi.\n\nTisby said electing Hyde-Smith could send a signal that would imperil the state\u2019s ability to attract talent and businesses that could stimulate the economy \u2014 which could cause real harm to Mississippi, one of the country\u2019s poorest states.\n\n\u201cMississippi will remain the \u2018closed society,\u2019 young people will continue to migrate away from the state, and citizens will miss yet another opportunity to decisively break from a racist past and present to chart a new path toward a racially inclusive future,\u201d he said.\n\nMississippi residents often find themselves at the top of lists about poor education, health problems and other rankings that don\u2019t encourage people to view the state positively. In this highly watched race \u2014 no longer competing for attention with other contests \u2014 there is a real question about which vision will attract the majority of the state\u2019s voters."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "With your time off this weekend, we\u2019re going to need 163 million of you to rake some forests", "description": "Four days is enough to clear the nation's forests -- with some key caveats.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/21/with-your-time-off-this-weekend-were-going-need-million-you-rake-some-forests/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VZXbVGCcblclk6UKi4EiDOuJ_l8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HZPKC6HK7MI6RL7R53BJW34SZI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:45:20Z", "content": "Standing in the smoky ruins of the town of Paradise, Calif., last weekend, President Trump suggested that the cause of the fire lay, to some degree, in the forests surrounding the town being improperly maintained.

And when it is, it\u2019s a very small problem. So, I know everybody\u2019s looking at that to that end.\u201d\n\nThe president of Finland later told the Associated Press that his conversation with Trump hadn\u2019t included any description of raking out the forests, but by that point the damage was done. Trump\u2019s comment became an international meme, with Finns posted photos of themselves holding rakes in what could only be described as patriotic poses.\n\nAt the heart of the comment, though, is a valid point: Underbrush in forests can dry out and help wildfires spread. If Finland (or America) really put our backs into it, what would it take to clear out our forests and reduce the ability of fires to spread?\n\nTo determine the answer to that question, we must first answer three others.\n\nHow much forested area is there in the country?\n\nHow long does it take to clear underbrush?\n\nHow many people are available to help?\n\nLet\u2019s go in order.\n\nHow much forested area is there in the country?\n\nWe can start with Finland.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTo President Sauli Niinisto\u2019s point, much of Finland is indeed covered with forest. The World Bank estimates that there are about 55 million acres of forest in the country.\n\nThe United States\u2019 national forests cover much more territory. In total, there are more than 188 million acres of national forest in the country, mostly west of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Forest Service estimates that, nationally, there are 746 million acres of forest in the country.\n\nIf Finland looks a lot more forest-y than the United States in our maps, there are two reasons. The first is that the map of the United States shows only national forests. The second is that the maps use different scales. Here\u2019s Finland roughly scaled to the size of the United States.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nFor every acre of forest in Finland, then, there are about 13 in the United States.\n\nHow long does it take to clear underbrush?\n\nTo answer this, we turned to an expert: Erwin Milbourne, owner of the Virginia-based landscaping company the Turf Surgeon.\n\nWe first asked Milbourne how long it would take to clear out underbrush from an acre of forest. He suggested that the easiest way to do it would be to use a forestry cutter, a device that attaches to a small vehicle and can be driven through an area to remove brush and debris. The device \u201cchews it up like a blender,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA forestry cutter on a Bobcat. (Erwin Milbourne/The Turf Surgeon)\n\nWith one of those, you can clear an acre in about four hours, he said.\n\nThere\u2019s just one drawback: The combination of the cutter and the vehicle to push it around costs about $150,000 by Milbourne\u2019s estimate. What we\u2019re assuming here isn\u2019t that we have a ton of money but, instead a ton of manpower. So, we asked, how long would it take people without a forestry cutter to clear an acre?\n\n\"Are you kidding?\u201d Milbourne replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d\n\nWe made him think about it.\n\nIt would be a \u201cnightmare,\u201d he said, but using hand tools, a crew of four people could do it in three or four days.\n\nIf the government decided to invest in forestry cutters, the mulch that\u2019s left behind would need to be bagged and removed. Milbourne said that clearing an acre of leaves would take two or three people about four to six hours on average.\n\nBringing us to our next question.\n\nHow many people are available to help?\n\nThe population of Finland is about 5.5 million. That of the United States is about 326 million.\n\nBut those aren\u2019t really helpful numbers. My son Thomas is a U.S. resident, but, at about 2 years old, I would prefer he not drive a mobile blender through the forest. So let\u2019s instead consider a metric that\u2019s designed to establish how many people in a country can work: The size of the labor force.\n\nIn Finland, according to the World Bank, there are about 2.6 million people in the labor force. In the United States, it\u2019s about 163 million.\n\nAdding it all up\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that we need to clear out the underbrush only once a year. Here\u2019s how the math breaks down.\n\nUsing a forestry cutter. If we have an army of forestry cutters, the work breaks down into two parts. The first pass is running the cutter through the acre of forest; the second is picking up the debris that remains.\n\nIf we assume that everyone is working 12-hour days until the work is complete, it would take about seven days for the working population of Finland to drive their forestry cutters through the nation\u2019s forests. This could be staggered, meaning that the country wouldn\u2019t need to buy the requisite 18 million cutter/Bobcat combinations, saving some portion of the $2.7 trillion that would require. (About \u20ac2.4 trillion, for our Finnish readers.)\n\nThe next part of the job is the cleanup. Depending on how long clearing an acre takes \u2014 four hours or six \u2014 it would require every Finn to spent 14 to 20 days raking and bagging the debris that\u2019s left behind.\n\nFor the United States, the numbers would be different. We\u2019d need 249 million forestry cutters to run a sweep of every acre of forest (price tag: $37.3 trillion), assuming each is used for one day. But we have a lot more people to get it done. That job would take the entire labor force about a day and a half, and the subsequent raking/clearing would take another three to five days.\n\nDoing it by hand. Milbourne\u2019s nightmare scenario is just that.\n\nLet\u2019s define a unit called the man-day, which is one person working for one day on clearing an acre. In the United States, clearing every acre by hand \u2014 raking it, if you will \u2014 would require about 9 billion man-days (total acreage times four people working for three days). In Finland, the number is smaller: 659 million man-days.\n\nBut, again, the United States has more men to work those days. It would take the U.S. labor force 55 12-hour days to clear our forests. The unlucky Finns would need to devote 245 days of the year, which would certainly be fun in the winter.\n\nThe logistics problem\n\nWe\u2019re skipping over a lot of problems here. For example, most Americans live in cities, not in the forest. There would be a massive logistical operation to coordinate sending people to the proper forests on the proper days, involving massive caravans of trucks or trains shunting people around the country for their allotted days of service. Some portion of the workforce, of course, would end up working in the newly massive forestry-cutter-manufacturing-and-repair sector. The Bobcat corporation would likely soon have a market cap equivalent to the entire Nasdaq.\n\nBut the biggest question is what happens to the debris that\u2019s collected. Milbourne told me that clearing an acre of leaves and debris could fill anywhere from 15 to 75 bags. (The time of filling them is incorporated above.) If we\u2019re talking about lawn and garden bags like these from Rite-Aid, that\u2019s an additional cost in Finland of between $494 million and $2.5 billion. In the United States, it\u2019s between $6.7 billion and $33.6 billion. Bag manufacturing would be another new, massive cottage industry.\n\nWhere does it go? Uh, good question. The amount of debris collected in Finland would fill between 3.2 billion and 16 billion cubic feet. That latter figure is an amount equivalent to the entire volume of Sydney Harbor.\n\nIn the United States, those bags of debris would take up between 43.5 billion and 218 billion square feet.

Pictures)\n\nRocky Balboa has long been canonized in popular culture as the physical embodiment of Philadelphia, a city known for blue-collar underdogs with chips on their shoulders. The \u201cCreed\u201d spinoffs bestowed Philly\u2019s underdog crown upon a new name: Adonis Creed (nee Johnson), played by Michael B. Jordan \u2014 the illegitimate son of Rocky\u2019s late foe turned friend, Apollo Creed, and an adopted son of the city.\n\nIn \u201cCreed II,\u201d released Wednesday, Adonis returns to his hometown of Los Angeles and trains to fight the hulking Viktor Drago, the son of his father\u2019s killer, Ivan Drago, in Moscow. The movie maintains the connection to Philly\u2019s against-the-odds determination, but it comes at a time when the context has changed.\n\nThe typical perception of Philadelphia is rather distinct. The city\u2019s fan base, known for obnoxiously supporting teams that rarely win championships, is widely regarded as the absolute worst in sports. In the \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cCreed\u201d movies, fans have seen hardship and triumph depicted through adored sports film tropes, all while the actual city\u2019s sports teams failed to find the same continuous success.\n\nNo longer is Philly known for lazy identifiers such as cheesesteaks, volatile fans and \u201cthe Rocky steps.\u201d It\u2019s actually getting recognition for something else: The city finds itself at the forefront of popular culture for winning, not losing.\n\n[\u2018Creed II\u2019 isn\u2019t as great as the original, but it gets the job done]\n\nRapper Meek Mill has become an unlikely avatar for prison reform. The Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 polarizing long game for success yielded the team\u2019s first playoff appearance in six seasons. And \u201cCreed II\u201d was filmed against the backdrop of the Philadelphia Eagles winning Super Bowl LII, their first championship of the NFL\u2019s post-merger era. Such pride hadn\u2019t been felt since the Philadelphia Phillies won the World Series in 2008.\n\n\u201cI was there in the city when it happened,\u201d says \u201cCreed II\u201d director Steven Caple Jr., who arrived in January to prepare for filming. \u201cI was literally on 15th and Sansom, and Broad [Street] was maybe one street over, and it was crazy. I had to check it out, just to catch the energy.\u201d\n\nFor Meek Mill, who titled his 2017 album \u201cWins & Losses,\u201d the start of 2018 almost certainly felt like the latter. He began the year behind bars after being sentenced to two to four years in November 2017 for violating the conditions of his probation. His case, which stemmed from a decade-old conviction for gun and drug charges, drew national attention, including criticism of how black men and women are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system.\n\nAlthough fame couldn\u2019t keep Meek Mill out of prison, his profile elevated his case. He was released on bail in April after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner questioned the credibility of the rapper\u2019s arresting officer. Since his release, Meek has become a national advocate for criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cWhen he has done interviews with national TV shows and even news conferences with the governor, he\u2019s mentioned, \u2018Hey, I know I\u2019m lucky, and I\u2019m just an example of what so many others are dealing with,\u201d says Alex Holley, co-host of Fox 29\u2019s \u201cGood Day Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nNow Meek is slated to release his fourth album, the aptly titled \u201cChampionships,\u201d on Nov. 30. And let the Eagles tell it: Meek Mill was a source of inspiration during their championship run. The team adopted his \u201cDreams and Nightmares (Intro)\u201d as their theme song.\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 championship hopes had begun to fade after quarterback Carson Wentz, an MVP candidate, suffered a season-ending knee injury last December. Enter backup Nick Foles, who, against all odds, led the Eagles to the Super Bowl. They defeated the defending champion New England Patriots, snatching the Lombardi Trophy that had eluded them for more than 50 years, and Foles was named Super Bowl MVP.\n\nThe Super Bowl victory marked what seemed like an immediate change of culture for the franchise and the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier, and a lot more fun, for people to associate themselves with the Super Bowl champion,\u201d says Spike Eskin, program director for WIP-FM Philadelphia.\n\n[Why Philadelphia is a perpetual underdog]\n\nThat winning attitude extended to the 76ers. After years of setbacks and being strategically terrible to draft the best available players, the 76ers concluded the 2017-18 season on a 16-game winning streak. They won their first playoff series in six years and, with the addition of four-time all-star Jimmy Butler, are considered a contender in the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference. (Meek Mill was transported directly from prison to the Wells Fargo Center to ring a replica of the Liberty Bell before a playoff game. As with the Eagles, the gesture was criticized for conflating Meek\u2019s release from prison with a sports team\u2019s ambition.)\n\nJust three years ago, the Sixers were the worst team in the NBA. Now they\u2019re among the new faces for success in the league.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cCreed\u201d franchise has given the old \u201cRocky\u201d story a new star (a white, working class hero didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of the city), while still maintaining the narrative\u2019s tropes: In the latest installment, Adonis appears overmatched once again and must come to terms with the circumstances surrounding his father\u2019s death, and the legacy he left behind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to discontinue the underdog story,\u201d Caple, Jr. says. \u201cSo a lot of it tapped into [Adonis\u2019s] vulnerability as a character, his flaws and his growth.\u201d\n\nAnd the reason people gravitate toward that vulnerability is because they enjoy feel-good stories. The tales of Meek Mill, the Eagles and the 76ers and the intertwined stories of Rocky Balboa and Adonis Creed allow the masses to romanticize what it\u2019s like to overcome hardships and win.\n\nAs Gene Demby, a Philadelphia native and the co-host and lead blogger for NPR\u2019s Code Switch podcast and blog, put it: \u201cBeating the odds is a great story, but the odds are also part of the story.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "FANTASY PLAYS: Players to start and sit for NFL Week 12 - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post FANTASY PLAYS: Players to start and sit for NFL Week 12 Washington Post With three games on Thursday, fantasy football players need to get their lineups in place before scarfing on turkey and pie.

Hilton (13) reacts after a touchdown reception during the second half of an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018, in Indianapolis. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press)\n\nWith three games on Thursday, fantasy football players need to get their lineups in place before scarfing on turkey and pie.\n\nThis week looks to have less potential than previous weeks for scoring, with the Falcons-Saints game on Thursday night shaping up to have the most fantasy upside.\n\nPlayoff time in most fantasy leagues is looming, which makes this a make-or-break week for many teams.\n\nSTART: T.Y. Hilton, WR, Colts: Questions about his hamstrings were emphatically put to rest when he torched the Titans with nine receptions for 138 yards and two scores last week. After recording just 15 targets in a three-game span, Hilton has 16 in his last two games and faces a Dolphins pass defense that is 29th in the league in average yards allowed per reception. A dialed-in Andrew Luck (seven straight games with at least three touchdown passes) will have no problem finding his featured pass catcher.\n\nSIT: Deshaun Watson, QB, Texans: Take away his five-TD performance against the Dolphins in Week 8, and Watson has just six touchdown passes in his past five games. That doesn\u2019t bode well against a Titans defense that still ranks fourth in fewest fantasy points allowed per game despite being lit up by the Colts last week. Watson no longer offers the bonus of running the ball, which makes him sideline material for fantasy players this week.\n\nSTART: Duke Johnson Jr., RB, Browns: He\u2019s once again RB2/flex viable in PPR formats after catching all 13 of his targets for 109 yards and three touchdowns in his last two games. Expect the good times to continue for Johnson and his fantasy owners, who get a plum matchup against the Bengals, who are 31st in fantasy points allowed per game to opposing running backs. Cincinnati is also 31st in receiving yards allowed and rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield is improving.\n\nSIT: Alex Collins, RB, Ravens: Collins is too touchdown-dependent to garner much value and has seen his touches decline since getting 19 carries in Week 6, falling to just seven last week against the Bengals. The unexpected rise of Gus Edwards makes an already-crowded Baltimore backfield more cramped, which means Collins will see limited touches against a Raiders defense that is 31st in rushing yards allowed.\n\nSTART: Carson Wentz, QB, Eagles: Don\u2019t be discouraged by Wentz\u2019s poor effort in the loss at the Saints. With the Eagles ranked 25th in rushing and their chances of defending their Super Bowl crown beginning to slip away, expect Wentz to throw at will against a Giants defense that he lit up for three touchdowns in Week 6. There\u2019s little chance of Zach Ertz catching just two passes or Golden Tate being a nonfactor in consecutive weeks, so bank on Wentz rebounding.\n\nSIT: Emmanuel Sanders, WR, Broncos: After consecutive 100-yard games in Weeks 6 and 7, Sanders has flattened to a combined 160 yards in his last three games. He has suffered without having Demaryius Thomas taking coverage away. And with rookie Courtland Sutton starting to see more targets in his direction, Sanders has fallen from a solid WR2 to a borderline flex. Although the Steelers are 28th in receiving yards allowed, Sanders\u2019 recent struggles aren\u2019t encouraging enough to take the gamble.\n\nSTART: Tre\u2019Quan Smith, WR, Saints: The 13 targets he had in the win over the Eagles was the same number he had in his previous three games combined. Smith won\u2019t have to wait long to exploit a vulnerable secondary, as the Falcons defense he\u2019ll see Thanksgiving night is 29th in fantasy points allowed per game to opposing receivers while giving up 21 touchdown passes. He\u2019s a strong flex option who is another good game or two away from being a legit WR2.\n\nSIT: Aaron Jones, RB, Packers: There\u2019s little debate that Jones is now Green Bay\u2019s lead back. However, he has yet to record more than 15 carries in a game this season and his matchup against the Vikings appears to be the splash of cold water that stalls him after scoring four times in the last two games. Minnesota is fourth overall against the run and has allowed only five touchdowns on the ground, meaning Jones will need to deliver as a pass catcher to justify having him in the lineup.\n\nSTART: Jordan Reed, TE, Redskins: His production perked up once Colt McCoy replaced the injured Alex Smith at quarterback, resulting in Reed catching his first touchdown since Week 1. The Cowboys are middle of the pack when it comes to stopping tight ends, although the memory of Ertz pulling in 15 catches for Philadelphia against Dallas two weeks ago should be a good reason why Reed\u2019s fantasy numbers will continue to swing upward.\n\nSIT: Anthony Miller, WR, Bears: With Mitchell Trubisky (shoulder) unlikely to play against the Lions on Thanksgiving, Miller\u2019s run of two straight games with a touchdown catch has a strong chance to end, especially if Chicago focuses its attention toward Detroit\u2019s 22nd-ranked run defense.\n\nSTART: Eli Manning, QB, Giants: The Eagles secondary is in worse shape than when Manning passed for 281 yards against them in the first meeting this season. With Saquon Barkley and Odell Beckham Jr putting up solid numbers of late, Manning should have a field day on a Philly defense that is 27th in fantasy points allowed per game.\n\nSIT: LeSean McCoy, RB, Bills: Don\u2019t count on McCoy putting up 110 yards and two scores against the Jaguars, whose run defense is stouter than the Jets run D that McCoy ripped up in Week 10. Even with a big workload, that\u2019s a matchup fantasy owners should avoid.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 12 lineup advice and tools, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This could, under certain circumstances, mean directing troops to temporarily detain migrants in the event of disorder or violence against border patrol agents. (Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP)/The Monitor via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday the White House has given him explicit authority to use military troops to protect Customs and Border Protection personnel, with lethal force if necessary, at the southwest border.\n\nThis could, under certain circumstances, mean directing troops to temporarily detain migrants in the event of disorder or violence against border patrol agents. \u201cThis is minutes -- not even hours\u201d of potential detention, Mattis said, suggesting that he was not planning to use the military to operate migrant detention camps.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep you posted on any new missions and any new numbers of troops as those decisions are made,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mission thus far for the approximately 5,800 active-duty troops in the border area has been mainly to lay barbed wire and other barriers along the border and to transport border patrol personnel. Mattis has stressed the need to keep the military away from civilian law enforcement roles such as arrests, which are forbidden under the Posse Comitatus Act. The law prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role, except in cases and under circumstances specifically authorized by the Constitution or Congress.\n\nThe basis for the expanded legal authorities for Mattis is a belief by the Trump administration that the caravans of Central American migrants, whose numbers include many families with children, moving toward the U.S. border pose a potential security threat to the border patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited a San Diego Pacific Coast beach to see up close newly installed razor wire wrapped around a towering border wall that cuts across the sand. She said there were as many as 500 criminals and gang member in the groups heading northward, though she refused to answer questions about how they were identified or what crimes they had committed.\n\nMattis emphasized that he would use his expanded authorities only in response to a specific, detailed request from Nielsen, and that none has yet been made.\n\n\u201cI now have the authority to do more. Now we\u2019ll see what she asks me for,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis was adamant that the military will remain within its legal limits.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing law enforcement,\u201d he told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cWe do not have arrest authority.\u201d He noted that National Guard troops under state control are also involved at the border, and he said the governors of those states could give them arrest authority. He said there are about 2,100 National Guard troops involved.\n\nMattis said that as of Wednesday there were 5,764 active-duty troops performing support missions along the border in Texas, Arizona and California. The number changes frequently. Just a day earlier, the Pentagon said in a report to Congress that there about 5,900 troop involved; at other times the Pentagon has put the number at 5,800.\n\nMattis said the instruction he received Tuesday was signed by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly. Asked by a reporter what legal authority Kelly has to issue such an instruction to the Pentagon chief, Mattis replied, \u201cHe has the authority to do what the president tells him to do.\u201d\n\nIt its report to Congress on Tuesday the Pentagon estimated the cost of the mission at $72 million through Dec. 15, when the mission is scheduled to end.

(weatherbell.com)\n\nWeather reminiscent of midwinter is descending on the D.C. area just in time for Thanksgiving Day. High temperatures may stay below freezing in the suburbs \u2014 something that rarely happens on sunny days in January, let alone November.\n\nTo make matters more unpleasant, wind chills are in the teens and low 20s for most of Thanksgiving. To top it all off, actual temperatures are likely to give the coldest Thanksgivings in recent memory a run.\n\nThanksgiving forecast\n\nHere\u2019s the short version: frigid, with slowly diminishing winds. Highs are near 30 to as warm as the mid-30s. Wind chills mainly in the teens through midday ease a bit after that, as gusts diminish with time. Thanksgiving night, temperatures aim for the midteens to low 20s if clouds don\u2019t get in the way.\n\nEarly morning to 10 a.m.\n\nWith sunrise near 7 a.m., the first rays will greet temperatures in the 20s area-wide.\n\n\n\nGFS weather model temperature forecast for 7 a.m. Thanksgiving morning.\n\nThe warmest locations downtown may still be closer to 30 degrees, but it\u2019s a frozen start to the day. Add in winds out of the northwest around 10 to 20 mph \u2014 we\u2019re talking widespread wind chills in the teens as well. Any warming in the morning is painfully slow. Bundle up if you\u2019re headed out. Grab the scarf, as well!\n\n10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nTemperatures have soared to a range of mid-20s to around 30 by midmorning. Add in a still gusty wind, and wind chills are still in the teens to around 20.\n\n\n\nWind chills at 10 a.m. may still be in the teens, although this forecast from the short-term HRRR model may be a bit aggressive.\n\nOn the bright side, skies remain mostly clear during the midday into afternoon. Winds have not yet subsided much on the early end of this time frame, but they should start to noticeably do so as we head through and beyond noon.\n\n1 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nSkies remain mostly sunny throughout the afternoon, and winds diminish somewhat. Temperatures reach the upper 20s and lower 30s early afternoon, and could rise a few degrees more in the hours following.\n\n\n\nHigh temperatures on Thanksgiving as forecast by the NAM weather model. It suggests mainly near and below freezing for maximums.\n\nDaytime highs seem likely to mainly fall in a zone of near 30 to mid-30s, which means plenty of locations won\u2019t top freezing. If anything, a forecast of near 30 to mid-30s might be leaning on the warm side of weather modeling.\n\n4 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nWe\u2019re slowly coming off daytime maximums in the time before sunset, and skies remain mostly clear. Winds are out of the north around 10 mph, with some higher gusts. Our first pre-4:50 p.m. sunset should go off without a hitch. Post-sunset temperatures are quickly back below freezing and into the 20s during the evening.\n\n7 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nSkies stay largely clear into the night, if you\u2019re eager to peep some stars. Just remember to layer!\n\n\n\nLate evening temperatures as forecast by the high resolution NAM model.\n\nMost of the evening is spent in the 20s area-wide, but winds do continue to diminish. Temperatures range across the 20s during the late evening, with some colder suburbs north and west already into the low 20s.\n\n10 p.m. to 7 a.m. Friday\n\nWe may see some cloudiness blow through late night, which is the main forecast question. Temperatures are primed for lows in the midteens to the low 20s. Quite intense for November. If you\u2019re out late or up early, treat this like midwinter despite winds that become relatively light.\n\nHistorical context\n\nAs Capital Weather Gang\u2019s Jason Samenow pointed out earlier this week, if D.C. can manage a high below 40 degrees, it will be the coldest Thanksgiving in five years. Below 38 degrees, the coldest in 18 years. At or below 35 degrees? The coldest since at least 1996.\n\nIf somehow we manage a high temperature colder than that, the only targets are 33 (1903 and 1901) and 30 degrees.\n\nDate High temperature Nov. 27, 1930 30 degrees Nov. 26, 1903 33 degrees Nov. 28, 1901 33 degrees Nov. 28, 1996 35 degrees Nov. 23, 1989 35 degrees\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Justin Grieser also calculated that only about 10 percent of Thanksgivings have seen high temperatures make the 30s, let alone threaten coldest Thanksgiving on record. It seems the question here is not so much whether such a cold Thanksgiving is rare, but how rare it is.\n\nThere\u2019s also a decent chance Dulles will set a record for record low maximum for any Nov. 22 there. The current number to beat is 35 degrees, set back in 1989.\n\nThe rest of the holiday weekend\n\nAs our morning forecast indicates, weekend weather is a bit of a weather sandwich, with sunnier and tolerable conditions Black Friday and Sunday.\n\nCold is the big story Friday, as mid-winterlike morning lows rise to highs in the mid-30s to around 40 despite mainly sunny skies.\n\n\n\nA coastal storm and a frontal system combine to deliver rain Saturday. (Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nSaturday is looking wet.\n\nA storm system is headed our way early Saturday. For now, it mostly looks to be a daytime event, ending in the evening or early overnight. This system is mostly rain, starting with perhaps a brief period of mixed precipitation. There could be a touch of concern for slick spots, mainly west of Interstate 95, so check back in as we close.\n\nThe long holiday weekend ends with skies trending clearer in the wake of Saturday\u2019s storm system. Highs should make the 50s on Sunday."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Felicia Sonmez", "title": "Rebuking Trump\u2019s criticism of \u2018Obama judge,\u2019 Chief Justice Roberts defends judiciary as \u2018independent\u2019", "description": "\u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\u201d Roberts said in an unusual statement Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rebuking-trumps-criticism-of-obama-judge-chief-justice-roberts-defends-judiciary-as-independent/2018/11/21/6383c7b2-edb7-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wzogNvaWUPRdFR93jlpCOYptNsw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SD4SLXXNW4I6RFWUBUR7FKVNBE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:23:39Z", "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday issued an extraordinary statement in response to President Trumps criticism of federal judges, one day after the president blamed an Obama judge for ruling against his administrations ban on asylum for those who cross t\u2026 [+1365 chars]", "fulltext": "The chief justice of the United States and the president of the United States engaged in an extraordinary war of words Wednesday over the independence of the federal judiciary, with Chief Justice John G.

It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \u2018independent judiciary\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nTrump was referring to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers much of the West Coast \u2014 although the ruling he was criticizing came from a district judge in California, not the circuit court. Trump feels aggrieved by decisions of the appeals court, which he tweeted Wednesday has become \u201ca terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace.\u201d\n\nTrump regularly says the 9th Circuit is the one most overruled by the Supreme Court, but that depends on the time period under consideration. Studies show that over the past five years, three others have a higher percentage of decisions overturned.\n\nThe rebuke-and-retort between the heads of two branches of the federal government astounded those who carefully watch the Supreme Court.

Tigar. The Roberts statement did not mention the president by name.\n\nThe chief justice is an aggressive defender of the judiciary and has frequently expressed concern about attacks on its impartiality, whether they come from the left or the right. In 2010, he called the timing of President Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of the court\u2019s decision in Citizens United v. FEC during the president\u2019s State of the Union speech \u201cvery troubling.\u201d\n\nRoberts made it clear last month that he is particularly sensitive about the image of the courts because of the recent partisan battle over the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\n[Roberts says Supreme Court will not serve \u201cone party\u201d]\n\nSupreme Court justices bristle at the suggestion they are not independent, despite Trump\u2019s apparent confidence Tuesday that the setback in lower courts just means \u201cwe end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won.\u201d\n\nAt an event at the University of Minnesota just after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Roberts said the court served \u201cone nation\u201d and not \u201cone party or one interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur role is very clear: We are to interpret the Constitution and laws of the United States, and to ensure that the political branches act within them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat job obviously requires independence from the political branches. The story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s statement from Roberts was the first time the chief justice has responded to criticism from the president, which at times has gotten personal.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump frequently disparaged Roberts, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. Roberts has a solidly conservative voting record in his 13 years on the Supreme Court, but Trump labeled him an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d because of one vote: Roberts\u2019s decision to join liberals in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nIn a tweet after the decision, Trump said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy \u201cshould be proud of \u00adhimself for sticking to his principles, in light of Justice Roberts\u2019 bullshit!\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday had told reporters outside the White House that he had a \u201cmajor complaint\u201d about Tigar\u2019s decision, in which the judge temporarily blocked the administration from denying asylum to migrants who illegally cross the southern border.\n\n[Trump lashes out at judge after order to allow illegal border crossers to seek asylum]\n\nTigar, of the Northern District of California, ruled late Monday that federal law clearly states that migrants can seek asylum anywhere on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\u201d the judge, who was appointed by Obama, wrote in a 37-page ruling.\n\nTrump erupted about the decision. \u201cThis was an Obama judge. And I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not going to happen like this anymore,\u201d the president said. \u201cEverybody that wants to sue the United States, they file their case in \u2014 almost \u2014 they file their case in the 9th Circuit. And it means an automatic loss no matter what you do, no matter how good your case is.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cWe will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn his Twitter response to Roberts on Wednesday, Trump again attacked the 9th Circuit, saying \u201ca vast number\u201d of its rulings on border and security issues are overturned. \u201cWe need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBoth Roberts and Trump have supporting evidence for their arguments. Although Roberts \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s two nominees to the Supreme Court, Neil M. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2014 decry any attempt to label judges as partisan, studies show there are clear ideological differences between judges nominated by presidents of different parties. That is why there are so many partisan battles over judicial nominations, and why the Trump administration has made filling the courts with conservative judges such a priority.\n\nBut Trump is fixated on the adverse rulings that come from the 9th Circuit, which is considered the nation\u2019s most liberal regional appeals court. It is also the largest, covering nine states, and in his tweet, Trump again called for breaking it up, a proposal that has been debated for decades without resolution.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s losing streak in lower courts is nationwide, with district judges and appeals courts across the country ruling against the administration\u2019s policies on issues as diverse as immigration, abortion policy for teenage undocumented immigrants and how to judge the Commerce Department\u2019s actions on the U.S. census. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties have been part of those decisions.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration was thwarted in its efforts to revoke CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s White House press credentials by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly \u2014 a Trump appointee.\n\nBecause of the losses, the administration has pursued an aggressive agenda of trying to get the Supreme Court to take up the lower-court decisions before they have made a thorough but time-consuming journey through the appeals process.\n\nTrump will need Roberts in those efforts, since the court now has five committed conservatives and four consistent liberals.\n\nRoberts delivered the administration its biggest win at the Supreme Court at the end of the last term, when the court on a 5-to-4 vote upheld the president\u2019s \u201ctravel ban\u201d on people from certain Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIn ruling that the president had not exceeded his powers, the chief justice put aside comments that Trump had made about Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cIt is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe express no view on the soundness of the policy.\u201d\n\nFelicia Sonmez contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Washington Post Staff", "title": "Rebuking Trump, Chief Justice Roberts defends judiciary as \u2018independent\u2019 after president criticized judge who blocked asylum ban", "description": "U.S. Chief Justice John G.

Trump pushed back on sanctions against Russia over the nation\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, so Congress passed them last year over his objections. Trump said then he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin when he insisted that the Kremlin was not involved in any effort to interfere in America\u2019s politics.\n\nNow, in the wake of Trump\u2019s apparent absolution of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oct. 2 slaying of Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist, Republicans and Democrats say they are prepared to pass another set of sanctions to hold the Saudi government accountable.\n\nEven Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is known for his tough stances when it comes to foreign affairs but who is also one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill, said Tuesday that sanctions on Saudi Arabia should be included in a must-pass measure to fund the government by Dec. 7. In a Twitter thread, Graham wrote that Mohammed is \u201cbeyond toxic\u201d and that \u201cwhen we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.\u201d\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of the Crown Prince \u2013 in multiple ways \u2013 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 20, 2018\n\nSuch comments were echoed by other Senate Republicans, primarily those who have frequently been critical of Trump -- notably retiring Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) -- and do not have the ear of the president like Graham does.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Corker, the outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said on Twitter.\n\nIf Congress cannot push through more sanctions on Saudi Arabia in the lame-duck session, it may have a more challenging time doing so next year when Sen.

Excluding the Lions and Cowboys, who have hosted games on Thanksgiving every year since 1978, the Redskins will join the St. Louis Cardinals (1975-77) and Chicago Bears (1979-81) as the only teams to play on Thanksgiving in three consecutive seasons.\n\n[Redskins-Cowboys matchups: Five keys to Thursday's game]\n\nWashington is 3-7 on Thanksgiving, including a 1-7 record against the Cowboys.

That general idea has been demonstrated at science fairs, but the new work shows it can power a free-flying airplane.\n\nSo can people look forward to traveling in planes that are almost silent and emit no air pollution?\n\n\u201cNot anytime soon,\u201d says Steven Barrett of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who reported the results in a study released Wednesday by the journal Nature.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the technology could work at such a large scale, he said in a telephone interview. And even if it can, it would take a few decades to develop such planes, he said.\n\nBefore that, the approach might be used in airplane-like drones that perform tasks like environmental monitoring and surveillance, he said. As drones become more common in urban skies, the lack of noise would be an advantage in making them less bothersome to people on the ground, he said.\n\nThe Nature paper reports the results of 10 test flights inside an MIT athletic building. With a wingspan of about 16 feet (5 meters), the five-pound (2.45-kilogram) plane sailed along at about 11 mph (17 kph). Each flight covered about 60 yards (55 meters).\n\nBarrett, 35, said he was inspired as a child by watching \u201cStar Trek\u201d television episodes and movies, where he was struck by the shuttles that flew with no moving parts in their propulsion systems. He recalled thinking, \u201cThere should be a way things should fly without having propellers and (jet) turbines.\u201d\n\nAs an adult, he focused on that and came across a concept called \u201cionic wind.\u201d\n\nFor the MIT airplane, that involves a series of thin wires at the front of the plane that generate a powerful electric field. The field strips electrons from air molecules, turning the molecules into positively charged particles called ions. Those ions flow toward negatively charged parts of plane, colliding with ordinary air molecules and transferring energy to them. That produces a wind that provides thrust for the plane, Barrett explained.\n\nA similar process has long been used in outer space to propel some spacecraft, he said.\n\nBarrett said he hopes to find a way to eliminate the \u201cvery slight buzz\u201d one can hear.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re onto something here,\u201d said Pat Anderson, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Daytona Beach, Florida, campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He had no role in the research.\n\nHe called the results impressive. But the experimental aircraft lacks the range and endurance to serve as a useful drone, and it\u2019s not clear whether the technology could be scaled up to fix that or become useful for propelling a passenger plane, he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

But Trump, who has an especially contentious relationship with the press, has skipped it the last two years.\n\nWolf\u2019s sharply anti-Trump performance in 2018 was criticized by some as too pointed in its shots at White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other White House staff.\n\nChernow, for his part, in 2016 joined with other historians in expressing alarm at Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric.\n\n\u201cLike many other historians, I have been deeply disturbed by the Trump campaign \u2014 more deeply disturbed than by any other presidential campaign in our history,\u201d he said in a video statement, expressing alarm that Americans might \u201cforget who we are as a people and succumb to historical amnesia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been horrified by the many shocking statements this man has made, but no less frightening have been the omissions,\u201d he went on to say, citing the then-candidate\u2019s reluctance to say words like injustice and tolerance or express emotions like kindness, compassion and empathy.\n\nChernow said in a statement released by the association that he\u2019d been asked \u201cto make the case for the First Amendment\u201d in his speech and was \u201chappy to oblige.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of the press is always a timely subject, and this seems like the perfect moment to go back to basics,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cWhile I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry.\u201d\n\nChernow declined comment further when asked if his speech would include criticism of Trump.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press National Writer Hillel Italie in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He cited medical consensus that viability typically begins between 23 and 24 weeks and said there is \u201cno legitimate state interest strong enough, before viability, to justify a ban on abortions.\u201d\n\nMississippi is one of several states that already have a \u201ctrigger law\u201d in place that would ban abortions if Roe v.

The abortion rate was 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in 2015, compared with 12.1 in 2014 and 15.9 in 2006.\n\nIn the years immediately after abortion was legalized nationwide in 1973, the number of legal abortions rose dramatically, reaching its peak in the 1980s. Abortions then began dropping at a slow rate until around 2006 to 2008, when they increased slightly, followed by even greater decreases in recent years.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance report comes at a heated time for abortion politics in the country, with Trump administration officials introducing new policies to reduce funding to abortion providers and state legislatures debating ever more restrictive laws on abortion. Just this week, a federal court in Mississippi blocked the state\u2019s ban against abortions past 15 weeks gestation. In signing the bill into law, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) had said he hoped to make the state the \u201csafest place in America for an unborn child.\u201d\n\nWhile the CDC paper did not delve into the reasons for the decline, analysts have cited improved access to birth control, which has led to a decrease in unintended pregnancies, especially among teens, as well as the state laws regarding parental consent, waiting periods and other conditions that make it more difficult for women to get abortions.\n\n\"Analyses have suggested that improved contraceptive use played a role in the long-term declines. In some states, decreased access to abortion services contributed, as well,\u201d said Rachel Jones, principal research scientist for the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports women\u2019s right to abortion.\n\n\n\nAbortion Surveillance - United States 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nChuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, added other possible causes: \u201ca higher percentage of women today decide to carry an unexpected pregnancy to term, teenagers are less sexually active and with fewer partners, pro-life views are more prevalent among the rising generation than they were 40 years ago.\u201d\n\nHe called the decline \u201csharp and consistent\u201d and pointed out that the U.S. abortion rate is half of what it was in 1980.\n\nThe data is isn\u2019t 100 percent complete \u2014 California, Maryland and New Hampshire did not participate, and the reporting is better in some places than others \u2014 but it nonetheless provides a window into the overall trends and demographics of who is seeking abortions. The report shows tremendous variation by age, race and geographic region.\n\nWhile the abortion rate decreased across all age groups in 2015, women in their 20s accounted for nearly 60 percent of all abortions. The abortion rate was 19.9 for women ages 20-24 and 17.9 for ages 25-29.\n\nWhite women had the lowest abortion rate, at 6.8 abortions per 1,000 women, and black women had the highest abortion rate at 25.1 per 1,000. \u201cThe findings in this report indicate that the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions have declined across all race/ethnicity groups but that well-documented disparities persist,\u201d Tara C. Jatlaoui, from the CDC\u2019s division of reproductive health, and co-authors wrote.\n\nThere was also considerable variation among jurisdictions, from a rate of 2.8 abortions in South Dakota to 23.1 abortions in New York.\n\nOne major source of controversy in recent years has been the widespread availability of medical abortions or pills such as RU-486 that can be taken to induce abortion without surgical intervention. In 2015, about a quarter of all abortions involved medical abortion, which can be done only early in a pregnancy.\n\nThe report did not have information about deaths from complications of abortion in 2015, saying the data was still being assessed.

They describe themselves as a \u201cWestern chauvinist\u201d fraternal group that believes in ending welfare, closing the borders and adhering to traditional gender roles.\n\nBut critics point to other statements and behavior to argue that these aims are a subterfuge for racist and hateful beliefs.\n\n\u201cTheir disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions: rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists,\u201d the Southern Poverty Law Center, which considers the Proud Boys a hate group, wrote in a report. \u201cThey are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe group captured national media attention for its involvement in a fight that broke out on the streets of New York after it was invited to a Republican club in town. Police sought to charge nine people who were affiliated with the group after the incident.\n\nThe Proud Boys, who did not respond to a request for comment sent to their New York chapter, have pushed back on assertions like those made by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

That\u2019s as absurd as saying a Dallas Cowboys fan wants all the other teams to die. To say black people are totally responsible for their lot in life now that it\u2019s 2011 is not racist.\"\n\nThe FBI\u2019s field office in Seattle referred inquiries about its designation to its headquarters in Washington. In a statement distributed by spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton, the FBI said it did not regulate political ideology or any other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cOur focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhen it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on criminal activity of individuals \u2014 regardless of group membership \u2014 which appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion.

The two laws would have marked the earliest abortion bans in the country.\n\nWhen Bryant signed the bill into law in March, he said the state would be \u201csaving more of the unborn than any state in America.\u201d\n\n[As the midterms approach, women\u2019s rights remain the fault line in American politics]\n\nIn a news conference last week, Bryant stood alongside Republican Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith and defended her amid widespread criticism over a joke she made about \u201cpublic hanging.\u201d Bryant began the news conference by suggesting that black women were participating in \u201cthe genocide of 20 million African American children\u201d through legal abortions.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights, such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of the Mississippi abortion clinic, celebrated Tuesday\u2019s ruling as a victory for women in the state.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision should be a wake-up call for state lawmakers who are continuously trying to chip away at abortion access,\u201d Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. \u201cSuch bans will not stand in a court of law.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Elon Musk leads 2018's business turkeys, but he has some stuffed competition - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Elon Musk leads 2018's business turkeys, but he has some stuffed competition Washington Post I love Thanksgiving, the quintessential American holiday.

One of the ways I celebrate it is by writing about \u2014 bad pun intended \u2014 business turkeys. You know, the kind of thing that leads people to say, \u201cWhat a turkey!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a terrific turkey crop this year \u2014 and that\u2019s without even including the various foul things that Donald Trump has done. But let\u2019s leave Trump\u2019s turkeys and those of his opponents for political writers to gnaw on, and stick with business turkeys.\n\nOur lead turkey is Elon Musk of Tesla Motors. Actually, he\u2019s a double turkey.\n\nMusk sent out a totally nonsensical tweet in August, when Tesla was trading at $356 a share, saying that he had financing to take the company private at $420.\n\nThe number 420, as even a nonuser like me knows, is associated with marijuana. Which may be why Musk picked that price. Or maybe he was just high when he pushed \u201csend\u201d on his tweet. Who knows?\n\nMusk\u2019s bogus claim brought the Securities and Exchange Commission down on him because it affected the market for Tesla stock. Musk then turned himself into a double turkey by declining to go along with a proposed settlement Tesla\u2019s lawyers made with the SEC.\n\nMusk\u2019s withdrawal understandably enraged the SEC. So when Musk changed his mind again and decided to settle, the SEC whacked him for $20 million personally.\n\n[NASA, rankled by Musk\u2019s pot smoking, to launch safety review of SpaceX]\n\nI wonder how much weed \u2014 or how many turkeys to feed the poor \u2014 Musk could have bought with that $20 million if he had kept his mouth shut.\n\nSpeaking of non-shut mouths, John Schnatter, the now-ousted founder of Papa John\u2019s, is right up there with Musk when it comes to double turkeydom.\n\nBut what Schnatter did is considerably nastier than Musk\u2019s ratty, rambling behavior.\n\nSchnatter, whose company was a major pro football sponsor, blamed kneeling National Football League players for the problems Papa John\u2019s had selling its overpriced pizza. At best, Schnatter showed poor impulse control; at worst, racism. That gobble-worthy move was followed by a second turkey \u2014 his infamous internal email, of which the less said, the better. For that matter, the less said of Schnatter, the better.\n\nNow, to big-company turkeys.\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s board deserves its own flock. The board let Jeff Immelt, handpicked successor to Jack Welch (remember him?) do enormous deals that have now put GE at risk. Last year, the directors hired GE lifer John Flannery to replace Immelt and try to fix GE. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nSo this year the board fired Flannery. I hope Flannery\u2019s successor, Larry Culp, manages to fix GE. I think highly of Culp \u2014 I\u2019ve done very well as a shareholder in Danaher, the firm he used to run, and I\u2019ve even nibbled a bit at GE stock since his accession. Which may well end up making me a turkey, too.\n\nAt the very least, the GE board members involved in the Immelt and Flannery debacles should don turkey feathers. And perhaps return their directors\u2019 fees to GE shareholders. Or donate the fees to charities that help GE workers who have lost their jobs.\n\nNow, two more turkeys from the world of finance.\n\nThe first is Toys R Us, the once-dominant retail chain that got slaughtered after the leveraged buyout crowd took it over and loaded it with debt.\n\nMaybe Toys would have ultimately gone under even without that debt because Amazon.com (whose founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) beat the stuffing out of it.\n\nBut at a minimum, the debt and subsequent underinvestment in Toys\u2019 business accelerated job losses suffered by thousands of workers. Who don\u2019t have much to be thankful for as the holiday approaches.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sears, which finally filed for bankruptcy this year after a decade of being run by Eddie Lampert, a denizen of the hedge-fund world. In person, Lampert\u2019s a decent guy \u2014 I\u2019ve met and talked with him a few times \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t a decent leader of the Sears-Kmart combo.\n\nSears\u2019s long decline, despite various games Lampert had the company play with its assets, so damaged Lampert\u2019s reputation that investors fled his funds, reducing his wealth. But his financial suffering doesn\u2019t approach that of Sears workers who lost their jobs, or Sears landlords and vendors who got burned.\n\nFinally, there are some of my media colleagues, who were snookered into making a huge deal out of the supposed invasion of the United States by Central American migrants.\n\nThe \u201cinvasion\u201d struck me as a nothingburger, but it involves things I don\u2019t know much about. However, when Post media critic Margaret Sullivan said the coverage was much ado about nothing, that was good enough for me to feel comfortable handing some turkeys to people in my own business.\n\nAnd that will do it. Regardless of whether you share my views, let\u2019s enjoy the season, declare a truce and try to get along. A happy Thanksgiving to you and yours, and a happy winter festival of your choice."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "A man hurled racist slurs and a punch at a FedEx driver \u2014 then died after he was punched back - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post A man hurled racist slurs and a punch at a FedEx driver \u2014 then died after he was punched back Washington Post Timothy Warren was driving his FedEx truck through a verdant neighborhood in Portland, Ore., when the man he would soon kill screamed\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/21/man-hurled-racist-slurs-punch-fedex-driver-then-died-after-he-was-punched-back/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/By-4mnRjAi4Bq4TWAmrf-tDroLE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BFX7DRHNR4I6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:35:21Z", "content": "Timothy Warren was driving his FedEx truck through a verdant neighborhood in Portland, Ore., when the man he would soon kill screamed that Warren was going too fast.

Warren swung back, connecting a single blow above Magnuson\u2019s left eye that sent him tumbling to the ground.\n\nMagnuson, 55, briefly lost consciousness, then died later that evening.\n\nProsecutors, however, have decided not to charge Warren, 41, with a crime.

But he said he believed nothing would have occurred had Warren kept driving.\n\nGibbs agreed.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the prosecutor wrote, \u201cthe decision by Mr. Warren, who is black, to not let the racist vitriol to which he was being subjected go unanswered is not of legal significance . . .

Materials are crafted for specific purposes, such as staying warm or cool and staving off the wind. Here\u2019s how to dress to enhance the body\u2019s natural ability to stay warm.\n\nLayers\n\nThe most important advice, even if you ignore everything else on this page, is to dress in layers. Layers inherently cross off most of the other items on this list.\n\nThree layers will keep you warm:\n\nBase \u2014 Polyester, silk or some other material with the ability to wick sweat away from your skin. Just don\u2019t use a cotton shirt as your base layer. It will absorb the moisture fine, but it won\u2019t evaporate.\n\n\u2014 Polyester, silk or some other material with the ability to wick sweat away from your skin. Just don\u2019t use a cotton shirt as your base layer. It will absorb the moisture fine, but it won\u2019t evaporate. Middle \u2014 This is the insulating layer, which is the workhorse in keeping you warm. Sweaters, sweatshirts, fleece; these will all work as the middle layer. It should be snug but not tight. Down coats also make a great middle layer in the coldest temperatures.\n\n\u2014 This is the insulating layer, which is the workhorse in keeping you warm. Sweaters, sweatshirts, fleece; these will all work as the middle layer. It should be snug but not tight. Down coats also make a great middle layer in the coldest temperatures. Outer \u2014 This layer is less about keeping you warm (the first two layers should be doing that) and more about blocking the wind and rain. If it\u2019s not that windy and it\u2019s not raining, a regular winter coat (down puffer, wool pea coat, etc.) will be fine. But if you really want to stay warm, make your outer layer a wind- and waterproof shell, like a rain jacket. Ideally it has vents around the armpits to allow sweat to evaporate. If you want to get really fancy, the outer shells made of specially engineered materials such as Gore-Tex or Sympatex are rain- and windproof and also breathable.\n\nSpace\n\nProbably the most common misconception about dressing warm is that the layers should be tight. But if you think of a layer of clothing as the interface between you and the elements, you can see how a tight shirt is only putting your skin closer to the cold air.\n\nSpace will keep you warm: a good-fitting wool sweater, for example, that creates a thin boundary layer of air between your skin and the environment. Your body heat will warm the boundary layer and the sweater will prevent the layer from being blown away from your body.\n\nStay dry\n\nMoisture is the kiss of death on a cold day, whether it\u2019s from rain or perspiration. Evaporation is a cooling process, and if you\u2019re wet, the cooling process is happening right on your skin.\n\nAvoid getting wet by wearing a base layer that wicks sweat away from your body, such as polyester or silk. Your outer layer should be waterproof, such as a rain jacket, but should also have vents or breathable fabric so your perspiration can evaporate off the interior layers.\n\nBreak the wind\n\nEven if the temperature isn\u2019t that cold, the wind can make your time outside miserable. Our warm bodies heat up a little layer of air around us, which helps insulate from the cold. Wind can blow the warm layer away. The best way to counter the wind is with a windproof outer layer, which keeps the warm layer of air next to our skin, where it should be.\n\nHats, gloves and socks\n\nProtect your extremities by wearing a hat that covers your ears, waterproof gloves and wool socks. If you have a beautiful, thick head of hair, you can get away with earmuffs or a winter headband. The idea that most of your body heat is lost through your head is a myth. The body loses most of its heat through whatever is exposed. Stay covered, and you\u2019ll stay warm.\n\nMaterials and what they do\n\nPolyester or polypropylene \u2014 This material is basically fine, woven strands of plastic, which sounds horrible to wear, but it actually can give clothing its softness. Fleece tends to be made out of polyester, for example. Polyester and polypropylene are moisture-wicking fabrics, which draw perspiration away from the skin. They make great cold-weather clothing.\n\nSilk \u2014 It\u2019s more costly than many other fabrics, but silk is a great material for a base layer because it\u2019s natural and wicks moisture like polyester.\n\nWool \u2014 This is an essential cold-weather material when paired with some polyester layers. A wool sweater makes a perfect middle layer. It does absorb moisture, which is not great, but it stays warm even when it\u2019s wet. The best thing about wool is its ability to trap that warm-air layer next to your skin. It also makes good hats and socks.\n\nNylon \u2014 Nylon is good in outer layers, as it doesn\u2019t absorb much water. It makes for a good poncho or rain jacket.\n\nGore-Tex, Sympatex or similar \u2014 These are engineered, patented materials that claim to be waterproof, windproof and breathable. Most of these live up to the claim. They make great outer-layer jackets for cold weather.\n\nCotton \u2014 Clothing made of cotton is not good for cold weather. It absorbs moisture and traps it next to your skin. Save the cotton for summer, when you might want a little extra moisture to keep you cool."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Rosalind S.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nProsecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III asked a federal judge Wednesday to order George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser to President Trump, to start serving time in prison on Monday as scheduled.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s lawyers had asked U.S. District Court Judge Randolph D. Moss to allow Papadopoulos to delay his two-week prison sentence while a constitutional challenge to Mueller\u2019s appointment filed in a separate case in Washington is resolved.\n\nBut Mueller\u2019s team responded that Papadopoulos waived his rights to appeal when he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and that he had failed to file his request in a timely fashion.\n\nIn the more than a year since Papadapoulos was first charged by Mueller\u2019s office, he has never challenged the constitutionality of the special counsel\u2019s appointment. Papadopoulos\u2019s motion citing the D.C. case was made just days before the scheduled start to his brief prison stay.\n\nAn appeals court in Washington heard oral arguments earlier this month in the constitutional challenge, which was made by a former aide to Trump adviser Roger Stone who is fighting a subpoena to appear before the grand jury. It is not clear when the three-judge panel is likely to rule in the case, which may ultimately go to the Supreme Court.\n\nMueller\u2019s prosecutors said Papa\u00addopoulos\u2019s own public statements since he was sentenced suggested that his filing was solely an effort to delay his incarceration.\n\nChris LaVigne, an attorney for Papadopoulos who recently replaced the lawyers who represented him during the plea process, said in a statement that the special counsel\u2019s motion had failed to address the central question of Papadopoulos\u2019s request: \u201cWhy should Mr. Papadopoulos be required to begin serving his sentence now, when there is an appeal pending that could directly impact the validity of his prosecution and conviction?\u201d\n\nProsecutors had asked Moss to sentence Papadopoulos to as much as six months in prison for lying to federal agents about key details involving his interactions with a London-based professor and two Russian nationals.\n\nBut at his sentencing hearing, Papadopoulos appealed for mercy, saying that he understood his lies had been wrong and that he was remorseful.\n\nMoss told Papadopoulos that he had been planning to order him to serve 30 days, but shaved the sentence to 14 days because he was moved by his contrition.\n\nFollowing the hearing, Papadopoulos gave a series of interviews in which he expressed views that the special counsel\u2019s office described Wednesday as \u201cinconsistent with his stated acceptance of responsibility at sentencing.\u201d\n\nFor instance, he told Fox News days later that he was considering withdrawing his plea and that he should not \u201chave to serve even one day in jail for something that now it seems was completely orchestrated.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted on Nov. 9 that his biggest regret was pleading guilty.\n\n\u201cThe defendant received what he bargained for, and holding him to it is not a hardship,\u201d prosecutors wrote Wednesday.\n\nLaVigne called the special counsel\u2019s inclusion of Papadopoulos\u2019 public remarks \u201cunrelated and wholly irrelevant\u201d to the legal motion.\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s prison term would mark an important milestone for the investigation, which began when an Australian diplomat alerted U.S. officials in July 2016 that Papadopoulos had claimed to have been told the Russians held dirt about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Waldman", "title": "How Matthew Whitaker\u2019s \u2018wingnut welfare\u2019 stint made him perfect for Trump", "description": "But who paid the acting attorney general all that money?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/11/21/how-matthew-whitakers-wingnut-welfare-stint-made-him-perfect-for-trump/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RYLW1DO5koAv1Tu1wn0mVbh_2ZE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WPQGX6VVLI5UHCR4A5N7YJ46RU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T17:18:47Z", "content": "Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, in addition to being the man President Trump picked to put a stop to the investigation of the 2016 Russia scandal, is an entrepreneurial fellow.

Whitaker, in addition to being the man President Trump picked to put a stop to the investigation of the 2016 Russia scandal, is an entrepreneurial fellow. We\u2019ve already learned about his involvement with a scam patent marketing company that was shut down by the feds after cheating customers out of $26 million.\n\nAnd new information on Whitaker\u2019s recent employment sheds light on an interesting corner of the political world, one where a guy like Whitaker can earn huge sums of money for doing very little \u2014 and in the process, it turns out, audition to become the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. You might even call it swampy.\n\nOr you might call it \u201cwingnut welfare,\u201d a disparaging term that refers to a system wherein conservatives are granted well-remunerated sinecures from which they can advocate conservative ideas in the media while barely having to work. Is there a bit of jealousy in that term, used as it is by liberals who perhaps wish that more of their own donors would toss money around as freely as conservative donors do? Absolutely.\n\nBut Whitaker was employed by a particularly strange kind of Potemkin organization, created to give the appearance of legitimacy while having little real existence outside of a cable-news chyron underneath Whitaker\u2019s name. And oh boy was it lucrative, as The Post reports:\n\nIn the three years after he arrived in Washington in 2014, Matthew G. Whitaker received more than $1.2 million as the leader of a charity that reported having no other employees, some of the best pay of his career. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust described itself as a new watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials. For Whitaker, it became a lucrative steppingstone in a swift rise from a modest law practice in Iowa to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job. As FACT\u2019s president, he regularly appeared on radio and television, often to skewer liberals. But FACT\u2019s origins and the source of funding used to pay Whitaker \u2014 now the acting attorney general \u2014 remain obscured. An examination of state and federal records, and interviews with those involved, show that the group is part of a national network of nonprofits that often work in concert to amplify conservative messages.\n\nFACT, which was created under a different name some years before taking on Whitaker, is an organization so mysterious that some of the people listed on its official documents barely seem to know it exists. One person listed as a director said he had forgotten about his involvement, but upon looking into it concluded, \u201cThe organization only existed on paper and didn\u2019t do anything at all.\u201d Another person listed as a director \u201csaid he was surprised to learn of his role,\u201d explaining that the group\u2019s founder approached him but he never agreed to be involved.\n\nBecause FACT is a 501(c)3 charitable organization, it doesn\u2019t have to reveal its donors. But this all raises a tantalizing question: Just who would pay all this money to someone like Whitaker?\n\nLet\u2019s remember that Whitaker wasn\u2019t particularly well-known before he was tapped to be Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff. He had been a U.S. attorney and mounted a weak Senate campaign in 2014, coming in fourth place with 7.5 percent of the vote in the Republican primary. It\u2019s not like he had some kind of following that would make donors rush to open their wallets for him.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say, however, that whoever was donating all that money got nothing for it. Whitaker\u2019s job seems to have consisted mostly of going on TV to amplify conservative messaging, on questions like whether Hillary Clinton was one of history\u2019s greatest criminals and should be immediately prosecuted.\n\nA job like that exists because cable news has an absolutely insatiable demand for people to come on the air and speak about whatever controversy or faux-controversy is occupying Washington\u2019s attention at a given moment. If you\u2019re demented enough to spend an entire day watching it, you\u2019ll see a steady parade of talking heads coming on the air for five-minute \u201chits\u201d about one issue or another, dozens and dozens of them. Because the networks need to find so many people to do this each and every day, genuine expertise is far less valuable than the ability to speak emphatically and authoritatively.\n\nWhitaker had the kind of authority that cable news bookers prize, because of both his status as a former U.S. attorney and his position as president of an important-sounding organization. Viewers would never know that in truth it was little more than a mail drop.\n\nJust to be clear, there\u2019s nothing illegal about this, or even really unethical. I don\u2019t doubt that when Whitaker went on TV all those times to attack Clinton or other Democrats, he was expressing his genuine beliefs. But someone who found a home in that particular part of the political world, where organizations hide behind their status as \u201ccharitable\u201d groups while devoting themselves to obviously partisan PR, might not be the best choice to serve as America\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\n\nBut it was a perfect audition for Whitaker, and not just because Trump could see him on TV criticizing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. Trump would also have seen someone advocating Republican interests while claiming devotion to abstract principles like integrity in government. Because Trump was looking for someone who would put the president\u2019s interests above all else while claiming to care only about the fair administration of justice, Whitaker could demonstrate that he was just the man for the job."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Valerie Strauss", "title": "Controversy over teaching Thanksgiving to kids \u2014 2018 edition", "description": "A school district official calls for culturally appropriate Thanksgiving lessons.

Some schools have even replaced Thanksgiving celebrations with harvest festivals.\n\nWheaton College historian Robert Tracy McKenzie wrote in the New York Times a few years ago that the question about how to teach Thanksgiving to kids was the wrong one. The better question: Should it be taught?\n\nIf our goal is to teach schoolchildren about the origins of our contemporary Thanksgiving holiday, why spend time on the 1621 feast shared by Pilgrims and Wampanoag? Neither the Pilgrims nor the Wampanoag considered that now famous gathering a Thanksgiving celebration. To them, it was a harvest festival. A true Thanksgiving was a solemn, holy day set apart for prayer and praise in church, not an outdoor party centered on military drills and barbecue. What\u2019s more, for nearly three centuries afterward, few Americans outside New England linked our national Thanksgiving holiday to a tradition supposedly begun in 1621. When President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the first national autumn Thanksgiving in 1863, he focused exclusively on contemporary events and ignored the past entirely. For the rest of the 19th century, school history textbooks rarely referred to the Pilgrims or the \u201cfirst Thanksgiving.\u201d Why do we feel obliged to pay attention to them now? . . . More than a century later, the U.S. still wrestles with challenges of diversity, and we\u2019re still tempted to distort the \u201cfirst Thanksgiving\u201d into one of two equally present-minded morality tales: the heart-warming multicultural celebration or the cruel reminder of European colonialism. Both tell us more about current perspectives than historical realities. If such caricatures are really our best options, historical truth would be better served by deleting Thanksgiving from the curriculum entirely.\n\nIt remains in the curriculum, however, across the country, and every year there seems to be some controversy over the teaching of the holiday. The 2018 edition reveals the divisions in this country about how we view history, diversity and truth.\n\nThis happened in North Carolina\u2019s Wake County public schools district, which has been rocked in the past year with racially charged incidents, including the online posting by students of two videos with racist stereotypes and language.\n\nLauryn Mascare\u00f1az, a former teacher who joined the North Carolina district\u2019s Office of Equity Affairs in the spring, tweeted this several days ago:\n\nTeachers! Repeat after me:\n\nI will not have my students make \"Indian\" feathers/clothes.\n\nI will not culturally appropriate an entire people for \"cute\" activities.\n\nI will tell my students the truth about this country's relationship with Indigenous people.#PinterestIsNotPedagogy \u2014 Lauryn Mascare\u00f1az (@laurynmaria) November 16, 2018\n\nSome educators tweeted back with praise:\n\nYes to this! Put my students in groups this week and gave each a myth about the \u201cfirst Thanksgiving.\u201d They had to research what the truth actually was and why the myth is still perpetuated today. \u2014 Tiffanie (@misstiff2390) November 17, 2018\n\nLove this. Revisionist history begins with us. We can't wait for the textbook Publishers to catch up. Kids will repeat what we model. Let's model the truth. \u2014 Dan Jackson (@Mind_on_ASaP) November 18, 2018\n\nThat, the News & Observer reported, led to a response from conservatives, including A.P. Dillon and Anthony J. Bruno, one who tweeted in response that Mascare\u00f1az was a \u201cprofessional social justice warrior.\u201d The other tweeted that her views were why \u201cparents remove their kids from public schools.\u201d\n\nAnd people wonder why parents remove their kids from public schools, she is a loon. @TerryStoops \u2014 Anthony J Bruno (@ajbruno14) November 17, 2018\n\nMascare\u00f1az had been working for the Teaching Tolerance project of the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, which has published guidance on how to teach about Thanksgiving in a culturally appropriate manner. It says in part:\n\nSchool Thanksgiving activities often mean dressing children in \u201cIndian\u201d headdresses and paper feathers as they sing \u201cMy Country \u2019Tis of Thee\u201d or \u201cMr. Turkey.\u201d Some teachers might even ask their students to draw themselves as Native Americans from the past, complete with feather-adorned headbands and buckskin clothing. These activities might seem friendly and fun, unless you are aware of how damaging this imagery is to perceptions of contemporary Native peoples. This imagery contributes to the indoctrination of American youth into a false narrative that relegates indigenous peoples to the past and turns real human beings into costumes for a few days a year. It\u2019s not just bad pedagogy; it\u2019s socially irresponsible. Native Americans have been speaking out and writing back against the colonialist narrative of Thanksgiving for as long as the American narrative has existed. . . . Teaching about Thanksgiving in a socially responsible way means that educators accept the ethical obligation to provide students with accurate information and to reject traditions that sustain harmful stereotypes about indigenous peoples.\n\nThe guidance offers teaching resources, including a \u201cThanksgiving Mourning\u201d activity that does the following:\n\nAnd that\u2019s our Thanksgiving teaching controversy for this year.

She subsequently asked her staff to look into the matter to \u201cdouble-check whether anything had crossed my desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced,\u201d Sandberg wrote.

Open Society did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Freedom from Facebook spokesman Eddie Vale said Wednesday: \u201cWe have said publicly, and Open Society has said publicly, they provide no funding yet Facebook continues to lie.\"\n\nSandberg, in her post on Wednesday, wrote: \u201cIt was never anyone\u2019s intention to play into an anti-Semitic narrative against Mr. Soros or anyone else.

Among its own sellers, some took to the company\u2019s forums to complain about Amazon\u2019s tight-lipped handling of the matter. \u201cWho knows what they\u2019re not disclosing about this,\u201d wrote one user. \u201cHopefully nothing. ...\"\n\nOthers questioned Amazon after it told users there\u2019s \u201cno need for you to change your password or take any other action,\u201d fearing that hackers still might try to use their names and email addresses for nefarious purposes, including phishing scams.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Amazon has run into security troubles. In October, the tech giant reportedly fired an employee who inappropriately shared customers' emails with a third-party seller. The security lapse, which Amazon said it was working with law enforcement to investigate, similarly resulted in messages to customers indicating their email addresses had been exposed.\n\nThe latest incident, however, could embolden those who would like to see tech giants and other businesses disclose more information about security incidents to their customers. Over the past year, tech giants such as Facebook and Google have experienced more serious mishaps affecting their users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission in April announced Yahoo would pay a $35 million penalty to settle charges that it misled investors by failing to disclose one of the world\u2019s largest data breaches in which hackers stole personal data linked to hundreds of millions of user accounts. Yahoo learned of the intrusion in 2014, but the company did not reveal the incident until 2016 when it was in the process of being acquired by Verizon Communications.\n\nBut currently, the federal government has no law requiring companies to tell consumers when their information has been stolen or compromised. Most states do have rules, but they generally only cover incidents in which sensitive personal information, like driver\u2019s license numbers or credit-card information, is taken. That includes Amazon\u2019s home state of Washington, where companies must inform residents of data breaches if the mishap includes the unauthorized disclosure of names along with information like Social Security numbers.\n\nIt is not clear when Amazon\u2019s technical error occurred or how long customer data might have been exposed. Amazon also did not detail the nature of the glitch or its fix.\n\nSome analysts estimate that Amazon now has nearly 100 million subscribers paying for Amazon Prime. But the universe of consumers who use the site is much larger.\n\nIn October, Amazon notified some customers that an employee had shared their email addresses with a third-party vendor in violation of the company\u2019s policies.

Researchers say entanglements are a leading cause of right whale deaths. (Michael Dwyer, File/Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON \u2014 A new simulator is letting scientists use a joystick to swim a virtual whale across a video screen. But this is no game \u2014 it\u2019s a serious attempt to better understand how the giant mammals become entangled in fishing lines.\n\nTim Werner, a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, hopes the technology will lead to safer fishing gear designs and help critically endangered North Atlantic right whales avoid the looming threat of extinction.\n\n\u201cIf we can see how they get entangled, it would help us prevent it. The technology in computers has evolved to a state where we can model these things,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than eight in 10 critically endangered right whales become ensnared by fishing lines, and nearly six in 10 are entangled more than once.\n\nEntanglements are a leading cause of right whale deaths. Experts estimate there are no more than 440 animals left on the planet, and the species\u2019 future is bleak because of heavy mortality and poor reproduction in recent years.\n\nWerner says the video simulation has helped his team better understand how whales unwittingly \u2014 and often lethally \u2014 wrap themselves in the fishing buoy lines that hang vertically in the ocean.\n\nMarine biologists say entangled whales often can\u2019t feed, and the stress weakens them and makes females less likely to birth calves. This past season, not a single new birth was discovered.\n\nAquarium scientists, working with researchers at Duke University, published their findings this week in the journal Marine Mammal Science, describing how they\u2019re using a standard video game console to \u201cswim\u201d a computer-generated whale through heavily fished waters to recreate an entanglement.\n\nThe simulator shows how a whale might flinch as it strikes a rope, then instinctively corkscrew and roll \u2014 ending up with the line hopelessly wrapped around its body and flippers.\n\nIt also lets researchers reverse the simulated entanglement. Vikki Spruill, the aquarium\u2019s president and CEO, says the technology is the latest effort to work with fishermen and engineers to solve the entanglement threat. Scientists working with a grant from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration already are testing ropeless gear with lobstermen in the Gulf of Maine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our mission to find conservation measures that make a difference,\u201d Spruill said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nWerner said the simulator accomplishes what scientists can\u2019t do in real life: test fishing gear on actual whales.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough of them, and we wouldn\u2019t purposely see them get entangled,\u201d he said. Plus, it would take decades \u2014 time the species doesn\u2019t have \u2014 to collect enough data.\n\nResearchers say they eventually may use the simulator to model and study threats to other ocean creatures such as leatherback sea turtles.\n\n___\n\nFollow Bill Kole on Twitter at https://twitter.com/billkole .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wilbur Cross of Connecticut. It is a beautiful secular and religious blessing, and is an astounding testament to what public rhetoric in the United States can be. At a moment in our history when the Oval Office is occupied by a maw-like void \u2014 so bereft of dignity and civility that wishing for eloquence seems like proof of the worst naivete \u2014 I crave voices such as Cross\u2019s more than ever. So I went back and read every Thanksgiving proclamation issued by an U.S. president. If the pronouncements illuminate the gap between our present and our possibilities more painfully than ever, they also serve as a testament to why Thanksgiving is the perfect American holiday.\n\nIn the early years of the republic, presidents issued Thanksgiving proclamations not on any set date, but to mark events that they thought merited particular public displays of religious gratitude. (They also occasionally called for Days of Public Humiliation, a tradition that sounds surprisingly appealing in these fallen days.) It took the determined lobbying of Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Ladies\u2019 Magazine and later Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book, to convince President Abraham Lincoln to make Thanksgiving a regular national holiday. And it wasn\u2019t until the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 and a fight over whether setting the date of Thanksgiving was a state or a national prerogative \u2014 that Thanksgiving was firmly fixed as a uniform national holiday.\n\nLogistical kerfuffles, the sweep of centuries and the vast differences in presidential styles notwithstanding, the presidential Thanksgiving proclamations have maintained a similar form over time. They recognize America\u2019s privileges, celebrate the year\u2019s successes and mark its losses. And they make an argument about America\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nThe United States has gotten bigger in the years since George Washington\u2019s 1789 Thanksgiving proclamation, both literally and in the role our country plays on the world stage. But one of the beautiful things about Thanksgiving is that, for a moment, it lets us be small again. When presidents thank God for America\u2019s blessings, or when they cite the advantages of the oceans that serve as our natural buffers and the richness of our farmlands and natural resources, they are reminding Americans that the good fortune that comes our way is partly beyond our control. To the extent that we live good lives in the United States, there is an extent to which we cannot smugly claim to have done it all ourselves.\n\nBut part of the American idea, no matter how tattered and threadbare that dream has become, is the prospect that we can better ourselves. Thanksgiving is a chance to account for our progress in the year that has passed. Presidents mark it in the yield of the fields; the negotiations that have kept the peace and the service of soldiers, sailors and airmen abroad; the advances of our scientists; and the public\u2019s acts of charity. Around our Thanksgiving tables, we measure our successes in smaller, more intimate terms.\n\nAnd because Thanksgiving will come again, and because the American Dream has yet to be realized perfectly in this or any year, the work continues. Thanksgiving lets us be grateful while acknowledging the world\u2019s imperfection, to recognize our personal and national good fortune not as a resting place, but as resources for the long toil that lies ahead.\n\nOf all the Thanksgiving proclamations I read, the one that lingered most with me was Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s 1903 declaration. It\u2019s a celebration, but read today, it also feels like a warning:\n\nDuring the last year the Lord has dealt bountifully with us, giving us peace at home and abroad and the chance for our citizens to work for their welfare unhindered by war, famine or plague. It [behooves] us not only to rejoice greatly because of what has been given us, but to accept it with a solemn sense of responsibility, realizing that under Heaven it rests with us ourselves to show that we are worthy to use aright what has thus been entrusted to our care. . . . We pray for strength, and light, so that in the coming years we may with cleanliness, fearlessness, and wisdom, do our allotted work on the earth in such manner as to show that we are not altogether unworthy of the blessings we have received.\n\nThat same task lies us before us today. With Roosevelt\u2019s words, and that work in mind, my colleagues at The Washington Post Opinions section wish you all a very Happy Thanksgiving."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mradamtaylor", "title": "What Trump got wrong about Saudi Arabia's role in global oil markets", "description": "The kingdom hopes to use its oil as a foreign policy tool.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nLast month, as controversy over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi intensified, the general manager of the Riyadh-owned al-Arabiya news channel wrote a caustic op-ed warning that Saudi Arabia could use its power over the global oil market to hurt the United States if it imposed sanctions.\n\n\u201cIf the price of oil reaching $80 angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure,\u201d Turki Aldakhil wrote, warning that the United States would \u201cstab its own economy to death, even though it thinks that it is stabbing only Riyadh!\u201d\n\nThis threat prompted criticism and ridicule from some experts, who argued that it overestimated Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic clout. But at least one key figure apparently took it seriously: Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, after weeks of making excuses for Saudi Arabia over its role in the killing of Khashoggi, Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the recent low oil prices, which he described as akin to a \u201cbig tax cut\u201d for Americans, and to specifically thank Saudi Arabia for what he viewed as its role in pushing down the prices.\n\nOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nThe tweet was, at best, misleading. It betrayed an apparent misunderstanding of the international oil market, with Trump mixing and matching the U.S. oil price (the West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil, or WTI, price) with the international price (the Brent price).\n\nMoreover, by focusing on Saudi Arabia, Trump\u2019s tweets ignored other factors driving the fall in oil prices, such as concerns about global economic growth and a U.S.-China trade war, as well as a rise in U.S. oil production and U.S. exemptions to sanctions on Iranian oil. In fact, Saudi Arabia is said to be considering cutting oil production next year in a bid to increase prices because of these factors.\n\nBut Trump has long fixated on Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the oil markets, for better or worse. Just last week, he called on Saudi Arabia specifically to not cut oil production. And, more generally, the U.S. president has inflated the economic value of Saudi Arabia to the United States several times in recent months.\n\nHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nOn Twitter, Trump has a long-standing habit of talking about oil prices. In 2011, he suggested repeatedly that the United States should simply take Iraq\u2019s oil. He has also suggested that then-President Barack Obama made a deal with Saudi Arabia ahead of the 2012 election under which the kingdom increased oil production to keep prices low.\n\nBut when it comes to Saudi domination of the oil markets, Trump\u2019s perception appears to be stuck in the past \u2014 in particular, the 1973 oil crisis, during which a group of Middle Eastern states refused to sell oil to the United States, which resulted in shortages and increased prices.\n\nWriting for The Washington Post last month, Jeff Colgan, an oil politics expert at Brown University, argued that the way the oil market works had changed dramatically since 1973, meaning that any future embargoes would have less impact. The system has become more flexible, less reliant on long-term contracts, so it is easy for a consumer to get imports from another producer at short notice. The United States also has been producing more oil itself and imports only a small amount of Saudi oil.\n\nEven though Saudi Arabia would be able to affect the price of oil in the short term, Colgan wrote, Riyadh would be cautious about the long-term effect. \u201cIt encourages other producers, including those in the United States, to produce more,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOver time, that brings the price down while simultaneously eating into Saudi Arabia\u2019s market share.\u201d\n\nEllen Wald, author of \u201cSaudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom\u2019s Pursuit of Profit and Power,\u201d argued that Saudi Arabia had no plausible leverage over the United States. \u201cIf Riyadh directed the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, to halt exports to the United States today, it would primarily hurt Aramco itself,\u201d Wald wrote in the New York Times, noting that Aramco owns the largest refinery in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Saudi Arabia\u2019s royals know this. After Aldakhil\u2019s al-Arabiya commentary was published, the Saudi Embassy in Washington moved to distance the government from his stance. A statement released on the same day by the official Saudi Press Agency offered only a far more vague warning.\n\n\u201cThe Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and that the Kingdom\u2019s economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy,\u201d that statement said.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia has doubts about its economic worth to the United States, it should be thankful that Trump apparently does not share them. The U.S. leader has repeatedly inflated the value of arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Now, despite the global outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, he continues to insist that Saudi oil is vital to U.S. economic prosperity.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow do you get Trump to criticize Saudi Arabia?

Nonetheless, Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh isn\u2019t making any victory predictions like he did as the Wolverines' quarterback in 1986, backing it up in a 26-24 win. \u201cI don\u2019t think about that,\u201d he said this week, per the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since. There\u2019s not much to say about that. I can\u2019t remember what it was or what it was that really made me say that or do that.\u201d . . .\n\n[As Ohio State game nears, Michigan\u2019s defense prompts memories of fabled 1997 team]\n\nAlabama has been unbeaten entering its Iron Bowl matchup with Auburn six times in Nick Saban\u2019s 11 completed seasons at the helm of the Crimson Tide and again has a perfect record entering this year\u2019s game. But the Tigers have won two of those six meetings: The infamous \u201cKick Six\u201d game in 2013 and last year\u2019s 26-14 victory. Those two Auburn teams had a combined three losses entering the Iron Bowl, however, and this year\u2019s version has four. One big matchup problem facing the Tigers is pass protection: They\u2019ve given up a sack on 9.2 percent of their passing-down situations, which ranks 87th nationally. Alabama\u2019s defense ranks second in that category, notching a sack on 15.3 percent of its opponents' passing downs, and has 37 sacks total, which ranks sixth nationally. . . .\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether Clay Helton will be coaching for his job when Southern Cal hosts Notre Dame, but the Trojans certainly seem to be heading in the wrong direction: They\u2019ve gone from 21-6 in his first two full seasons \u2014 with Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl appearances \u2014 to 5-6 and needing an upset of the Fighting Irish to earn a postseason bid this season. USC last missed out on a bowl game because of a losing record and not because of NCAA sanctions in 2000, and Paul Hackett got the boot after that 5-7 campaign. USC was listed as an eight-point underdog as of Friday morning, and that\u2019s a scenario under which Helton\u2019s Trojans teams have struggled: They\u2019re 1-11 both straight-up and against the spread when they aren\u2019t favored. In any case, Helton will be coaching amid reports that USC might be interested in hiring James Franklin away from Penn State.

Nearly all the votes have been counted \u2014 but again, not all. California still has an estimated 1.3 million ballots to tally, but those won\u2019t shift the results much nationally. (It will determine who wins at least one House seat.)\n\nWhat will be affected by those additional ballots is the national vote total. The 2018 election is already expected to be the highest-turnout midterm election in the past century, according to analysis by the United States Elections Project.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s already the highest-turnout midterm House election in history, according to Cook Political Report\u2019s running tally of the House vote. More votes were cast in House races this year than in any presidential election before 2004.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nMuch of that is a function of population growth. But the midterm turnout stands out as exceptional for other reasons, too.\n\nFor example, as a percentage of the prior presidential election, midterm turnout is the third-highest in the past 90 years. (National vote totals weren\u2019t available for the 1938 midterms.) The total number of votes counted so far is 81 percent of the 2016 total. Were another 2.3 million votes added to the total, the percentage relative to the prior presidential year would top the 1950 figure of 81.7 percent.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nMore interesting is the division of that figure by party. The number of votes cast for Democratic House candidates was 90 percent of the total votes cast for Hillary Clinton two years ago. The votes cast for Republicans this year was only 80 percent of what President Trump received.\n\nMore interestingly, the number of votes cast for Democrats this year is 94 percent of the total cast for Trump. It would take another 3.8 million votes to top Trump\u2019s total, which won\u2019t happen. But that\u2019s the third-highest percentage one party has received in a midterm of the other party\u2019s presidential candidate in the prior presidential election.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe difference in percentage of support between the parties was also broader than normal. Democrats received 7.9 percent more of the vote than did Republican House candidates, a wider margin than the Republicans have seen in any midterm in the past 90 years. It\u2019s a higher margin than that by which any Republican presidential candidate has won the popular vote since 1984.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIn terms of raw votes, the Democratic margin has already topped the widest margin by which either party has earned more votes in a midterm, as noted by Cook Political\u2019s Dave Wasserman. The prior record, an 8.7-million vote margin, was set by the Democrats in the post-Watergate 1974 midterms.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWasserman has also highlighted a point we\u2019ve made as the votes have come in: The representatives each party is sending to Washington next year couldn\u2019t look much different.\n\nWith the defeat of Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah), the Republican caucus will include only one nonwhite woman, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) \u2014 who also happens to represent the only stretch of the West Coast not represented by a Democrat.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWe can put that another way. Ninety percent of the Republican caucus will be white men. Two-thirds of the Democratic caucus won\u2019t be.\n\nOr, put yet another way: If you run into a white man on the House floor next year, there\u2019s a 2-to-1 chance he\u2019ll be a Republican. If you run into a woman, there\u2019s a 7-to-1 chance she\u2019s a Democrat. If you run into a person of color, there\u2019s a 10-to-1 chance that representative is a Democrat.\n\nThere, again, is that rumbling subtext to American politics: A surge in turnout benefited the Democrats and reflected a more diverse American electorate.\n\ncorrection: This article was updated because I forgot that California's 21st District hadn't been called."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Gunmen attack western Libya oil site, production unchanged", "description": "Libya's oil company says 8 gunmen attacked substation of its southwestern Sharara oilfield but no employees hurt", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/gunmen-attack-western-libya-oil-site-production-unchanged/2018/11/21/49445046-eda4-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:44:10Z", "content": "BENGHAZI, Libya Libyas oil company says eight gunmen attacked a substation of its southwestern Sharara oilfield but no employees were hurt and production was unaffected.

The logic he used was often nonsensical, the numbers he used were fictional, and he ignored legitimate arguments in favor of getting tough.\n\nBut equally problematic is this: He went back on his word.\n\nTrump spent most of the weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance making the case for a tempered response and even promoting narratives that didn\u2019t implicate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman or King Salman. Yet occasionally when he granted the premise that they might have been involved, he suggested the punishment would be severe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible precedent,\u201d he said Oct. 11. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen. And we\u2019re being very tough.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 14 interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he was asked about the prospect of Mohammed having ordered the killing. \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at very, very strongly, and we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.\u201d\n\nThen on Oct. 18: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for some investigations. . . . and I think we\u2019ll be making a statement \u2014 a very strong statement.

And they should be in big trouble, okay?\u201d\n\nHe added that day: \u201cCertainly it would be a very bad thing in terms of relationship. It would take a while to rebuild.\u201d\n\nNone of this appears to apply anymore. Trump is suggesting we\u2019ll never really know what happened, even as the CIA is preparing to report that it has high confidence that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t stop there Tuesday; he also said it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mohammed ordered it \u2014 such is the importance, in his telling, of our reliance upon Saudi Arabia. \u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information,\u201d he said in his statement, \u201cbut it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Then he continued making the case for no punishment for Mohammed.\n\nThat\u2019s Trump basically throwing up his hands and saying it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mohammed ordered it. And that doesn\u2019t comport with what he said before. It doesn\u2019t make sense after saying it would be a \u201cvery bad thing in terms of our relationship\u201d and that whoever was responsible \u201cshould be in big trouble.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense from a president who has promised \u201cvery severe\u201d punishment for the perpetrators. Trump hasn\u2019t projected any of the anger he promised in that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview if he found out Mohammed was responsible.

The logic he used was often nonsensical, the numbers he used were fictional, and he ignored legitimate arguments in favor of getting tough.\n\nBut equally problematic is this: He went back on his word.\n\nTrump spent most of the weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance making the case for a tempered response and even promoting narratives that didn\u2019t implicate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman or King Salman. Yet occasionally when he granted the premise that they might have been involved, he suggested the punishment would be severe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible precedent,\u201d he said Oct. 11. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen. And we\u2019re being very tough.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 14 interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he was asked about the prospect of Mohammed having ordered the killing. \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at very, very strongly, and we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.\u201d\n\nThen on Oct. 18: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for some investigations. . . . and I think we\u2019ll be making a statement \u2014 a very strong statement. It\u2019ll have to be very severe.\u201d\n\nHe went even stronger Oct. 23: \u201cWhoever thought of that idea, I think, is in big trouble. And they should be in big trouble, okay?\u201d\n\nHe added that day: \u201cCertainly it would be a very bad thing in terms of relationship. It would take a while to rebuild.\u201d\n\nNone of this appears to apply anymore. Trump is suggesting we\u2019ll never really know what happened, even as the CIA is preparing to report that it has high confidence that Mohammed ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nBut Trump didn\u2019t stop there Tuesday; he also said it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mohammed ordered it \u2014 such is the importance, in his telling, of our reliance upon Saudi Arabia. \u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information,\u201d he said in his statement, \u201cbut it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Then he continued making the case for no punishment for Mohammed.\n\nThat\u2019s Trump basically throwing up his hands and saying it doesn\u2019t really matter whether Mohammed ordered it. And that doesn\u2019t comport with what he said before. It doesn\u2019t make sense after saying it would be a \u201cvery bad thing in terms of our relationship\u201d and that whoever was responsible \u201cshould be in big trouble.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense from a president who has promised \u201cvery severe\u201d punishment for the perpetrators. Trump hasn\u2019t projected any of the anger he promised in that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview if he found out Mohammed was responsible.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) deplanes Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport after traveling with President Trump. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWith Joanie Greve\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Marco Rubio has been trying to think more from the perspective of a blue-collar worker than a white-collar consumer since he lost the GOP nomination to President Trump two years ago. The Florida senator says that\u2019s reshaped his views on economic growth, free trade and China. Lately, he\u2019s been seeking advice from policy experts at the major think tanks on the right as he seeks to fashion what he calls a \u201cpro-work\u201d agenda that can excite Trump\u2019s base supporters while staying true to the conservative principles he\u2019s espoused throughout his political career.\n\nTrump has accelerated a national political realignment, and Rubio is grappling with how best to respond. \u201cClearly there are people that have voted for Republicans in the past that no longer support Republicans, and clearly there are people who have voted for Democrats in the past that are now supporting Republicans,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been a shift, almost a trade-off. It comes down to what kind of district do you live in: Do you live in a district that has more of the latter or the former?\u201d\n\nReflecting on the lessons of this month\u2019s elections, Rubio lamented that House races became hyper-nationalized. He said his friends Carlos Curbelo in Miami and Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia ran almost flawless campaigns and carefully distanced themselves from Trump, but both lost reelection anyway because of the national head winds. Rubio believes Republicans must find a way to appeal to those who supported Mitt Romney in 2012 but then voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, as well as voters who backed Barack Obama before breaking for Trump.\n\nThe senator fared best against Trump during the 2016 primaries in the same suburban areas where Republicans suffered their heaviest losses this month. I noted that many of those Romney-Clinton voters might have been Romney-Rubio voters if he had won the nomination instead of Trump. \u201cYeah, well, the key to the future \u2014 if you want to have a governing majority \u2014 is you have to somehow bring back the people you lost without losing the people you brought,\u201d he replied. \u201cI'm not saying that's easy to do, and that's certainly not the central goal of what we're trying to achieve here, but I think in trying to achieve that, you end up with the potential to have a governing majority or at least a governing consensus that allows you to pass public policy.\u201d\n\n-- Yuval Levin, the editor of National Affairs, said Rubio is operating from the premise that, rather than dividing people by playing on their cultural grievances, he can unite a center-right coalition with a platform of specific policies that will improve everyone\u2019s quality of life. \u201cI\u2019m predisposed to agree with that,\u201d said Levin, a former domestic policy staffer in George W. Bush\u2019s White House who has talked regularly with Rubio since he joined the Senate in 2011. \u201cIf you look at the political situation for Republicans, especially after this election, the challenge they have is their coalition consists of suburban families and working-class voters. \u2026 Trump focuses on hating what they hate, but that doesn\u2019t work with suburban families. \u2026 Republicans have to offer an agenda that speaks to middle-class and working-class families. That\u2019s the role Sen. Rubio played during tax reform.\u201d\n\nDuring that debate, Rubio pushed to expand the child tax credit. An amendment he introduced with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) to raise the corporate tax rate from 20 percent to 21 percent to pay for a larger child tax credit was opposed by Trump, as well as GOP leadership, and went down on a 29-to-71 vote. Rubio threatened to torpedo the entire legislation, which overwhelmingly benefitted billionaires and big businesses while ballooning the national debt by more than $1 trillion, unless he could get something extra to assist average families. To secure his vote, negotiators agreed to allow families who owe no federal income taxes to still claim up to $1,400 of the $2,000 child tax credit, up from $1,100 in the original Senate bill.\n\nMarco Rubio, accompanied by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on election security. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n-- I interviewed Rubio after he delivered a meaty policy speech at the Heritage Foundation last Thursday during an anti-poverty forum. The 47-year-old began by recounting his well-known origin story. His father worked as a bartender and his mother was a hotel maid after they immigrated from Cuba. Without attending college, they could buy a house and provide a middle-class lifestyle for their children. Rubio argued persuasively that parents today cannot provide the same quality of life with such service jobs. Because they live in \u201cbubbles of prosperity,\u201d he said \u201celites\u201d don\u2019t understand how many Americans are struggling to get by.\n\nRubio spoke about \u201cthe dignity of work\u201d and giving people \u201ca path out of poverty\u201d by creating more good jobs. \u201cFor starters, we need to get the millions of what scholars have called \u2018the missing men\u2019 back into the labor force,\u201d he told the crowd at Heritage. \u201cBy some counts, there are upwards of 6 million prime-age able-bodied men who simply do not work and are not even looking. It's a national crisis. It deserves an emergency solution.\u201d\n\nHis marquee proposal for how to do so is to expand the earned-income tax credit to reward low-income people who work, essentially subsidizing their wages. He also wants to overhaul the federal disability insurance program and food stamps \u201cto not just mandate work, but to promote it.\u201d Rubio rejected raising the minimum wage because he says that would just discourage employers from hiring. He also rejected any guaranteed minimum income because it would create disincentives to work.\n\nOne idea that puts him at odds with the business community is restricting the use of noncompete agreements that limit a worker\u2019s ability to move from one employer to another. \u201cWhile noncompete agreements make sense in certain circumstances, many entry level workers are surprised to find themselves unable to take their next job because of broad non-compete agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a concerning trend that hampers economic growth and holds individuals back from reaching their full potential. The issue merits scrutiny from those of us in favor of robust and open labor markets.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio has been attacked as a flip-flopper on issues like immigration, but he argues that it\u2019s foolish to assume policy should remain static and not evolve. After all, politics isn\u2019t static. The economy isn\u2019t static. Culture isn\u2019t static. \u201cThere was a time when the structure of our economy meant that, as long as there was economic growth, everybody benefited from it,\u201d Rubio said when I asked how his new agenda breaks with GOP orthodoxy. \u201cI don't think that's as true today as it once was \u2026 because the architecture of the economy has changed. \u2026 Growth alone, absent other factors, is not enough and doesn't tell us enough.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio\u2019s biggest evolution has been on trade. \u201cIn an ideal world, if life was a laboratory, you'd have free trade,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be no tariffs, and the market would find the best place to produce. But the world is not a laboratory.\n\n\u201cLet's suppose that free trade is a 90 percent winner. That means it's a 10 percent loser, and the 10 percent that\u2019s being hurt are real people,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if they're concentrated in certain communities of certain demographics, it has real implications for their lives, for their families and for communities. And I think while we spent a lot of time celebrating the 90 percent or the 80 percent or the 70 percent \u2014 or whatever that the right number is for the winners \u2014 we have been insensitive and forgotten the people who were left behind.\u201d\n\n-- In trying to understand the discontent that fueled Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP, there\u2019s been an increasing focus since 2016 on blue-collar workers who have been left behind by the economic gains of the past several decades. Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told me that too many conservatives still either argue that these people don\u2019t realize how good they have it or believe the problem is mainly with marketing and messaging. \u201cSen. Rubio is one of the few people who is actually focused on fixing what\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Cass. \u201cHe\u2019s actually providing an explanation for what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nCass, who wrote a new book called \u201cThe Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America,\u201d praises Rubio for \u201cswitching lenses\u201d in how he looks at problems in a way few other Republican lawmakers have. \u201cAll the research on free trade being good is from the consumer\u2019s perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you care about workers, you care about whether growth is broad-based.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio singled out China in his speech at Heritage. \u201cPro-work conservatives should reckon with the fact that the mismanaged opening of our economy to China has done much to create dependency on antipoverty programs, as these low skilled jobs were offshored there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen we sat down in a conference room afterward, Rubio laid a copy of his speech on the table. It was heavily marked up, and he\u2019d rewritten chunks by hand, including the chunk on China. Rubio, who sits on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, explained why he\u2019s changed his attitude toward Beijing.\n\n\u201cThere was a widespread consensus in foreign policy circles that if we opened up to China and allowed them to continue cheating, it was okay because eventually they would become rich and prosperous and then they would become more like us,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cThat was an enormous miscalculation and, frankly, it was probably an assumption that early in my career I somewhat shared. And it is now clear that it's not going to work out that way.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio confers with President Trump during a meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House. (Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News)\n\n-- Since Trump claimed the label of \u201cnationalist\u201d last month, after resisting it for years, Rubio has vigorously defended him. He wrote an op-ed last week for the Wall Street Journal entitled, \u201cTrump is Right About Nationalism.\u201d But then he offered a definition that would seem to differ from the president\u2019s. Essentially what he\u2019s describing as nationalism is what Rubio used to call American Exceptionalism. \u201cAmericans are the children of pilgrims, immigrants and slaves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA true American nationalism isn\u2019t about a national identity based on race, religion or ethnicity. Instead, it is based on our identity as a nation committed to the idea that all people are created equal, with a God-given right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio and Trump have mended fences since 2016. \u201cYou know what they say about men with small hands,\u201d the senator famously said. \u201cI guarantee you there\u2019s no problem,\u201d Trump replied at a debate. \u201cI guarantee you!\u201d\n\nBut the senator has also lightly distanced himself from Trump when it comes to America\u2019s role in the world. On Monday, he defended retired admiral Bill McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, after Trump trashed him on Fox. On Tuesday, he reacted this way to Trump\u2019s refusal to act against Saudi Arabia for the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi:\n\nOur foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests.\n\n\n\nIt is in our natl interest to defend human rights.\n\n\n\nHR violations lead to mass migration, help extremism flourish & often result in new governments hostile towards the U.S. because we supported their oppressors. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 20, 2018\n\n-- How he learned to stop worrying and love the Senate: Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s defeat of Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson means that Rubio is now the state\u2019s senior senator. As a presidential candidate, Rubio talked constantly about how much he hated his current job. Attacked by Jeb Bush for missing votes, he replied: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen. I have missed votes this year. You know why? Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda, only a president can set the agenda.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t plan to seek a second term after he dropped out of the presidential race, but he changed his mind. And now he\u2019s changed his mind about Congress, too. \u201cYeah, because it's a different Senate,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe got more done in two years than we did in six years. Part of that is a function of being in the majority and having the White House, and part of it is a function of having more experience. \u2026 For the first two or three years of my career, I'd fly up here every week to basically give speeches and write letters because that's all we could do. \u2026 Now we've gotten results, so there's been dignity attached to the work.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio is eager to demonstrate that he\u2019s an ideas guy willing to work across the aisle. He introduced the third most bills and resolutions of any senator last year (57) and signed on as a co-sponsor to an additional 245, more than any other Senate Republican. He co-sponsored a bill last year with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), for instance, that would create an alternative system of accreditation and make it easier to get federal student financial aid for non-college career training programs.\n\n-- But he is not optimistic about working productively with the Democratic-controlled House. \u201cI think in some ways they are captive to some of the same things that some on the right might be, and that is archaic, traditional thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the left has a tendency to say if you don't agree with their idea on paid family leave, their ideas on poverty and their ideas on work, you are indifferent to the suffering of people in those circumstances. I think the right has a tendency to sometimes say the market and only the market takes care of everything. Neither one of those absolutes are true.\u201d\n\n-- One of the conservative scholars who Rubio has been hashing out his new ideas with is Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Olsen argued last year in his book, \u201cThe Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism,\u201d that Reagan has been misappropriated by certain communities on the right. He argues that the 40th president was much less anti-government than popularly remembered. Olsen says, by the time he became the GOP standard bearer, Reagan actually accepted most of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. He also notes that Reagan imposed punitive tariffs on Japanese imports, even while preaching the virtues of free trade.\n\n\u201cWhat happened after President Reagan left the scene was some of the old tensions within the GOP reasserted themselves, and everyone tried to claim support for their side from Reagan,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWhat Sen. Rubio is doing is trying to reorient the Republican Party toward the genuine center of Reaganism. \u2026 The whole idea of Reagan as Mr. Open Borders \u2026 is just not what Reagan was.\u201d\n\n-- Rubio is not up for reelection until 2022 in the nation\u2019s largest swing state. If Trump loses in 2020, he\u2019d be well positioned to run in 2024. Even six years from now, he\u2019ll still only be 53.\n\nHe went out of his way during our interview to stress that any effort to lift the poor will not come at the expense of the middle class or the well to-do. \u201cOur goal is not to take anything away from the people who are succeeding in the new economy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to allow them to continue to succeed while finding ways to allow more Americans who are not benefiting from the new economy to succeed as well. And that can be a difficult endeavor. But that's certainly what I'm going to be focused on for years to come.\u201d\n\n-- Programming note: The Daily 202 will be dark on Thursday and Friday so we can celebrate Thanksgiving.

(Christopher Ingraham)\n\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn looks on as President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Trump said in the spring that he wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and former FBI director Jim Comey. The New York Times\u2019s Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment. The encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how Mr. Trump views the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear whether Mr. Trump read Mr. McGahn\u2019s memo or whether he pursued the prosecutions further. But the president has continued to privately discuss the matter, including the possible appointment of a second special counsel to investigate both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Comey, according to two people who have spoken to Mr. Trump about the issue. He has also repeatedly expressed disappointment in the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, for failing to more aggressively investigate Mrs. Clinton, calling him weak, one of the people said.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cTrump on multiple occasions raised with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then-chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, whether the Justice Department was progressing in investigating Hillary Clinton,\u201d CNN adds. \u201cAnticipating the question about Clinton would be raised, Whitaker came prepared to answer with what Justice was doing on Clinton-related matters, including the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One investigations, the source said. The source added that Whitaker was trying to appease the President, but did not seem to cross any line.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s legal team has submitted answers to a set of questions from special counsel Bob Mueller. Carol D. Leonnig and Robert Costa report: \u201cThe inquiries include only a portion of the questions that Mueller has sought to pose to Trump for nearly a year, when he first requested an interview with the president. The topics cover activities during the campaign and do not delve into questions about whether Trump has sought to obstruct the probe into Russian interference. One of Trump\u2019s attorneys said that his answers will not provide any great surprises. \u2018What I can tell you is they\u2019re complete and detailed,\u2019 Rudolph W. Giuliani said in an interview. \u2018But there\u2019s nothing there I haven\u2019t read in a newspaper.\u2019 ... Mueller now must decide whether to continue to press for an in-person sit-down with Trump about his actions as president \u2014 a move his legal team continues to resist.\u201d\n\nActing attorney general Matt Whitaker visits the White House last Friday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n-- Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker received more than $1.2 million over three years from a conservative nonprofit that reported having no other employees and does not disclose its donors. Robert O'Harrow Jr., Shawn Boburg and Aaron C. Davis report: \u201cThe Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust described itself as a new watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials. For Whitaker, it became a lucrative steppingstone in a swift rise from a modest law practice in Iowa to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job. As FACT\u2019s president, he regularly appeared on radio and television, often to skewer liberals. But FACT\u2019s origins and the source of funding used to pay [Whitaker] remain obscured. An examination of state and federal records, and interviews with those involved, show that the group is part of a national network of nonprofits that often work in concert to amplify conservative messages.\n\n\u201cContrary to its claims in news releases and a tax filing, the group was created under a different name two years before Whitaker\u2019s arrival, according to incorporation and IRS records. At least two of the organizers were involved in another conservative charity using the same address. In its application to the IRS for status as a tax-exempt organization, the organizers reported that the group would study the impact of environmental regulations on businesses, records show. In that incarnation, the group took no action and \u2018only existed on paper,\u2019 one man named in IRS filings as a board member told The Washington Post. Another named in a state filing as a board member said he never agreed to be on the board.\u201d\n\n-- Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosure form showed he collected more than $1,800 in \u201clegal fees\u201d from an invention-marketing company that was shut down amid accusations of fraud. Matt Zapotosky reports: \u201cThe form, which Whitaker first filled out after taking over as [Sessions\u2019s] chief of staff, shows Whitaker drew a salary from [FACT] of $904,000 and collected $1,875 in legal fees from World Patent Marketing. That company is notable because it shut down in May and agreed to pay a settlement of more than $25 million to resolve a [FTC] inquiry into its practices.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cMr. Whitaker also faced new questions on Tuesday about donations to his unsuccessful 2014 campaign for a [Senate] seat in Iowa. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s campaign committee received four donations totaling $8,800 this year, a few months after he joined the Justice Department,\u201d Ken Vogel and Haberman report in the Times. \u201cExecutive branch officials are generally prohibited by a federal law, the Hatch Act, from knowingly soliciting or accepting campaign donations. The four donations to the \u2018Whitaker for U.S. Senate\u2019 committee \u2014 three of $2,600 and one of $1,000 \u2014 came within days of each other at the end of January and the second day of February \u2026 They were the first to be made to the account in just over two years. In addition to the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibition on political activity by most executive branch employees, a separate Justice Department memo restricts political activity by its personnel even further, in the hopes of keeping the agency as far from partisan politics as possible.\u201d\n\n-- While serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, Whitaker gained a reputation for seeking severe sentences for people accused of drug crimes. Michael Kranish reports: \u201c[Raeanna Woody] had two nonviolent drug convictions, for possessing marijuana and delivering 12 grams of methamphetamine. But when she was arrested in a third drug case, she said, [Whitaker\u2019s office] decided to make an example of her. \u2026 Woody was given a choice: spend the rest of her life in jail, or accept a plea-bargain sentence of 21 to 27 years, according to court records. She took the deal. \u2026 [Whitaker\u2019s] office was more likely than all but one other district in the United States to use its authority to impose the harshest sentences on drug offenders, according to a finding by [an] Iowa federal judge, Mark W. Bennett, who it called a \u2018deeply troubling disparity.\u2019\u201d Woody\u2019s sentence was later shortened by Barack Obama.\n\n-- Chuck Schumer has asked Justice\u2019s inspector general to probe Whitaker\u2019s communications with the White House. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cIn a letter to inspector general Michael E. Horowitz, [the Senate minority leader] on Tuesday requested a formal probe into whether there were any \u2018unlawful or improper communications\u2019 between Whitaker and the White House during Whitaker\u2019s service as chief of staff to Trump\u2019s former attorney general \u2026 Schumer said he was concerned that as acting attorney general, Whitaker could improperly disclose \u2018confidential grand jury or investigative information from the Special Counsel investigation or any criminal investigation.\u2019\u201d\n\nTHE HOUSE LEADERSHIP FIGHT:\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership bid appeared to gain strength with words of praise from Barack Obama and an endorsement from a potential challenger. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cOne [development] was Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who left Washington last week planning to take the Thanksgiving holiday to ponder a run against Pelosi for speaker. But her dalliance ended Tuesday. Fudge said she would support Pelosi after the minority leader agreed to make Fudge chairman of a resurrected subcommittee on elections and pledged that \u2018the most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party, black women, will have a seat at the decision-making table.\u2019 \u2026 Pelosi\u2019s opponents continue to insist they have the votes to block her from the speakership when the full House meets Jan. 3. But Fudge\u2019s withdrawal showed that their numbers are dwindling, not growing \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\u201cSpeaking Tuesday in Chicago, Obama hailed Pelosi as \u2018one of the most effective legislative leaders that this country\u2019s ever seen.\u2019 \u2018Nancy is not always the best on a cable show or with a quick sound bite or what have you,\u2019 Obama said. \u2018But her skill, tenacity, toughness, vision, is remarkable. Her stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things and to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done I think stands up against any person that I\u2019ve observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Fudge\u2019s endorsement came the same day that reports emerged about her support for a former state lawmaker now accused of killing his ex-wife. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan reports: \u201cFudge asked for leniency in sentencing for Lance Mason in a 2015 letter after Mason admitted to brutally beating his then-wife, Aisha Fraser. On Saturday, Mason was arrested in connection with Fraser's death. \u2026 In a statement released on Tuesday, Fudge mourned Fraser\u2019s death and said Mason\u2019s actions are not those of the man she once knew.\u201d\n\n-- Some incoming House Democrats fear opposition to Pelosi could cost them seats on their preferred committees. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Annie Grayer report: \u201cRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey is one of the five fresh Democratic faces to sign the letter vowing to support new leadership on the floor. Asked if he were concerned that his position could hurt his chances to win spots on key committees, Van Drew said: \u2018I guess to be totally objective, I'd have to say yes.\u2019 But he added that any concerns about backlash from Pelosi or her allies wouldn't impact his ultimate vote.\u201d\n\n-- Pelosi and her two top deputies \u2014 Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Jim Clyburn (S.C.) \u2014 have banded together against the opposition. From Paul Kane: \u201cThey have overseen great political victories and then clashed in bitter moments of personal enmity, with each angling to take another out of power at one time or another. Those old rivalries have been set aside, not necessarily forgotten, as they try to tamp down a rebellion of junior Democrats clamoring for new leadership.\u201d\n\nKHASHOGGI FALLOUT:\n\n-- Trump declared his support for Saudi Arabia amid international condemnation over the killing of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, prompting rebukes from members of his own party. Josh Dawsey, Shane Harris and Karen DeYoung report: \u201cIn an exclamation-mark-packed statement that aides said he dictated himself, Trump said that U.S. intelligence would continue to \u2018assess\u2019 information but that the United States \u2018may never know all the facts surrounding the murder.\u2019 Speaking of whether the crown prince knew about or ordered the killing by Saudi agents last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Trump said \u2018maybe he did or maybe he didn\u2019t!\u2019 But the president indicated that U.S. interests in Saudi oil production, weapons purchases and support for administration policies in the Middle East were more important than holding an ally to account, and he stressed the importance of staying in the kingdom\u2019s good graces.\n\n\u201c[Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, must decide whether to use the handful of days left in the legislative term to consider a bipartisan bill, introduced last week, to stop virtually all U.S. weapons sales and military assistance to the Saudis in response to both the war in Yemen and Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u2026 Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant, co-sponsored the Senate bill and said in a statement that he believed there would be \u2018strong bipartisan support for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia, including appropriate members of the royal family, for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms ... I fully realize we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage. However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Graham suggested it may be hard for Congress to pass a government funding bill to avert a shutdown without somehow including sanctions for Saudi Arabia. Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger report: \u201cCongressional leaders have not weighed in on the likelihood that the sanctions bill will be added to the federal funding extension, due by Dec. 7. It is unlikely that lawmakers will be able to find enough time on the floor to put such a bill to a separate vote, with only weeks left until lawmakers depart Washington. In the House, Democratic leaders have already promised to take up the issue of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and the fate of Yemen, as part of their agenda when they assume the majority in the chamber next year.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s emphasis on Saudi arms sales has thrown an unwelcome spotlight on U.S. weapons manufacturers. Aaron Gregg and Christian Davenport report: \u201cTrump named specific U.S. defense contractors as beneficiaries of a $110 billion arms deal that followed his highly public visit to the kingdom last year. \u2026 It was not the first time the president has brought up arms sales in the context of Khashoggi\u2019s killing. \u2026 Those presidential mentions have been met with consternation across the defense industry, with representatives from prominent manufacturers and trade associations preferring to stay silent. In a little over a month, Saudi business has been transformed from a badge of honor to an untouchable conversation-stopper for U.S. defense contractors.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s statement again demonstrated his transactional approach to foreign policy. From Anne Gearan: \u201cNearly two years into his presidency, Trump is unswerving in his instinct to make everything \u2014 from trade to terrorism, from climate change to human rights \u2014 about what he sees as the bottom line. \u2026 The nothing-to-see-here tone, the fractured syntax and falsehoods, and the abundance of exclamation points were pure Trump \u2014 and as far from the massaged, nuanced products of past White Houses as one could imagine.\u201d\n\n-- The reality in Saudi Arabia: Jailed women\u2019s rights activists have been subjected to psychological or physical abuse while in custody. Kareem Fahim reports: \u201cSome of the abuse occurred during interrogations in which several of the women were administered electric shocks or flogged, two [sources] said, citing a witness account. Other women displayed what witnesses said were apparent signs of abuse, including uncontrollable shaking or difficulty standing, the people said.\u201d\n\n-- The Post\u2019s Editorial Board writes that Trump\u2019s statement \u201cbetrayed American values in service to what already was a bad bet on the 33-year-old prince\u201d: \u201cAs with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump is justifying his affinity for a brutal and reckless leader by disregarding the findings of the U.S. intelligence community. \u2026 Worst of all, Mr. Trump libels Mr. Khashoggi, saying that \u2018representatives of Saudi Arabia\u2019 had called him an \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The crown prince did make those allegations in a phone call to the White House \u2014 but the regime itself was so embarrassed when The Post reported on the call that it denied making them.\u201d\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN AND WOMEN:\n\n-- Congressional Democrats and Republicans said they would investigate Ivanka Trump\u2019s use of a personal email account to conduct government business. Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report: \u201cHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) announced their intention to investigate, in letters to White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and acting White House counsel Emmet Flood. They demanded a full account of exactly how many emails Trump sent and received, on what subjects, and whether she had preserved them in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. They also asked whether Trump had received training related to the use of private emails \u2014 a sign that GOP leaders do not accept her explanation that she was unfamiliar with the rules prohibiting the use of a personal account. \u2026 Their new letters to the administration were released amid a furor from congressional Democrats, who vowed to take up the investigation next year \u2014 but stir less partisan rancor than the GOP did in its probe of Clinton.\u201d\n\n-- After spending significant time focusing on Clinton\u2019s email controversy in 2016, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d covered the similar allegations against Ivanka Trump in a segment lasting 25 seconds. (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.)\n\n-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke gave no indication he might leave his job as the ethics investigations involving him continue to attract headlines. Lisa Rein and Juliet Eilperin report: \u201cAs federal investigators examine his real estate dealings [in his hometown of Whitefish, Mont.] \u2014 and other aspects of his conduct \u2014 Zinke is dismissing rumors of his departure and plunging into the public debate over forest management. [Trump] has said several times that he intends to \u2018review\u2019 multiple ethics investigations against the secretary \u2026 in deciding whether to keep him on as he shakes up his Cabinet. But in recent days, Zinke has derided the scrutiny as \u2018fake news\u2019 and vowed to stay in his job to advance the president\u2019s pro-industry agenda, saying the president backs him \u2018100 percent.\u2019\u201d [That's what Scott Pruitt said too \u2014 right up until the day he was pushed out.]\n\n-- Some top Justice officials loyal to ex-AG Sessions are considering leaving their posts. Politico\u2019s Gabby Orr reports: \u201cAccording to more than a half-dozen former and current administration officials, at least four top officials \u2014 mostly Sessions loyalists \u2014 have either quit or are eyeing the exit \u2026 Among those leaving are Danielle Cutrona, a senior counsel to Sessions who had been with him since his Senate days. She departed DOJ last Friday. Rachael Tucker, a senior counselor to the attorney general, could also exit \u2018in the next couple of months,\u2019 citing her fidelity to Sessions, or possibly take another job within the agency, said two sources \u2026 Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeff Wood, another former Sessions Senate staffer, may also soon make an exit.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon signed on to a $100 million effort to investigate alleged abuses of power by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Cezary Podkul and Brian Spegele report: \u201cMr. Bannon unveiled the effort in a lengthy press conference Tuesday alongside exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, who said he would provide the funding for the so-called \u2018Rule of Law Fund\u2019 to investigate deaths and disappearances of Chinese executives, politicians and other public figures. \u2026 Both men said the Trump administration wasn\u2019t involved in the effort.\u201d\n\nCentral American migrants, part of the caravan trying to reach the United States, continue their journey as they prepare to leave Mexicali, Mexico. (Rodrigo Abd/AP)\n\nTHE REST OF THE AGENDA:\n\n-- Trump lashed out against the federal judge who blocked his attempt to deny asylum to migrants apprehended at the southern border. Maria Sacchetti and Sarah Kinosian report: \u201c\u2018This was an Obama judge and I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not going to happen like this anymore,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018We will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 \u2026 The administration expressed confidence the asylum policy will ultimately prevail in court, in part because it relies on the same presidential authority Trump asserted in a modified travel ban \u2014 barring specific travelers mainly from majority-Muslim nations \u2014 that the Supreme Court narrowly upheld in June.\u201d\n\n-- Lawmakers from both parties are digging in on their demands for the government funding bill. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett reports: \u201cTrump is pressuring Republicans to obtain at least $5 billion for his border wall, far more than what Senate Democrats are prepared to give. Democrats in turn are considering pushes for legislation to protect [Mueller] and the elimination of a citizenship question from the next census, according to people familiar with the negotiations. Meanwhile House Democrats are embroiled in a divisive leadership fight, limiting the energy that Nancy Pelosi can devote to the year-end spending negotiations. And House Republicans, set to enter the minority in just a month and a half, recognize this is their last chance to get a down payment for Trump\u2019s wall before entering legislative obscurity.\u201d\n\n-- The Education Department abandoned a policy allowing it to dismiss hundreds of civil rights complaints en masse. Laura Meckler reports: \u201cIn March, the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights updated its Case Processing Manual and said it would dismiss a complaint if it was part of a pattern of allegations, or if the complaint placed an \u2018unreasonable burden\u2019 on the office. That prompted a lawsuit from three civil rights groups alleging the policy had wrongfully cut off a critical avenue for students who believe their right to an education was being blocked. The suit is pending. On Tuesday, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights, Kenneth L. Marcus, released a revision to the Case Processing Manual, with that provision deleted.\u201d\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her move to overhaul Obama-era guidelines on how universities handle sexual misconduct allegations. She writes in a Post op-ed: \u201cAmerica\u2019s students deserve to attend school focused on learning, with nothing limiting them from reaching their unique potential and preparing to lead successful lives. No student should have their education unfairly derailed. That\u2019s why there must be no tolerance for sexual harassment or assault in America\u2019s schools \u2014 or anywhere else in the country, for that matter. And there should also be no tolerance for adjudicating these matters in a way that denies to any person access to the core principles that underpin our justice system, such as due process.\u201d\n\n-- Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is leaning on Mitch McConnell to get a vote on the chamber\u2019s bipartisan criminal justice bill. The New York Times\u2019s Nicholas Fandos reports: \u201c[O]n Monday morning, [Grassley] joined a private phone call with [McConnell] to discuss [the bill]. I have been there for you, Mr. Grassley told Mr. McConnell, the man standing in the way of a quick vote on the measure. And I would hope this is something that you would help me make happen, he said, according to three people familiar with the call \u2026 The direct lobbying by Mr. Grassley was just part of a pressure campaign aimed squarely at Mr. McConnell this week as an unusual coalition of senators, conservative advocacy groups and White House officials press to change the nation\u2019s sentencing and prison laws.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration reinstated Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid work requirements after they were blocked by a federal court. Amy Goldstein reports: \u201cFederal health officials announced Tuesday night that they had, for a second time, approved Kentucky\u2019s plan to impose \u2018community engagement\u2019 requirements as part of Medicaid, saying they could start in April, nine months after they originally were to have taken effect.\u201d\n\n-- The VA\u2019s inspector general found the agency mishandled hundreds of health claims from veterans with ALS. Lisa Rein reports: \u201cVA Inspector General Michael Missal ... found that dozens of veterans suffering from ALS were deprived of financial support because staff mishandled their benefits claims. Officials with the inspector general\u2019s office are concerned that the Veterans Benefits Administration, under pressure from Congress and veterans service organizations to reduce an enormous backlog of compensation claims and appeals, may be cutting corners. Of 960 claims that were examined by Missal\u2019s office, 430 contained errors. Of those, 230 claimants were awarded the wrong benefits, the inspector general\u2019s report says. Most received no money or were underpaid.\u201d\n\n-- Senior lawmakers are considering a taxpayer-funded bailout for certain failing pension plans. Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report: \u201cA draft of the plan, obtained by The Washington Post, would direct the Treasury Department to spend up to $3 billion annually to subsidize payments for retirees from certain underfunded pensions. It would also require benefit cuts, higher premiums and new fees levied against companies and union members in an attempt to make the pensions as financially solvent as possible. \u2026 The plan using taxpayer money is one of multiple proposals being considered by a special congressional committee tasked with addressing the pension crisis.\u201d\n\nGOP Rep. Mia Love greets supporters during an election night party in Lehi, Utah. (Rick Bowmer/AP)\n\nMIDTERMS FALLOUT:\n\n-- GOP Rep. Mia Love has officially lost her Utah congressional race against Democrat Ben McAdams. Elise Viebeck and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201c[Love] was defeated by [McAdams] by 694 votes in the toss-up race. McAdams currently serves as the mayor of Salt Lake County and was previously a member of the Utah Senate. \u2026 Love, who first won election in 2014, had initially trailed McAdams by 6,700 votes in the days after the election. She significantly narrowed the gap as more ballots continued to be counted \u2026 Love is the only black female Republican in Congress, and her loss underscored the increasing homogeneity of the party\u2019s lawmakers, particularly in the House.\u201d\n\n-- At least three companies, including Walmart, have asked for the return of their donations to Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) after her \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comment. Rachel Siegel reports: \u201cWalmart on Tuesday joined Boston Scientific, the medical devices manufacturer, and the railroad franchise Union Pacific in asking for the return of campaign donations they made to [Hyde-Smith] of Mississippi. \u2026 Each of the companies says the donations were made before they became aware of Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment, which was spoken in a state with one the nation\u2019s most shameful records of lynching. \u2026 In a statement Tuesday, [Democrat Mike Espy\u2019s] campaign said it was confident that \u2018voters will follow Walmart\u2019s lead.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- In a debate last night, Hyde-Smith attempted to blame Espy for the controversy over her comment, which he said has given Mississippi \u201canother black eye.\u201d Matt Viser reports: \u201c\u2018You know, for anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements,\u2019 the GOP senator said. \u2026 But targeting Espy, she added that \u2018this comment was twisted, was turned into a weapon to be used against me, a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That\u2019s the type of politics that Mississippians are sick and tired of.\u2019 Espy responded by tossing the charge back at Hyde-Smith and noting that some prominent supporters had distanced themselves from her. \u2018Well, no one twisted your comments because your comments were live \u2014 you know, they came out of your mouth,\u2019 Espy said. \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The enthusiasm spurred by Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate bid appears to have helped trigger a mini-blue wave in Texas\u2019s most populous county. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dan Frosch reports: \u201cNearly every Republican in Harris County, home to Houston, was unseated on Nov. 6, including 59 judges and the top executive, Ed Emmett, a moderate who won in 2014 with 83% of the vote. Mr. Emmett, whose official title is county judge and who was widely lauded for steering the county through the devastation of Hurricane Harvey last year, lost to political novice Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat who said she has never previously attended a meeting of the Harris County Commissioners Court, which she will soon oversee.\u201d Many Republicans blamed Emmett\u2019s loss on \u201cstraight-ticket\u201d voting, allowing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters to vote for all listed Democrats with a single click.\n\n-- During the midterms, the Democratic group Priorities USA experimented with new ways to capitalize on digital advertising. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cIn addition to spending about $50 million on digital ads this cycle, the group ran experiments behind the scenes to create a new playbook for liberal groups as they rush to catch up with GOP advantages online. \u2026 Without public notice, Priorities ran tests on Facebook\u2019s secret algorithms to try to decode how long an ad could run before its frequency was diminished in news feeds. It created a dashboard so other liberal groups could legally coordinate their ad purchases with minimal overlap. And it ran extensive testing on the types of advertising that worked best, often discovering that what staff believed would work did not.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThis 2014 photo of Cindy Hyde-Smith made the rounds online:\n\nThere\u2019s a Facebook photo of Cindy Hyde-Smith posing in a Confederate hat at the home of Jefferson Davis.

What Path Officials Took Is a Mystery,\u201d by ProPublica's A.C. Thompson: \u201cThere were some obvious clues that this was no ordinary double homicide. \u2026 [One suspect], Devon Arthurs, 18, said the victims were his roommates, and members of a neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen Division. Arthurs said that he\u2019d decided to leave the group, and that he\u2019d killed the men to keep them from carrying out what he said were their plans for violence. \u2026 To this day, it is unclear if the FBI talked with Arthurs or what steps it took to shut down Atomwaffen. \u2026 But this much is clear: Within months of Arthurs\u2019 warnings, Atomwaffen members or associates had killed three more people. \u2026 Some experts and former officials see the case as part of a larger pattern, evidence that federal agencies are understaffed and out of position in confronting the threat of white supremacist terrorism even as the FBI\u2019s latest report shows a spike in hate crimes for the third straight year.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cOn the California Wildfire Missing List, Name After Name After Name,\u201d by the New York Times's Simon Romero, Jose A.

(Matt Bell/Associated Press)\n\nIt\u2019s Virginia week for the Virginia Tech football team, and in case anyone needed a reminder, Hokies offensive lineman Kyle Chung had a message emblazoned across the front of his T-shirt the other day.\n\nThe redshirt senior offered no apologies for offending any Cavaliers players.\n\n\u201c4,382 days\u201d the shirt read, along with an image of the Commonwealth Cup, the hardware on the line for the annual showdown between the bitter rivals set to kick off for the 100th time Friday afternoon at Lane Stadium.\n\nChung said he received the shirt last year after the Hokies beat Virginia, with the number representing how long the trophy had resided in Blacksburg, Va. Virginia Tech has won 14 straight against its archrival, the longest winning steak by either side in series history.\n\n\u201cThis rivalry means everything to us,\u201d said right guard Braxton Pfaff, a redshirt senior. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason it\u2019s the last game of the season. Being able to win that and have bragging rights for next year, and especially with the streak that\u2019s been built up, there\u2019s just so much riding on it.\u201d\n\n[The nation\u2019s top running back recruit is changing positions. \u2018Smart guy,\u2019 says Adrian Peterson.]\n\nUnderscoring the significance of the rivalry, Virginia Tech players, particularly those suiting up for their final game against the Cavaliers, barely addressed the other streak at stake. The Hokies (4-6, 3-4 ACC) need a win against Virginia to keep alive their chances of a 26th straight bowl berth.\n\nIt\u2019s the longest official active streak the NCAA recognizes after Florida State vacated its appearance in the 2006 Emerald Bowl because of NCAA violations.\n\n\u201cWe know how important this is,\u201d Hokies quarterback Ryan Willis said. \u201cBeating U-Va. is something we have to do year in and year out. It\u2019s expected. I want to win more than anything in the world. I think all of our guys do. I think everyone is buying in this week, and we\u2019re going to put the best product on the field.\u201d\n\nA triumph Friday would allow Virginia Tech to play a makeup game Dec. 1 against Marshall. The youthful Hokies had a game against visiting East Carolina scheduled for Sept. 15 canceled when the Pirates decided they were not going to travel because of Hurricane Florence, citing safety issues.\n\nShould Virginia Tech lose Friday, it will not play Marshall and its season will end with its fewest wins since going 2-8-1 in 1992 during the sixth year under legendary coach and program architect Frank Beamer.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s the most important game of the year,\u201d Hokies senior defensive tackle Ricky Walker said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like playing against those guys up the road. No matter what, they always think they\u2019re better than us, and we just keep on winning and just dominating.\"\n\nWinning again on Friday is the Hokies' best hope of salvaging what has been a disastrous season.\n\nVirginia Tech has lost four straight games, allowing 42.5 points per game and 6.89 yards per rushing attempt during that stretch. Pittsburgh rushed for 492 yards in a 52-22 rout on Nov. 10, and Georgia Tech gained 465 on the ground while attempting only one pass on the way to winning 49-28 on Oct. 25.\n\nThe Hokies rank fourth to last in the ACC in total defense (436.6 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (31.7 points allowed per game), both statistical anomalies in what\u2019s traditionally been among the stoutest defenses in major college football.\n\nLast season the Hokies finished fourth nationally in both categories. One major reason is roster turnover, which Walker referred to in talking about the rivalry with Virginia.\n\n\u201cMost guys really don\u2019t know about this game, you know? Maybe they saw it on TV last year, or they redshirted, and they didn\u2019t play. It\u2019s going to be tough. It\u2019s going to be a great battle.\u201d\n\nAmong the projected Virginia Tech defensive starters heading into Friday, eight are freshmen or sophomores. Graduation, transfers, dismissals for disciplinary reasons and injury have combined to leave longtime Hokies defensive coordinator Bud Foster with one of his least experienced groups.\n\nEarly in the week, for instance, linebacker Rico Kearney announced he would be transferring. Wide receiver Sean Savoy (Wilson High School) also indicated via social media he would be doing the same, adding a potential distraction within the locker room.\n\nKearney had 18 tackles, the most for a Hokies player in one game since 2003, while filling in at middle linebacker for starter Rayshard Ashby against Boston College Nov. 3 in a 31-21 loss. The defense, though, had been struggling even with the redshirt freshman in the lineup.\n\nThe daunting task against Virginia (7-4, 4-3) will be figuring out how to slow quarterback Bryce Perkins, who is within reach of several school single-season offensive records but hurt his left ankle during last Saturday\u2019s 30-27 overtime loss to Georgia Tech.\n\n\u201cObviously you\u2019ve got to take care of the first one to get to the next one, and that\u2019s always how it\u2019s been through the course of this series and our bowl streak,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been in our way as far as our opportunity to extend our season, whether it\u2019s championship game and that type of thing.\n\n\u201cThis it the first time we\u2019ve been in this situation in a long, long time that we\u2019ve had to win this game to extend our season, so obviously this game is extremely, extremely important, more so than probably the [bowl] streak because this game will continue the streak if we take care of business.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCollege Football Playoff rankings: UCF\u2019s ascent livens up an otherwise stagnant upper tier\n\nThe four key questions that could decide the College Football Playoff field\n\nArkansas football players suspended after reportedly flirting with opponent\u2019s cheerleaders\n\nLes Miles resumes his career at Kansas, the land college football forgot\n\nJohn Feinstein: The Flacco brothers have a lot in common.

(Tim Ireland/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Just like the politicians, English soccer is divided by Brexit.\n\nWith four months until Britain withdraws from the European Union and no consensus over the terms of the split from the bloc, there is also uncertainty about the players Premier League clubs will be able to recruit.\n\nWith free movement of people from the European single market to work in Britain set to end, players from the continent could become subject to the same soccer-specific immigration requirements as counterparts from the rest of the world.\n\nAfter a quarter-century of growth, the Premier League sees maintaining the free-flowing pipeline of talent from Europe into its clubs as essential for maintaining the appeal of the competition worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d West Ham co-owner David Gold said. \u201cWhy would you change it?\u201d\n\nBut the English Football Association is seizing on Brexit to try to ensure players eligible for its national team gain more playing time in the Premier League and build on the semifinal run at this year\u2019s World Cup in Russia.\n\nCurrently, the FA runs the visa system for non-European players in conjunction with the government\u2019s Home Office. Unless a deal is reached between the FA and the Premier League, those eligibility requirements could apply to any foreign player after Brexit in March.\n\nPlayers from the top 50 FIFA nations are considered for work permits, with a sliding scale of appearances required \u2014 from 30 percent of games over two years for the 1-10 teams to 75 percent for 31-50 teams. According to FA research seen by The Associated Press, 65 percent of Europeans currently playing in the Premier League would have failed if the criteria were applied to them.\n\nBut for players who don\u2019t meet the threshold, clubs can seek an exemption by arguing the case for a work permit in front of a panel. The FA hopes to persuade the Premier League to scrap that system, known as the governing body eligibility endorsement.\n\nUnder the FA\u2019s post-Brexit proposals, Premier League clubs would be allowed to sign whoever they want from abroad but only be allowed 13 non-homegrown players in the squad. That number is an average based on the 262 non-homegrown players currently in the 20 teams.\n\n\u201cBrexit should not be used to weaken playing squads in British football, nor to harm clubs\u2019 ability to sign international players,\u201d the Premier League said in a statement.\n\nMost of the 20 teams do not currently use their full quota of 17 non-homegrown players, a status which means they have not been affiliated to an English or Welsh club for three complete seasons or 36 months before their 21st birthday.\n\nAccording to the FA\u2019s research, which was presented to Premier League clubs last week, restricting them to 13 homegrown players last season would have affected only 42 player appearances out of more than 10,000. Only 24 were starts. From Premier League champion Manchester City, only backup goalkeeper Claudio Bravo would have missed out on his three appearances.\n\nThe FA calls this a \u201cpragmatic\u201d solution: Clubs could still sign whoever they want from Europe, but the freedom over recruitment is extended worldwide, as long as they abide by new squad limits.\n\n\u201cThe FA believes increasing access, but preventing an increase in current numbers of overseas players, would benefit all of English football,\u201d the governing body said in a statement.\n\nThe limited opportunities for English talent at home were underscored when Jadon Sancho left Man City last year for Borussia Dortmund in Germany. The 18-year-old winger has since won the Under-17 World Cup and gained regular top-flight experience that saw him fast-tracked into Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior England side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful he\u2019s seen my progress in the Bundesliga,\u201d Sancho said. \u201cMy focus was getting minutes as a player and playing first-team football, which is what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nFA chief executive Martin Glenn pitched his plans at a meeting of clubs last week but the Premier League remains unconvinced that stronger quotas will have a positive impact on the national team.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence so to speak to support his proposal,\u201d said Gold, whose West Ham squad features 16 non-homegrown players. \u201cWe are very supportive of English football. We want it to be successful. But we don\u2019t want to be doing things that isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nThe FA leadership can\u2019t even rely on Southgate for support, despite less than a third of the players featuring in the Premier League before the international break being English.\n\n\u201cMost of the data I have seen suggests quotas on squads would not make a difference because you could still field a team outside the base of British players,\u201d Southgate said.\n\nLawyers have questioned the merits of the FA\u2019s quotas proposal.\n\n\u201c(It) is completely at odds with the rest of the immigration system which requires employers to only sponsor workers at certain salary levels and to have academic qualifications or skills,\u201d said Andrew Osborne, head of immigration at London-based law firm Lewis Silkin. \u201cNon-football employers do not have freedom to recruit who they want subject to a numerical limit.\u201d\n\nPremier League clubs, like European counterparts, are currently allowed to transfer 16- and 17-year-old players between countries in the region under an exemption from FIFA regulations. But after Brexit, British clubs will only be allowed to sign foreign players over the age of 18, like the rest of the world. Manchester United, a record 20-time English champion, fears European rivals will be handed a competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cIf you have 16-year-olds going to play for them and if we have to wait until 18 there are clearly practical issues there,\u201d United chief financial officer Cliff Baty has said.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore endorsed the campaign to remain in the EU ahead of the 2016 referendum. That reflected the competition\u2019s focus is maintaining the allure to domestic fans and the global television audience, with broadcast rights generating more than $3 billion per season.\n\n\u201cAccess to talented footballers from across Europe has played a key part in the growth of the Premier League, with match attendance and global interest increasing significantly as high quality foreign players have taken their place in the competition with and against the best British and Irish players,\u201d the league said.\n\nThe government, which wants to end preferential immigration access for workers from the EU, uses the power of the Premier League to project soft power and promote British culture internationally.\n\n\u201cWe have held positive discussions with government about the importance of access to European players for our clubs,\u201d the league said, \u201cand the many cultural and economic benefits a globally popular Premier League brings to the U.K.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But an error of logic has seeped into the coverage of this alleged doctrine and the bearing it has on the Khashoggi killing \u2014 and many other matters, as well.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle error, but a serious one.\n\nIn the media discussion of Trump\u2019s response to the murder, you often see variations of the claim that Trump has revealed an unpleasant, unstated truth about his worldview \u2014 that Trump will put America first even if it requires sanctioning the most reprehensible conduct, or doing things that are necessary even if people find them deeply unsettling.\n\nThe lead story on Trump\u2019s response in the New York Times, for instance, describes it as \u201ca stark distillation of the Trump worldview,\u201d which is \u201cheedless of the facts\u201d (correct!), but also \u201cremorselessly transactional\u201d and \u201cdetermined to put America\u2019s interests first.\u201d A Post piece claims Trump is prioritizing America\u2019s \u201cbottom line.\u201d A CNN analysis notes that \u201cAmerica first\u201d means Trump will look the other way \u201cas long as a foreign power enriches the United States,\u201d adding: \u201cPerhaps Trump should get marks for frankness.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion here is that we are now seeing what \u201cAmerica first\u201d really looks like. That is, when Trump says \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he means it.\n\nBut this concedes too much. In an inadvertent but pernicious way, it supports Trump\u2019s preferred framing of his presidency. In this case and many others, Trump is not being \u201cfrank\u201d about his real priorities, and he is not putting America first. He\u2019s putting his own naked self-interest over what\u2019s good for America, and prioritizing the real-world policy realization of his own prejudices and hatreds over any good-faith, fact-based effort to determine, by any discernible standard, what might actually be in the country\u2019s interests.\n\nTrump\u2019s idea of a \u2018dangerous\u2019 world\n\nTrump\u2019s core claim that we must overlook the killing to maintain our current relationship with the Saudis, and that this is good for us, is itself mostly nonsense. As a Post editorial points out, the failure to sanction those responsible for the murder \u2014 including the Saudi kingdom, per the conclusion of the CIA \u2014 buttresses a world in which \u201cdictators know they can murder their critics and suffer no consequences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s response to this notion is the idea that \u201cthe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d and that he will pursue our \u201cnational interests\u201d in this dangerous world. But Trump\u2019s statement on the killing relies on falsehoods to depict maintaining our relationship with the Saudis as in our \u201cnational interests.\u201d As we\u2019ve noted:\n\nThe Saudis did not agree to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States, a number Trump seems to have just made up; they did not order $110 billion in military equipment; and they will not be creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to take this further and point out that here Trump is not actually operating from any meaningful conception of what is good for the country. It isn\u2019t just those lies. It\u2019s also Trump\u2019s insistence that we\u2019ll never know whether the crown prince actually ordered the killing, which breaks from the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion, and the subtle slandering of Khashoggi via the floating of the Saudi claim that he was an \u201cenemy of the state.\u201d\n\nI challenge you to read those things as driven by any conception of what\u2019s good for America. They are arguably damaging to the country, since they weaken faith in efforts to determine the truth, and could further distress Americans who are deeply upset by the murder. But what\u2019s undoubtedly true is that they can only be about making Trump\u2019s current stance politically easier for himself.\n\nThe bigger idea at stake here in Trump\u2019s response is the notion that our commitment to international standards of human rights are to be jettisoned when they get in the way of our \u201cinterests.\u201d It\u2019s true that the United States has a long history of turning a blind eye to Saudi human rights abuses. But this does not preclude responding to this particular atrocity, and merely claiming Trump is revealing \u201cthe truth\u201d about our previous realpolitik does not justify the current absence of any response.\n\nMore to the point, Trump is not merely acquiescing to this unfortunate \u201ctruth.\u201d He\u2019s actively weakening our commitment to human (and civil) rights on many other fronts as well, both at home and abroad.\n\nThe idea that adherence to international standards on human rights \u2014 but also international commitments on other matters, such as fighting climate change and taking in asylum seekers and refugees \u2014 is a zero-sum negative for America is of course supposed to be foundational to Trump\u2019s worldview. But the administration has never actually defended this proposition on any of these fronts in a fact-based manner.\n\nLies, lies and more lies\n\nThis is most glaringly true on asylum seekers and refugees. Limiting their entry is also foundational to \u201cAmerica first\u201d Trumpism. But Trump has not merely tried to reduce asylum seeking; he has justified this with all manner of lies about the supposed threat it poses to us. Trump has not just slashed refugee levels to historic lows and employed bureaucratic chicanery to reduce those levels further. His administration deep-sixed internal data showing them to be a net economic positive.\n\nThe point here, again, is that Trump is placing his prejudices \u2014 his determination to implement a white nationalist agenda \u2014 over any good-faith effort to determine what the actual impact of this agenda will be on the country. On the migrants, the self-interest runs even deeper than this. The lies about the \u201ccaravan\u201d were all about keeping the House in GOP hands \u2014 he even used the military as a prop in this exercise \u2014 to prevent Democrats from taking the House and subjecting him to accountability.\n\nOther aspects of Trump\u2019s white nationalism underscore the point. Trump\u2019s \u201cmany sides\u201d comment after Charlottesville, which emboldened white nationalists rather than calming racial tensions; his pardoning of racist Joe Arpaio; his attacks on African American athletes \u2014 Trump reportedly believed these things would help him politically, never mind that they stoked civil conflict that harmed the country. Over and over, Trump\u2019s prejudice and naked self-interest trump (as it were) any conception of the national interest.\n\nNeed more? The New York Times reports that Trump privately wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. There is no possible way this is based on any conception of the national good, unless Trump is totally delusional, which would itself mean there\u2019s no such operative conception here. Everyone knows Trump appointed Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general not because of Whitaker\u2019s qualifications, but for the sole purpose of protecting himself from the special counsel.\n\nThere is no big and unpleasant truth at the core of Trump\u2019s vision of what\u2019s good for the country. That vision is largely a void filled with unchecked self interest, both disguised and sustained by lies."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The fantasy football players you need in your Week 12 lineup - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The fantasy football players you need in your Week 12 lineup Washington Post Tuesday was a really fun day on Twitter.

As always, we start with the mismatch of the week. Good luck in Week 12.\n\nMismatch of the week\n\nJosh Adams, RB, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nA week ago, I really wanted to write up Peyton Barber as one of the best situations of the week, but I held off because \u2026 well, it\u2019s Peyton Barber. But he was facing a Giants run defense that has gone in the tank since trading Damon Harrison, and I almost did it. Barber went on to run for a career-high 106 yards. The Giants allowed 3.95 yards per carry before the trade, and that number has ballooned to 5.27 since, with Adrian Peterson, Matt Breida and Barber all having huge games.\n\n[Week 12 fantasy football player rankings]\n\nAs for Adams, he\u2019s forced his way ahead of Corey Clement and Wendell Smallwood in the Philadelphia backfield \u2014 he played 28 snaps and had 7 carries in Week 11, with the other two combining for 18 and 3, respectively. He leads the team in rushing grade (82.3; no one else healthy over 61.4), yards per attempt (6.1; no one over 4.1), and yards after contact per attempt (3.06; no one else healthy over 2.63). His workload will only climb.\n\nGood situations\n\nJameis Winston, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nOkay, there is of course always the chance Winston comes out and has one of those games like we\u2019ve seen multiple times this year and Ryan Fitzpatrick replaces him again and this all goes to hell. But there appears to be just as healthy a chance that he has a monster game. As Adam Harstad has been chronicling on Twitter, in every game this season, Tampa Bay\u2019s starting quarterback has produced either:\n\n\u00b7 360 passing yards;\n\n\u00b7 4 passing touchdowns; or\n\n\u00b7 Been benched in the second half\n\nThis is an elite offense with wildly inconsistent quarterbacks. Against San Francisco in Week 12, the best bet is the \u201celite\u201d wins out and Winston is an easy top-10 quarterback.\n\nMarlon Mack, RB, Indianapolis Colts\n\nAfter two straight monster games in Weeks 7 and 8, Mack has been relatively quiet since the Colts\u2019 bye \u2014 he had 308 yards and four touchdowns in Weeks 7-8 combined, but only 107 yards and one score in Weeks 10-11. But I\u2019m not anywhere close to the panic button. Mack is still dominating the work out of the backfield for the Colts, with nearly two-thirds the running back snaps and opportunities and almost double the red-zone work of Nyheim Hines and Jordan Wilkins combined. Even as it\u2019s been slow, he had more snaps the last two weeks than the other two combined. The Colts play a Dolphins team in Week 4 that allows the fourth-most points per game to opposing running backs. Mack\u2019s a low-end RB1.\n\nSterling Shepard, WR, New York Giants\n\nThe focus this week is going to be on Odell Beckham Jr. (my overall WR1 in a loaded week for receivers), but save some love for Shepard as well. The third-year receiver gets the same abysmal Philadelphia secondary as Beckham and won\u2019t even draw whoever they decide is their best cover corner. Pour one out for the defending Super Bowl champions, who likely will enter Week 12 with no healthy cornerback who was even on the roster in mid-October. Chandon Sullivan, De\u2019Vante Busby and Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc will fill the secondary. Their names, respectively, sound like a prep school lacrosse player, a character from a third-tier animated movie and a cheap champagne. That means Beckham, Shepard and whatever other receivers the Giants run out there have every opportunity to have a monster day.\n\nJordan Reed, TE, Washington\n\nYou want to say the loss of Alex Smith hurts Reed, but \u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t doing anything with Smith, so how could it really hurt him? In nine games and most of a 10th this season with Smith at quarterback, Reed had all of zero end zone targets. That ended on Colt McCoy\u2019s first pass attempt taking over, hitting Reed in the end zone for a touchdown Sunday. All that talent that made Reed so enticing is still there, and if McCoy gives him looks deep like Smith didn\u2019t, his potential rises right back up.\n\nBad situations\n\nCam Newton, QB, Carolina Panthers\n\nNewton draws a Seattle defense in Week 12 that hasn\u2019t allowed a quarterback to throw more than two passing touchdowns since Week 1 and hasn\u2019t given up more than 21.6 fantasy points to the position in a game all year. But not to fear, Newton\u2019s rushing will make up for it, right? Well, over the past two weeks combined, Newton has four carries for 12 yards. He\u2019s on pace for his fourth-worst career average carries per game and his lowest average rushing yards per game. Newton\u2019s still a QB1, but if he\u2019s not going to rush as much, he falls from \u201cin the conversation to be QB1 overall\u201d to \u201cmid- to low-tier QB1.\u201d\n\nAaron Jones, RB, Green Bay Packers\n\nOnly two running backs (Alvin Kamara and David Johnson) have scored a rushing touchdown against the Vikings this season. Only one team\u2019s running backs have topped 100 rushing yards against them, and that was the ridiculous Kamara/Mark Ingram pairing. Just last week, with the Bears leading the whole game, Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen combined for 90 rushing yards on 25 carries, a cool 3.6 per carry. The way to beat the Vikings is with your secondary pass-catchers (after Xavier Rhodes shuts down your No. 1), not with the running game.\n\nAllen Robinson, WR, Chicago Bears\n\nSpeaking of those Bears, and speaking of shutting down a No. 1 pass-catcher, it was Anthony Miller, not Robinson, who caught the touchdown pass for Chicago in Week 11, with Robinson covered by Rhodes. Robinson feasted against Detroit (Chicago\u2019s Week 12 opponent) two weeks ago, yes, but that was without Darius Slay in the lineup. Slay returned in Week 11 and held Devin Funchess to 39 receiving yards. There will be people who see what Robinson did against Detroit two weeks ago and fire him up in DFS. Don\u2019t be one of them.\n\nKyle Rudolph, TE, Minnesota Vikings\n\nRudolph remains one of the league\u2019s big-name tight ends, based on the last two years. And in 2016, he was genuinely worth that, with 120 targets and 840 yards. But when Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs really broke out in 2017 (they were good in 2016, but hit a new level after that), Rudolph\u2019s opportunities fell off \u2014 his targets dropped by more than a third, down to 76, but it was easy to overlook because he scored a hard-to-sustain 8 touchdowns on those 76 targets. This year, he\u2019s on pace for a similar 72 targets, but his touchdowns scoring has dropped, from 10.5 percent last year to 4.4 this year. His name recognition and his fantasy stock are at odds right now. Meanwhile, he draws a Green Bay defense in Week 12 that allowed a touchdown to Ed Dickson last week \u2026 the first touchdown the Packers have allowed to a tight end all season.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nBears \u2018cautiously optimistic\u2019 that Mitchell Trubisky will start Thanksgiving Day\n\nPredicting winners for each of the NFL\u2019s closest playoff races\n\nDid Marshal Yanda spit at Vontaze Burfict?

In recent weeks, a total of 20 fake Fana pages that were spreading fake news were shut down,\u201d Mekoya Hailemariam, head editor of Fana\u2019s online publications, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cThe pages were using our official logo and mixing our authentic news items with fake ones to intentionally spread misinformation. Some of these fake pages used to have as high as 45,000 followers.\u201d\n\nEthiopia has one of the lowest internet penetrations in the world with about 15 percent of its citizens having access to the net, according to Internet World Stats.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe swift and steep drop in oil prices has been the talk of Wall Street for several weeks and is good news for 30 million American travelers as they head into a busy Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nBut the dramatic decline cuts both ways, with several energy firms big and small seeing their stock prices fall even as President Trump cheers the lowest oil prices in more than a year.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the president tweeted:\n\n\u201cOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a piece of work,\u201d said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Heartland Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s all supply, that is the issue. The U.S. is producing 11.5 million barrels a day. We are largest producer in the world. There\u2019s just more supply than demand currently. If Saudi Arabia keeps pumping and exemptions to Iran stay in place, prices are going to stay low.\u201d\n\n[Trump presses Saudis to increase oil production in face of rising gas prices]\n\nThe current surplus is largely attributed to a miscalculation between demand and output by major producers, including Iran. A strong dollar is also weighing on oil prices because it makes oil more expensive for much of the world. Oil prices tend to fall as a result.\n\nSeveral companies have been shellacked by the price decline. Small- and medium-size independent oil companies that rely on fracking are seeing their profit margins erode, which is hurting stock prices. Newfield Exploration\u2019s stock price is down 39 percent this year. PDC Energy shares are off about 30 percent. Oasis Petroleum is down 14 percent, and Apache Corp. has declined about 20 percent.\n\nBenchmark Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both saw big price drops Tuesday but rallied Wednesday despite a report that crude stockpiles rose by nearly 5 million barrels last week. West Texas Intermediate was up more than 3 percent at $55.29 at 1 p.m. Benchmark Brent was up 2.2 percent at $63.94.Both are down more than 20 percent from their highs in early October.\n\nThe magic number is $50 per barrel. Much below that and companies start really hurting.\n\nOil entrepreneur Harold Hamm of Continental Resources has been one industry executive Trump has relied on for advice.\n\nIn an interview in January, Hamm said that \u201cI\u2019m not thinking at all that we\u2019ll see extreme prices in the future around $80 or $90 a barrel. That\u2019s not in the interest of producers around the world. We\u2019re not trying to do that, and OPEC\u2019s not thinking that either. When you read their rationale, it\u2019s based on a healthy market.\u201d\n\nHamm said that break-even costs for U.S. shale oil producers were as low as $35 a barrel and some as high as $45 or $50.\n\n\u201cBut initially when OPEC started to flood the market, they thought high-cost production meant $70 in a lot of these [geological] plays,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they quickly found out was that that was really wrong. That number kept falling. They realized \u2018these guys could compete with us.\u2019 That\u2019s when they had to reverse their tactics.\u201d\n\nFrank Verrastro, an oil expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he anticipates more oil price volatility until the Dec. 6 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, where he believes the cartel will cut production as it searches for a price close to $80 a barrel.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, \u201cmoney managers are waiting for an event that will catalyze a change in price, whether it is a supply disruption, a geopolitical event or news that demand is stronger than thought.\u201d\n\nVerrastro said the president has his mind on one thing: keeping oil prices low, which is a huge boost to consumers.\n\n\u201cThe president is thinking, \u2018Happy Thanksgiving. I give you lower prices,\u2019 \u201d Verrastro said.\n\nU.S. giants Chevron and ExxonMobil both are down about 10 percent in 2018.\n\nOil is a boom-and-bust business. The price drops when supply exceeds demand. Producers pull back and slow production as a result of the price squeeze. When demand exceeds supply, producers start drilling again and the cycle picks up again.\n\n[The good and bad of the steep drop in oil prices]\n\nThe United States is the world\u2019s biggest oil consumer at about 21 million barrels a day of the 100 million barrels produced daily worldwide. It is also a top oil producer, thanks to the shale oil renaissance over the past half-decade.\n\nOil and gas represent about 7.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Low prices have a salutary effect across the economy, including moderating the rate of inflation. By helping to keep inflation low, low oil prices can stem the rise of interest rates, including for mortgages and auto purchases.\n\nOil prices dove quickly Tuesday on Trump\u2019s endorsement of strong ties to oil swing producer Saudi Arabia, the de facto OPEC leader under fire for the October killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s willingness to maintain production is crucial to keeping oil prices low and the president happy. The oil giant was contemplating a cut in production at the December OPEC and non-OPEC meeting, which could raise prices.\n\nTrump has repeatedly tried to insert himself into key economic decisions made by others, and has been particularly incensed about interest rates and oil prices. He believes low interest rates and low oil prices will help boost the economy, though he often dismisses concerns that White House interference in these decisions could distort markets.\n\nFor months, Trump pressured OPEC to lower oil prices, even jawboning the coalition on Twitter.\n\n\u201cLooks like OPEC is at it again,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!\u201d\n\nTrump has imposed severe economic sanctions against Iran, which limit the ability of other countries to buy Iran\u2019s oil. The move was expected to drive up oil prices, which would make it more costly for consumers and businesses, but oil prices have stayed low in recent months.\n\nIn a move that limited the impact of the Iran sanctions on oil prices, however, the White House gave temporary waivers to eight countries that allowed them to keep buying Iranian petroleum, at least for a little while.\n\nThis week, Trump\u2019s comments came as part of a strident defense he has made regarding his relationship with Saudi Arabia, dismissing assessments from U.S. intelligence agencies that top Saudi leaders were involved in the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nLast year, Trump praised the economy\u2019s performance, particularly the run-up of the stock market. As the market has hit turbulence, however, Trump has found other things to highlight.\n\nEnergy has been one of the hardest-hit sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, thanks largely to the decline in oil.The sector slipped 3.29 percent Tuesday, the steepest of all 11 sectors.\n\nSteven Mufson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Voters in German state approve abolishing death penalty", "description": "Voters have approved a constitutional change abolishing the death penalty in Hesse, the last German state to have capital punishment on the books", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/voters-in-german-state-approve-abolishing-death-penalty/2018/11/21/8f5c7984-ed98-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:20:14Z", "content": "BERLIN Voters have approved a constitutional change abolishing the death penalty in Hesse, the last German state to have capital punishment on the books.

The estimates, the NGO said, may still be lower than the actual number of deaths.\n\n\u201cChildren who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections, with some too frail to even cry,\u201d said Save the Children representative Kirolos.\n\n\u201cParents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, half the Yemeni population suffers from famine.\n\nThe United States has remained largely silent on the war, even when Saudi Arabia enacted a blockade on its borders with Yemen last November. Since then, human rights groups have struggled to supply some of the most malnourished areas in the country with food and drinking water. About 90 percent of the country is considered to be desert or arid and the Yemeni government heavily relied on food imports before the conflict.\n\nWhat began as a rebellion by the country\u2019s Shiite-majority Houthi rebels during the Arab Spring has turned into a bigger confrontation between Saudi Arabia and its archrival Iran, which supports the Houthis.\n\nSaudi Arabia has received support from eight other Arab states that are also opposed to Iran\u2019s influence. U.S. officials long argued that the involvement of Iran has made it impossible to end the conflict, but criticism of that assessment has mounted as the conflict became the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.\n\nWestern nations have remained careful in calibrating their responses, to neither disgruntle the wealthy and investment-eager Saudi leadership nor domestic human rights supporters. Germany, for instance, reduced its arms equipment sales to Saudi Arabia and vowed to stop them completely, but approved new sales earlier this year. (Those sales have now been stopped amid the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Khashoggi).\n\nIn the United States, Trump has put Saudi investments and arms purchases first, even as members of his administration have pressured the Saudis to stop the Yemeni conflict. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both said in October that the war should come to an end. The United States exports more arms to Saudi Arabia than any other country.\n\n\u201cIt is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration added more pressure by ending its practice of refueling Saudi-coalition aircraft involved in the conflict. Critics said the Saudi military used those planes to drop bombs on nonmilitary targets, killing thousands of civilians.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition appears to be aware of the mounting international resistance, too, and has handed its supporters some arguments in its favor. This week, Saudi Arabia and the UAE pledged $500 million in aid to Yemen.\n\nBut the bombardment has continued, according to Save the Children. \u201cIn the past few weeks there have been hundreds of airstrikes in and around Hodeidah, endangering the lives of an estimated 150,000 children still trapped in the city,\u201d Kirolos said.\n\nHodeidah is one of Yemen\u2019s key port cities and has long been the access point to reach the country\u2019s north. As fighting has continued there, nongovernmental organizations have used the port of Aden, in the south, from which it takes two additional weeks to reach the malnourished north of the country, where a majority of the population lives.\n\nAs Save the Children was getting ready to release its devastating report Tuesday, Trump addressed the same issue. Ignoring evidence that the Saudi-led coalition has also escalated the conflict, Trump wrote that Iran is instead \u201cresponsible for a bloody proxy war.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nIran is allied with the Houthi rebels and has been accused of supplying them with weapons, including ballistic missiles, but Iranian troops are not present on the ground in Yemen.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the U.S. president had already moved on, when he tweeted about the role Saudi Arabia has supposedly played in driving down oil prices.\n\n\u201cThank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOil prices getting lower.

But critics say she is propping up an industry with a record of misleading students and poor educational outcomes.\n\nFormer Obama administration officials predicted Wednesday that DeVos\u2019s decision will be challenged in court.\n\nIn December 2016, the Obama administration ruled that the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, known as ACICS, should no longer be allowed to serve as a gatekeeper between colleges and billions of dollars in federal financial aid. It concluded that the agency was incapable of rectifying years of lax oversight and \u201cexhibited a profound lack of compliance\u201d with the \u201cmost basic\u201d responsibilities of an accreditor.\n\nBut in March, a federal judge ordered DeVos to reconsider that decision, finding that the Obama staff had failed to review thousands of pages of evidence.\n\nA senior Education Department official, Diane Auer Jones, reviewed the record and in September recommended that DeVos reinstate ACICS. She found that the council was out of compliance with two of 21 criteria but recommended it be given a year to fix those problems. She also recommended monitoring in a handful of other areas.\n\nDeVos agreed and in her decision characterized the Education Department under Obama as having ignored or mischaracterized relevant evidence when ruling that the accrediting agency be removed from the student loan program. DeVos said the decision reached by former Education Secretary John B. King Jr. suffered from \u201ccircular reasoning\u201d and \u201ca desire to achieve a preordained result.\u201d\n\nKing declined to comment.\n\nIn her recommendation, Jones found that ACICS has been asked to make changes and had done so. For instance, it was asked to better monitor job placement by the colleges it accredited, and it implemented a sophisticated system, she said. She also said the prior administration had imposed a double standard \u2014 tolerating other accreditors\u2019 failure to catch problems but not this one\u2019s.\n\nAnd she said the prior administration cited investigations and lawsuits targeting ACICS but not final judgments.\n\nDeVos\u2019s decision was delivered Wednesday to the accreditor. ACICS President Michelle Edwards replied she is gratified by the move and \u201ceager to move forward and commit all of our energy to reinvigorating and strengthening the organization for a strong future.\u201d\n\nCritics blasted the DeVos decision as evidence she is beholden to the for-profit college industry. They noted that ACICS remains out of compliance with two standards \u2014 one deals with whether the agency employs qualified and competent people; the second regards controls against conflicts of interest.\n\nOthers pointed to a staff report this year evaluating an application from ACICS for reinstatement by the Education Department, filed after it lost its original standing. That report found the agency failed to meet most standards.\n\nA senior Education Department official said that report was preliminary and would have been modified after more information was gathered. But former Obama administration officials say it is evidence their decision was the right one.\n\n\u201cBetsy DeVos has ignored her career staff\u2019s 57 findings of ACICS\u2019s noncompliance and her Thanksgiving gift to American taxpayers is to rubber stamp an accreditor that has been the gatekeeper of billions of federal dollars to predatory colleges without meaningful oversight,\u201d said Aaron Ament, a former Obama administration official who is president of the National Student Legal Defense Network, which has filed lawsuits regarding the ACICS decision.\n\nDanielle Douglas-Gabriel contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Child bride auction in South Sudan goes viral, sparks anger - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Child bride auction in South Sudan goes viral, sparks anger Washington Post JUBA, South Sudan \u2014 Five hundred cows, two luxury cars, $10,000, two bikes, a boat and a few cell phones made up the final price in a heated bidding war for a child br\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/child-bride-auction-in-south-sudan-goes-viral-sparks-anger/2018/11/21/033374cc-ed97-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T14:10:14Z", "content": "JUBA, South Sudan Five hundred cows, two luxury cars, $10,000, two bikes, a boat and a few cell phones made up the final price in a heated bidding war for a child bride in South Sudan that went viral after the auction was pointed out on Facebook.

It is the largest dowry ever paid in the civil war-torn country, the government said.\n\nThe highest bidder was a man three times the 17-year-old\u2019s age. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. Among the bidders was the state\u2019s deputy governor.\n\n\u201cShe has been reduced to a mere commodity,\u201d Ngong told The Associated Press, calling it \u201cthe biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being.\u201d Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Nyalong became the man\u2019s ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring despondently at the floor. The AP is using only her first name to protect her identity. The groom did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSouth Sudan has a deeply rooted cultural practice of paying dowries for brides, usually in the form of cows. It also has a long history of child marriage. Even though that practice is now illegal, 40 percent of girls still marry before age 18, according to the United Nations Population Fund. The practice \u201cthreatens girls\u2019 lives\u201d and limits prospects for their future, said Dr. Mary Otieno, the agency\u2019s country representative.\n\nThe bidding war has caused local and international outrage. It took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first pointed out the auction, and after it was taken down other posts \u201cglorifying\u201d the situation remained, George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan, told the AP.\n\n\u201cThis barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world\u2019s biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,\u201d he said. The auction was discussed, not carried out, on the site.\n\nFacebook did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nWhile South Sudan\u2019s government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can\u2019t regulate communities\u2019 cultural norms, especially in remote areas.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call it bidding as if it was an auction. It\u2019s not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you\u2019ll call it an auction,\u201d government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. \u201cYou have to see it with an African eye, as it\u2019s a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There\u2019s no word for it in English.\u201d\n\nSome local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the National Alliance for Women Lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government\u2019s plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.\n\nSouth Sudan\u2019s anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that some human trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,\u201d John Mading said.\n\nIn other cases, some girls who grow up in the South Sudanese diaspora are brought back to the country and forced to marry. The AP spoke with several people who know girls who arrived for what they thought was a vacation, only to have their passports taken away and forced into marriage by their families.\n\n\u201cSome families want children to marry in their countries and in their ethnic communities, but most do it if the kids are misbehaving,\u201d said Esther Ikere Eluzai, undersecretary for South Sudan\u2019s ministry of gender.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Daniela Tejada/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe UAE is Britain\u2019s fourth-largest export market outside the European Union, and British officials have been working to strengthen those ties as their country prepares to leave the E.U. in March and negotiate new bilateral trade deals.\n\nHedges\u2019s wife, Daniela Tejada, said Wednesday that she watched her husband shake as he received the sentence. \u201cI am in complete shock and I don\u2019t know what to do. Matthew is innocent,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them. This whole case has been handled appallingly from the very beginning with no one taking Matthew\u2019s case seriously.\u201d\n\nFor months, Hedges\u2019s family members refrained from speaking out. British government officials advised that keeping the case out of the press would ease his sentence. Tajada told the Sunday Times in October she had felt \u201cblackmailed.\u201d\n\nBritish consular officials were believed to have monitored Wednesday\u2019s court session in Abu Dhabi.\n\nMichael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, called it a \u201csham trial.\u201d Page said the UAE has been cracking down domestically on dissent but that it likes to present itself internationally as a \u201ca space for tolerance and openness \u2014 a lot of conferences are held there; there are a lot of academic links to the UAE.\u201d\n\nHedges was unexpectedly released on bail last month after four months in solitary confinement. Family members said his health had deteriorated and that he had been vomiting daily, after prison authorities supplied him with a cocktail of antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicine and sleeping pills.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament on Wednesday that she was \u201cdeeply disappointed and concerned at today\u2019s verdict\u201d and would raise the case with UAE authorities \u201cat the highest level.\u201d\n\nHedges has 30 days to appeal the verdict.\n\nIn a statement on its website, Durham University said that Hedges began his PhD work in 2013 and that his research was nearing completion. \u201cHis academic colleagues speak highly of his work, noting both his diligence and level of scholarship, as well as his undoubted passion and care for the Arab Gulf and its people,\u201d the university said.\n\nKristian Ulrichsen, an expert in the politics of the Gulf region currently at Rice University in Houston, noted that the verdict would probably have a chilling effect on future scholarship in the UAE, which has spent vast amounts of money in recent years to lure branches of prestigious Western universities and museums.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has presented itself as a secure hub for universities who want to do research in the region,\u201d said Ulrichsen, who has also advised Hedges\u2019s family since he was first detained. He said that the effect on the country\u2019s reputation as a safe place to work could be profound.\n\n\u201cOne hates to invoke \u2018privilege\u2019 in any way, but I think the assumption had been until now that if you were a Western scholar whose research ran afoul of the authorities, the worst thing that could happen to you was that you\u2019d be taken to the airport or, like me, denied entry. It\u2019s hard to overstate the degree to which this is a game-changer.\u201d\n\nTheodore Karasik, a Washington-based scholar who spent a decade in the UAE, said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that Matt is a pawn in a larger game, which is inexcusable. This is a graduate student, and the UAE is creating an atmosphere of fear.\u201d\n\nThe sentence could backfire on the UAE, he said, by deterring foreign businesses, as well as academics and journalists.\n\n\u201cAnybody who asks questions has to be aware of what\u2019s going on,\u201d Karasik said. \u201cIt makes for a challenging business environment when you throw foreign nationals who are graduate students into jail.\u201d\n\nLoveluck reported from Beirut.

Credit: Library of Congress\n\nColumnist\n\nI am on principle opposed to originality in Thanksgiving menus. Call me an arch-traditionalist, if you will \u2014 in fact, please do. And having just joined The Post this year, I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to take a stroll through the paper\u2019s archives to see what we\u2019d said about Thanksgiving in the good old days.\n\nWhat I discovered was a capsule history of the past 140 years of this most American holiday. In the 1897 announcement that the clerks of the federal government had been given a half-holiday on the day before Thanksgiving, I thought I saw the early stirrings of the American labor movement. I saw large social shifts, too, as the paper\u2019s Thanksgiving coverage slowly adjusted its focus. In the early decades, food was generally mentioned only glancingly, except for fairly regular features tracking the price of turkeys. It was clear that even back then, food was at least as important to the holiday as religion, but The Post either assumed women didn\u2019t read newspapers or thought they all knew how to cook. The Thanksgiving coverage tended toward sentimental fare such as sermons from local ministers, editorials urging charity toward the poor and moderately bad sentimental poetry. (\u201cA Thanksgiving Hymn\u201d in 1896, dedicated to President-elect William McKinley, began: \u201cO Lord! we thank thee for this glorious land; / United, faithful, beautiful, and grand.\u201d)\n\nBy 1920, America was less religious and less sentimental, and newspapers had discovered something that would become a driving force in many 20th-century industries: the buying power of women. The Post seized on that market opportunity, devoting more and more column inches to helping homemakers Do Thanksgiving Right. Recipes, which in the earliest years tended to be scant and distressingly hazy on the details, became numerous, and firmed up into something the modern reader would recognize. Explicit instructions were accompanied by standard measures instead of approximations such as \u201cbutter the size of a walnut.\u201d\n\nMany of these recipes tracked the economy and geopolitics. In 1889, in the wake of the Russian flu pandemic, The Post reported that \u201cRussian cookery, Russian servants, Russian clothes, and Russian what-not\u201d had a hold on \u201cevery one and everything in the United States.\u201d In this spirit, we offered a recipe for Russian Cream, though I suspect this was \u201cRussian\u201d in the same sense that \u201cfrench fries\u201d are a particularly Gallic delicacy. When World War I, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924, halted the importation of cheap domestic servants, you can see menus getting simpler, a process that accelerated in the 1930s as food budgets shrank.\n\nDuring those hard times, The Post looked for ways to help readers economize, such as serving chicken instead of turkey. In the 1940s, we helped cooks cope with war rationing and concoct treats to send to soldiers overseas. And in the postwar era of abundance, we offered low-calorie and low-salt tricks to help readers combat the diseases of dietary excess.\n\nThe paper\u2019s food writing also reflected a century of advances in food-processing technology. The invention of inexpensive powdered gelatin brought previously luxurious molded salads to ordinary Thanksgiving tables. It was also combined with its less aggressive cousin, cornstarch, to create the modern marshmallow, which reigned over everything from canap\u00e9s to casseroles, before shuffling off to become the dowager empress of the sweet potatoes.\n\nCanned goods and box mixes advanced into every corner of the Thanksgiving menu and then retreated as flash freezing, and then container shipping, made fresher ingredients affordable year-round. The invention of the continuous casting process for aluminum foil in the 1950s made it a ubiquitous presence in American kitchens, and so naturally, we began advising readers to wrap their turkeys in the stuff to keep them moist. Those turkeys were also apt to be flash frozen, an innovation that largely put an end to worries about their high cost.\n\nThe Post\u2019s archives showed food fads rising and falling like ancient empires, including serial flirtations with Asia in the form of now-problematic and distinctly un-Asian recipes, such as the \u201cStuffing Oriental\u201d from 1968, a bland concoction of packaged stuffing mix, onion and celery, which was probably not much improved by the addition of water chestnuts. America\u2019s midcentury adventures in Europe also brought novelties such as fondue. The paper, not quite mastering this newfangled European cookery, suggested pairing bubbling cheese sauce with \u2026 steamed Brussels sprouts.\n\nAs with all the best journeys, on this trip I also discovered something about myself.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m not quite as fond of yesteryear\u2019s Thanksgivings as I had thought. Perusing the acres of vintage Post recipes, I decided that most of them ought to be buried as deeply as possible in the ash heap of history.\n\nIn fairness, it usually wasn\u2019t the recipes\u2019 traditionalism that was the problem, but the all-too-modern thirst for novelty.\n\nThough there were exceptions. Since The Post\u2019s founding in 1877, stuffing has been unquestionably improved from its bready, flavorless origins. So has turkey-cooking; early recipes start with singeing off the \u201cpin feathers\u201d that were too small to pluck. And most American Thanksgiving tables have shed some time-honored stalwarts that I can\u2019t bring myself to miss. Like giblets, or mincemeat, which was once so central to the holiday that during the 1920s and \u201930s, the paper ran recipe after recipe for making mincemeat at home. (I\u2019m told it\u2019s actually delicious, though I\u2019ve never quite worked up the courage to try this traditional combination of dried fruit, fat, liquor and beef.)\n\nBut mostly when I found myself saying \u201cThey put what in their mouths?\u201d I was looking at some long-ago attempt to be au courant with the latest food fashions. For some reason, cranberries were disproportionately involved. The writers may have felt the cranberry was getting bored being everlastingly stewed with sugar, year after year. So they tried to get it interested in all the new opportunities that modern life had to offer. The result was \u2026 rather like trying to teach your grandparents to use Gmail.\n\nThe Post awarded a prize in 1936 to a reader-submitted recipe for some frightful concoction called \u201cCranberry Bananas\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ll spare you the details. In 1950, the cranberry was again ready to \u201cbranch \u2026 out on its own\u201d into unsavory sidelines such as Jell-O molds and the new boxed cake mixes. In 1952 it was \u201cdressed up\u201d by being forced through a manual food chopper \u2014 along with celery, nut meats and a whole seeded orange.\n\nThe cranberry wasn\u2019t the only ingredient mauled by modernism. In 1936, when pineapple was still the new-new thing, we suggested making it into a canape, along with, incredibly, olives and Roquefort cheese. In 1938, the paper advocated topping pumpkin pie with cheese, meringue, coconut or marshmallow \u201cfor variety.\u201d We tried for decades to remake the pumpkin pie \u2014 with gelatin, with ice cream, with unusual flavorings \u2014 always to unappetizing effect. In general, if any recipe was offered as \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cexciting,\u201d or \u201cnew,\u201d it was a good sign that you were about to be invited into a criminal conspiracy against some perfectly innocent foodstuff.\n\nAnd yet this historical tour also confirmed my faith in America. Food writers kept trying to entice readers into new experiments, and maybe they went along for a while \u2014 but mostly, Americans have stubbornly returned to the same Thanksgiving dishes served in 1899. Turkey and stuffing, cranberries and pumpkin pie, with no meringue or coconut distractions. When experimentation paid off, as it obviously did with dressing, it was incorporated into the holiday. And when it didn\u2019t (as was usually the case), Americans abandoned the recipes and forgot about ever having tried them.\n\nIt\u2019s been said that America is an essentially conservative nation; it\u2019s also been said that America has an unholy fascination with progress. After surveying a hundred years of food writing, I suspect that perhaps both of these observations are a little bit true \u2014 I also think that Americans have wrestled these opposing instincts into a most pleasing synthesis in their Thanksgiving menus.\n\nThose of us whose ideology tracks rightward recognize that progress has brought the nation many of the things we now wish to conserve. We therefore must be open to innovating, even within the most cherished traditions.\n\nBut we also recognize the value of the familiar things that have weathered the test of time. We are willing to try, but we also recognize that trying means opening yourself up to failure \u2014 and that when you fail, as you often will, the thing to do is immediately cut your losses and go back to what works.\n\nAmericans today are better cooks than their great-great-grandmothers were, and have better ingredients to work with, better technology for cooking them and more diverse palates. While we will be putting roughly the same meal on the Thanksgiving table as they did, we will labor less and enjoy it more. And what could be more quintessentially, traditionally American than that?"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Felicia Sonmez", "title": "Former Bush attorney general Alberto Gonzales rebukes Trump for reportedly seeking to prosecute Clinton, Comey", "description": "\u201cWe live in a democracy, and you don\u2019t go after political rivals,\u201d Gonzales said in response to a report that Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute his adversaries.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-bush-attorney-general-alberto-gonzales-rebukes-trump-for-reportedly-seeking-to-prosecute-clinton-comey/2018/11/21/103f5c64-ed8b-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XbcrrXscxb-oJIR7oWmx9o1xQYg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AFINQPCA5QI6HJREIHLGDMF3PA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:54:42Z", "content": "Former Bush administration attorney general Alberto Gonzales on Wednesday criticized President Trump following a report that Trump sought to prosecute two of his political adversaries, calling it a very, very serious situation.

(Virginia Mayo/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May told skeptical lawmakers on Wednesday that rejecting her divorce deal with the European Union would mean uncertainty and division, before a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to help finalize the Brexit agreement.\n\nMay and Juncker held late-afternoon talks in Brussels as negotiators worked to pin down agreement on issues of contention so that EU leaders can meet in Brussels on Sunday to rubber-stamp the package.\n\nThe U.K. and the European Union agreed last week on a 585-page document sealing the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, but are still working to nail down agreement on future relations.\n\nWith wrangling continuing on issues including Gibraltar and fishing rights, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Wednesday that the political declaration on future relations was \u201cnot there yet.\u201d\n\nHe said diplomats would meet Friday to prepare Sunday\u2019s summit, and \u201cthey will need to see a final text before then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nAt home, May is under intense pressure from pro-Brexit and pro-EU British lawmakers, with large numbers on both sides of the debate opposing the divorce deal. Brexiteers think it will leave the U.K. tied too closely to EU rules, while pro-Europeans say it will erect new barriers between Britain and the bloc, its neighbor and biggest trading partner.\n\nMay fended off a barrage of criticism from both opposition and government legislators Wednesday during her weekly Commons question-and-answer session dominated by Brexit.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the agreement \u201chalf-baked\u201d \u2014 and said his party could negotiate a better one \u2014 while Conservative Andrew Rosindell urged May to ditch the plan and remove \u201cthe tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation.\u201d\n\nMay replied that \u201cwe want to ensure we continue to have a close trading relationship with the European union\u201d after Brexit.\n\nShe said the alternative to the agreement was either \u201cmore uncertainty, more division or it could risk no Brexit at all.\u201d\n\nMadrid has raised objections to wording in the agreement about Gibraltar, the tiny territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula that was ceded to Britain in 1713 but is still claimed by Spain.\n\nLast year\u2019s EU guidelines on the Brexit negotiations effectively gave Spain veto powers over future relations between the bloc and the British overseas territory, and the Spanish government says it will vote against the Brexit deal if Gibraltar\u2019s future isn\u2019t considered a bilateral issue between Madrid and London.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Tuesday that his government \u201ccannot accept that what will happen to Gibraltar in the future depends on negotiations between the U.K. and the EU.\u201d\n\nBut May reassured British lawmakers that \u201cwe will not exclude Gibraltar from our negotiations on the future relationship.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s EU Affairs State Secretary, Luis Marco Aguiriano, said there was still time to \u201clegally clarify\u201d the agreement before Sunday.\n\nThe deal also needs to be approved by the European and British Parliaments \u2014 a tough task for May, whose Conservatives lack a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nMay won a reprieve from some of her Conservative Party foes after pro-Brexit rebels acknowledged that a bid to trigger a no-confidence vote in May had failed, for now.\n\nBut Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party \u2014 whose 10 lawmakers prop up May\u2019s minority government \u2014 has begun abstaining on votes in the House of Commons as a sign of their displeasure at the deal. The DUP opposes plans for keeping the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland open after Brexit, saying it weakens the ties binding the U.K. by creating separate trade rules for Northern Ireland.\n\nThe prospect of Parliament rejecting the deal when it comes up for a vote \u2014 likely next month \u2014 has increased fears among businesses that Britain could crash out of the bloc without a plan to keep trade running smoothly.\n\nConservative lawmakers loyal to May also warned that defeating the agreement could mean that Brexit never happens, because Parliament would halt Britain\u2019s departure rather than accept a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d exit.\n\n\u201cI think people will take a careful look over the abyss ... and consider whether they think it is in the best interests of the whole country,\u201d Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said.\n\n\u201cThe Brexiteers may lose their Brexit,\u201d she added.\n\n___\n\nLorne Cook reported from Brussels.

(AP Photo/Al Grillo, File)\n\nThe Trump administration is taking its first steps toward expanding oil and natural gas drilling in an area roughly the size of Indiana in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nThe Interior Department is ready to abandon a management plan put in place under Barack Obama for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, or the NPR-A.\n\nJoe Balash, assistant secretary of land and minerals at Interior, said that in light of \"some exciting new discoveries\" as well as \"advances in drilling technology,\" the Trump administration wanted to open up more acreage in the reserve to drilling.\n\n\"We think it's time to re-evaluate some of the areas that were previously left unavailable for leasing,\" Balash said in a call, according to a recording of the call obtained by The Washington Post. He added that it will take \"about a year\" to develop a new plan for managing the petroleum reserve after publishing a notice Tuesday.\n\nThe move is in line with other attempts under President Trump to expand fossil-fuel extraction nationwide, whether by trying to revitalize coal mining in the Appalachia mountains or offshore drilling in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWhen it comes to onshore oil development, Alaska has been a main locus of that push. And unlike efforts to boost coal mining or offshore drilling, Trump has seen significant success in the nation's northernmost state.\n\nThe Republican tax bill signed by Trump nearly one year ago mandated oil and gas lease sales in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is to the east of the petroleum reserve. For decades, environmentalists successfully fought to keep a coastal tract of relatively untouched wilderness there full of caribou and polar bears free from energy development. By opening up the refuge to leasing, Trump succeeded where George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush tried and fell short.\n\nAs its name suggests, Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve was originally earmarked for eventual oil extraction. In 1923, President Warren G. Harding set aside the area over oil supply concerns as the U.S. Navy started burning oil rather than coal to power its ships.\n\nBut as time passed scientists and conservationists began to recognize the area's ecological importance, particularly to migratory waterfowls that liked to frequent its wetlands. Working with subsistence hunters in Alaska and environmentalists in the Lower 48, the Obama administration put half of the petroleum reserve, or about 11 million acres, off-limits to oil drilling.\n\nEnvironmentalists like Mark Salvo, vice president of landscape conservation at the Defenders of Wildlife, criticized the Trump administration for throwing out a management plan that took years to make. Interior similarly is trying to scrap wildlife management plans for the Mojave Desert in California and for sagebrush habitat through much of the rest of the western United States, Salvo noted.\n\n\"These are examples of the Trump administration stealing defeat from the jaws of victory,\" he said. \"These plans took years to produce and tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer resources to arrive at these carefully crafted compromises to conserve public lands.\"\n\nAlaska's oil and gas industry, which originally balked at the Obama-era decision, praised the Trump administration for aiming to reverse it.\n\n\"There have been recent discoveries in the NPR-A and adjacent state land that suggests it may be a more prolific area for oil and gas development,\" said Kara Moriarty, president and chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.\n\nLast year the U.S. Geological Survey, Interior's main scientific arm, reassessed the reserve and estimated that it and the state and tribal areas around it contain 8.7 billion barrels of oil and 25 trillion cubic feet of gas. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had ordered the survey after ConocoPhillips announced a promising oil discovery in the northeast corner of the refuge earlier in 2017.\n\nBut a lease sale in NPR-A last December, which Zinke once touted as \u201clarge and unprecedented,\u201d got only seven bids for less than 1 percent of the area offered.\n\nNow the Trump administration is suggesting the land it is considering unlocking will garner more attention from oil and gas developers. \"I do think it's important to point out that some of the acreage that is probably most prospective is currently not available for leasing,\" Balash said.\n\nOf particular interest to the oil industry and concern to wildlife conservationists is Teshekpuk Lake and the surrounding area. That 320-square-mile freshwater body, the largest in the Alaskan Arctic, plays host to half a million shorebirds and tens of thousands of molting geese that groups like the Audubon Society worry will be impacted by oil operations.\n\nBalash, the Trump land management official, told reporters the department's geologists believe the area around the lake is \"extremely prospective\" due to the volume of oil underneath it. But in the same breath, he recognized the needle the department must thread between not only the interests of wildlife conservationists but Native Alaskans who live and hunt in the reserve.\n\n\"The big question is: Can we make some of that acreage available in a manner that is responsible and and honors the subsistence way of life that the people who live in the NPR-A have lived for thousands of years?\" Balash said.\n\nPOWER PLAYS\n\nThe Coast Guard recently opened its forward operating base in Kotzebue, Alaska.

Reporters have an obligation to ferret out facts, but they sometimes let ego and attitude get in the way.\n\nBoth, however, are best able to do their jobs if neither is boss of the other and each feels free to call out the other, without reporters fearing some sort of Kafkaesque disciplinary action.\n\nLimiting press questioning harms the press, the public and, potentially, the president. As President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s top aide, George Reedy, wrote in a memoir, \u201cThe Twilight of the Presidency,\u201d modern-day presidents are at risk of being trapped in a cocoon of yes men (and, today, yes women). Sometimes reporters\u2019 questions are the only rays of truth-bringing reality that penetrate.\n\nFor a better way to handle press access, the White House and its beat reporters need look no further than the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Since the late 1800s, Congress has pointedly butted out of decisions about who gets credentials to cover its proceedings, turning over the duties instead to a Standing Committee of Correspondents.\n\nNow morphed into several committees to meet the needs of broadcasters, photojournalists and periodical reporters (including those for Web-based publications), the group is made up of working reporters who serve on a rotating basis and adjudicate questions \u2014 that have become increasingly knotty in the digital age \u2014 about who is a reporter. Sometimes their decisions are controversial. But the decisions are made by dispassionate professionals, not by politicians with a potential interest in the outcome.\n\nWhy should that not be the same model at the White House? The White House Press Office and its staff should not be in charge of deciding who gets the coveted \u201chard pass\u201d for daily access to the president, staff and policymakers. Yes, the Secret Service should do a security screening. But decisions about professional bona fides should be in the hands of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which represents reporters on the beat, although it\u2019s better known for running a once-a-year glitzy dinner.\n\nIn trying to ban Acosta, the president may have done the press corps an inadvertent favor. With attention now focused on the dubious system for granting press credentials, the White House and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association should seize the moment to modernize it. Decisions about White House access should be in the hands of security and media professionals, not political appointees."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paige Winfield Cunningham", "title": "The Health 202: Here's how Trump and Bernie Sanders agree on lowering drug prices", "description": "Their proposals are strikingly similar.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/11/21/the-health-202-here-s-how-trump-and-bernie-sanders-agree-on-lowering-drug-prices/5bf42bd91b326b3929054956/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/58958185f0a6c5f3b18832d4146e5718-3931-2802-70-8-Election_2018_Bernie_Sanders_59503jpge7633.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:37:17Z", "content": "THE PROGNOSIS Sen.

(Chris O'Meara/AP)\n\nHave you heard about the trendy new approach to lowering prescription drug spending? Copy other countries.\n\nThe Trump administration and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are strange bedfellows on drug prices. But they\u2019re both eyeing similar approaches to lowering the country\u2019s astronomically high spending on prescription medicines: pegging U.S. drug prices to lower international levels.\n\nSanders proposed a bill Tuesday incentivizing companies to develop cheaper generic versions of brand-name medications that the government determines to be \u201cexcessively priced\u201d in comparison to the median price in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan.\n\nThis is similar to an idea advanced in October by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, whose agency is experimenting with pegging some Medicare payments to an index based on sales prices in those five countries plus 11 more: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nBoth proposals stem from the reality that drug prices are much higher in the United States because the government doesn\u2019t engage in price-setting, unlike in many other countries with similar economies. That means pharmaceutical companies pocket a lot more money in this country \u2014 and rely more heavily on their U.S. profits to pay for developing new medications.\n\nTrump and Sanders have adopted similar rhetoric when they talk about the issue, even though the Republican president and the self-described democratic socialist senator couldn\u2019t be further apart on other topics such as taxes and immigration. The United States pays unfairly high prices for prescription drugs, they argue, even as other countries demand \u2014 and obtain \u2013 steep discounts.\n\nSanders tweeted this Tuesday:\n\nNo other country allows pharma companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. That has to change.\n\n\n\nAt the start of the new Congress @RepRoKhanna and I will introduce legislation to stop Big Pharma from ripping off the American people. https://t.co/QGkZmoOcXV \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 20, 2018\n\nAnd from Azar:\n\nThe U.S. currently pays, on average, 180% of what other wealthy countries pay for costly physician-administered drugs. We've put out a plan that will ensure American patients get a more fair deal\u2014saving patients and the Medicare program billions. https://t.co/CYhKbf8Y59 \u2014 Secretary Alex Azar (@SecAzar) November 20, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Trump and Sanders have shared common ground. During their 2016 campaigns, both candidates advocated allowing Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers and private companies. Trump has since backed away from that idea, but HHS surprised many with its bold suggestion of creating an international price index (which I explained in this Health 202).\n\nGranted, HHS\u2019s experiment is quite limited in scope. It applies only to drugs administered to Medicare patients by doctors themselves and will last just five years. The experiment \u2014 called a \u201cdemonstration\u201d in administration-speak \u2014 won\u2019t start until sometime after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services propose a rule early next year.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposal, also sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), would go much further by affecting all drugs, including those purchased by Americans with private health insurance. If HHS determined a drug price to be excessive, the secretary would be directed to strip its maker of exclusivity rights and open the door for competitors to develop a generic version.\n\nSanders gave a nod to Trump\u2019s Part B proposal but emphasized that his approach would help the more than 150 million Americans who get private health coverage from their employer. The monthly cost for the popular insulin Lantus (used for diabetes) could fall from $387 to $220 and the medication Humira (used for arthritis) could fall from $2,770 to $1,576, according to some examples provided by Sanders\u2019s office.\n\nThere\u2019s little to no chance Sanders\u2019s bill will advance in Congress. Many Republicans aren\u2019t enthused even about Trump\u2019s limited Part B demonstration, because it smacks of government price-setting.\n\nThere is something else Sanders shares with the president: strong resistance from the pharmaceutical industry. A spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said both proposals would be \u201cdevastating\" if implemented.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would have the same devastating impact on patients as the administration\u2019s proposed International Pricing Index model,\u201d PhRMA spokeswoman Nicole Longo said in a statement provided to The Health 202.\n\n\u201cPatients in countries whose governments set prices wait years for new medicines and have far fewer treatment options,\u201d she added. \u201cThese policies reduce investment in research and development, slow progress in creating tomorrow\u2019s cures and will result in Americans having access to fewer new medicines.\u201d\n\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Happy almost Thanksgiving from The Health 202 team.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n\nAHH: The Trump administration has reinstated permission for Kentucky to impose work requirements for its Medicaid beneficiaries after a judge had blocked its ability to do so.\n\nCMS says it has approved the work requirements to start in April, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports, nine months after the rules were initially set to take effect.\n\n\u201cKentucky has been a lightning rod in the administration\u2019s rewriting of the rules for the public health insurance system for poor Americans by inserting long-held conservative ideas \u2014 about individual responsibility and a limited government helping hand \u2014 for the first time in the history of a program run jointly by the federal government and states that began under the War on Poverty of the 1960s,\u201d Goldstein writes.\n\nKentucky was the first state to win approval from the administration to create such rules for Medicaid beneficiaries. Days before the requirements were set to take effect, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled the state could not move ahead with plans \u201cbecause federal health officials had not adequately considered the requirement\u2019s impact on the program\u2019s central purpose \u2014 providing medical assistance to a state\u2019s citizens,\u201d Goldstein reports.\n\nInstead of an appeal, CMS reopened the state\u2019s proposal for another round of public comment, and with Tuesday\u2019s approval, made clear that \u201cthe version CMS just approved is substantially the same as the original with a few different nuances, such as a more explicit monitoring requirement about its effects,\u201d our colleague writes.\n\nAmy adds that because the case is still open, an attorney with the Kentucky Equal Justice Center said the plaintiffs will again ask that the requirements be found illegal. A similar lawsuit is also pending in Arkansas, the first state to put its Medicaid work requirements into effect.\n\nThe seal of the Department of Veterans Affairs is seen on the building in Washington.

Most received no money or were underpaid. In other cases, officials could not determine whether the benefits VA paid were too low or too high.\u201d\n\nRomaine lettuce is displayed at a grocery store in San Anselmo, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nOUCH: Check your fridge, and your Thanksgiving Day shopping lists. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that romaine lettuce is not safe to eat in any form.\n\nThe agency is warning people to throw away any romaine lettuce they have purchased, warning restaurants not to serve the greens and stores not to sell it, \u201cno matter where or when the lettuce was grown,\u201d and even if some lettuce has been eaten and no one has gotten sick. The agency's food safety alert is in response to a new outbreak of illnesses caused by a dangerous type of E. coli bacteria, our Post colleagues Joel Achenbach and Lena H. Sun report.\n\nThe CDC says 32 people across 11 states have been sickened by contaminated romaine lettuce, with 13 people hospitalized and one person suffering a form of kidney failure. Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency of Canada says 18 people have been infected by the same strain of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce.\n\n\u201cThis advice includes all types or uses of romaine lettuce, such as whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad,\u201d the CDC said. \u201cIf you do not know if the lettuce is romaine or whether a salad mix contains romaine, do not eat it and throw it away.\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker speaks at the Dept. of Justice's Annual Veterans Appreciation Day Ceremony. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\n\u2014 When he was a U.S. attorney, Matthew G. Whitaker imposed some of the country's harshest sentences on drug offenders, our Post colleague Michael Kranish reports.\n\nWhitaker, now the acting attorney general, spent about five years as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. Based on findings from a nationwide analysis conducted by Iowa federal judge Mark W. Bennet, Whitaker\u2019s office \u201cwas more likely than all but one other district in the United States to use its authority to impose the harshest sentences on drug offenders.\u201d\n\nKranish notes the Bush administration had pushed for strict sentences on repeat offenders, and that Congress had passed in 1970 legislation that gave U.S. attorneys the authority to lengthen prison terms dramatically, a tool that gave Whitaker \u201cdiscretion to impose longer jail times than other parts of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhitaker\u2019s record on drug sentencing is newly relevant after President Trump ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general this month and replaced him with Whitaker, who was Sessions\u2019s chief of staff,\u201d Kranish reports. \u201cTrump last week announced his support for legislation that would give judges more discretion in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders and reducing prison terms. Sessions had opposed the bill. Now Whitaker, as acting head of the Justice Department, is in a powerful position to try to influence the outcome.\u201d\n\nA doctor holds Truvada pills at her office in San Francisco. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\n\u2014The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential panel of medical experts, is now recommending physicians offer preventive medication to individuals who are at high risk of acquiring HIV.\n\nThe task force is also recommending that more doctors have a conversation about preventive drugs with their patients, our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports. The panel \u201cestimated that 1.2 million people are eligible for the daily drug regimen, which is very effective at preventing HIV infection, but only 78,360 took the medication in 2016,\u201d he reports.\n\n\u201cPre-exposure prophylaxis, known as PrEP, is a combination of two drugs \u2014 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine \u2014 made by Gilead Sciences and marketed as Truvada,\u201d Bernstein adds. \u201cTaken daily in a single pill, the FDA-approved medication greatly reduces the chance of acquiring HIV, according to research cited by the task force. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that PrEP cuts the risk of contracting HIV through sex by more than 90 percent and reduces the risk by more than 70 percent for intravenous drug users.\u201d\n\nThe medication is also quite pricey. According to drugmaker Gilead, the cost is nearly $1,676 for a 30-day supply. Bernstein adds \u201cmost insurance covers the drugs, but critics have cited out-of-pocket costs as perhaps the biggest obstacle to staying on the medication.\u201d\n\n\u2014 After a physician, a pharmacy resident and a police officer were killed at a Chicago hospital on Monday night, physicians and nurses across the country expressed agony over the latest instance of gun violence that one doctor said \u201chits too close to home,\u201d as our Post colleague Lindsey Bever reports.\n\nThe shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical Center in Chicago also follows after the National Rifle Association called on doctors earlier this month to \u201cstay in their lane,\u201d and not weigh in on gun policy.\n\n\u201cIt sparked a backlash from medical professionals across the United States and abroad, voicing their disdain on social media with the hashtag #ThisIsOurLane,\u201d Bever writes. \u201cAfter the Chicago shooting, the medical community returned to Twitter, extending prayers and pledging to fight.

And Washington\u2019s lead in the division is down to a tenuous one-game advantage over Dallas, which has won two in a row.\n\nEven though it is still November, Thursday\u2019s game feels like a must for the Redskins. Here are five keys to victory.\n\nGet Adrian Peterson running\n\nThis was the No. 1 key the last time Washington played Dallas and it remains the top key for the Redskins. When Peterson is running and running for a lot of yards, they win. Every time he has had at least 96 yards the Redskins have won. Even though the Cowboys have a strong run defense, Washington needs to give Peterson the ball . . . a lot.\n\n[Colt McCoy on starting for Redskins: \u2018I certainly don\u2019t take this for granted\u2019]\n\nPeterson says he is finally healthy after separating his shoulder and spraining his ankle earlier in the season. Most of his best runs have come after a hit \u2014 sometimes more than one. A lot of Peterson, especially in the second half, might be what the Redskins need.\n\nStop Ezekiel Elliott\n\nThe Cowboys running back is their one constant. Sometimes quarterback Dak Prescott plays well, sometimes he doesn\u2019t. But when Elliott is powering through the line, Dallas can be hard to stop.\n\nIn their October matchup, Elliott had just 33 rushing yards. It made the Cowboys one-dimensional, and Washington was able to build a big lead and hold on in the fourth quarter. If Elliott finds holes, Washington won\u2019t be so lucky.\n\nWin the turnover battle\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 defense has been adept at forcing turnovers. Many of their wins have come simply because they have gotten opponents to surrender the ball. Even with Smith\u2019s two interceptions last week, Washington moved up to +12 in takeaway/giveaway margin.\n\n[Redskins don\u2019t know if Trent Williams, other injured starters will play versus Cowboys]\n\nWashington has done well this year winning the field position game and there is no better way to shorten a field than getting a turnover. The Redskins would do well to get one early. They have won every game in which they scored first and lost those in which they didn\u2019t.\n\nProtect Colt McCoy\n\nTackle Trent Williams might be back, which would be a relief to the Redskins, who have had to do without their top offensive lineman. Williams\u2019s surgically repaired thumb seems to be improving, but there\u2019s no sense of whether he will be able to play on Thursday.\n\nWashington has won one and lost one with a patched-together line. And while Dallas doesn\u2019t have the pass rush of Houston, it can be dangerous. If McCoy is to have any success, he needs time to throw. It will be up to a line with two new guards (one just two weeks removed from being out-of-work) to keep Smith safe.\n\nLet Colt be Colt\n\nWhile it is important for the Redskins to be able to run Peterson, they can\u2019t be competitive if McCoy is restricted. He knows Washington\u2019s offense intimately, which helps, but the Redskins need him to be able to throw. He had some good passes in Sunday\u2019s loss \u2014 including a touchdown throw to Jordan Reed.\n\nMcCoy will take more chances than Smith. And while the Redskins played their best when Smith didn\u2019t force passes, that approach won\u2019t work for most quarterbacks. McCoy needs to throw and open up a sluggish passing game.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nWhy CBS showed only one replay of Alex Smith\u2019s injury\n\nExactly 33 years since his own injury, Joe Theismann \u2018so upset\u2019 for Alex Smith\n\nAs Colt McCoy takes over, he tells team, \u2018You\u2019re in good hands with me\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Gunmen kidnap 23-year-old Italian volunteer and injure 5 others on Kenyan coast", "description": "It was the first abduction of a foreigner since a spate of al-Shabab attacks six years ago.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/gunmen-kidnap-23-year-old-italian-volunteer-and-injure-5-others-on-kenyan-coast/2018/11/21/fb05a714-ed89-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:25:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "A child who was injured when an Italian volunteer was kidnapped in Chakama receives treatment at the Malindi district hospital in Kenya on Wednesday.

No group has claimed responsibility.\n\nThe Italian charity that Silvia Costanza Romano was volunteering with, Africa Milele, released a brief statement on its website saying: \u201cThere are no words to comment on what is happening.

We were told to lie down, and they began shooting while they went away,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\n\nThis June 2018 photo shows Silvia Costanza Romano, 23, the Italian volunteer who was kidnapped Tuesday. (Silvia Cristaldi/AP)\n\nMultiple witnesses in the village said the assailants dragged the woman toward a nearby river and eventually crossed it with her, shooting indiscriminately as they went. Police said a 10-year-old child was shot in the eye and a 12-year-old was shot in the thigh.\n\n\u201cRight now, the people are afraid,\u201d said Albert Chome, a village elder in Chakama. \u201cWe are especially afraid to cross the river. We don\u2019t know where the terrorists are.

Chome says Abdi booked three nights in a local guesthouse.\n\nKenya\u2019s coast thrives on tourism, and a series of abductions in 2011 and 2012 by al-Shabab led to a regional economic slump.\n\nTwo incidents in particular made international headlines: In 2011, a wheelchair-bound French woman was kidnapped on Manda Island, a short distance from Lamu Island, one of Kenya\u2019s premier tourist destinations. The kidnapping came just weeks after a British man was killed and his wife kidnapped from another island close to the border with Somalia. The French woman died, while the British woman was released for a ransom.\n\nGideon Saburi, the deputy governor of Kilifi county, where Chakama is located, called for greater vigilance and increased security presence in the area.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a security camp here or at least a police post,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many years peace has prevailed and so we have relaxed.

The argument doesn\u2019t survive scrutiny.\n\nTrump has been trying to advance a version of this claim since Khashoggi\u2019s Oct. 2 disappearance stirred suspicions he was killed at the hands of his native government. And the president revived it Tuesday as he waved away any imperative to act on the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did in fact order the assassination.\n\nIn an oddly rambling, 634-word statement announcing that he is effectively moving on from the matter, Trump said the kingdom has committed to spending $450 billion in the United States, \u201ca record amount of money\u201d that will \u201ccreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development and much additional wealth\u201d for the country.\n\nThe president\u2019s assertions, which he has steadily inflated in recent weeks, are off by orders of magnitude, as my colleague Glenn Kessler has documented.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where Trump got the $450 billion figure. And most of the military deals Trump is counting amount to memorandums of intent \u2014 not signed contracts. Six specific sales agreements, worked out during the Obama administration and notified to Congress then, total $28 billion. The Pentagon said last month the number is even smaller, with Saudi Arabia having signed \u201cletters of offer and acceptance\u201d for $14.5 billion in weaponry. That is a fraction of the $110 billion that Trump said the Saudis have committed to spend in that category. (The Trump administration itself said the arms sales would produce \u201ctens of thousands of jobs,\u201d a figure Trump has subsequently placed as high as 1 million.)\n\nThe rest of the incoming investment Trump is touting would come from commercial deals, but his math there rests on \u201cdouble-counting, wishful thinking and fuzzy figures,\u201d as Glenn has written. For example, the White House has chalked up $100 billion to investments from a fund established by Softbank and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. But Softbank has said only half of that sum is U.S.-bound.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. (Reuters/Amir Levy)\n\nTrump repeated the claim while addressing reporters Tuesday before heading to Mar-a-Lago for Thanksgiving. \u201cThey\u2019re paying us $400 billion-plus to invest in our country. That\u2019s probably the biggest amount ever paid to the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not clear what Trump means. But the trading relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is not especially significant. Last year, Saudi Arabia ranked 20th as a destination for American goods. And U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia have actually dipped over the last two years. Switzerland, whose economy is roughly comparable in size to Saudi Arabia\u2019s, buys more from the United States, as Bloomberg has noted.\n\nTrump also argued for the need to protect American access to Saudi Arabian oil. \u201cTrump also referred to Saudi Arabia as \u2018after the United States . . . the largest oil producing nation in the world,\u2019 and said the Saudis have been \u2018responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels,\u2019\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey, Shane Harris and Karen DeYoung write. \u201cTrump indicated that in anticipation of the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports early this month, he had made a deal with Riyadh to keep its own production high to avoid a spike in oil prices. But U.S. sanction waivers granted to most of Iran\u2019s major customers have kept prices unusually low, and the Saudis said last week that they intended to cut production.\u201d\n\nU.S. oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in more than a year after the comments. But prices have already slid more than 20 percent since early October, as supplies have increased and worries about a global slowdown take hold.\n\nThe U.S. gets about 11 percent of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, but it is now the world\u2019s largest oil producer. And American production is rising at its fastest pace in a century, a development that hands the U.S. leverage it hasn't seen in decades.\n\n\"The U.S. energy surge presents OPEC with one of the biggest challenges of its 60-year history,\" Bloomberg's Javier Blas reports this morning. \"If Saudi Arabia and its allies cut production to keep prices higher, shale will thrive, robbing them of market share. But because the Saudis need higher crude prices to make [more] money than U.S. producers, OPEC can\u2019t afford to let prices fall.\"\n\nBut focusing on the bean-counting risks missing the bigger picture. For one, there\u2019s a mysterious incongruence at the core of Trump\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019m not going to destroy the world economy and I\u2019m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.\n\nYet as the president makes excuses for leaders of a relatively marginal trading partner, he continues pressing trade hostilities with more stalwart allies. The administration has yet to lift metals tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for example, and is weighing whether to slap tariffs on auto imports from Europe and beyond \u2014 developments that are already weighing on American companies and dragging on business investment at home.\n\nThen there\u2019s the more basic question: Even stipulating that the president\u2019s claims about Saudi investments proved true, would they justify abandoning U.S. values? A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers is answering that in the negative, ripping Trump's defense of Saudi denials and demanding stronger sanctions against the country be included in a year-end budget deal.\n\nProgramming note: We\u2019re publishing an abbreviated version of the newsletter today and will be dark on Thursday and Friday in observance of Thanksgiving.

WSJ's Corrie Driebusch: \"Mounting concerns about the pace of growth spurred fresh declines in stocks around the world Tuesday, wiping out yearly gains for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.What started as a selloff in shares of highflying technology companies bled into other corners of the financial markets, as investors drove down prices for everything from shares of retailers and energy companies to oil and bitcoin.\n\n\"The latest bout of selling left investors grappling anew with concerns that the nearly 10-year bull market could be running out of steam, even as ongoing growth in U.S. jobs, manufacturing, and corporate earnings signal to many that a recession isn\u2019t imminent.\"\n\nWhy is this happening? One theory, via the WSJ: \"Some traders who stepped in to scoop up shares in late October, hoping for a quick rebound, are now in danger of losing those potential profits and more. That puts the stock market in a tenuous position, several said. 'The buy-the-dippers are getting concerned,' said Justin Wiggs, managing director in equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nThe stock market as a warning signal. NYT's Matt Phillips: \"In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that [Trump\u2019s] global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits.

WSJ's Greg Ip writes that fading fiscal stimulus, Fed tightening and slowing global growth could force a reckoning: \"The question is whether markets, in adjusting to these new realities, will overreact to the point that they endanger the expansion, on track to become the longest ever next summer. The answer for now appears to be no, but the trends are troubling. Assessing forward-looking market and economic data, economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. put the odds of a recession beginning in the next 12 months at around one in three. A year ago, their models put the probability at 8% to 27%.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump blames the Fed again. CNBC's Fred Imbert: \"Trump once again took a shot at the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, saying he would like to see lower rates from the U.S. central bank in answering a question on the state of the economy and financial markets. 'I'd like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate. I think the rate's too high. I think we have much more of a Fed problem than we have a problem with anyone else,' Trump said to reporters outside the White House. 'I think your tech stocks have some problems.'\"\n\nThe Fed isn't likely to budge. WSJ\u2019s Nick Timiraos and Gregory Zuckerman: \"Market turbulence is leading some investors to call on the Federal Reserve to halt its campaign of interest rate increases, but the selloff in stocks and corporate bonds that accelerated Tuesday is unlikely to stop the central bank from raising rates when it meets again next month. Fed officials have signaled in recent days they plan to proceed with another quarter percentage point increase in their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet Dec. 19, marking their fourth rate increase this year.

You won\u2019t want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nKelly Monroe, investigator with the Georgia Secretary of State's office takes a look at a new voting machine that produces a paper record being tested at a polling site in Conyers, Ga. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)\n\nSeveral states still have not taken action to ensure their voting machines produce a paper trail, stoking concerns that voters may again head to the polls in 2020 without this widely accepted security practice in place.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterms, 13 states \u2014 including Georgia, Texas and Pennsylvania \u2014 were home to at least some precincts that relied on electronic voting machines without paper backups -- leaving them without a way to verify election results in the event of a cyber attack on the systems. (Florida, luckily, largely had a paper trail.) An even larger number of states lack backup paper ballots for people with disabilities.\n\nThere seem to have been no major failures in the 2018 midterms when it came to voting security. But experts warn that was no thanks to old voting machines, a patchwork state and county system and the failure of many states to ensure they have a paper trail should electronic voting machines fail.\n\nLawrence Norden, the deputy director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program, said some states, such as Delaware, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, are working to replace equipment to ensure there is a paper trail by 2020. But at least six of states \u2014 including many counties in Texas \u2014 are still likely to rely entirely on paperless machines in the next presidential election, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the stories out of the election was our antiquated systems were failing us,\u201d Norden said.\n\nAfter revelations of Russia\u2019s campaign to hack the 2016 election, states such as Virginia rushed to ensure they had a paper ballot trail in the case of electronic failures. But a lack of funding and concerns over who controls local election processes are hampering efforts to secure voting infrastructure. In the months leading up to the midterms, policymakers conceded the necessary changes to systems would be impossible, so officials instead set their sights on 2020.\n\nThe stakes are higher for the presidential election, which will undoubtedly be a bigger target for possible foreign or domestic interference.\n\nBut immediate assistance from the federal level isn't likely to be forthcoming. A GOP Senate staffer told me on Tuesday it\u2019s \u201cdoubtful\u201d the Secure Elections Act will get floor time during the lame-duck congressional session. A bipartisan group of senators introduced the bill, which initially required states receiving federal assistance for election security have a paper ballot trail. But revisions to the bill significantly watered down those measures, sparking a partisan feud. The bill stalled this summer following resistance from the White House and some state officials.\n\nMarian Schneider, president of Verified Voting, said election security should be recognized as a national security issue following evidence of Russian interference n 2016.\n\n\u201cThe cost to replace the machines throughout the country would be a fraction of our homeland security budget,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see this as a threat because of the decentralized nature of our election system.\u201d\n\nElection security advocates pointed to Georgia as a case study for the necessity of paper backups. Though there are no reports implicating the insecurity of Georgia's voting machines, there were issues with old machines functioning properly on Election Day. Georgia does not have paper backups statewide \u2014 stoking concerns as security threats were politicized during the tight race for governor.\n\nAfter activists brought a lawsuit against the state, a judge denied a motion to force Georgia to adopt a paper backup system in the weeks before the midterms, my colleague Ellen Nakashima reported. However, the judge indicated she may compel the state to do so in the future.\n\nFunding remains the biggest barrier for states seeking to update their systems. Many Pennsylvania counties, including Philadelphia, did not have paper backups in this year's elections. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's administration has told counties to backup their electronic tallies with a paper trail by 2020. But the estimated price tag \u2014 $125 million \u2014 may complicate the matter. The state's 2018-2019 budget only earmarked $14 million for election security, primarily from a $380 million congressional package earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe original allocation that comes out of Congress right now has been woefully inadequate,\u201d said David Hickton, who co-leads the state\u2019s independent, nonpartisan election security commission. He\u2019s working to see whether the state can strike public-private partnerships with voting machine companies to make up the gap.\n\nNorden said Texas, Indiana, Tennessee, Kansas, Mississippi and Kentucky have made no promises, increasing the possibility they won't have paper backups in place for the next presidential election.\n\nDemocrats called for paper ballots in Tennessee earlier this year, but state election coordinator Mark Goins said the election systems were secure and dismissed those calls, according to a Tennessean report. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) wanted the state to use some of the federal funding for election security to update to systems with a paper trail, but the state ultimately rejected that call.\n\n\u201cState leaders decided not to spend the money this year, but America\u2019s intelligence chiefs continue to warn us \u2014 we\u2019re vulnerable,\u201d Cooper told me. \u201cTennessee officials must listen and make improvements before 2020. Our right to vote is at stake.\u201d\n\nChris Davis, the chief of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators, told the Victoria Advocate that Texas counties should decide themselves what voting methods to use.\n\n\u201cI would trust no one else other than the election officer of that county to know what works for their county and the process for having voters vote in a secure way,\u201d Davis said in an interview with the Victoria Advocate.\n\nAccording to a Houston Public Media report, 46 Texas counties have upgraded their voting machines since the 2016 elections. But only 11 of those counties chose machines that have a paper backup.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misattributed the quote from Jim Cooper to Mark Goins.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\nPolitics Ivanka Trump\u2019s email use spurs bipartisan calls for investigation President Trump defended his daughter, but Republicans and Democrats in Congress demanded documents and said they\u2019ll look into her actions.

However, the Nations League is also a backdoor into the 2020 European Championship.\n\nThat\u2019s where things can get confusing.\n\nThere will still be a typical European Championship qualifying campaign, but 16 teams get a second chance through playoffs.\n\nIn spring 2020, the 2018 Nations League results will be dusted off as the qualifying criteria for the playoffs, handing places to the four best-placed teams from each Nations League tier who missed out in qualifying.\n\nCurrently, that means Kosovo is guaranteed a playoff spot but World Cup champion France isn\u2019t \u2014 although the French are almost certain to qualify for 2020 the usual way.\n\nMEANINGFULL MATCHES\n\nEurope\u2019s smallest teams finally have something to play for.\n\nThe likes of Georgia, Macedonia and Kosovo usually spend their time scrambling to organize barely watched friendlies. The Nations League gives them meaningful games and, since all three won their League D groups, a shot at qualifying for a European Championship \u2014 something that\u2019s normally all but impossible.\n\nGone are the days when several of the tiniest nations waited years to earn a single point. The Nations League division system means UEFA\u2019s smallest member, Gibraltar, was playing comparable opponents and earned two rare wins, while Luxembourg came within four points of winning its group.\n\nNo change for perennial struggler San Marino, though. It still lost all six of its games without scoring a goal.\n\nFANS UNSURE\n\nThe games may be exciting, but they\u2019re rarely sold out.\n\nThere were more than 20,000 empty seats in Gelsenkirchen for Germany\u2019s dramatic 2-2 draw with the Netherlands, while Tuesday\u2019s game between World Cup quarterfinalists Sweden and Russia was roundly criticized for its flat atmosphere even though promotion was at stake.\n\nFor Scotland\u2019s 3-2 home win over Israel \u2014 a promotion decider billed as the host nation\u2019s biggest game in a decade \u2014 Hampden Park was less than half full.\n\nThat shows that some European soccer fans have been slow to fall in love with the new Nations League format, though the old friendlies weren\u2019t always crowd pleasers.\n\nFIFA is sure to be watching, since president Gianni Infantino \u2014 formerly of UEFA \u2014 is looking to build a worldwide Nations League clone.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Alessandra Tarantino/AP)\n\nU.N. Special Representative for Libya Ghassan Salame indicated in a statement to the Security Council that a national conference should be convened at the start of 2019 to \u201ccreate a space for Libyans to crystallize their vision for the transition and no longer be ignored by their politicians.\u201d This follows a conference in Palermo, Italy, that brought together international partners and Libyan stakeholders to discuss the situation.\n\nSalame\u2019s framing suggests that the conference will seek to impose a new path, regardless of what existing institutions might want. In other words, Libya\u2019s transition plan, established in 2012, is being rebooted following a painful lack of progress on a number of fronts. The original plan consisted of organizing a constitutional referendum, to be followed by elections. That plan was put into question after the Libyan House of Representatives, a legislature elected in 2014 whose internal legitimacy is now contested, failed to adopt the needed referendum law for a combination of reasons, including internal political dynamics.\n\nWhile the conference\u2019s proposed mandate, decision-making rules and time frame have not been publicly discussed, it seems the idea is to create a narrative of the country coming together at one event. The conference would serve as a founding \u201cwe the people\u201d moment, resulting in a sense of legitimacy and authority to set new constitutional rules for a new Libya. Salame has only stated that the national conference will give \u201ca platform for, and give a voice to, the Libyan people.\u201d This has led to speculation that participants will be mainly drawn from the country\u2019s various social constituencies rather than limited to representatives of the country\u2019s main political forces.\n\nIs this the best way forward for Libya?\n\nLessons learned\n\nMany other countries in the region have experience with national conferences that offer lessons for Libya. Those experiences show that while national conferences create important opportunities, they are also fraught with risks.\n\nThe main feature of Yemen\u2019s failed post-2011 transition was the National Dialogue Conference, which was designed to give an important voice to social constituencies alongside the country\u2019s political forces. The transition eventually collapsed for a number of complex reasons. Of note, the discussions that took place in the conference did not reflect the quickly evolving power dynamics on the ground, which eventually imposed themselves through force of arms. The clear lesson for Libya is that attempts to impose decisions without the support of forces that control territory on the ground are likely to fail.\n\nThe situation of Somalia in 2012 has many similarities to that of Libya in 2018. Somalia, too, was mired in a long-standing conflict-ridden transition; the country sought a legitimate new political framework upon which to build a new state; and the Somalis, with international partners, were hammering out a constitution to be sent to referendum. Just as in Libya, at a certain point, a referendum was thought to be impossible, primarily because of security concerns and an inability to find consensus on critical issues.\n\nInstead, international and Somali officials organized a conference, the National Constituent Assembly, to provide legitimacy in adopting a \u201cProvisional Constitution.\u201d This would then pave the way for elections and a more permanent constitutional foundation for the state. However, more than six years later, the legitimacy of both the Provisional Constitution and the Somali state are still weak, inclusive elections have not been held, and the transitional period continues with little change in either the political elites or the lives of ordinary citizens.\n\nTunisia presents one of the only successful experiences with dialogue processes in the region, but the context and manner of proceeding will be extremely difficult to replicate in Libya. First, Tunisia\u2019s conference was convened by a number of civil society actors, whereas Libya\u2019s process is effectively being launched by the United Nations and will depend heavily on additional support from the international community. Secondly, Tunisia\u2019s conference lasted for over a year and made very slow progress, which most Libyans would probably view as highly undesirable. Finally, the Tunisian conference encouraged agreement between the country\u2019s main political forces, whereas in Libya, the rationale seems to be more to maneuver around political elites.\n\nPreconditions for moving forward\n\nLibya needs a way to move itself out of transition. A new constitution represents a birth certificate for a new state, a new social and political contract whose legitimacy and authority are grounded in the will of the people. As such, it is a critical milestone in exiting from transition and building foundations for a new society. In the case of Libya, a constitutional settlement would ideally help reconcile competing claims for legitimate authority and provide a common vision around which the state-building process can happen. However, even laying foundations requires certain conditions be met, such as minimal security and an acceptance of the main power holders who need to work together, or at least to channel conflict through politics rather than violence.\n\nThe question then poses itself \u2014 what can be done when those preconditions are not there? In Libya, the answer seems to be to hold a national, legitimizing event to create a narrative of a new beginning. Based on regional experience, perhaps we should be prepared that this may not be the dawn of a new Libya, but rather one step toward the end of the transition\u2019s beginning.\n\nZaid Al-Ali is senior adviser on constitution-building for Arab countries at International IDEA.\n\nSumit Bisarya is head of the Constitution Building Program at International IDEA."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The Latest: Brexit: Germany making it easier to fire bankers - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Latest: Brexit: Germany making it easier to fire bankers Washington Post LONDON \u2014 The Latest on negotiations over Britain's exit from the European Union (all times local):. 12:35 p.m..

Many Chinese social media users called the videos racist and full of outdated stereotypes.\n\nIn a statement from Milan headquarters, designers Gabbana and Domenico Dolce said, \u201cWhat happened today was very unfortunate not only for us, but also for all the people who worked day and night to bring this event to life.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai extravaganza was to include 300 models previewing a new collection on a rotating stage, including super model Eva Herzigova and Isabella Fontana during a brand DNA section, and a lineup of millennial stars and influencers for a second section dedicated to the future. The final part of the show was to be dedicated to Asia, with Asian models and a front row of Asian stars among the 1,000 invited guests, including actor Darren Wang, actor Jing Kang Liang, singer Stan Young and actress Bing Bing Lee, along with Wang and Zhang.\n\nAsia, and China in particular, is key to European luxury brands\u2019 success. A recent study by Bain consultancy said one-third of all high-end purchases are made by Chinese consumers, shopping both at home and abroad. That is expected to rise to 46 percent by 2025, fueled especially by millennials and generation Z teens.\n\nDolce&Gabbana has 44 boutiques in China, including four in Shanghai, having entered the Chinese market in Hangzhou in 2005.\n\nDolce told The Associated Press in an email interview before the controversy erupted that the designers had planned an \u201chomage to China, to celebrate the country, and at the same time, to tell our story and love for fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019We want to give life to a great show that we hope will be unforgettable to everyone.

(John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nTechnology columnist\n\nSure, you could choose a smart speaker based on sound or price. The go-to gadget gift of the season is available from Amazon, Apple and Google with better acoustics, new touch screens and deep holiday discounts.\n\nBut you\u2019re not just buying a talking jukebox. Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant also want to adjust the thermostat, fill your picture frame or even microwave your popcorn. Each artificial intelligence assistant has its own ways of running a home. You\u2019re choosing which tribe is yours.\n\nI call it a tribe because each has a distinct culture \u2014 and demands loyalty. This decision will shape how you get information, what appliances you purchase, where you shop and how you protect your privacy. One in 10 Americans plan to buy a smart speaker this year, according to the Consumer Technology Association. And Amazon says its Echo Dot is the best-selling speaker, ever.\n\nThe last time we had to choose a tech tribe like this was when smartphones arrived. Did you go iPhone, Android, or cling to a Blackberry? A decade later, it\u2019s increasingly hard to fathom switching between iPhone and Android. (A recent Match.com survey found iPhone and Android people don\u2019t even like dating each other.) Now imagine how hard it will be to change when you\u2019ve wired stuff into your walls.\n\nIn my test lab \u2014 I mean, living room \u2014 an Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod sit side by side and the voice AIs battle it out to run my home like genies in high-tech bottles. Here\u2019s the shorthand I\u2019ve learned: Alexa is for accessibility. Google Assistant is for brainpower. And Siri is for security.\n\nAmazon\u2019s aggressive expansion makes Alexa the one I recommend, and use, the most. Google\u2019s Assistant is coming from behind, matching feature by feature \u2014 and Siri, the original voice assistant, feels held back by Apple\u2019s focus on privacy and its software shortcomings.\n\n(Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye.)\n\nSmart speakers are building the smart home that you never knew you needed. Inside the audio equipment, they\u2019re home hub computers that work alongside smartphone apps to connect and control disparate devices and services. Now with a speaker and the right connected gizmo, you can walk into a room and turn on the lights without touching a button. Or control the TV without a remote. Amazon even sells an Alexa-operated microwave that cooks, tracks and reorders popcorn.\n\nBut home assistants can also be Trojan horses for a specific set of devices and services that favor one company over another.\n\nMy buddy Matt recently asked me to help him pick speakers and appliances for a big remodel. He loves the Google Assistant on his Android phone, so selecting his tribe should be easy, right? Hardly: He wanted to put Sonos speakers all around the house, but they take voice commands directly via Alexa. (Sonos says Google Assistant support is coming, though it\u2019s been promising that for a year.)\n\n\n\nLutron Caseta-connected light switches work with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri smart homes. (John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nFiguring out which connected doodads are compatible can be like solving a 10,000-piece puzzle. The best smart home gadgets (like Lutron Caseta and Philips Hue lights) work across all three tribes, but sometimes alliances and technical concerns make appliance makers take sides.\n\nEach AI has its limitations. They\u2019re not all equally skilled at understanding accents \u2014 Southerners are misunderstood more with Google and Midwesterners with Alexa. The price of ownership with some is letting a company surveil what goes on in your house. You can try, like me, to live with more than one, but you\u2019re left with a patchwork that won\u2019t win you any favors with family.\n\nHow do you find your AI tribe? Here\u2019s how I differentiate them.\n\n\n\nGoogle Home, Amazon's Echo and the Apple's HomePod double as smart home hubs. (John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nAlexa\n\nSupported smart home devices: Over 20,000.\n\nWho loves it: Families who buy lots through Amazon and experiment with new gizmos.\n\nThe good: Alexa knows how to operate the most stuff, thanks to Amazon\u2019s superior dealmaking. The only connected things it can\u2019t run in my house are the app-operated garage door and some facets of my TV. Amazon also has been successful at spawning new connected gadgets: Alexa\u2019s voice and microphone are built into more than 100 non-Amazon devices. And Amazon recently announced plans to offer appliance makers a chip that lets Alexa users voice command inexpensive everyday things, from wall plugs to fans.\n\nAlexa has also mastered some of the little details of home life. It will confirm a request to turn off the lights without repeating your command \u2014 super helpful when someone nearby is napping.\n\nThe bad: Alexa grows smarter by the week, but it can be a stickler about using specific syntax. It also has the weakest relationship with your phone, the most important piece of technology for most people today. Amazon has bolstered a companion Alexa app for phones, making it better for communicating and setting up smart home routines, but I still find it the most confusing of the lot.\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t always show the highest concern for our privacy. This spring, when Alexa inadvertently recorded a family\u2019s private conversations and sent it to a contact, Amazon\u2019s response boiled down to \u201cwhoopsie.\u201d And it records and keeps every conversation you have with the AI \u2014 including every bag of popcorn it microwaves. (Amazon says it doesn\u2019t use our queries to sell us stuff beyond making recommendations based on song and product searches).\n\nSome love Alexa\u2019s ability to order products by voice. But as long as Alexa runs your house, you\u2019ll always be stuck buying those goods from Amazon. (That microwave will only ever order popcorn from Amazon.) The coming generation of appliances built with the Alexa chip inside could similarly trap you forever into Amazon-land.\n\n\n\nThe Amazon Basics Microwave, $60, takes commands from Alexa \u2014 and even keeps track of your popcorn supplies. (John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nGoogle Assistant\n\nSupported smart home devices: Over 10,000.\n\nWho loves it: People who are deep into Google\u2019s services.\n\nThe good: Google Assistant comes the closest to having a conversation with an actual human helper. You don\u2019t have to use exact language to make things happen or get useful answers. Its intelligence can also be delightfully personal: It\u2019s pretty good at differentiating the voices of family members. And on the new Home Hub device with a screen, Assistant curates a highlights-only show from your Google Photos collection.\n\nWhile Android phone owners are more likely to use lots of Assistant-friendly Google services, the Assistant doesn\u2019t particularly care what kind of phone you use \u2014 its simple companion apps work on iOS and Android.\n\nAnd Google is neck and neck with Alexa on many of the nuances: Night mode reduces the volume of answers at night, and it can even require Junior to say \u201cpretty please.\u201d\n\nThe bad: As a relative newcomer to the smart home, Google has been catching up fast. But in my house, it still can\u2019t fully control my Ring doorbell or send music to my Sonos speakers. And I\u2019m not convinced that Google has Amazon\u2019s negotiating sway, or the influence to bring the next generation of connected things online.\n\nThe bigger problem is privacy. Google\u2019s endgame is always getting you to spend more time with its services, so it can gather more data to target ads at you. Like Alexa, Google Assistant keeps a recording of all your queries \u2014 every time you ask it to turn off the lights. Google treats this kind of like your Web search history, and uses it to target ads elsewhere. (Thankfully, it still keeps data from its Nest thermostat and home security division separate.) The potential upside is that when Google discovers your habits in all that data, it might be able to better automate your home \u2014 like what time all the lights should be off.\n\n\n\nThe new $150 Google Home Hub serves as a smart speaker, smart home control center and family photo frame. (John Brecher for The Washington Post)\n\nSiri\n\nSupported smart home devices: Hundreds.\n\nWho loves it: Privacy buffs and all-Apple households.\n\nThe good: Apple means business on security and privacy. Any device that wants to connect to HomeKit, its smart home software that works with Siri on the HomePod and iPhone, requires special encryption.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, your data is not attached to a personal profile, which aside from protecting your privacy also means that Apple is not using your home activity to sell or advertise things. (While other smart speakers keep recordings and transcriptions of what you say, Siri controls devices by making a request to its system through a random identifier, which cannot be tied to a specific user.)\n\nAnd Apple is pretty good at keeping the smart home simple. Setting up a smart home device is mostly just scanning a special code. Even creating routines, in which multiple accessories work in combination with a single command, is easier in the Siri\u2019s companion Home app than with competitors.\n\nThe bad: You have to live in an all-Apple device world to reap these benefits. Siri\u2019s a pretty good DJ, but only if you subscribe to Apple Music. You\u2019re stuck with the HomePod as the one-size-fits-all smart speaker, and Siri still isn\u2019t as competent as her AI competitors.\n\nAnd Apple\u2019s security-first approach has kept too many appliance makers from joining its ecosystem. Sure, it\u2019s quality not quantity, but Siri still can\u2019t interact with my Nest thermostat or Ring doorbell, just to name two. Apple did recently loosen up a tad: starting with Belkin Wemo\u2019s Mini Smart Plug and Dimmer, it no longer requires special hardware for authentication \u2014 that can now happen via software. The move should make it simpler to make new products Siri compatible, and allow it access to existing ones.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.

(Daniela Tejada via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 A British academic was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday in the United Arab Emirates on charges that he was spying for the U.K. \u2014 a verdict that Britain described as shocking as it urged its Mideast ally to reconsider the decision.\n\nMatthew Hedges, a 31-year-old PhD student in Middle Eastern Studies at Durham University, was arrested at Dubai Airport on May 5 and has been held in detention since.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had travelled to the UAE last week and discussed the case with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. He described the situation as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\nHedges can challenge the ruling within 30 days.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances,\u201d Hunt said in a statement which underscored his surprise at the decision.\n\nThe harsh verdict is unusual for a British national in the UAE who is not accused of a violent crime.\n\nThe emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are home to large numbers of British nationals who work in a range of positions, from top management jobs and public relations to teaching and athletics. Ties between Britain and the seven emirates of the UAE run deep, dating back more than 200 years. The British were among the first contracted to help build the UAE\u2019s infrastructure after oil was discovered there in the early 1960s and retain a multimillion dollar arms trade.\n\nThe Muslim country on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula prides itself on being tolerant of foreigners, and of being tourist-friendly. But British nationals have run afoul of local customs and laws, which prohibit public intoxication, kissing in public and cursing at someone \u2014 which can all lead to arrest and deportation.\n\nThe Federal Appeals Court of Abu Dhabi said Hedges was found guilty of \u201cspying on the UAE and providing sensitive security and intelligence information to third parties.\u201d\n\nLocal papers say police secured evidence of his activities from Hedges\u2019 electronic devices and surveillance by Emirati intelligence. Durham University, meanwhile, said that there was no reason to believe Hedges \u201cwas conducting anything other than legitimate academic research.\u201d\n\nThe UAE has come under criticism for its vast surveillance network. While it helps to track down criminals quickly and keeps the country among the safest in the world, the network has also been used to go after critics and those conducting sensitive research. Rights organizations and some academics have been barred from the country and stopped from conducting research on the conditions of laborers from countries such as India and Nepal who build high-rise towers and sprawling malls in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nA number of faculty and students at New York University have reportedly been barred from entering the UAE for work deemed critical of the government, despite the university having a campus in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Hedges was detained at Dubai International Airport as he was preparing to leave the country following two weeks in the UAE. His wife says he was doing fieldwork for his doctoral thesis on the impact of Emirati security and foreign policies.\n\nThe academic was charged after more than a month in detention, the group said.\n\n\u201cUAE rulers cannot claim to preside over a global knowledge and education hub while locking up academics for months in solitary confinement,\u201d Michael Page of Human Rights Watch said.\n\nBritain had until now been restrained in commenting on the case, citing ongoing legal proceedings. Officials have declined to comment on intelligence matters, in keeping with government policy.\n\nHedges\u2019 wife Daniela Tejada, who was in court, said she was in \u201ccomplete shock.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatthew is innocent,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them.\u201d\n\nUrging the British government to make a stand for him, she added: \u201cI am very scared for Matt.

(Chiang Ying-ying/AP)\n\nTaiwanese voters will determine the outcome of 10 referendums Nov. 24 as well as local elections. This will not be the first time this autonomous island has held referendums, although none succeeded in the past.\n\nThis time, the story could be different. A recent change reduced the threshold requirement from 50 percent of eligible voters to just 25 percent in favor of the question \u2014 and a simple majority will suffice. And the new law decreased the referendum voting age from 20 to 18. This lower threshold suggests that it might be easier to pass referendums, impacting Taiwan\u2019s domestic politics as well as its international relations.\n\nHere are three things you need to know about these referendums:\n\n1. Cross-partisan issues are on the rise\n\nThe public will make direct decisions on three major issues: same-sex marriage, the environment and a name change for Taiwan. Unlike in 2004 and 2008, civic organizations proposed most of these November referendums. Out of the 37 proposals since January, political parties put forward only five. Only 10 referendums collected enough signatures to get on the November ballot.\n\nCivic organizations on opposite ends of the political spectrum have proposed conflicting referendums on marriage equality, with proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage found across parties. For example, the pro-Kuomintang (KMT) Happiness of the Next Generation has coalesced with the pro-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Presbyterian leaders \u2014 their referendum will determine whether Taiwan\u2019s Civil Code should define marriage strictly as between a man and a woman. Equal Love Taiwan, another civic group, proposed a referendum that would let voters decide whether the Civil Code marriage regulations should guarantee the rights of same-sex couples to get married.\n\n[China-U.S.-Taiwan relations are in choppy waters. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on.]\n\nThe name \u201c Chinese Taipei \u201d has allowed Taiwan to participate in the Olympics and other international sports events. Under a referendum proposed by a civic group, teams instead would compete under the name \u201cTaiwan.\u201d\n\nThe active participation of civil society in the referendum process suggests that individuals look to express their preferences with a direct vote, rather than follow the lead of major political parties. The opposition KMT proposed two partisan referendums, aimed at repealing the DPP\u2019s nuclear-free policy and other environmental issues related to energy.\n\n2. The ruling DPP has been noncommittal\n\nPresident Tsai Ing-wen has been particularly quiet on the referendums, a striking contrast to the left-leaning positions on progressive issues that helped her win the presidency in 2016. The ruling party even contradicted its own platform by prohibiting its members from rallying for the name change to \u201cTaiwan.\u201d\n\nTsai\u2019s stance appears to be strategic. Her government has resisted approving same-sex marriage legislation, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to recognize same-sex unions in 2017. Tsai and the DPP\u2019s non-stance appears calculated to secure votes from conservative older generations from rural areas \u2014 at the risk of losing young voters.\n\n3. The DPP may be facing a rocky road\n\nUrban youths are the primary advocates for same-sex marriage. According to a July survey conducted by the Marriage Equality Coalition , more than 80 percent of the population below 35 supported same-sex marriage, but only 30 percent of the over-45 group shared similar sentiments. Moreover, our analysis based on the distribution of signatures for referendums on same-sex marriage shows that these youths are concentrated in cities where Tsai had barely won in the 2016 elections.\n\nConversely, the DPP\u2019s core constituency \u2014 rural voters in Southern Taiwan \u2014 seems indifferent about the legalization of same-sex unions. The different positions on marriage equality within the DPP means Tsai cannot please both camps and risks losing the support of young urban voters.\n\nThe KMT, meanwhile, is gaining younger and newer KMT members in both villages and cities, who are the leading mobilizers in reactivating coal-fired power plants. Our analysis suggests that the shift in youth support to the KMT may leave the DPP on a rocky road in this election.\n\n[Beijing wants Taiwanese to identify as Chinese. But how do Taiwanese really feel?]\n\nIndependence supporters are the main force behind the name-change referendum. The DPP has discouraged its members\u2019 participation in activities related to the name change, seeking to avoid angering status-quo supporters, as well as China and the United States. In an August poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, 65 percent of respondents were in favor of the name change. The overwhelming support indicates that voters may express their frustrations with the DPP in the November midterm elections. A key indicator to watch is Kaohsiung City, Taiwan\u2019s third-largest city, ruled by the DPP since 1998. The DPP mayoral candidate won 68 percent of the votes in 2014 \u2014 but recent polls suggest that the DPP may fare no better than Sen. Ted Cruz, who won a narrow victory in Texas.\n\nWhat are the implications for Taiwan\u2019s future?\n\nAccording to the National Security Studies Surveys conducted by Duke University , 2017 was the first time in history when more than half of the Taiwanese population were not attached to any political party. The ongoing referendum debates suggest that the nonpartisan trend is likely to continue, which could be problematic for Taiwan\u2019s democracy in the long run.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Political parties serve as an important platform for coordinating resources, votes and policies. Taiwan\u2019s voters will consider pro/anti-same-sex marriage referendums and pro/anti-nuclear energy referendums. If opposing referendums pass, although unlikely, how could a democratic government implement the self-contradictory will of the people?\n\nAnd the name-change referendum may have political consequences for Taiwan\u2019s relations with China, as well as Taiwan\u2019s status in the world. If Taiwan votes to compete under \u201cTaiwan\u201d instead of \u201cChinese Taipei,\u201d China may pressure the International Olympic Committee to prohibit Taiwan from participating in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics . China may also retaliate using even more severe tactics, such as putting pressure on Taiwan\u2019s few remaining diplomatic allies to terminate the recognition of Taiwan as an independent nation.\n\nWhile voters may see the appeal of direct involvement in political decisions, referendums pose a dilemma for Tsai and her party. After Nov. 24, Tsai will confront the consequences of these referendums on Taiwan\u2019s domestic political stability and its relations with China. More importantly, when it is possible that direct voting becomes a norm, look out for how Taiwan consolidates its democracy by avoiding \u201cthe tyranny of the majority\u201d \u2014 the majority of an electorate placing its own interests above and at the expense of those in the minority.\n\nShan-Jan Sarah Liu is an assistant professor in the School of Geography, Politics and Sociology at Newcastle University in Britain.

The shooter later killed himself.\n\nQuick told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that he grabbed the gun from the shooter when it jammed, which gave people time to escape, and hit him with it, though the shooter was able to get the gun back and hit Quick with it.

Several people escaped while Quick was fighting with the shooter.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat reported that FSU President John Thrasher and members of the Board of Trustees committed $30,000 for Quick to use on law school expenses.

To connect users with police, the Taser is always paired with Noonlight\u2019s app, officials from both companies told The Washington Post. When the trigger on the Taser Pulse+ is pulled, a beacon on the device communicates with the app, which alerts authorities that a likely emergency is unfolding. Using information from the app, including GPS, responding authorities have access to the user\u2019s identification and location, even when someone is fleeing the scene of the incident.\n\n\u201cEverything happens in real time,\u201d said Nick Droege, the co-founder of Noonlight. \u201cWe dispatch emergency services, and the user is getting a text message and a phone call from us so they can explain what\u2019s happened, and 911 dispatchers are also seeing this information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe might also have their health information, which includes information about allergies and medication use, and their picture from their profile information,\u201d he added.\n\nIf a Taser owner presses the device\u2019s trigger while the safety is on, Pratt said, police aren\u2019t alerted. If customers don\u2019t need assistance from authorities after firing the weapon \u2014 or if they\u2019ve mistakenly pulled the trigger \u2014 a user can cancel an active alarm by sharing a four-digit code after they receive a text from the company\u2019s dispatchers asking them whether they need help.\n\nThe Taser Pulse+ has a 15-foot range and is designed to incapacitate someone for 30 seconds, Pratt said. The device, which includes access to Noonlight, costs about $470, according to Axon.\n\nThe company declined to reveal how many individuals have purchased its Tasers and what percentage of its customer base are individual owners vs. law enforcement agencies.\n\nTasers remain controversial because of the physical toll they can exact and a track record that calls into question their effectiveness, according to some experts.\n\n\u201cElectronic weapons rarely work all the time,\u201d Ron Martinelli, a forensic criminologist, told CNN in 2015, noting that incapacitation can hinge upon where and how both electrical probes strike the body. \u201cHistorically, they tend to be about 60 percent effective.\u201d\n\nDroege said his long-term goal is to create technology that completely removes the burden of contacting authorities when someone finds themselves in an emergency situation. To get there, he said, Noonlight will partner with companies that create wearable devices and medical technology that can sense when someone is in physical distress.\n\n[They put microchips in their employees. Now this company is helping parents track their children.]\n\nIn September, Noonlight added a feature to its app known as \u201cautomatic crash detection and response.\u201d The app uses an algorithm that taps into a smartphone\u2019s sensors, allowing the platform to measure and detect minuscule changes in the user\u2019s location, motion and force.\n\nFor crash detection to work accurately via a smartphone, Droege said, the system relies on the device\u2019s GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope, both of which are used for maintaining orientation. The app might also tap into sensors such as a phone\u2019s proximity meter or magnetometer. The former measures a phone\u2019s proximity to another object, and the latter provides the phone with orientation to the earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nThe sensors are used in conjunction with analytics data from billions of miles of driver data from Zendrive, a company that amasses data about driver behavior, such as aggressive and distracted driving. An algorithm pores over the dual streams of information, Droege said, noting that the data is regularly updated in hopes of improving the algorithm\u2019s accuracy.\n\nIf the sensors detect a sudden change in motion and force indicating that the user has been involved in an accident, the app alerts 911 without the user\u2019s prompting.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to be driving a vehicle for this platform to work,\u201d Droege said in October. \u201cYou could also be on a bicycle or a Bird or Lime scooter, and the app will know whether you\u2019ve been in an accident.\u201d\n\nLime issues global recall of one of its electric scooter models amid fears that it can break apart in use\n\nElon Musk says his futuristic transportation tunnel in L.A. is \u2018disturbingly long\u2019\n\nWant to get your packages delivered via robot?

In a musical, he says, \u201ccharacters are moved to sing by a heightened emotion,\u201d while in a play-with-music, characters sing as a matter of course, as part of their job description \u2014 whether they are the fairies and traveling players who populate Shakespeare\u2019s comedies or the Jewish vaudevillians who inhabit \u201cIndecent,\u201d Paula Vogel\u2019s 2017 Tony Award-nominated play.\n\n[How \u201cIndecent\u201d brought Paula Vogel back to the head of the class]\n\nThat\u2019s where \u201cIndecent\u201d starts. As a struggling theatrical troupe sings the socialist anthem \u201cAle Brider\u201d in Yiddish, the song sets the time and place. Sholem Asch, the real-life writer who would eventually become one of the foremost Yiddish novelists of the 20th century, is trying to recruit actors and backers for his new play, \u201cGod of Vengeance.\u201d The play concerns Jewish brothel owner Yekel, who uses his profits to arrange a marriage for his virginal daughter Rifkele to a young rabbi, only to be thwarted when his daughter falls in love with one of the prostitutes.\n\nVogel\u2019s script gives us excerpts of Asch\u2019s controversial play, and focuses on the struggle to perform it on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cOur cast is a troupe of actors performing a play about a troupe of actors performing a play,\u201d says Rosen. \u201cWe try to let the audience know where we are at any moment, and we use everything from surtitles to costume changes, but especially music. The people on stage may be Asch\u2019s characters, then suddenly they become the actors portraying Asch\u2019s characters. They line up for their final bow in Bratislava, then turn to the left as the sign for Ellis Island lights up, and the audience knows the curtain-call line has become a queue of immigrants. In 90 seconds, music enables us to travel across the ocean and time.\u201d\n\nTo tell the story of the Yiddish theater as it traveled across the Atlantic, one almost has to include klezmer music, the sound of the shtetl. Klezmer drew from the folk music of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, but it also incorporated jazz as it moved into the cities of Western Europe and North America. Nothing demonstrates the transformation better than one of the show\u2019s songs, \u201cBei Mir Bistu Shein,\u201d which became a big American hit for the Andrew Sisters and Benny Goodman.\n\n\u201cKlezmer is like jazz,\u201d says Alexander Sovronsky, the music director for \u201cIndecent.\u201d \u201cIt can work with a big band or a single saxophone or violin. There are a lot of minor keys, a sense of carrying weight, but also a sense of lift, of forward motion. That\u2019s very helpful to this play, which is, after all, about a group of people who fell in love with a story and wanted to tell it to the whole world.\u201d\n\nThe original productions of \u201cIndecent,\u201d at Yale Rep in 2015 and on Broadway in 2017, used arrangements and new music by Lisa Gutkin, fiddler for the noted band the Klezmatics, and Aaron Halva, an experienced \u00adregional-theater composer. Vogel, a 1998 Pulitzer winner for \u201cHow I Learned To Drive,\u201d now insists that all productions of \u201cIndecent\u201d use the arrangements and music of Gutkin and Halva.\n\nBut before she locked in that contract language, the Rosen-led consortium of Arena Stage, Kansas City Repertory and Baltimore Center Stage had already licensed the rights to \u201cIndecent\u201d and had begun developing their own music with Sovronsky. As a result, this three-theater co-production will be the only version of \u201cIndecent\u201d to ever use different music.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident of timing,\u201d Rosen says.\n\nSovronsky has arranged the five songs that Vogel used for her drama about Asch\u2019s 1906 script, and he composed all the incidental music. Sovronsky appears on stage as the violinist and is joined by two other musicians. They are always on stage and often interact with the speaking actors.\n\n\u201cThe way Paula uses music in the script is similar to the way Shakespeare used music,\u201d says Sovronsky. \u201cThey\u2019re both drawing from popular music of the period. We use famous klezmer and Broadway songs the audience may already know. It\u2019s like singing along to a Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift song today.\u201d\n\nSholem Asch has an unusual connection to Washington: His son Moses \u201cMoe\u201d Asch was the founder of Folkways Records, the label that introduced some of the greatest recordings by Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly and Pete Seeger. After Asch died, Folkways was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution and is still run as an active label here in Washington.\n\n\u201cSholem was dubious about his son\u2019s career as a radio repairman and engineer,\u201d says Jeff Place, a senior archivist for Smithsonian Folkways. \u201cBut he took Moe on a trip to Princeton to see Sholem\u2019s friend Albert Einstein, because the scientist needed an engineer for a radio spot that would be broadcast in Europe to encourage Jews to leave while they still could. Later, over dinner, Einstein asked Moe what he wanted to do, and Moe said, \u2018I want to create an encyclopedia of the sounds of the world,\u2019 which is pretty much what Folkways became \u2014 and still is.

Macdonald, Canada\u2019s first prime minister, as the face of the new vertically oriented $10 bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to think that my sister \u2014 a black woman \u2014 is on the $10 bill,\u201d Wanda Robson, Desmond\u2019s 91-year-old sister, said at the bank note\u2019s unveiling Monday at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. \u201cThe queen is in good company.\u201d\n\nThe bill also shows a map of Halifax\u2019s historic north end, which was home to one of Canada\u2019s oldest black communities and also where Desmond was raised.\n\nBefore her visit to the movie theater in 1946, Desmond, who for a short time taught at a segregated school, was no stranger to systemic racism. When she left her teaching job to launch a career as a beautician, Desmond was forced to travel out of the province for training because beauty schools in Nova Scotia barred black people from enrolling.\n\nCanada had no Jim Crow-like laws, but it did have policies that enforced segregation, said Constance Backhouse, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who has written extensively on Desmond.\n\nThe policies were \u201cjust as bad as Jim Crow,\u201d Backhouse said, but they were written in a way that \u201cmasked\u201d their racist intent.\n\nBlack Nova Scotians often complained, \u201cAt least in the United States, you know where the segregated facilities are,\u201d she added.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Desmond opened her own beauty studio. In fact, the episode that thrust her into the history books happened while she was on a business trip.\n\nWhen her Dodge sedan broke down in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia \u2014 about 100 miles from Halifax \u2014 Desmond, then 32, decided to pass the time waiting for her car to be fixed by going to the Roseland Theatre for a screening of \u201cThe Dark Mirror,\u201d a psychological thriller and murder mystery.\n\nShe bought a ticket and headed to the ground floor because she had trouble seeing. But she was called back and told that her ticket was for the balcony.\n\nWhen Desmond asked to exchange her ticket for a ground-floor seat, the white ticket seller refused her request, telling her, \u201cI\u2019m not permitted to sell downstairs tickets to you people.\u201d\n\nRealizing that her request was being refused because of her race, Desmond returned to the ground floor. She was arrested \u2014 losing her purse and a shoe in the resulting scuffle \u2014 and spent 12 hours in jail, where she was never told of her legal right to counsel or to seek bail.\n\nDesmond was charged with tax evasion for failing to pay 1 cent \u2014 the difference in the sales tax on the floor and balcony seats. Despite the theater\u2019s refusal to sell her the more expensive floor seat, she was convicted and fined $26.\n\nShe fought the conviction, and her lawyer asked the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to overturn the lower court\u2019s decision, but this proved fruitless. Rather than arguing that the theater was using a racially neutral tax law to enforce segregation, her lawyer tried to get the decision overturned on a technicality.\n\nDespite the court\u2019s decision, one of the justices did wonder \u201cif the manager who laid the complaint was so zealous because of a bona fide belief that there had been an attempt to defraud the province of Nova Scotia of the sum of one cent, or was it a surreptitious endeavor to force a Jim Crow style rule by misuse of a public statute.\u201d\n\nDesmond suffered personal and professional repercussions as a result of her fight for racial equality, which helped spark a movement that dismantled segregation in Nova Scotia in 1954, Backhouse said. She was alone when she died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 1965.\n\nIn 2010, the province of Nova Scotia offered an apology and granted Desmond a posthumous pardon.\n\nHer journey to the front of the $10 bill began two years ago when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instructed the Bank of Canada to put a woman who wasn\u2019t a monarch on the front of a bank note. Desmond was selected after an open call for nominations and a public survey.\n\nRobson played a large role in ensuring that her sister\u2019s story was more widely known outside of Nova Scotia. She told the Canadian Press that she plans to use her new $10 bill to buy the book she co-authored about Desmond for her 12-year-old granddaughter.\n\nBackhouse, who spent the weekend in Nova Scotia at celebrations marking the introduction of the bill, said many black Canadians there were planning to give out the bank notes as gifts.\n\n\u201cCanadians are more polite about their historical racism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to let them know about their history.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the 1 cent Desmond was charged with failing to pay was the price difference between the floor and balcony seats. It was the difference in the sales tax on the price of those seats.

South Korea said Wednesday it will dissolve a foundation funded by Japan to compensate South Korean women who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s World War II military brothels. (Lee Jin-man/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s decision to dissolve a foundation funded by Japan to compensate South Korean women who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s World War II military brothels has thrown fuel on the diplomatic fire between the countries, who share a bitter wartime history.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday was predictable as many South Koreans believe that Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government settled for far too less in the 2015 deal, and that Japan still hasn\u2019t acknowledged legal responsibility for atrocities during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nJapan, meanwhile, is angry that South Korea is effectively walking back on an internationally recognized agreement.\n\nA look at the intensifying dispute between South Korea and Japan:\n\n___\n\nTHE WOMEN\n\nThe women forced to work in the brothels were mainly from Japan and Korea, but also from the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia. They were sent to hundreds of front-line brothels called \u201ccomfort stations\u201d to provide sex for the Japanese army that invaded and occupied Asian countries from the early 1930s through the end of World War II.\n\nWartime documents show that Japan\u2019s military supervised the brothels, and set the tariffs, service hours and hygiene standards. Government documents say the purpose was to keep soldiers from raping women and triggering anti-Japan sentiment, as well as preventing venereal disease and Chinese espionage.\n\nInitially, some were professionals or from poor Japanese families, historians say. In South Korea, they were often deceived by local agents who recruited them promising factory work. Later in the war, many minors in the Philippines were kidnapped, raped or tricked into working in the brothels, some victims said.\n\n___\n\nJAPAN\u2019S STANCE\n\nJapan\u2019s government has repeatedly denied there was any coercion, and more recently has refused to use the term \u201csex slave\u201d for the women in English media and U.N. documents.\n\nJapan has intensified its stance in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s nationalist government, which says there is no official record showing the wartime government\u2019s systematic use of coercion. Some ultra-right-wing lawmakers say the South Korean women forced to work in the brothels were all prostitutes, and there is increasing bashing of supporters of the survivors, as well as journalists for writing stories about them.\n\nThe issue flared in 2014 after a former reporter from Japan\u2019s left-leaning Asahi newspaper was accused of fabricating his report on the first South Korean survivor who came forward, leading to defamation lawsuits still pending in Japan.\n\nStatues honoring the victims erected in the U.S. and elsewhere by South Korean groups have also upset the Japanese government.\n\n___\n\nTHE WOMEN\u2019S DEMANDS\n\nThe former victims have demanded compensation and an apology from Japan\u2019s government. Japan in 1995 set up the semi-government Asian Women\u2019s Fund, a scheme to finance compensatory projects for victims from across Asia, including South Koreans.\n\nIn all, the fund paid nearly 5 billion yen ($44.2 million) for medical and welfare projects for all the recognized women from across Asia, including 61 South Koreans. But many others in South Korea rejected the fund because of pressure from their support group\u2019s policy to keep demanding official compensation.\n\nEstimates by historians for the total number of victims range from 20,000 to 200,000. In South Korea, about 240 women came forward and registered with the government as victims, and only 27 of them are still alive.\n\n___\n\nTHE 2015 DEAL\n\nUnder the agreement reached in December 2015, Japan pledged to fund a Seoul-based foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn\u2019t consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, insisting that all wartime compensation issues were settled in a 1965 treaty that restored diplomatic ties between the countries and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul.\n\nThe deal initially described by Seoul and Tokyo as \u201cfinal and irreversible\u201d turned out to be anything but. Many victims refused payment. Anti-Japan activists rallied furiously, accusing the government of former conservative President Park Geun-hye of \u201cselling away\u201d the honor and dignity of the aging victims. College students began camping out in the street across the embassy to protect the statue from potential attempts to remove it. A 64-year-old Buddhist monk died after setting himself on fire to protest the deal in January 2017.\n\nJapan expressed anger that South Korea didn\u2019t taken specific steps to remove the statue and similar monuments in other places in the country, insisting there has been a clear understanding to do so.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who won office in May last year following Park\u2019s removal from office over a corruption scandal, said in December 2017 that the 2015 agreement was seriously flawed because Park\u2019s government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\n___\n\nHISTORICAL ISSUES\n\nThe legacy of sexual slavery is hardly the only issue of contention between South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe countries are at odds over a ruling by Seoul\u2019s Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.\n\nSeoul has also expressed resentment about Tokyo\u2019s territorial claims over the disputed eastern islands occupied by South Korea. Japan last month refused to send a warship to an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul requested the removal of the Japanese navy\u2019s \u201crising sun\u201d flag, which many South Koreans see as a symbol of Japan\u2019s wartime aggression.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo\u2019s bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington\u2019s efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s growing influence in the region. Japan has also expressed wariness over South Korea\u2019s outreach to rival North Korea in past months, stressing the need to maintain pressure until the North takes concrete steps toward relinquishing its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\n\u201cThe Moon government is trying to maintain a two-track approach \u2014 cooperating with Tokyo on security and economic issues, but firmly responding to issues surrounding history and territorial claims,\u201d said Bong Young-shik, an analyst at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University.\n\n___\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Saving Greece was hard enough; bailing out Italy would be all but impossible.\n\nBut its government argues the spending is necessary to relaunch economic growth after years of austerity.

(Brian Westerholt/Four Seam Images/Associated Press)\n\nLast fall, midway through a junior year spent rampaging across North Carolina high school football fields, Quavaris Crouch began to formulate his future. As he became the top-ranked running back recruit in America, he surveyed the state of the position at the sport\u2019s highest level. He studied the fleeting shelf life of NFL running backs and saw stars like Le\u2019Veon Bell scuffle through contract negotiations.\n\nCrouch, a 6-foot-3, 230-pound \u201cbig old freak\u201d \u2014 his words \u2014 could have played running back at any college in the country. After peering into the years ahead, the 18-year-old decided he would play running back nowhere: He switched to linebacker. Crouch wants to rush the passer, because in the NFL, running backs get used up and sack artists get paid.\n\n\u201cI want to be smart about it,\u201d Crouch said Monday afternoon in a phone conversation. \u201cMy passion is running back. I love to play running back. I love to score touchdowns. Realistically, I feel like linebacker is the best for me.\u201d\n\nCrouch has supporters in high places. Standing at his locker inside Washington Redskins headquarters last Friday, Adrian Peterson listened to a reporter explain Crouch\u2019s outlook. Peterson nodded along and raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cSmart guy,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s smart. If you\u2019re able to play a different position and be good at it and be as dominant, then me as a running back, I would definitely go that route.\u201d\n\n[Adrian Peterson lives by an east Texas code: \u2018Initiate the force of the attack\u2019]\n\nThose words, coming from Peterson, form a staggering appraisal of the state of the NFL running back. In 11 seasons, he has earned $99 million, which is $30 million more than the next-highest earning back. He has rushed for more yards than all but eight men, and scored more rushing touchdowns than all but five. And even Peterson believes if he was a high school senior today, his best career path would be . . . something else?\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d Peterson said. If he was 18 now, Peterson says, he would choose wide receiver or put on weight and become a pass rusher, \u201clike Von Miller or something,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nCrouch and Peterson, two of the great running backs at their respective career stages, agree playing the position professionally would be unwise for players who have options. They have a clear-eyed view of how the prestige of the position has evolved. Running back, from the days of Jim Brown, was for the fastest, baddest dude on the field. Even as recently as 2011, Peterson signed a contract worth up to $100 million. Now, the best high school running back in the country says no thanks to the position.\n\nThe value of running backs has nosedived among modern NFL teams. The pounding running backs take shortens their careers. Teams view them as replaceable and increasingly specialized. Lasting stars at the position are going extinct.\n\nBell\u2019s saga added another data point. Slapped with the franchise tag by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bell ended up sitting out the entire season rather than play for $14.5 million and risk injury before he became a free agent. The Steelers would not offer him the long-term contract he wanted, even after Bell carried the ball or caught it more than 400 times last year. It was the latest sign of how teams view running backs as interchangeable and fragile, unworthy of massive paydays even as the demands of their position grow more diverse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re devaluing that position,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cBut if you take a lot of those guys out of those positions, that offense is not going to function. You take Alvin Kamara out of New Orleans, they\u2019re still going to be functional because they got Drew Brees, but it\u2019s not going to be the same threat. You take Melvin Gordon out of the Chargers' offense, that offense is totally different. Look at the Eagles [after injury sidelined Jay Ajayi]. Totally different. That\u2019s how valuable the running back position is. They act like they don\u2019t see it, but they know.\u201d\n\nPeterson said he and other running backs \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d appreciated Bell holding out rather than signing the franchise tag.\n\n\u201c[The Steelers] got lucky with [James] Conner, because he\u2019s doing an outstanding job,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not Le\u2019Veon Bell. The ability he brings to that team, I understand [Bell\u2019s holdout]. Someone has to stand up and say, \u2018Show me what I\u2019m worth.\u2019 . . . Somebody is going to give him what he wants, or around what he wants. I can tell you that much.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the best running backs of all-time, Adrian Peterson says he would play a different position if he was just starting his career. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe majority of running backs don\u2019t last long enough to sign a second deal, and those who do are often squeezed. Todd Gurley, whom the Rams signed to a four-year, $57.5 million extension before this season, stands as an outlier. But even he can look around his own locker room for an idea of what the NFL thinks of his position. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks signed a deal worth $81 million over five years, and defensive tackle Aaron Donald signed for $135 million over six.\n\nA coming wave is about to give NFL running back valuation another stress test. The rookie contracts of Kamara, Ezekiel Elliott and Kareem Hunt are all set to expire after the 2020 season. All of them, like Bell, contribute heavily to their team\u2019s passing attack. Like Bell, they could argue they deserve to be paid more than a traditional running back. In the wake of Bell\u2019s holdout, Peterson has some advice for them.\n\n\u201cI would say stand your ground,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cGet your worth. Get what you\u2019re worth. I remember telling Alvin, \u2018Listen, God willing you stay healthy, keep doing what you\u2019re doing, the Saints are going to be paying you a lot of money here soon.\u2019 So when his opportunity comes, he has to understand his value to the team and what he brings to that team. It\u2019s understanding what your value is, and not feeling guilty.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys get caught up in letting these guys down,\u201d Peterson continued, motioning with his arms to teammates inside the Washington locker room. \u201cWhat they need to understand is, it\u2019s a business. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a business. And [teams] don\u2019t cater to every player the same way, unfortunately. As far as the running back position, they don\u2019t really cater to us. If you have that talent, know your value, and do what it takes to make sure you get what\u2019s due to you.\u201d\n\n[NFL power rankings, Week 11: Saints swagger as No. 1; Redskins fall after losing game and QB]\n\nIf Crouch reaches the NFL, he plans to circumvent the challenge of getting paid as a running back by playing defense. Playing fullback in Harding High\u2019s wing-T offense as a junior, Crouch rushed for more than 3,000 yards and 27 touchdowns. He has no discernible body composition other than muscle. \u201cGod has created some freaks,\u201d Harding Coach Van Smith said. \u201cCrouch is one of them.\u201d\n\nCrouch asked college recruiters if he could still play running back in goal-line packages, and coaches like Clemson\u2019s Dabo Swinney and Michigan\u2019s Jim Harbaugh approved. But his full-time role will be defense, a choice he made for his long-term career prospects. He sees smaller, quicker running backs coming to prominence at the pro level. He understands the punishment big running backs take, mentioning Leonard Fournette and Earl Campbell as examples. He thinks Bell was right to hold out.\n\n\u201cI feel like they don\u2019t treat the backs right,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cWe\u2019re not valuable as much as somebody else who plays. You want to go somewhere where you\u2019re valued and they\u2019re going to need you.\u201d\n\nCrouch believes the best high school running backs, especially bigger backs like him, will make the same switch with an eye toward the future.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a pass rusher, and you can manipulate the passer, you\u2019re a $100 million man,\u201d said Sam Greiner, Crouch\u2019s coach during his first three seasons. \u201cBut some of the running backs, they might only have a life span or three to five years, and nobody takes care of them with guaranteed money. They think they\u2019re just dime-a-dozen when you get to that level. It\u2019s a crazy thing to see how high school, college, it\u2019s such a big deal. You see Heisman candidates and all of that at running back, and all of a sudden that means nothing at the highest level.\u201d\n\nIt will be hard for Crouch to let go of playing running back full-time. He loved the position, loved scoring touchdowns, loved when he broke a long run and heard the crowd\u2019s cheers grow into a roar as he sprinted. \u201cEverybody knows your name,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cYou just get a lot of love playing running back. It\u2019s nice, man.\u201d Carrying the ball may still be a joy, but increasingly for the best athletes in football, it is no way to make a living.\n\nMore from The Post:\n\nAaron Donald, \u2019285 pounds of dynamite,' is NFL\u2019s ultimate outlier in an offense-heavy season\n\n\u2018Blind side\u2019 left tackles inspired a movie.

For a richer experience, you can find the full version of this story here. An Internet connection is required.]\n\nEdward Enninful, the new editor in chief of British Vogue, is supremely confident in both his aesthetic beliefs and in his worldview. In short order, he has upended a century-old publication, transforming its masthead to be more reflective of the global audience it seeks to serve and crafting some of the most memorable, inspiring and diverse fashion covers of the past year. His work exudes authenticity. He\u2019s made inclusiveness look organic and effortless. And he\u2019s made fashion look glorious.\n\nYet Enninful, on this day in the middle of Paris Fashion Week, is flummoxed over a coat. Not just any coat, Enninful tells me, but his coat. It\u2019s caramel-colored, a gift from Riccardo Tisci, the recently appointed creative director of Burberry. The color has thrown Enninful thoroughly off balance. He prefers the strict camouflage of black and white: Black suit. White shirt. Black-framed eyeglasses. It\u2019s his uniform.\n\nThe Burberry coat is a classic and looks splendid on Enninful, but he clearly does not feel fine in it. He\u2019s chatting up his colleagues, killing time before the start of the umpteenth show of the day, and he\u2019s clutching the coat around his torso with his shoulders hunched forward as if he\u2019s attempting to vanish within its tailored confines. Most people would not have such strong feelings about a simple piece of outerwear, but Enninful has spent his entire adult life considering the way clothes not only make us look but also the way they make us feel. And the coat makes Enninful feel exposed at a time when he is in the spotlight as never before.\n\nEnninful began his fashion career as a model, an instrument for telling fashion stories. Later, when he became a stylist, he selected the costumes for such narratives. As a fashion director for glossy publications, he was able to write the visual story itself. Now that he\u2019s in charge of British Vogue, he has the power to determine whose stories are told at all.\n\n\u201cI always feel that the strongest stories resonate with the times we live in. So my stories will always be a bit social \u2014 they\u2019ll have an edge,\u201d Enninful tells me. \u201cThis is a time when the world is so divisive. So many walls are up. It\u2019s so important that British Vogue just says, you know, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to show beauty.\u201d It\u2019s okay to highlight differences. \u201cDiversity does work,\u201d he adds with emphasis. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdward Enninful, British Vogue\u2019s editor in chief, outside the Miu Miu show during Paris Fashion Week in October. For many in the industry, his appointment came as a welcome surprise. (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nEnninful, 46, took the helm of the highly regarded British glossy in August 2017, marking a litany of firsts. Enninful is the first man to run the 102-year-old fashion magazine and its first black editor in chief. But those would be mere footnotes in his biography were it not for the singular perspective he brings to his work. He wants to celebrate art and creativity, of course. But he wants to do so in a way that feels both real and aspirational. He has been unabashed and vocal about the historical lack of diversity in British Vogue\u2019s pages and on its staff, and he\u2019s determined to remedy that specifically and within the fashion industry at large. \u201cThere\u2019s such a buzz about him. Normally that subsides after the first couple of issues. You know people get over it and move on and look for the next thing. But I think they just find it so pleasing, and it\u2019s working in every direction,\u201d says veteran fashion editor Grace Coddington. \u201cI love what he\u2019s doing. I really do. ... For me that\u2019s the way magazines should look.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s take on globalism and his expansive view of culture have gotten him noticed. In the suddenly vigorous guessing game of who will one day succeed Anna Wintour, fashion\u2019s most famous and powerful editor, Enninful is now top of mind. The corporate lords of Cond\u00e9 Nast, Vogue\u2019s owner, have been adamant in batting away speculation that Wintour, 69, is stepping down or even slowing down anytime soon. \u201cShe is integral to the future of our company\u2019s transformation and has agreed to work with me indefinitely in her role as [Vogue magazine] editor-in-chief and artistic director of Conde Nast,\u201d said chief executive Bob Sauerberg in a statement this summer. Still.\n\nThe idea of Enninful as the next Anna Wintour \u2014 that is, the next editor to wield outsize influence within the fashion industry and to become iconic outside of it \u2014 does not require a move to New York and an office at One World Trade Center. That perch would give him a bigger audience and greater financial might. But he already has extraordinary influence. If Wintour is the producer of studio-financed, big-tent blockbusters, Enninful is the critically acclaimed indie filmmaker whose work punches you in the gut. It is rich and dynamic. It may rile you up or soothe you. It will make you think.\n\nPeople also tend to forget that Wintour was not an omnipotent devil-clad-in-Prada when she climbed to the top of the American Vogue masthead 30 years ago. She grew into that role, and the kind of power she amassed reflected a fashion world that was becoming more corporate, more enamored with celebrities, more hierarchal.\n\nAmerican Vogue remains an advertising behemoth, but it has not been immune to the economic travails of magazines. The next Anna Wintour will rise out of an industry that is now more diffuse and deflated. It is a borderless business, one in which celebrities are just as likely to rise from social media and Nollywood as network television and Hollywood. The role of kingmaker is less important when a young designer can sell direct-to-consumer, broker a lucrative sneaker deal or court the affections of myriad influencers.\n\nEnninful is well positioned for this new landscape. He has an extraordinary, artful eye that makes his work stand out amid the visual chaos. He regularly engages with his more than 855,000 followers on Instagram. He has his eyes set on Africa as a place to expand his readership and is traveling to Ghana this fall to advocate for arts education there. He\u2019s well connected within fashion\u2019s establishment and in the world of entertainment. He knows Oprah, for heaven\u2019s sake. And he\u2019s laser-focused on arguably fashion\u2019s most pressing social issue of the day: diversity.\n\n\n\nBritish Vogue\u2019s December 2017 cover featuring Adwoa Aboah, and the September 2018 cover featuring Rihanna. (Courtesy of Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain)\n\nFor his inaugural issue of British Vogue, Enninful chose Adwoa Aboah as the December 2017 cover star. The biracial, British-Ghanaian model and activist has a honey-colored complexion, a sprinkling of freckles across her nose, the neck of a gazelle and a buzz cut. She is not especially long-limbed or lithe; she exudes solidity. On the cover, she wears a Marc Jacobs minidress in shades of pale pink and brown with a matching turban by the British milliner Stephen Jones. Her eyelids glitter with metallic turquoise shadow, and her lips shimmer in red. Aboah looks as though she has stepped from the 1970s by way of the 1940s. Her style borrows inspiration from the African diaspora while it revels in a slick disco glamour.\n\nThe image is a striking mix of references brought together by Enninful and photographed by Steven Meisel. It confidently rebuffs street style and informality. It is unapologetically high fashion \u2014 knowing, assured, refined. And yet it also says: All are welcome.\n\nIt was received with lusty applause in the British press, on social media and in the broader fashion world. The heightened enthusiasm was a reaction to the industry\u2019s especially bleak record on inclusivity. When British Vogue\u2019s outgoing editor, Alexandra Shulman, posed for a portrait with 54 members of her staff, the entire group was white. During Shulman\u2019s 25-year tenure, there was a 12-year period when no black model appeared alone on the cover of the magazine. Until this year, no African American photographer had ever shot an American Vogue cover in its 125-year history. For more than 100 years, no black man or woman had ever served as editor in chief of any Cond\u00e9 Nast publication, until 2012 when Keija Minor became editor of Brides. A black woman has never won a Council of Fashion Designers of America award for menswear, womenswear or accessories. And in 2013, the international runways were so disproportionately white that Bethann Hardison, a former model agency owner and activist, with support from Iman and Naomi Campbell, published an online list of design houses whose actions they characterized as \u201cracist\u201d due to the lack of people of color in their fall shows.\n\nIn an industry that draws inspiration from the global melting pot, few people of color have had authorship over the tales being unspooled, how beauty is defined, where status is conferred and the way in which femininity is depicted. One might argue that in 2018, Enninful\u2019s emphasis on diversity \u2014 which also includes size, ethnicity and culture \u2014 is inevitable, obvious or easy. Indeed, many international editions of Vogue have bloomed: China, Mexico and Latin America, Arabia. But the truth is that no other editor at one of fashion\u2019s leading legacy publications has treated multiculturalism as a fundamental operating principle.\n\nEnninful impresses readers and reassures his peers by nimbly incorporating diversity without democratizing fashion; he has not diluted it, over-explained it or given it a stronger connection to the gritty streets. In Enninful\u2019s hands, fashion remains as rarefied and fanciful as ever. Inclusive, he says, does not mean down-market. He offers the same tempting fantasy that has for generations attracted fabulists, social swans, mid-country dreamers and creative entrepreneurs. He simply acknowledged that black and brown kids have been dreaming, too. What did their starry-eyed visions look like?\n\n\u201cUsually when a new editor takes over, there\u2019s a shakedown period when an editor finds their voice,\u201d says Jonathan Newhouse, the trim, rather bookish-looking chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International who hired Enninful. \u201cIn Edward\u2019s case, he produced a masterful, standout product from the beginning.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s May cover showcased nine up-and-coming models that included women of color, plus-size and hijab-wearing. They were dressed in shades of khaki, taupe, olive and brown and staring out at the viewer: confident, perhaps a bit defiant. A few critics cried reverse discrimination: ivory-complexioned redheads and blue-eyed blondes had gone missing. But again, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.\n\n\n\nEnninful with longtime friend Naomi Campbell after he became an officer of the Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace in October 2016. (Philip Toscano/WPA Pool/Getty Images)\n\nJune brought the model and actress Cara Delevingne. Ariana Grande was photographed for July. In August, Enninful styled Oprah Winfrey in an ivory Stella McCartney gown with a ruffled neckline matched with diamond and emerald medallion drop earrings. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a joy to be able to grab Oprah Winfrey and turn her into an empress dripping in the best gowns, dripping in diamonds,\u201d Enninful says. A woman who had been photographed thousands of times was revealed anew.\n\nBy fall, it seemed that Enninful had created a ripple effect. Traditionally the most advertisement-packed issue of the year, the September fashion magazines have long been stubbornly homogenous. But this year, major magazines featured women of color on the cover. Beyonc\u00e9 was the September star of American Vogue in a history-making photograph by Tyler Mitchell, who is African American. Other cover girls that month included models Slick Woods and Naomi Campbell, and actresses Tracee Ellis Ross, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Ruth Negga, Tiffany Haddish and Zendaya.\n\nBut Enninful led the way with Rihanna wearing a dramatic floral headdress, with the hand-drawn eyebrows of a silent movie siren and lips glimmering like lacquered blackberries. It marked the first time a black woman had ever appeared on a British Vogue September issue.\n\nWhen Enninful was plotting that cover, he considered the season\u2019s trends. And then he began to build a character, drawing from different historical periods, like the 1960s when daring women shaved off their eyebrows and penciled in exaggerated new ones. \u201cI remember sending [Rihanna] this book that I had that dealt with African tribesmen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just so left field, but that\u2019s what makes a picture, when you take all those inspirations and influences and meld them together to create something that\u2019s quite new to the eye. That\u2019s when I feel I\u2019ve really succeeded.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s work echoes with the influence of Diana Vreeland, Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton. He is precise \u2014 free but intentional. His work is lush. He creates a visual shorthand for our fantasies and fears. He plays with the tension between high culture and low, between the privileged and disenfranchised, between the Western world and elsewhere. And the results are profoundly, otherworldly beautiful.\n\n\u201cHe has a vision and a talent for telling a story,\u201d Newhouse says of Enninful, whom he has known for 20 years. \u201cVogue is kind of a magic act. How do you describe the difference between a beautiful image and an ordinary image? It\u2019s hard to put in words; you can\u2019t put it in a business plan. But success depends on that.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnninful after the Fendi fashion show during Milan Fashion Week in September. (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nEnninful, whom colleagues call genial, even-tempered and just plain nice, has the sort of British accent that sounds, to American ears, unfailingly polite, yet delightfully conspiratorial.\n\nHe describes himself as European, African and British \u2014 in that order. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t all those things I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do what I do or see the world the way I do,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cI see it from the perspective of \u2018the other.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s the strength of my work.\u201d\n\nEnninful was born in Ghana but raised in London\u2019s Ladbroke Grove neighborhood, which sits alongside the more famous Notting Hill, with all of its cinematic glamour. When Enninful was growing up, Ladbroke Grove was populated by recent arrivals from Africa and the Caribbean, as well as those of Chinese descent, working-class whites and gays.\n\nHis mother was a seamstress, and his father was in the Ghanaian army and worked with the United Nations. \u201cThere was a lot of us. Six of us. And we were like a tribe and kind of didn\u2019t need anybody else,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAt home, I lived in Africa: the food, the clothes, the people who came to visit my parents. And then I\u2019d go to school. I\u2019d be in England. So there was always that diversity, [but] I didn\u2019t even know what it was called. It\u2019s always been part of me and my family and my upbringing.\u201d\n\nHis family wanted him to become a lawyer; they expected something intellectual from him. But Enninful loved art and design. He and his mother would \u201csketch clothes together. Design things,\u201d he says. \u201cShe had a lot of African wives [as clients], so every day the women would come into the house in their headscarves and all these colors. She\u2019d have me zip them into these peplum dresses. I remember that so well, and then later she\u2019d tell me how to make clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much money and I was very much into fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019d go to the secondhand market and buy the clothes for two pounds or whatever, back in the day, and re-create clothes for myself \u2014 clothes I could face the world in. Like your armor.\u201d\n\nEnninful was a tallish, lanky 16-year-old when he was discovered on the Underground on his way to school by Simon Foxton, a stylist who told him that he had a particular, distinguishing model\u2019s \u201cit,\u201d which in this case was full lips, hooded eyes, flawless ebony skin and a bone structure of angles and planes that catch the light just so. His parents grudgingly let him model while he was in school.\n\n\n\nBritish Vogue\u2019s August 2018 cover featuring Oprah Winfrey. (Courtesy of Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain)\n\nHe realized that his artsy leanings could translate into a career thanks to people such as Foxton, whom he began assisting on shoots for i-D magazine, a London-based chronicler of youth culture. His parents gave him a month to work at i-D \u2014 after which he was expected to focus on school. When he was offered a full-time job as the magazine\u2019s fashion director, he was 18. He left school \u2014 to his parents\u2019 horror \u2014 and stayed at the magazine for two decades. (He eventually earned his degree from Goldsmiths, University of London.)\n\n\u201cI decided that my destiny really was to work in magazines and just to say something, not in the traditional way of, you know, being a lawyer or doctor, but just to say something through art and beauty,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very young. But I knew I had a voice.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s signature visual language is rooted in those formative years in the 1980s, drawing from what has been referred to as the Buffalo era. Codified by the late stylist Ray Petri, it was defined by rebelliousness and self-expression, a do-it-yourself attitude and a mash-up of cultures and ethnicities. Visually, it meant boys in skirts, girls cast as boys and multiracial kids. The Pan-African Boho style of Soul II Soul exemplified it, as did Culture Club\u2019s Boy George bedecked in a treasure chest of flamboyant jewelry by the artist Judy Blame. The movement\u2019s soundtrack was Neneh Cherry\u2019s \u201cBuffalo Stance.\u201d\n\nEnninful\u2019s work also bears the marks of \u201990s American grunge with its emphasis on youthful realism and human imperfections. And one can see the hand of a teenage Enninful who rummaged through secondhand bins and witnessed the kaleidoscope of colors and patterns paraded through his childhood home by women whose roots were in Africa rather than Europe.\n\nAny rough edges are smoothed over by a high-minded, intellectual, respectful sense of fashion history. \u201cI used to spend all my money on books I couldn\u2019t afford just so I could learn about the people who had been before \u2014 all the great editors, the great designers. You have to study. [Styling] is not just going to a party and thinking you\u2019re fabulous because you know how to put outfits together,\u201d he says, likening styling more to acting or singing. \u201cYou have to study your craft.\u201d\n\nHe turned fashion into social commentary as a contributing editor at Vogue Italia in the early 2000s. One of his most memorable fashion shoots boldly commented on the modern obsession with plastic surgery and our inability to accept human imperfection. The 2005 feature depicted bandaged models in various states of recuperation and reinvention. There were blackened and bruised eyes, bloody bits of gauze and magnificent designer frocks. It was a jarring juxtaposition of superficial confidence and deeply rooted insecurity, of self-creation and self-destruction. Enninful didn\u2019t mock fashion\u2019s doyennes; he exposed their truth.\n\nIn 2008, he was instrumental in shaping Vogue Italia\u2019s groundbreaking Black Issue. A response to the fashion industry\u2019s near whitewashing of the runways in New York, Milan and Paris, the project exclusively featured black models in all of its fashion spreads. It celebrated blackness while underscoring the ways in which it\u2019s sidelined and categorized as \u201cother.\u201d\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Enninful also was contributing to American Vogue. His first story, in 2005, was photographed in a laundromat. He followed up with one shot in a supermarket. \u201cI wanted to bring this element of reality to American Vogue,\u201d he says. He also learned how to balance art and commerce.\n\n\u201cI was very young going into Vogue, in my early 30s, and I learned that fashion is a business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just telling all these fanciful stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was doing all these Italian Vogue stories \u2014 60 pages of head shots and a little scrap [of clothing], and you get to Anna and you have 12 outfits, and you have to create a story around these 12 outfits, and you find that it\u2019s not just 12 outfits on a rack [at the magazine] but it\u2019s units in a store.\u201d\n\nHe moved on from American Vogue to become fashion director of W magazine. There, he once styled Rihanna as a post-apocalyptic warrior princess in a feather coat, armloads of tribal bracelets, skeleton medallions and a king\u2019s ransom of jewels. In another story, model Linda Evangelista became a cyborg matron. Naomi Campbell was a chic Michelle Obama doppelganger.\n\n\u201cWe shared the same set of values. We\u2019re both European,\u201d says W editor in chief Stefano Tonchi, who was born in Italy. \u201cWe lived the \u201980s in the same place with the same ideas, the same set of images, the same music, the same clothes. We believe in diversity. We both live it as gay men to start with \u2014 and with the people we work with.\u201d\n\nEnninful spent about five years at W before stepping into his current position. He was not the obvious choice. He was not a woman; he was not white. And while he was well connected, he had not come from posh circumstances. But Enninful is well liked in an industry known for its prickly characters and unapproachable personalities. The announcement was met with surprise and delight.\n\n\u201cIn this business, he\u2019s somebody who is always positive, who\u2019s always looking for solutions,\u201d Tonchi says. \u201cMost of the time, we spend our life pushing the stone up the hill. It\u2019s nice to have someone helping you push it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBritish Vogue\u2019s May 2018 cover. (Courtesy of Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain)\n\nEnninful works from a modest office on the fifth floor of Vogue House, a 1958 dun-colored brick and stone building whose exterior is neither as elegant nor as stylish as its name would imply.\n\nThe interior is functional. Its open floor plan is filled with unremarkable workstations and old magazines. Odd bits of fashion paraphernalia are pushed into corners, including an Edward doll commissioned by Harvey Nichols that consists of a large bespectacled brown head atop a Giacometti-like body dressed in a black suit. It has been turned to face the wall. Enninful\u2019s own office is a glass box dominated by a large desk, which he occasionally thumps for emphasis when talking, and stacks of fashion and art books.\n\nWe meet there in early September, after a long holiday and before he heads into the circus of international runway shows. He\u2019s finishing up a morning staff meeting. There are some 40 people on his team, as well as regular contributors including filmmaker Steve McQueen, makeup artist Pat McGrath and Campbell. He\u2019s hired stylist Julia Sarr-Jamois as a fashion editor at large, Alice Casely-Hayford as digital editor and Donna Wallace as fashion and accessories editor. They are all women of color. There are some dozen other editors, interns and assistants whose ethnicities read like roll call at the United Nations. And beginning this year, the magazine also has a new publisher after 26 years: Vanessa Kingori, who is of Afro-Caribbean descent.\n\nAlexandra Shulman, who preceded Enninful, was the longest-tenured editor in chief in the magazine\u2019s history, and she cast it as a champion of British designers and as a thoughtful read with a bohemian take on glamour. Indeed, Shulman\u2019s own style was more muddy Wellingtons than high-gloss Manolos. When she was asked about the all-white group portrait of her staff, she told the Guardian newspaper that when nonwhite candidates applied to work for her, \u201cthey almost always did in fact get the job. But relatively few came up through the pipeline, for whatever reason, so that might account for why there weren\u2019t more.\u201d Enninful has begun reaching out to local schools, cultivating the talent pool in digital media and trying, with his very presence, to change the presumptions about who is welcome at Vogue House.\n\nThere was a perception that one had to be wealthy, connected or of a certain class to work at British Vogue. Indeed, both of Shulman\u2019s parents once worked at the magazine. \u201cSo many people thought it wouldn\u2019t be possible for them to work at Vogue. Now they\u2019re not scared to pick up the phone, to pick up their CV because they know, \u2018Oh my God, we can!\u2019 They know that the possibility is there,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cAll these magazines are putting these incredible women of color on the cover, and I hope it\u2019s not just a fad. The only way we can really stop it from being a fad is to get the people working behind the scenes [more diverse].\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the way to get there is ... getting the kids coming in here to see what\u2019s possible, to see what can be done no matter what background you\u2019re from. To see me, from my background,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIf I\u2019m here and I can do this, there is no reason why these kids can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nEnninful delights in how his team is also diversifying the front row of fashion shows. The mythical front row. In the alchemy of fashion show seating charts, it\u2019s a designation reserved for those who are gatekeepers, decision-makers, newsmakers. It is not a diverse place.\n\nIn 2013, Enninful remarked on this fact in especially blunt terms. As the fashion director of W magazine, he was in Paris for haute couture shows, a civilized realm of one-of-a-kind gowns and made-to-order daywear presented to admiring clients and industry professionals. Enninful arrived at one of the day\u2019s shows to find his counterparts at other magazines all seated in the front row. Enninful had been seated in the second. He was not pleased. And he did not take his designated seat.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a matter of wanting an unobstructed sightline to the runway. It was not ego. And while it may have been a minor detail, it was not a petty one. So he tweeted: \u201cIf all my (white) counterparts are seated in the front row, why should I be expected to take 2nd row? racism? xoxo.\u201d\n\nIt was the sort of remark that might have bubbled up privately over dinner but had never been stated publicly by someone of Enninful\u2019s stature, in part because so few editors of his stature are black. \u201cAt that moment, I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve been here working all these years, for 20 years. Same as this editor and same as that editor.\u2019 And there\u2019s just a level of respect, really,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind every fashion director in second row. But if you\u2019re putting me behind my contemporaries, then that means that is a problem that we need to address. My parents [said] when these things happen, stand up. So I stood up ... for myself \u2014 and for the future, really.\u201d\n\nThe matter was resolved privately to Enninful\u2019s satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019d do it again,\u201d he says. \u201cI was taught certain things that were right and wrong. It\u2019s that simple. And you know, at the time, I had to right a wrong.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnninful took the helm of British Vogue in August 2017. (Tom Hoops/for The Washington Post)\n\nIn Enninful\u2019s quest to halt the inertia of tradition \u2014 to make a century-old product modern \u2014 there have been bumps along the way. He severed ties with longtime editors and criticized the former editor in chief\u2019s failure to be inclusive by making plain his determination to be so. He hurt feelings and nicked egos. And there is concern among close readers that the magazine is publishing fewer long-form feature stories, a concern Enninful says is overblown. \u201cBritish Vogue always had a history of great journalism, and I guess because I come from the visual [side] people assume that maybe I can\u2019t read,\u201d he says. \u201cI studied English literature at university. I used to write all the things for i-D.\u201d British Vogue, he says, has published substantive features on abortion in Northern Ireland and racial tension in London, among others, and will continue to do so.\n\nBased on the numbers, the changes Enninful has made have been positively received. While overall circulation for British lifestyle glossies is down, British Vogue had a 1.1 percent uptick in circulation over last year. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, its circulation as of August 2018 was about 192,000. (In comparison, American Vogue\u2019s circulation is about 1.2 million, while Vogue Italia has a circulation of about 114,000.)\n\n\u201cThe reaction of readers and business partners, they feel [British Vogue] is relevant,\u201d Newhouse says. \u201cOur revenues are up by 8 percent, for a magazine that\u2019s more than 100 years old. That\u2019s not just a feeling; it\u2019s transforming into real revenue and profit.\u201d\n\nBritish Vogue may never be an advertising colossus like its American counterpart. But Enninful has nonetheless become a leader by the example he has set. He\u2019s turning a legacy brand into a next-generation fashion bible, not by reinventing the product but by reflecting its audience. To see Adwoa and then Vittoria, Halima, Adut, Faretta, Paloma, Radhika, Yoon, Fran and Selena on the cover of a fashion institution, one that regularly featured Princess Diana, is, well, something.\n\n\u201cI realize: Oh my God, this might be normal to me, but for Vogue, it\u2019s a different thing. Seeing this on i-D or W is different from seeing it on the cover of British Vogue with its incredible history,\u201d Enninful says. \u201cIt feels more real. It seems more substantial.\u201d\n\nDiversity is becoming part of the magazine\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s being written into its future history. Which matters because Vogue \u201cstands for tradition,\u201d as Enninful points out. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to evaporate in a year or two.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Spanish court rules union of sex workers illegal", "description": "Spain's National Court has outlawed a union of sex workers, saying that recognition of the group amounted to making the exploitation of prostitutes legal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/spanish-court-rules-union-of-sex-workers-illegal/2018/11/21/8ac8bd42-ed7f-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:21:08Z", "content": "MADRID Spains National Court has outlawed a union of sex workers, saying that recognition of the group amounted to making the exploitation of prostitutes legal.

REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nMany people \u2014 including roboticists, psychologists and philosophers \u2014 are trying to understand how the world will work when it is hard to distinguish artificial intelligence from human beings. Ordinary people often are creeped out when they discover that the \u201cperson\u201d they thought they were interacting with is actually an AI. Google learned this recently when its Duplex assistant, which could phone up restaurants and hair salons to book reservations and appointments \u2014 sounding just like a human, \u201cumms\u201d and \u201cahhs\u201d and all \u2014 caused public consternation.\n\nMy research, building on ideas that I have developed with Barry Weingast and that I am working on now with two graduate students in artificial intelligence, Dylan Hadfield-Menell and McKane Andrus, points to some more fundamental questions. We all live in normative social orders \u2014 sets of rules that say what is okay, and what is not okay to do, making complex interactions more predictable. If these rules are to work, they need to be enforced. But what happens when some of the human beings we think we are interacting with are bots?\n\nEven trivial-seeming rules can be important\n\nRules help provide order to the massively complex societies we live in, which otherwise would be completely unpredictable. Sometimes these rules are enforced by officials such as police and judges, but most of the time they are enforced by ordinary people, who disapprove of rule-breakers and end up refusing to do business with them. Rule compliance is expensive, but when these rules are not enforced, then society can get into trouble, because cheating becomes pervasive. Even worse, cheating can spread. If I think that no one is enforcing the rules, and everyone is cheating, then I don\u2019t want to be a sucker. Everyone, then, is always observing: Who is following, who is enforcing, the rules?\n\nThis creates what game theorists call a \u201csignaling\u201d problem, where people are trying to read signals from those around them as to whether they are cheating or enforcing the rules, and then deciding whether to comply or not. Here, my research with Hadfield-Menell and Andrus argues that \u201csilly rules\u201d \u2014 rules that don\u2019t seem to matter \u2014 can be crucially important.\n\nFor example, when an executive assistant uses friendly language in an email and signs his or her name with \u201cbest regards\u201d or \u201ccordially,\u201d it might seem like meaningless noise that doesn\u2019t contribute information about, for example, when a phone call needs to be scheduled. But many of us work in communities where using that language and style amounts to a rule \u2014 if we break the rule, we may be criticized or shunned. People in those communities don\u2019t see the rule as silly at all and get upset about perceived rudeness.\n\nWe argue that these silly rules reinforce more important ones \u2014 for instance, about keeping promises and respecting property \u2014 by providing information about whether rules in general are being obeyed. When there are lots of silly rules, provided they are cheap to enforce and follow, members of the group have lots of opportunities to observe what people do when someone in the group breaks the rules. That means people can figure out in low-stakes interactions whether to stick around for the high-stakes interactions.\n\nBots may mess these rules up\n\nAs businesses try to build congenial artificial intelligence, they get them to comply with silly rules. X.ai, for example, is a product that uses machine learning to learn how to act as a user\u2019s personal assistant over email. When you purchase this product, you get an AI assistant named either \u201cAndrew Ingram\u201d or \u201cAmy Ingram.\u201d If you want to schedule coffee with a new business contact over email, you CC \u201cAndrew\u201d or \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d take over scheduling, emailing the contact \u2014 \u201cHi, I\u2019m happy to help schedule coffee\u201d \u2014 and signing off with a \u201cname\u201d and \u201ctitle.\u201d An email exchange with \u201cAndrew\u201d or \u201cAmy\u201d appears in your contact\u2019s conversation threads.\n\nBut, of course, the AI system doesn\u2019t have a name and title; it can\u2019t feel happy to help; it isn\u2019t a person sitting alongside all the other people in someone\u2019s email inbox.\n\nThis leads to problems. Should your contact be polite to \u201cAndrew Ingram\u201d when they respond, even if Andrew Ingram is not a real person? Or do they just stick to the purely functional content: I\u2019m available at 9:30 on Wednesday? If, further into the exchange, \u201cAndrew\u201d makes a mistake about what they said, do they chastise \u201chim\u201d for not reading carefully? Or for treating them in a manner they consider rude? It\u2019s confusing \u2014 especially if people think at first that Andrew is human and only later discover that he is a bot. Andrew\u2019s politeness may not tell us much about whether his organization can be trusted on other rules.\n\nIf enough of us start interacting with bot schedulers who don\u2019t care if we are polite or not, we might all start to wonder whether the rules we really do care about \u2014 like whether people are timely in keeping their appointments or respect the confidentiality of what we tell them when we speak \u2014 will be enforced and followed.\n\nThis may damage social order\n\nOur work uses computational simulations of groups like this and finds that a group that has a lot of (cheap) silly rules is more likely to endure moments of doubt about whether the rules are being enforced. Groups face those kinds of moments all the time, as innovation and globalization continually shake up our understandings of which rules work when.\n\nThe risk with robots that impersonate humans is that silly rules will become less effective. The more bots that there are in our email chains and social interactions, the less opportunities we have to see whether people in our communities are following the important rules. And by having robots follow our silly rules, we introduce noise into the signals that real humans are sending. \u201cPoliteness\u201d from the \u201cassistants\u201d in an organization becomes a less reliable indicator of whether you can trust the humans in that organization if more of the \u201cassistants\u201d are robots.\n\nMaking robots that seem more human by following silly rules will indeed make them easier to work with. But we shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that these practices are just window-dressing. Silly rules play important roles in maintaining human social orders.\n\nGillian Hadfield is a professor of law and strategic management at the University of Toronto, a faculty affiliate at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and senior policy adviser at OpenAI.

Schmidt and Maggie Haberman broke the story yesterday evening that President Trump \"told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, according to two people familiar with the conversation.\"\n\nHowever: \"The lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, rebuffed the president, saying that he had no authority to order a prosecution. Mr. McGahn said that while he could request an investigation, that too could prompt accusations of abuse of power. To underscore his point, Mr. McGahn had White House lawyers write a memo for Mr. Trump warning that if he asked law enforcement to investigate his rivals, he could face a range of consequences, including possible impeachment.\"\n\nBottom line: \"The encounter was one of the most blatant examples yet of how Mr. Trump views the typically independent Justice Department as a tool to be wielded against his political enemies,\" Maggie and Schmidt report.\n\nA photo of the front of a flier that circulated on Capitol Hill shows some of the members-elect of the 116th Congress, on Tuesday.

S.): Remember when the National Republican Congressional Committee hosted classes with top aides to Republican incumbents on how to talk to female voters? That was five years ago. Those same lessons still apply for Republicans today following the thumping they took from women in the midterms.\n\nThe Trump factor: In 2018, President Trump, according to the Cook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman, \u201cwidened the gender divide in a way we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Particularly with \u201cmillions of professional Republican women\u201d who questioned the GOP in the Trump era and following confirmation of now-Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cRepublicans may never recover with that demographic,\u201d he warned.\n\nIn 2018, President Trump, according to the Cook Political Report\u2019s David Wasserman, \u201cwidened the gender divide in a way we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Particularly with \u201cmillions of professional Republican women\u201d who questioned the GOP in the Trump era and following confirmation of now-Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Young women: Historically, according to Dan Cox, the research director at the Public Religion Research Institute, women previously showed no preference when it came to voting for female candidates over male ones. But this year, a Suffolk/USA Today poll found that nearly one-third of young women ages 18 to 34 preferred the female candidate over the male one, compared with 19 percent of women overall.\n\nHistorically, according to Dan Cox, the research director at the Public Religion Research Institute, women previously showed no preference when it came to voting for female candidates over male ones.

'Macho prism': \u201cThe GOP was making progress leading up to Trump\u2019s election and that just really set the effort back,\u201d one former senior GOP Hill staffer told Power Up. \u201cHe is particularly unpopular [with] women for a variety of reasons and a lot of it is so basic to who he is. I have trouble thinking about a realistic plan for him changing that,\u201d the strategist lamented, referring to a \u201cvery antiquated toxic macho prism through which [Trump] seems to view the world.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just female voters who have fled the Republican Party. GOP female representation in Congress has decreased as well. The problem for Republicans was laid bare in one cringeworthy picture. A flier circulating on Capitol Hill last week pictured some of the members-elect from the most diverse House freshman class of Democrats in history alongside an overwhelmingly white and male smattering of headshots of incoming Republican freshmen.\n\nBy the numbers, per Wasserman:\n\nOne is the loneliest number: Out of a House freshman class of 31 on the GOP side, there is only one woman (Rep.-elect Carol Miller from West Virginia. GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) was elected to the Senate). That's compared to 35 new Democratic women in the House.\n\n(Rep.-elect Carol Miller from West Virginia. GOP Rep.

Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) told PK in an interview that simply put, more Republican women need to run for office. After asking GOP leaders during a post-election party meeting how they planned to recruit more female candidates, Stefanik she told PK she was \u201cstruck\u201d by the lack of an answer. Kane writes:\n\n\u201cStefanik is not known as a troublemaker, quite the opposite. Shortly after Paul Ryan became speaker, she got the honor of introducing him before a group of House interns. So, when she\u2019s standing up in front of her colleagues and demanding answers, it demonstrates the level of despair among GOP women.

More from their story:\n\nThen and now : Just a couple days ago, Trump promised a \u201cvery full report\u201d on Khashoggi's death and, before that, The Post reported the CIA had assessed with high-confidence that MBS ordered Khashoggi's killing. But now: \u201cIt appeared that no report was forthcoming, and it wasn't clear that the president had received any new information. CIA Director Gina Haspel had already shown the president details of the crown prince\u2019s involvement, officials said.\u201d\n\nInside the decision : \u201cTrump\u2019s defense of Saudi Arabia marks another instance when he has sided with the personal assurances of an autocrat, who has an incentive to deceive him, over the objective analysis of his own intelligence officials . . . Trump\u2019s decision to side with the Saudis, in the end, came down largely to the money he claimed the kingdom would bring to the U.S. economy,\u201d Josh, Shane and Karen report.\n\nFalse: \u201cTrump also took up a Saudi claim, fanned by some on the American political right, that Khashoggi was seen as an 'enemy of the state' and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group opposed by Riyadh. That amounted to an unsubstantiated slur toward Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, who though he had friends within the movement had also once been a loyal supporter and close ally to the Saudi royal family.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there. The Middle East in particular . . . It is the president\u2019s obligation and indeed the State Department\u2019s duty as well to ensure that we adopt policy that furthers America\u2019s national security. So as the president said today, the United States will continue to have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nRead The Post's editorial about the Trump administration's latest statements.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the outgoing Foreign Relations chair, isn't pleased:\n\n\u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t\u201d won\u2019t cut it. So tonight, @SenatorMenendez and I sent a second Global Magnitsky letter to the president requiring that he specifically determine whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal #Khashoggi. \u2014 Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) November 21, 2018\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\nNON-ALTERNATIVE FACTS: The Thanksgiving table can be a political minefield, which is why we're here to arm you with some facts with which to accurately zing your relatives.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn the early-morning hours of July 28, 2017, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona crossed the congressional aisle for a now-infamous huddle with Democratic lawmakers, the prelude to casting the decisive \u201cno\u201d vote on the Senate\u2019s \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nPolitical analysts tend to use the term \u201caisle-crossing\u201d in symbolic terms, a metaphor for lawmakers' willingness to cooperate with the opposing party to get things done. But a new working paper by Bryce J. Dietrich of the University of Iowa finds that in strictly literal terms, members of Congress today are much less likely to physically cross the aisle of the chamber to fraternize with members of the opposing party than they were even 10 or 15 years ago.\n\nTo quantify lawmakers' aisle-crossing behavior, Dietrich combed through more than 1,400 hours of C-SPAN footage covering the years from 1997 to 2012. He calls it \u201cthe largest collection of C-SPAN videos ever compiled.\"\n\nDietrich used a computer algorithm to focus on what he calls the \u201cant farm\u201d shots of the House Representatives \u2014 the high-angle shots showing lawmakers milling about the House floor during votes. He then had the computer key in on the telltale signs of motion that occur when a lawmaker physically crosses the aisle to mingle with members of the opposing party.\n\nHe finds that Republicans and Democrats grew less likely to cross aisles and speak with one another during the period he analyzed. \u201cAs Democrats and Republicans become increasingly divided,\u201d Dietrich writes, \u201cthey have more incentive to display party discipline which translates to an unwillingness to physically cross the aisle.\u201d\n\nLack of aisle-crossing was particularly prevalent both in the run-up to party-line votes, as well as in the aftermath of those votes. Polarization, in other words, isn\u2019t just an ideological abstraction \u2014 it\u2019s affecting how lawmakers move and operate in the physical world.\n\nOn some level that physical separation reflects what political scientists are observing all across the country: people increasingly sorting themselves into like-minded enclaves. Americans today are more likely to live and work with others who share their political beliefs than they were several decades ago.\n\n\u201cJust as Americans seem to be moving away from those who share opposing viewpoints,\u201d Dietrich writes, members of Congress \"seem less willing to expend the effort necessary to walk across the aisle, let alone work out their differences in order to find common ground.\u201d\n\nDietrich\u2019s measure provides a quantified confirmation of something that members of Congress have anecdotally noted: social interactions between lawmakers, once commonplace, are on the decline. It also tracks closely with a separate widely used measure of polarization based on how often members vote together.\n\nWould more aisle-crossing and bipartisan fraternization lead to a less polarized Congress? Some observers believe it would, but Dietrich is doubtful: he writes that the social freeze between the parties is most likely a consequence of ideological sorting and polarization, rather than a cause of it.\n\nAt any rate, there\u2019s nothing in the data to suggest the trend will reverse itself in coming years. Voting data show members of Congress continuing to drift away from each other ideologically, with survey data showing a similar split widening between voters.\n\nDietrich hopes, however, that other researchers in political science continue looking toward non-traditional metrics, like data derived from video recordings, to increase their understanding of the forces at work within Congress."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Brent E.

Netanyahu says he will take over temporarily as defense minister as early elections loom. (Ariel Schalit/AP)\n\nHead of the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party Avigdor Liberman resigned as defense minister in the aftermath of another flare-up of violence between Israel and Hamas. Protesting what he called Israel\u2019s too-soft policy on Hamas, Liberman took his five-member party out of the government coalition of religious and right-wing parties and called for new elections. Leaving the government with 61 seats in the Knesset, barely a majority out of 120, this stirred discussion among politicians and observers about whether Israel would have to go to elections now or wait until November 2019, the requisite date according to law.\n\nOnce elections are called, there would be at least three months before the vote takes place. Such a lapse poses risks for the parties as new escalations of violence between Israel and Hamas might cause the public to blame them. Or Netanyahu\u2019s legal troubles (he is under investigation for alleged corruption) could catch up to him.\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind, then, is: Can Benjamin Netanyahu keep the coalition together? And if not, can he win the election and gain a fifth term as prime minister?\n\nThen and now\n\nNetanyahu had only 61 seats when his right-wing Likud party formed the government after the 2015 election. But it was always more durable than conventional wisdom thought, for two reasons. One, none of the parties in the coalition wanted to take a chance on new elections; fear of losing support kept them together. Two, there was always the chance that an outside party would be brought in to shore up the government\u2019s numbers \u2014 as indeed happened when Liberman entered the coalition in May 2016.\n\nSo what\u2019s changed? First, Liberman has been unhappy with how things have gone for him and for Israel. He is generally hawkish on foreign policy, and would prefer to take a hard line against Hamas, including using military force, although he has tempered those hard-line tendencies before. This time, though, he seems genuinely angry that Israel agreed to a cease-fire. But he also sees that his term as defense minister hadn\u2019t strengthened him as a contender in the eyes of Jewish Israeli voters. A poll conducted after the cease-fire found that 69 percent of Israelis were unhappy with how Liberman handled the crisis, but 74 percent were also unhappy with Netanyahu. Given this discontent, Liberman thinks he can play up Netanyahu\u2019s mishandling by emphasizing that it prevented him from using greater force against Hamas.\n\nHe might be right. In three surveys conducted over the weekend, Liberman\u2019s resignation was seen as appropriate by 55 to 59 percent of the public, while 75 percent agreed that the cease-fire was \u201cgiving in to terror.\u201d In all three polls, support for Liberman\u2019s party increased by one to three seats.\n\nSecond, Liberman\u2019s resignation convinced the other parties that the old, but slim, 61-seat majority was too fragile because the nearness of the election has made them jittery. Party leaders don\u2019t want to be held responsible for triggering new elections. They do, however, want to force other party leaders to bring down the government and take the blame even while they see how much they can push their own demands within the government.\n\nRisk factors at play\n\nDespite these conditions, the coalition and the election are still Netanyahu\u2019s to lose. Indeed, conditions in 2018 are very similar to conditions in 2014, when observers wondered whether a July war between Israel and Hamas would bring Netanyahu down. Netanyahu is risk-averse, but he is also a good politician, so he knows how to provoke emotional reactions in the electorate that would channel their votes toward his party. He is also very lucky, in that no other party has a leader with the charisma, political courage, vision and institutional support to challenge him, so that Jewish Israelis typically see him as better than the other options.\n\nIn addition, Gaza isn\u2019t a problem of Netanyahu\u2019s making. Previous Israeli prime ministers haven\u2019t been able to deal with it because there are structural conditions in place that no Israeli or Palestinian leader has been able to break down.\n\nThe security implications of Hamas in Gaza pose a threat to any Israeli government, since Hamas refuses to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. But since right-wing governments proclaim they are better at defense and security issues, they face a particular pressure to deal with it. Combined, these two conditions lead to the reality that the status quo is still the safest bet for a right-wing Israeli government.\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu has sought to avoid Gaza and prioritizes the status quo. He wasn\u2019t looking for escalation or to use military force as an electoral prop, because if Israel got bogged down in an extended fight or Israeli civilians died as a result of rocket fire, then his credibility would be shot. He often presents himself as the best protector of Israel\u2019s security, so a drawn-out fight with Hamas that includes Israeli casualties would undermine that image.\n\nThis helps explain, too, why Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want elections now: Vocal segments of the public are already angry at the cease-fire and the lack of a military response to Hamas rockets. The longer it takes to get to elections, the less intense the public memory of this moment will be.\n\nThe other parties in the government are still reluctant to take a chance on new elections, especially if they are seen as the cause of them. Naftali Bennett, leader of the rightist-religious Zionist Bayit Yehudi party and considered a challenger to Netanyahu from the right, originally demanded that he be appointed defense minister in Liberman\u2019s place or else his party would leave the government. When Netanyahu refused, Bennett walked his threat back and said he\u2019s content to be considered a candidate for the position. Moshe Kahlon, of the center-right Kulanu party, insists that the government cannot effectively govern with a one-seat majority, but he has not moved to pull out of the coalition and will be meeting with Netanyahu soon to further discuss this.\n\nIn the coming weeks, any of his coalition partners could still decide to bring down the government. For the moment, though, it is limping along. It\u2019s worth noting, too, that relations with the United States under President Trump, and the Trump peace plan, haven\u2019t played any role in these developments. This isn\u2019t unusual; contrary to popular belief, the United States isn\u2019t a major factor in Israeli elections. This time, especially, it\u2019s all about the parties\u2019 political maneuverings.\n\nBrent Sasley is associate professor of political science at the University of Texas at Arlington and co-author of \u201cPolitics in Israel: Governing a Complex Society.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Michael Scherer", "title": "How to influence campaigns: Take inexperienced staffers, stir in a small amount of money, Democrats find", "description": "A digital test in two House districts finds that even affordable web ads can move voters, a potential boon to underfinanced candidates in future races.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-to-influence-campaigns-take-inexperienced-staffers-stir-in-a-small-amount-of-money-democrats-find/2018/11/20/c7a75ca2-ec1f-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/A61ft6MJl-40YfoC80DI_12kFqs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H2P5QRXNAMI6ROVMFJTU5EKQFM.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:00:00Z", "content": "Andrew Grant, a Republican long shot who ran for Congress near Sacramento, never knew his attacker was in her 20s or that she was spending $39,000 against him as part of a secret experiment.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nAndrew Grant, a Republican long shot who ran for Congress near Sacramento, never knew his attacker was in her 20s or that she was spending $39,000 against him as part of a secret experiment.\n\nBut the digital ads placed by Soraya Vaezi on behalf of the Democratic group Priorities USA were hard to miss, as they blanketed parts of his district in the final weeks of the campaign: basic stop-motion videos that accused him of siding with donors to cut taxes for the \u201cultra rich\u201d and cut health-care coverage for millions.\n\n\u201cThey posted on Instagram and were shared with me,\u201d said Grant, who was outraised by his opponent, Democratic incumbent Ami Bera, five to one and lost his election by 10 percentage points. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a way of telling people otherwise.\u201d\n\nGrant was a guinea pig in a much larger effort by Priorities to improve the way Democrats compete digitally in elections. In addition to spending about $50 million on digital ads this cycle, the group ran experiments behind the scenes to create a new playbook for liberal groups as they rush to catch up with GOP advantages online.\n\nThe goal was to bridge the gap with Republican campaigns, which have spent a higher percentage of their election money online in recent cycles. While Democrats narrowed the gap this cycle, Democrats still believe they were outspent digitally \u2014 evenin a year when Democratic money flooded the political system. An analysis by Priorities of outside groups estimated that Democrats spent $86 million online this cycle, compared to $115 million for Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough for us to just go spend money on digital. We wanted to encourage, incentivize, shame, educate other organizations to do the same thing,\u201d said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities. \u201cWe wanted to be able to show other people it worked.\u201d\n\nWithout public notice, Priorities ran tests on Facebook\u2019s secret algorithms to try to decode how long an ad could run before its frequency wasdiminished in news feeds. It created a dashboard so other liberal groups could legally coordinate their ad purchases with minimal overlap. And it ran extensive testing on the types of advertising that worked best, often discovering that what staff believed would work did not.\n\n\u201cMore often than not we were wrong about what was going to be the thing that worked best,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, the group\u2019s creative director.\n\nLanguage about bipartisanship tested well in polls, but performed poorly online. \u201cPeople want you to be bipartisan problem solvers for the things that they like,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cAnd so often that message would fall flat when you tested an execution of it because you are not saying anything that affects people lives.\u201d\n\nMessaging on President Trump to minority voters could discourage Democratic voting by reminding people why they wanted nothing to do with the process. Even an ad that featured a woman giving herself a pep talk in the mirror created a backlash, because people didnot want to see someone brushing their teeth or using a Q-Tip.\n\nIn perhaps the most ambitious experiment, Priorities set aside about $100,000 to test a basic problem that confronts many House campaigns that lack the budgets to hire a digital consulting firm. The question: Could young staff with a few months of basic training design, target and execute an effective digital campaign on their own?\n\nTwo races were targeted. Vaezi, a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin, focused on Grant\u2019s race in California, and Charlotte Robertson, a recent graduate of Ithaca College, targeted the seat of Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. in the northern suburbs of Milwaukee The ads were aimed at registered voters who cast ballots in recent elections, but only to half the precincts in the district. That waythe effectiveness of the campaign could be measured against a control group\u2019s election results.\n\n\u201cBefore this, Charlotte and I had never used most of the software we were using to develop the creative,\u201d said Vaezi.\n\n\u201cBy most of it, she means all of it,\u201d Robertson added.\n\nBoth had help from a team at Priorities that split the precinct data so they could make ad purchases themselves on platforms such as Facebook and Google. They also received basic research about what messages could work well in the districts.\n\nThe ads against Sensenbrenner also attacked him for voting to \u201cstrip health care\u201d by supporting a repeal of Obamacare, while claiming he favored out-of-state donors. A second set of ads had a positive introductory message about his Democratic opponent, Tom Palzewicz, who received about 38 percent of the vote on Election Day, compared to Sensenbrenner\u2019s 62 percent.\n\nThe preliminary results of both tests, however, suggest the experiment was effective. The precincts that were targeted moved toward the Democrats by between 0.8 and 1 percentage point over the control group. Priorities estimates that the cost per vote won through the advertising will be about $40.\n\n\u201cThe lesson is you can do digital,\u201d said Danielle Butterfield, the director of advertising at Priorities. \u201cAnyone can do digital.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a message that other consultants have been pushing, as they try to persuade the party to spend more money digitally next time.\n\n\u201cFor 2018, Democrats still had in a lot of places a very traditional media mix,\u201d said Mark Jablonowski, the managing partner of DSPolitical, a Democratic firm that has its own low-cost self-serve product for smaller campaigns. \u201cI worry that when we had a blue wave that rises all ships that people could take the wrong message away from it.\u201d\n\nBack in California\u2019s Central Valley, Grant had less praise for the upstart efforts against him, which focused on a single spot that attacked him for supporting cutting health coverage to give tax cuts to campaign donors. He supported the Republican tax bill criticized in the spot, which repealed the individual mandate meant to pay for coverage for uninsured Americans. But he said he did not support repealing Obamacare without a replacement, as the ad against him implied. He also said the ad suggested he had voted for the tax bill, even though he does not hold elected office.\n\n\u201cThey were misleading,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\nBut he said he was not surprised to see the ads show up. \u201cI was actually surprised to see they didn\u2019t come after me more,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washpostvisuals", "title": "The new Arctic frontier", "description": "As the ice melts, U.S. prepares for possible threats from Russia and China", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/arctic-climate-change-military-russia-china/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/arctic-climate-change-military-russia-china/img/1800/Z34C5QHDPMI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:00:00Z", "content": "UNALASKA, Alaska \u00ad Army helicopters began flying in and out of the scraggily wilderness near this fishing town in August, surprising even the mayor.

The strike group, carrying thousands of sailors, practiced cold-weather operations in the Norwegian Sea, an area where Russian submarines operate.\n\n\u201cCertainly America has got to up its game in the Arctic.

(Kadir van Lohuizen/NOOR)\n\nRecent upgrades include new sensors on several Aleutian islands for a radar network known as the North Warning System. It was first installed during the Cold War to watch for incoming aircraft and ballistic missiles, but the Pentagon concluded more recently that existing radar did not offer \u201cadequate detection and identification of aircraft operating outside the continental United States,\u201d according to an Air Force assessment.\n\nThat prompted the operation involving the helicopters in Unalaska.\n\nA military spokeswoman, Leah Garton, said the mission allowed the aircrews to practice navigating over water and landing in mountainous areas, where the sensors were installed. The new equipment will \u201cassist in flight safety for all civilian and military aircraft in the local area,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new Navy and Coast Guard Arctic strategies would follow the national defense strategy released by Mattis in January that made countering Russia and China a priority. Both nations have shown interest in Arctic resources as the ice melts, including fossil fuels, diamonds, and metals like nickel and platinum.\n\nAn Arctic boom As the ice melts and technology improves, resources will be more easily extracted from the Arctic. For decades, the natural gas fields on Russia\u2019s Yamal Peninsula were deemed too expensive to develop, but projects there are taking off.

Both China and Russia have moved to tap the Arctic\u2019s vast resources of fossil fuels, diamonds and metals.

Scientists also have a stake in the region. Glacier samples, known as ice cores, may offer clues to climate change and the planet\u2019s past weather patterns. Tourism has been on the rise as well. Melting ice has made the region easier to navigate and opened it up to oil and gas exploration.\n\nRussia has more than 40 icebreakers \u2014 the U.S. military has two working ones \u2014 and stationed more troops in the region. China, meanwhile, is building its third polar icebreaker and staked a claim this year as a \u201cnear-Arctic\u201d state, further injecting itself into policy debates.\n\n\"We're obviously watching both the Russians and the Chinese quite closely,\" said Vice Adm. Linda L. Fagan, who oversees Coast Guard operations in the Arctic and Pacific. \"Russia, on their side of the Arctic in sort of the Northern Sea Route, is investing heavily in commercial infrastructure and in military infrastructure.\"\n\nCoast Guard Capt.

(Kadir van Lohuizen/NOOR)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that school of international realism: If you\u2019re not here, someone else will be,\u201d Tlapa said. \u201cThe nation doesn\u2019t have a deep-bench strength in terms of capabilities to operate up here and project power and protect our national interests.\u201d\n\nThe potential militarization has raised hope for investment in places like Unalaska and Nome, a port town on Alaska\u2019s western coast.\n\nUnalaska, with nearly 5,000 full-time residents, is perhaps best known as the port in Discovery Channel\u2019s \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d series. The town processes the largest volume of commercial fishing in the United States each year, with the company UniSea operating hotels, bunkhouses and bars there.\n\nThe fishing helps make Unalaska home to hundreds of bald eagles, which scavenge dumpsters, perch on lamp posts and occasionally swoop down to attack people.\n\nThe town \u2014 which takes its name from the Aleut word \u201cOunalashka,\u201d meaning \u201cnear the peninsula\u201d \u2014 has struggled with unemployment, alcoholism and bar fights. But Kelty said that has improved in recent years as the number of full-time residents increases and the success of the fishing industry has helped bankroll paved roads, schools and other municipal projects.\n\nPromise and peril Traditions will be at risk as the temperatures rise. Remote towns and cities like Point Hope, Alaska, may soon be more accessible to commercial ventures. That could bring a host of new problems. Most residents of the tiny settlement of Oqaatsut, Greenland, used to be hunters. But the instability of the sea ice has made searching for whales and seals more difficult. As the Arctic thaw shapes military policy, it is also posing problems for indigenous groups. The government allows the Inuit community in Point Hope to catch 10 whales a year, but the melting ice has made the hunt much harder. photos for captions The nomadic, reindeer-herding Nenets people of Siberia face a challenging environment that could soon become even more precarious. Their location is sparsely populated but strategically important to business and military interests. Scarce sunlight makes tanning beds a necessity in remote parts of Russia, but residents still find ways to have fun. The economic boom has breathed life into struggling regions, but it remains uncertain what life will be like for younger generations, among them the cadets at a naval school in Murmansk.\n\nEchoes of World War II are still obvious across Unalaska. The hull of the SS Northwestern, a ship bombed during a Japanese air raid in 1942, rests upended in a bay, and many World War II-era buildings have been repurposed by the fishing industry. The ruins of an old Army installation, Fort Mears, overlook Dutch Harbor.\n\nThough nothing is planned, Kelty argued that an influx of U.S. troops could bring infrastructure projects that could benefit residents, such as the installation of undersea fiber-optic cables from mainland Alaska that could bring more affordable Internet and cellphone service.\n\nIn Nome, the Army Corps of Engineers is studying whether the small city's port can be dug deeper to handle large vessels. Doing so would add another deepwater port on the Bering Sea, 730 miles closer to the Arctic Circle than Unalaska. Both towns are below the circle but are considered a part of the Arctic by the U.S. government because of how connected they are to it.\n\nDespite its distance from the Arctic, Unalaska is the last deepwater port where large ships heading to the Arctic can refuel in the western United States, and the first when returning. However, it is not considered ideal by mariners and pilots because of its limitations, which include no highway connecting it to mainland Alaska, limited communications and wild weather in which thick fog and high winds are common and can maroon visitors for days.\n\nElsewhere in the Arctic, the Pentagon has begun to expand its presence through training exercises with partner nations. In Europe, the Marine Corps is deepening relationships with Norway, Finland and Sweden, training units of rank-and-file troops in the shadow of Russia. In June, Norway\u2019s government asked the United States to increase the number of Marines there from about 330 to 700, with plans to base them on a rotational basis in the Norwegian Arctic.\n\nRussia vaguely warned Norway that there will be \u201cconsequences\u201d to the decision, and U.S. and Norwegian officials have sought to stress that the arrangement is meant to deepen their security partnership and build expertise on existing Arctic training ranges, rather than deter Russian aggression.\n\nThe Norwegian navy out on patrol.

Carroll Jr., the deputy commander of Marine Corps Forces Europe, said commanders want to make sure service members are familiar with the biting cold and can move through the countryside on skis or snowshoes.\n\n\u201cEverything is hard. Everything is more difficult,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWhen the wind is blowing at freakin\u2019 30 miles per hour, it\u2019s dark 24-7, and it\u2019s minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit, and you\u2019ve got to put your gear in your pack, get out of your rack, get out of your sleeping bag, get outside the tent and go do something \u2014 everything is hard.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force also has sought to strengthen its relationships with Arctic allies, said Iris Ferguson, a civilian analyst for the service. That includes the formation of the Arctic Challenge exercise over Europe that will probably test air-to-air combat and other skills and involve Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United States at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cThe demands of the region make alliances and partnerships all the more vital,\u201d said Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force\u2019s top officer.\n\nThe Air Force is planning to base two squadrons of advanced F-35A fighters in Alaska by 2022, supplementing a fleet of jets that already includes two squadrons of F-22 Raptors, considered the Pentagon\u2019s best in air-to-air combat. The decision will allow the Air Force to take advantage of the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, a sprawling installation that includes 65,000 square miles of space for pilots to train.\n\n\u201cAir power, in particular, plays such a crucial role in this region,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe ice is melting, absolutely, but the reality is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to operate from a surface perspective, either on ocean or on land. That is certainly the case in the near future, and I would argue probably much farther afield as well.\u201d\n\nUnrecognizable terrain The stark landscape conveys a sense of permanent isolation. But as Arctic waterways grow freer of ice, they could soon be crowded with military and commercial vessels. Already, the melting water is forming new streams and rivers, and people whose livelihoods depended on more frigid temperatures are being forced to adjust. What were once mountains of ice are now gushing rivers. photos for captions\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps increasingly have trained ground forces in Alaska. In March, a joint force of about 1,500 U.S. troops trained together in an exercise known as Arctic Edge, with some driving armored vehicles across frosty terrain and others moving on foot through frigid, snowy conditions.\n\nArmy Maj. Chad Peltier, the commandant of the school at the Northern Warfare Training Center in Black Rapids, said instructors stress to students the things that change when working in extreme subzero temperatures.\n\n\u201cIf you bring your weapon from the temperature into a warmer environment \u2014 say, inside of a tent \u2014 and then you bring it back out into that negative-40, negative-60 temperature, the condensation that has built up is enough to freeze that weapon up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple thing that can disable a warfighter.\u201d\n\nCanadian service members train in the Arctic, learning about winter survival and receiving guidance from the Canadian Ranger Patrol Group, an Inuit unit. (Kadir van Lohuizen/NOOR)\n\nThe elevated profile of Arctic operations at the center has raised the possibility that the Army will replace a tracked personnel carrier known as the small-unit sustainment vehicle, or SUSV. The vehicle, first fielded in the 1980s, rides high on snow and sometimes tows a squad of soldiers on skis behind it, said Jared Sapp, a science adviser to U.S. Army Alaska.\n\nAt sea, the Navy has operated submarines in the Arctic since the 1940s and carries out a large training every year with them known as ICEX north of Alaska.\n\nIn April, Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the recent decrease in polar ice has prompted the Navy to begin preparing a new Arctic strategy just four years after the last one was released.\n\nThe plan will incorporate \u201cblue-water Arctic operations,\u201d in which ships without icebreaking capability sail in areas that were once more frozen, he said.\n\nAsked by reporters after the hearing what triggered the new review, Spencer was blunt.\n\n\u201cThe damn thing melted,\u201d he said.\n\n[What are your questions about the changing Arctic?

She had two nonviolent drug convictions, for possessing marijuana and delivering 12 grams of methamphetamine. But when she was arrested in a third drug case, she said, the office of U.S. Attorney Matthew G. Whitaker decided to make an example of her.\n\nUnder Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, Woody was given a choice: spend the rest of her life in jail, or accept a plea bargain sentence of 21 to 27 years, according to court records. She took the deal.\n\nJudge Robert W. Pratt in the Southern District of Iowa later accused federal prosecutors of having \u201cmisused\u201d their authority in Woody\u2019s nonviolent case. He urged President Barack Obama to commute her sentence \u2014 and Obama did shorten her term, after she had served 11 years.\n\nWoody\u2019s case highlights one of the most controversial if little-known aspects of Whitaker\u2019s \u00adcareer: his efforts to obtain unusually stiff sentences for people accused of drug crimes.\n\nWhitaker spent nearly five years as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. His office was more likely than all but one other district in the United States to use its authority to impose the harshest sentences on drug offenders, according to a finding by a different Iowa federal judge, Mark W. Bennett, who called it a \u201cdeeply troubling disparity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president can look at my case and he can see that what I had done wasn\u2019t severe enough to warrant that many years, then why was I given that many years to begin with, why was that much of my life taken from me?\u201d Woody, a 57-year-old mother of five, said in an interview. \u201cI blame Whitaker\u2019s office and \u00adeverybody underneath him.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this article.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s record on drug sentencing is newly relevant after President Trump ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general this month and replaced him on a temporary basis with Whitaker, who was Sessions\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nTrump last week announced his support for legislation that would give judges more discretion in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders and reducing prison terms. Sessions had opposed the bill. Now Whitaker, as acting head of the Justice Department, is in a powerful position to try to influence the outcome.\n\nWhitaker has come under intense scrutiny since Trump appointed him on Nov. 7. His un\u00ad\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox selection, with no Senate confirmation, has drawn attention because of concerns that he could interfere with or shut down special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhitaker has also drawn scrutiny for saying that judges should have a \u201cbiblical view\u201d of the law and that courts should be an \u201cinferior branch\u201d of government. In addition, he worked as a board member for an invention-marketing company that shut down in May and agreed to pay nearly $26 million to resolve a complaint from the Federal Trade Commission, which accused it of bilking customers.\n\nSupporters cite Whitaker\u2019s five years as a U.S. attorney as his most relevant experience to be acting attorney general. He was working as a private attorney when he was recommended for the job by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). President George W. Bush nominated Whitaker, and he was sworn into office on June 15, 2004.\n\nA year later, Whitaker said that his office had tried 500 cases, of which 271 were drug cases, most of them involving methamphetamine. At the time, Iowa, like many states, was trying to quell the growing use of meth.\n\nThe Bush administration had encouraged tough sentences on repeat offenders, and Whitaker used a powerful tool that gave him discretion to impose longer jail times than other parts of the country.\n\nIn 1970, Congress passed legislation that gave U.S. attorneys the ability to dramatically lengthen prison terms. It was called an \u201c851 enhancement\u201d filing, under which a second-time offender\u2019s sentence could be \u201cenhanced\u201d so that a 10-year sentence automatically was extended to 20 years. A third-time offender could receive a life term.\n\nA judge had no choice other than to impose the longer sentence. A prior offense could be as little as an aggravated misdemeanor in a state court that led to no jail time. Critics have long said it has been misused in some jurisdictions by overzealous federal prosecutors.\n\nQuestions about the use of these filings came to the attention of Bennett, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Iowa. He suspected that defendants in his court were more likely to face increased sentences than those in neighboring Nebraska, and he took it upon himself to conduct a \u00adnationwide analysis.\n\nHe found a wide disparity and inserted the results of his study into his ruling in a case that had come before him. He found that Whitaker\u2019s office used its power to make such filings more than any other U.S. attorney except one in a Florida district. (A U.S. attorney in Guam, a U.S. territory, had a higher rate but a statistically insignificant number of cases.) The judge based his finding on cases during fiscal 2006, 2008 and 2009. Whitaker\u2019s term began in mid-2004 and ended in January 2009. While the report covered only part of Whitaker\u2019s service, it was a broad enough sample for Bennett to consider it representative.\n\nThe rate at which Whitaker\u2019s office and another one in Iowa sought the harshest possible sentence was a \u201cjaw-dropping and deeply troubling disparity compared to the vast majority of federal courts in the nation,\u201d Bennett said in a statement to The Washington Post. Whitaker never appeared before him, and he declined to comment about Whitaker\u2019s term as U.S. attorney.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s Southern District of Iowa used enhanced sentences in 84 percent of relevant cases, compared with 26 percent nationwide, Bennett\u2019s finding said. Bennett concluded that a defendant in the Northern District of Iowa \u2014 which had a rate of filings similar to Whitaker\u2019s district \u2014 was 2,532 percent more likely to be subjected to an enhanced sentence compared with someone convicted of a similar offense in a Nebraska district.\n\n\u201cI found their harshness in filing 851 notices inexplicable,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nIn Raeanna Woody\u2019s case, the filing was used as leverage by Whitaker\u2019s office. Woody, whose last name at the time was Paxton, appeared before Judge Pratt in the Southern District on July 10, 2008.\n\nHer previous drug convictions resulted in little or no jail time. Her third offense occurred when authorities determined that she drove a car in which another individual was pursuing a drug deal.\n\nWoody said a prosecutor from Whitaker\u2019s office, Jason T. Griess, had informed her that, as a third-time offender, her sentence could be \u201cenhanced\u201d to mandatory life in prison under an 851 filing. She said she had no choice but to make a plea bargain that resulted in the sentence of 21 to 27 years.\n\n\u201cI remember them saying through Jason that he wouldn\u2019t budge, and \u2018me and my office are going to make an example out of you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGriess declined to comment for this article.\n\nWhen the sentencing came before Pratt, he made clear that he was appalled that Whitaker\u2019s office had used the threat of a life sentence to get Woody to agree to the plea bargain.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s entirely too long a sentence,\u201d Pratt told Woody, according to the sentencing transcript, but he said the agreement left him no choice.\n\nThe matter eventually came to the attention of JaneAnne Murray, who runs the University of Minnesota Law School\u2019s Clemency Project. Murray, who took on the case, said Woody\u2019s \u201csentence was excessive by any measure.\u201d\n\nMurray wrote a report to Pratt urging clemency. Pratt then wrote a letter to Obama\u2019s pardon attorney expressing his displeasure with how the case had been handled by Whitaker\u2019s office. Pratt wrote in the May 13, 2016, letter that he was forced to impose a sentence that \u201cwas entirely disproportionate\u201d to her crime.\n\nThe \u201cmost compelling reason\u201d that the president should grant clemency, Pratt wrote, was that Whitaker\u2019s office \u201cmisused\u201d its power by threatening Woody with a life sentence by using the 851 filing, \u201ceffectively removing my discretion\u201d to give Woody \u201ca fair sentence.\u201d Pratt stressed that Woody \u201cwas and is a nonviolent offender. She was not a significant player in the overall \u2018conspiracy\u2019 in this case. . . . This was not a conspiracy that involved \u2018drug kingpins.\u2019 It was a situation where methamphetamine-addicted individuals resorted to selling the drug to support their own addictions.\u201d\n\nPratt declined to comment for this article.\n\nWhile Woody was serving her 11th year in federal prison, she got a phone call telling her that Obama had granted her clemency. She eventually was freed, got remarried and moved to Cheyenne, Wyo., where she works at a factory assembling medical devices.\n\nWhitaker was replaced as U.S. attorney by Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, who became interested in the job partly because of his outrage over the sentencing of his father. Michael Klinefeldt was given a 10-year term in a methamphetamine case brought by Whitaker\u2019s predecessor. Nicholas Klinefeldt said that by 2013 he had stopped using 851 enhancement filings to lengthen sentences.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue I completely disagreed with Matt Whitaker on,\u201d Klinefeldt said. \u201cFrankly, we are never going to prosecute our way out of our drug problem. Lengthy sentences for drug criminals is not the answer.\u201d\n\nWhitaker, who lost a 2014 campaign for the Senate, subsequently seemed to have made a turnabout on sentencing. On July 20, 2016, two months after Pratt wrote his letter urging Woody\u2019s clemency, he attended a news conference in support of legislation to reduce sentences of non\u00adviolent drug offenders. Standing by the bill\u2019s co-sponsor, Grassley, Whitaker declared that it would \u201cfree up\u201d space in federal prisons and enable the government to \u201cfocus on violent criminals.\u201d\n\nA month later, Obama commuted Woody\u2019s sentence.\n\nCarol D.

(Jonathan Paye -Layleh/Associated Press)\n\nMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 The only memento Moses Z. Kaine has from his father is a T-shirt, left more than two decades ago when the peacekeeper\u2019s tour of duty finished and he returned home, leaving his pregnant girlfriend behind.\n\n\u201cI was still in my mother\u2019s womb when my father ended his duties and left Liberia,\u201d the 21-year-old told The Associated Press. \u201cMy mother says my father wore this T-shirt when he came around to visit her. She still can remember those moments well.\u201d\n\nThe story is as old as war itself: Children left behind by the soldiers who fathered them.\n\nKaine is among more than 6,000 children fathered by soldiers in a West African peacekeeping mission that came to Liberia in 1990 and left eight years later, according to a center set up to register and support them. A smaller number of children were fathered by members of a separate U.N. mission that emerged as Liberia struggled to emerge from a vicious civil war.\n\nMany of the Liberian children, now grown, have never met their fathers. Others were abandoned by their mothers and grew up as orphans. As they enter adulthood two decades after the peacekeepers\u2019 departure, they are the focus of new attention in a world coming to terms with sexual exploitation and abuse by soldiers sent to protect vulnerable communities.\n\nUnlike many of the Liberian children left behind, Kaine says his father looked out for him, asking if he could bring the boy and his mother home to where he lived.\n\n\u201cFamily pressure and fears made my mother remain,\u201d he said pensively.\n\nEven the few details Kaine has about his father are inconclusive: The T-shirt worn by his father, Lt. Cpl. Taiwo-Oyetunji, still clearly bears the seal of the West African regional body ECOWAS, under whose umbrella the ECOMOG peacekeepers arrived. It\u2019s a shirt from Niger, though his father\u2019s ID says he is of the Yoruba tribe, from Nigeria. Kaine became emotional upon seeing an identity card with him pictured in his uniformed father\u2019s arms.\n\nThe young man recently made his way to a support center in Liberia\u2019s capital, Monrovia, that was set up to help the thousands of children left behind by peacekeepers.\n\nThe United Nations-ECOMOG Children Organization, or UNECO, encouraged soldiers to register themselves and their children. They say they registered more than 6,000 children and eventually set up an orphanage on Monrovia\u2019s outskirts.\n\nMany of the West African soldiers cooperated, while others had to be found to register, said Ciah Cole, who set up the center with her husband, the Rev. Abraham Cole. Still, it was not possible to register all of them and much of the material was lost over the years, severing any chance for the children to track their fathers down.\n\nLiberia was in turmoil for 14 years amid back-to-back civil wars that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and forced more than half a million to flee to neighboring countries. The first civil war, which began in 1989 and became one of Africa\u2019s bloodiest conflicts, led to a regional peacekeeping force that at one point reached 15,000 troops. A U.N peacekeeping mission later emerged, only to leave Liberia earlier this year.\n\nWhile many women were raped during the fighting, the thousands of peacekeepers\u2019 children were largely the product of relationships Liberian women sought out as a shelter from hunger and hardship. At the time, peacekeepers had some of the best access to food in Monrovia.\n\n\u201cPeople were starving. There was nowhere to turn and women had to look for different ways to survive,\u201d Cole said.\n\nThe relationships went against the code of ethics for both ECOWAS and the U.N., which forbid sexual contact with people under the peacekeepers\u2019 protection because the potential for exploitation and abuse was high. In the early 2000s, the U.N. refugee agency reported that peacekeepers and humanitarian workers in Liberia had demanded sex in exchange for food, medicines, shelter and education.\n\nEnforcing bans on such relationships remains a major challenge, according to an Associated Press investigation last year that uncovered roughly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers in various countries over a 12-year period.\n\nIn Liberia, the thousands of children who resulted from those relationships have now been largely absorbed by society. Nearly 40 of them still live at the UNECO center, which is painted in the peacekeepers\u2019 camouflage colors. Over the years, the center has helped to raise many of the children with little financial support.\n\n\u201cWhen there is no father, no mother, you are handicapped,\u201d said 24-year-old Nana Addo, who was placed in the center by his mother in 1995. He has lost hope of ever seeing his Ghanaian father \u201cbut if he\u2019s still alive and I see him, I will be happy.\u201d\n\nThe problem is larger than reported, but resources are scarce, said Cole.\n\n\u201cMany of the mothers are hiding, refusing to identify themselves because they say it is shameful and disgraceful that those solders had children by them but could not return to see what\u2019s happening to the children they left behind.\u201d\n\nShe called on governments that contributed peacekeepers to Liberia to assist the children, and urged Liberia\u2019s government to set an example.\n\nWhile a far smaller number of the children were fathered by members of the U.N. mission that arrived years later, the U.N. says it made outreach efforts so Liberian women could register any complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse and receive assistance.\n\nSpokespeople at ECOWAS headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria declined to comment to The Associated Press, saying they did not have the information needed to respond.\n\nSome former ECOWAS soldiers, however, remember relationships with Liberian women well.\n\nMamadou Dalaba, a former Guinean soldier, said many colleagues impregnated local women and left without telling them once the war was over.\n\nAnother who served in Guinea\u2019s first contingent of soldiers in 1990 said many men had children with Liberian girlfriends in Monrovia. The men looked after the children as long as they could before returning home, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nFor the Liberians left behind, those broken bonds still hurt more than two decades later.\n\nKaine, the young man who clings to his father\u2019s T-shirt and ID card, says he was fortunate to grow up with his mother. He wants to become a mechanic but says he had to leave school this semester due to lack of support. \u201cThe country has become too tough,\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\nHe, too, issued an appeal to all the peacekeepers who left Liberian children behind to come back and support them.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s Liberia, depending on the government to help people like me is like relying on a broken stick to stand and walk,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

The cold air gradually eases Friday into the weekend, with rain likely Saturday into Saturday evening, perhaps starting briefly as freezing rain or sleet north and west of town.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Wednesday): Temperatures stay seasonably cool today as a cold front gradually approaches from the northwest. We\u2019ll start out in the 30s this morning, and with partly sunny skies, we should reach the upper 40s to near 50 this afternoon. Winds become a bit breezy during the afternoon, about 10 to 15 mph from the west. Great travel weather by the way, with the vast majority of the East Coast, and actually most of the nation, expected to see little to no precipitation. Confidence: High\n\nTonight: The cold front moves through this evening. That shifts our winds to come from the north-northwest and keeps them somewhat breezy at 10 to 15 mph. Lows sink to the mid-20s to near 30 under partly cloudy skies, as drier air filters in behind the front. Confidence: High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest updates.

Morning temperatures stuck in the mid-20s to near 30 feel more like the teens as winds continue from the north around 10 to 15 mph. Winds should ease a bit during the afternoon, but with highs only reaching the low to mid-30s. It could end up as Washington\u2019s coldest Thanksgiving in nearly 20 years! We\u2019re also looking at very dry air, with dew points tumbling into the single digits. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: With mostly clear skies and diminishing winds, temperatures drop like a rock. We\u2019re talking lows in the mid-teens to low 20s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nBlack Friday starts off frigid as temperatures rise into and through the 20s. The good news is we\u2019ve got mostly sunny skies once again, and this time with light winds. The air mass moderates a bit by afternoon, but we\u2019re still rather chilly, with highs in the upper 30s to near 40. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nThe weekend is a split decision. Rain develops Saturday morning, perhaps briefly mixing with freezing rain or sleet in our colder northern and western suburbs. But unlike last week, there\u2019s no high pressure to our north to lock in the cold air, so this should be mostly rain for our area as highs reach the 40s to near 50. The rain could be moderate to heavy at times during the afternoon into evening, before ending overnight with lows in the low to mid-40s. Higher pressure returns Sunday, providing partly sunny skies with light winds and milder highs in the 50s.

(Virginia Mayo/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May said Wednesday that she has made fresh progress in Brexit talks at a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, as negotiators try to pin down an agreement that EU leaders can rubber-stamp this weekend.\n\nThe U.K. and the European Union agreed last week on a 585-page document sealing the terms of Britain\u2019s departure, but are still working to nail down a separate political declaration on their future relations after Brexit on March 29.\n\n\u201cFurther progress has been made,\u201d May said in a brief statement after her meeting in Brussels with Juncker, but she added that \u201cthere are some further issues that need resolution.\u201d\n\nMay said the two sides have \u201cgiven sufficient direction to our negotiators. I hope to be able to resolve the remaining issues, and that work will start immediately.\u201d\n\nThe meeting with Juncker lasted just over 90 minutes. May said she will return to Brussels on Saturday for more talks, including with the Commission President, \u201cto discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests for all our people.\u201d\n\nAn EU summit is planned for Sunday, but May shed no light on whether it will still go ahead.\n\nAs wrangling continued over issues including Gibraltar and fishing rights, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Wednesday that the text on future relations was \u201cnot there yet.\u201d\n\nHe said diplomats would meet Friday to prepare Sunday\u2019s summit, and \u201cthey will need to see a final text before then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nAt home, May is under intense pressure from pro-Brexit and pro-EU British lawmakers, with large numbers on both sides of the debate opposing the divorce deal. Brexiteers think it will leave the U.K. tied too closely to EU rules, while pro-Europeans say it will erect new barriers between Britain and the bloc \u2014 its neighbor and biggest trading partner.\n\nMay fended off a barrage of criticism from both opposition and government legislators Wednesday during her weekly Commons question-and-answer session dominated by Brexit.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the agreement \u201chalf-baked\u201d \u2014 and said his party could negotiate a better one \u2014 while Conservative Andrew Rosindell urged May to ditch the plan and remove \u201cthe tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation.\u201d\n\nMay replied that \u201cwe want to ensure we continue to have a close trading relationship with the European Union\u201d after Brexit.\n\nShe said the alternative to the agreement was either \u201cmore uncertainty, more division or it could risk no Brexit at all.\u201d\n\nMadrid has raised objections to wording in the agreement about Gibraltar, the tiny territory at the tip of the Iberian Peninsula that was ceded to Britain in 1713 but is still claimed by Spain.\n\nLast year\u2019s EU guidelines on the Brexit negotiations effectively gave Spain veto powers over future relations between the bloc and the British overseas territory, and the Spanish government says it will vote against the Brexit deal if Gibraltar\u2019s future isn\u2019t considered a bilateral issue between Madrid and London.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Tuesday that his government \u201ccannot accept that what will happen to Gibraltar in the future depends on negotiations between the U.K. and the EU.\u201d\n\nBut May reassured British lawmakers that \u201cwe will not exclude Gibraltar from our negotiations on the future relationship.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s EU Affairs State Secretary, Luis Marco Aguiriano, said there was still time to \u201clegally clarify\u201d the agreement before Sunday.\n\nThe deal also needs to be approved by the European and British Parliaments \u2014 a tough task for May, whose Conservatives lack a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nMay won a reprieve from some of her Conservative Party foes after pro-Brexit rebels acknowledged that a bid to trigger a no-confidence vote in May had failed, for now.\n\nBut Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party \u2014 whose 10 lawmakers prop up May\u2019s minority government \u2014 has begun abstaining on votes in the House of Commons as a sign of their displeasure at the deal. The DUP opposes plans for keeping the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland open after Brexit, saying it weakens the ties binding the U.K. by creating separate trade rules for Northern Ireland.\n\nThe prospect of Parliament rejecting the deal when it comes up for a vote \u2014 likely next month \u2014 has increased fears among businesses that Britain could crash out of the bloc without a plan to keep trade running smoothly.\n\nConservative lawmakers loyal to May also warned that defeating the agreement could mean that Brexit never happens, because Parliament would halt Britain\u2019s departure rather than accept a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d exit.\n\n\u201cI think people will take a careful look over the abyss ... and consider whether they think it is in the best interests of the whole country,\u201d Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said.\n\n\u201cThe Brexiteers may lose their Brexit,\u201d she added.\n\n___\n\nCook reported from Brussels.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\u201d said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.\n\nTraffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant\u2019s queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. On a monthly basis, it\u2019s getting 80 million visits while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri says the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.\n\nQwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \u201cdigital sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe site doesn\u2019t use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft\u2019s Bing.\n\nTo be sure, Google\u2019s in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, California, accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.\n\nMojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month and search queries have quintupled over the past year.\n\nAnother British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking.\n\nPat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and says has never felt their services were inferior to Google\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people would go back if they started using these sites,\u201d Walshe said. They\u2019re \u201callowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\u201d which means you\u2019ll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said.\n\nWalshe likes Startpage\u2019s new \u201canonymous view\u201d feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site.\n\nGermany\u2019s Unbubble is a \u201cmeta-search\u201d site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.\n\nOutside Europe, there\u2019s also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.\n\nSome privacy search operators say it\u2019s equally important to help users avoid \u201cfilter bubbles,\u201d in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.\n\n\u201cThe main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\u201d said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \u201cIf you are using Google today, perhaps you\u2019ll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\u201d preventing people from seeing the \u201cgreat diversity\u201d online, he said.\n\nSome sites rely on donations, others from \u201caffiliate advertising\u201d \u2014 links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don\u2019t target or track users. That\u2019s different from Google\u2019s behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.\n\nMojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, believes advertising is \u201ca necessary evil and we\u2019ll look for whatever route we can to avoid it,\u201d said marketing chief Finn Brownbill.\n\nIn Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has thrived, with monthly search queries jumping by nearly half to 20 million from a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe, who also runs software company Hulbee.\n\nEven so, Wiebe said he met plenty of skepticism at the start. \u201cIn 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) \u2018you\u2019re crazy\u2019,\u201d and that the project would be dead within a year.

Spahn appears to be trailing other high-profile candidates in a bid to succeed Merkel as leader of her Christian Democratic Union party next month.\n\nOne of the leading contenders, Friedrich Merz, called Wednesday night for a clarification that the U.N. pact won\u2019t create any new grounds for asylum \u201cthrough the back door.\u201d At an event in eastern Germany with the other candidates, Merz also advocated a wider discussion on how the right to asylum in Germany is defined.\n\nMerkel, who has announced she won\u2019t run for a fifth term in 2021, said the migration pact is an example of the way in which global problems can only be solved through international cooperation.\n\nAmid a rise in nationalist sentiment around the world, Merkel has become one of the most vocal defenders of multilateralism, frequently noting that Germany owes its revival after World War II to institutions such as the European Union and United Nations.\n\nPresenting her government\u2019s 356 billion-euro ($407-billion) budget for 2019, Merkel cited plans to invest more in care for children and the elderly, improve integration of migrants, raise pension levels and boost renewable energy.\n\nAlternative for Germany\u2019s co-leader, Alice Weidel, earlier accused Merkel\u2019s government of spending \u201cwithout thinking about tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWeidel used much of her speech to defend her party over its receipt of foreign donations and accuse rivals of having similarly dubious sources of income.\n\nMerkel didn\u2019t respond to Weidel\u2019s comments about party funding.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sundra Rajoos lawyer tells The Associated Press his client was detained by the Malaysian Anti-Corru\u2026 [+739 chars]", "fulltext": "BERN, Switzerland \u2014 The credibility of FIFA\u2019s reshaped ethics committee took a hit Wednesday after a leading judge was arrested on suspicion of corruption in Malaysia and later removed as deputy chairman.\n\nSundra Rajoo has been taken off cases while under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission for financial wrongdoing in his job leading an arbitration service.\n\n\u201c(Rajoo) will not be involved in any further activities of the adjudicatory chamber (while under investigation),\u201d FIFA said in a statement.\n\nThe decision was imposed \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d by judging panel chairman Vassilios Skouris, FIFA said.\n\nSkouris was picked 18 months ago to replace German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, whose ouster was engineered by FIFA President Gianni Infantino after falling out of favor with the new leadership. FIFA\u2019s lead ethics prosecutor, Cornel Borbely, was also forced from office in May 2017.\n\nOne year ago, Rajoo passed an integrity check to be appointed as one of two deputy chairmen of the judging panel. He was proposed by the Asian Football Confederation, which is based in Kuala Lumpur along with the Asian International Arbitration Centre, led by Rajoo until Wednesday.\n\nAlthough Rajoo is currently hanging on to his FIFA role, he resigned from his position with the arbitration service on Wednesday, his lawyer, Cheow Wee, told The Associated Press.\n\nRajoo\u2019s lawyer said his client had been detained by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission after returning from FIFA business in Zurich the previous evening. A court refused a request for a seven-day remand order against Rajoo, and he was later released unconditionally, Cheow said.\n\n\u201cThe judge agreed with our position that he (Rajoo) has diplomatic immunity and privileges,\u201d Cheow said. \u201cHe cannot be arrested nor detained, and isn\u2019t subjected to our criminal jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe MACC sought Rajoo\u2019s remand to protect and continue its investigation into allegations the ethics judge accepted and used his office for financial favors.\n\nThe MACC could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSince Rajoo joined FIFA, ethics judges have passed several life bans on soccer officials implicated in bribery by a sprawling U.S. Department of Justice investigation.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee has struggled to gain credibility and demonstrate its statutory independence since wholesale changes in personnel in 2017. While Skouris is a former president of the European Court of Justice, FIFA lead prosecutor Maria Claudia Rojas has been criticized in a European lawmaker\u2019s report for lacking experience in leading investigations.\n\nIn the May 2017 changes, Infantino also oversaw the removal of the head of FIFA\u2019s governance panel, who oversaw integrity checks on senior officials.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee also was tainted by corruption prior to Infantino\u2019s perceived purge. In 2016, Uruguayan lawyer Juan Pedro Damiani resigned as an ethics judge after being implicated in the Panama Papers corruption case. He had been a holdover from FIFA judicial bodies during Sepp Blatter\u2019s 18-year presidency.\n\n___\n\nNg reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He will not end his life in an old folks\u2019 home,\u201d he said, at the Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference. \u201cHe has to behave himself.\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas recently stepped back from the brink of their fourth war in a decade thanks to an Egyptian cease-fire.\n\nPalestinian militants fired 460 rockets and mortar shells into Israel last week in 24 hours, in response to a botched Israeli raid that left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli officer dead. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, while a Palestinian laborer working in Israel was killed by a Gaza rocket. It was the heaviest fighting since the 2014 Gaza war.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the time was not right for a wider confrontation in Gaza, but he has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to a cease-fire. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned in protest, accusing Netanyahu of being soft on terrorism, and another hard-line minister threatened to do the same \u2014 which would have sparked early elections \u2014 before backing down.\n\nIn the wake of the political crisis, and with early elections still a distinct possibility, ministers have begun talking tough about the next round of fighting.\n\n\u201cWe are now close to a no-choice war against Hamas in Gaza. We must strike hard to restore deterrence,\u201d Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told the conference. \u201cAny attack on Israeli soil must be met with a tough response ... if Sinwar or (Hamas political chief Ismail) Haniyeh were to fire a bullet or a rocket at a soldier or Israeli citizens they will pay with their heads.\u201d\n\nIsrael assassinated Hamas leaders Ahmad Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi in 2004, and tried to kill another leader, Khaled Mashaal, in 1997. The killing of senior members of the group has had no discernable impact on its operations or ideology.\n\nHamas has staged near-weekly border protests since March in an effort to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Islamic militant group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza\u2019s economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand rejected by militant group, which is pledged to Israel\u2019s destruction.\n\nDemonstrators each week have approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\n\u201cNobody wants war in Gaza now. It will be very damaging for everyone,\u201d said Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. \u201cI hope we can step back from this terrible cycle where every Friday we are wondering if we will go to war or not.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

That, along with the broader overhaul of the justice system, has raised serious concerns over rule of law in the young democracy, with the EU saying the changes erode the independence of the judicial branch of government.\n\nWednesday\u2019s legislative initiative \u2014 which noted that it was introduced to comply with the EU court ruling \u2014 marks one of the first significant steps by Poland to meet EU demands.\n\n\u201cWe know very well that in politics effectiveness matters and that sometimes you have to take one step back to take two steps forward,\u201d said Stanislaw Piotrowicz, a ruling party lawmaker and one of the key architects of the judicial overhaul, in an interview with the wPolityce.pl portal.\n\nZselyke Csaky, an expert on Central Europe with Freedom House, called it a \u201csignificant\u201d step and a sign by the ruling party of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d though she also said on Twitter that \u201cthe full damage to rule of law and legal certainty will be much harder to remedy.\u201d\n\nThe Polish government, in power since 2015, has been forced to climb down before. Earlier this year it softened a Holocaust speech law that made it a crime to attribute co-responsibility in the Holocaust to the Polish nation and which sparked a major diplomatic dispute with Israel. It also dropped draft legislation in 2016 that would have tightened the already restrictive abortion law after massive street protests by women wearing black.\n\nBut it is an almost unheard-of concession to the EU, which the government often says has no right to meddle in its internal affairs.\n\nUnder the amendment passed Wednesday to the new law on the Supreme Court, the judges who were forced to retire early will have the choice of returning to their duties. The law had lowered the retirement age from 70 to 65, and any judge who wished to remain had to request the consent of the president.\n\nThe party introduced the amended legislation to the parliament Wednesday and it was passed quickly by the lower house. It goes next to the Senate and also needs the president\u2019s signature, but since both are aligned with the party, these steps are all but certain to happen.\n\nThe party\u2019s reversal comes after local elections last month that showed Law and Justice winning the most seats in regional assemblies but losing badly in mayoral races in the cities and even mid-size towns. The results suggested the party\u2019s conflicts with the EU \u2014 which is extremely popular among voters \u2014 have cost it votes among urban, middle-class voters.\n\nIt also comes as the party, which has a strong anti-corruption profile, finds itself mired in corruption allegations. Last week the head of the state financial authorities resigned over allegations he had solicited a bribe of millions of dollars from a billionaire who heads two troubled banks.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Dana Pradana/Associated Press)\n\nBANGLI, Indonesia \u2014 A teary and largely silent convicted Australian drug mule returned to her homeland early Thursday hours after she was deported from the Indonesian tourist island of Bali where she had served nearly 14 years in prison for smuggling heroin.\n\nRenae Lawrence was the only woman among nine Australians who were arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms (18.3 pounds) of heroin from Bali to Australia.\n\nLawrence, 41, wearing black sunglasses and a black T-shirt, was escorted Wednesday afternoon through a crush of reporters outside Bangli prison on Bali into a waiting car. She made no comment.\n\nShe faced a throng of media when she and her mother, Beverley Waterman, landed at Australia\u2019s Brisbane Airport where they are expected to take a domestic flight to their hometown of Newcastle. Lawrence faces potential arrest in Newcastle on outstanding warrants that predate her ill-fated journey to Bali.\n\nAsked by reporters in Brisbane if she wanted to comment on her return to Australia, Lawrence looked teary-eyed and declined. Her mother explained: \u201cIt\u2019s very overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAsked later if she had anything to say, Lawrence told reporters in the Bahasa Indonesia language: \u201cThanks to the government of Indonesia. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nLawrence faces potential arrest in Newcastle on warrants including one that alleges the former panel beater was involved in a high-speed police chase in a stolen car a month before her arrest in Bali in April 2005.\n\nNew South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has indicated a deal with Lawrence\u2019s lawyers to hand herself in to police was more likely than her being arrested at Newcastle Airport.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we will make a time reasonable with her legal team to bring her in to have those warrants satisfied,\u201d Fuller told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nMaryoto Sumadi, head of Bali\u2019s justice and human rights office, said Lawrence is banned from ever re-entering Indonesia.\n\nShe may be the only member of the group dubbed the \u201cBali Nine\u201d by Australian media to walk free from prison.\n\nAndrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the ringleaders, were executed by a firing squad in 2015, causing a diplomatic furor between often testy neighbors Indonesia and Australia.\n\nFive others had their sentences increased to life on appeal, and another member, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died from cancer in May.\n\nLawrence, whom Customs caught with 2.2 kilograms (4.8 pounds) of heroin strapped to her body, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 1 billion rupiah ($68,000). She didn\u2019t appeal and almost every year her sentence was reduced during holiday remissions that are customary in Indonesia for inmates with good behavior, except those on death row or sentenced to life.\n\nLawrence\u2019s sentence was completed in May but was extended by six months because she couldn\u2019t afford to pay the fine, Bangli prison chief Made Suwendra said.\n\nAnother convicted Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby, whose trial and imprisonment on Bali mesmerized her country for more than a decade, returned home last year.\n\nCorby was arrested in 2004 at the age of 27 with more than 4 kilograms (9 pounds) of marijuana inside her boogie board bag, sparking a media frenzy in Australia on par with America\u2019s O.J.

Amnesty\u2019s Strike Tracker campaign, in partnership with Airwars, would help narrow down when and where coalition air and artillery strikes destroyed buildings.\n\nAmnesty hopes to compel the U.S-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group to take greater responsibility and conduct its own investigation into the deaths of hundreds of civilians.\n\nThe coalition says it worked to avoid civilian casualties in Raqqa.

In total, the coalition has acknowledged 104 civilian deaths from the hard-fought campaign.\n\n\u201cWith bodies still being recovered from the wreckage and mass graves more than a year later, this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Marin.\n\nSome 2,500 bodies have been pulled from the rubble and uncovered in mass graves, and searches are still underway. Amnesty suspects hundreds of civilians died in the campaign.\n\nAmnesty hopes to publish results of the research early next year.\n\nRaqqa was the capital of the Islamic State group\u2019s self-styled caliphate, which once encompassed a third of Syria and Iraq. In recent years the group has been driven from virtually all the territory it once controlled, and holds just a few small, remote pockets in Syria.\n\n___\n\nOn the net:\n\nhttps://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/strike-tracker\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn the militarized front line dividing the Korean Peninsula, South Korea has been busy bulldozing and blowing up some of its guard posts.\n\nIt is a symbol of what Seoul hopes will be a new era of relations with Pyongyang. But it is also one of the few steps South Korea can take to build confidence with the North without violating U.N. sanctions or going against its U.S. allies and protectors.\n\nIn South Korea, frustration is building that its efforts to improve relations with North Korea have not been matched with a corresponding improvement in ties between Pyongyang and Washington.\n\nIndeed, five months after President Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, there are worrying signs of backsliding.\n\nA meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, was canceled at the last minute earlier this month. And as the United States resumed small-scale military exercises with the South Korean military, North Korean media warned the country could restart its nuclear program unless sanctions were lifted.\n\nPyongyang has expressed frustration that \u2014 in its eyes \u2014 Trump has not come through on a promise to build a \u201cnew era\u201d of relations, while the U.S. administration remains adamant that strict sanctions will remain in place until North Korea surrenders its nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cThese acts by the U.S. apparently came from a medieval-era way of thinking that only threatening, coercive and barbarian tactics could enhance its negotiating leverage,\u201d DPRK Today, a state-sponsored website, said Monday, also complaining about recent military exercises with Japan involving nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and bombers. Those \u201cillogical\u201d tactics won\u2019t work, it said.\n\nIn Seoul, the government is wary of criticizing the United States directly. But behind the scenes, there is a real sense that Washington needs to move the needle forward by building trust with the North.\n\n[Opinion: As expected, North Korea played Trump for a fool]\n\n\u201cAs long as this lack of confidence persists, the United States and North Korea will just be going around in a vicious circle,\u201d said Lee Soo-hyuck, a ruling-party lawmaker who led South Korea\u2019s negotiations with the North a decade and a half ago. \u201cI really hope the United States has some novel idea.\u201d\n\n\n\nSouth Korean soldiers leave a guard post in the demilitarized zone. (South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty Images)\n\nThere is a fundamental disagreement between Washington and Seoul about how we arrived at this point. The Trump administration credits its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign for forcing Pyongyang to the negotiating table. South Korea\u2019s government says it was President Moon Jae-in and Trump\u2019s joint efforts to extend the hand of friendship to Kim.\n\nFrom that disagreement comes discord about how to move the process forward.\n\nVice President Pence told NBC News last week that it is \u201cabsolutely imperative\u201d that when Kim next meets Trump, he hand over a \u201cverifiable\u201d plan to disclose his nuclear and weapons sites, open them for inspection and dismantle them.\n\n\u201cNow we need to see results,\u201d Pence said.\n\nIt is an approach the South Koreans say is premature.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is aware that reporting a list of its nuclear weapons is a very important step toward denuclearization,\u201d South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said during a parliamentary hearing this month. \u201cBut such steps must come after concrete measures are taken to build up trust by both sides.\u201d\n\nChung also quoted Kim as saying that handing over such a list before the two sides trust each other \u201cis the same as telling us to submit a list of targets for attacks.\u201d\n\nThere is understandable wariness in Washington about trusting a regime that has never demonstrated its trustworthiness in the past and has not renounced a January pledge to move from testing to mass production of warheads and missiles.\n\nBut some experts say the United States also is at risk of missing an opportunity to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula and explore just how far Kim is prepared to go in cutting his nuclear arsenal in return for better relations and economic development.\n\nRobert Carlin, a visiting scholar at Stanford University who was involved in U.S.-North Korea talks from 1992 to 2000, said it\u2019s unrealistic to expect North Korea to allow thousands of U.S. investigators to roam its country at will. Washington also needs to be more aware of how its rhetoric plays in the North, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy is it so hard for people to grasp that North Korea is not a conquered country?\u201d he asked. \u201cAmerica also needs to stop rubbing their noses in the fact that we\u2019re going to keep sanctions on until hell freezes over.\u201d\n\nJoseph Yun, former U.S. special representative for North Korea, said Washington was guilty of \u201ca tremendous amount of mixed messaging\u201d between Trump and other members of the administration \u2014 and those under Trump were guilty of being \u201cway too uncompromising.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he said, Pyongyang was not even giving Pompeo and new Special Representative Stephen Biegun the chance to meet face to face with North Korean officials. \u201cWithout getting those meetings, you can\u2019t rely on summits to do all that work.\u201d\n\nRecent articles in North Korean state media suggest doubts may be surfacing in Pyongyang about whether Kim\u2019s more conciliatory approach to Washington is bearing fruit, experts say.\n\n\u201cUltimately the only road to a real agreement is to build trust between the United States and North Korea,\u201d said Lee, the South Korean lawmaker. Lee headed South Korea\u2019s delegation at six-party talks when North Korea submitted a list of its nuclear facilities in 2003. \u201cOnly if this happens will North Korea feel safe to actually tell the truth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has missed small but significant opportunities to signal its interest in a new relationship with Pyongyang, extending at the end of August a travel ban on U.S. citizens and blocking American aid workers from making humanitarian trips to the country.\n\nYun, the former special representative, said the United States should consider opening liaison offices with North Korea but ultimately should talk to Pyongyang about sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cYou can see bits of the sand castle crumbling,\u201d said John Delury, an associate professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a big wave out there.\u201d\n\nMin Joo Kim contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects testing of mystery new \u2018tactical weapon\u2019\n\nNorth Korea threatens to restart nuclear program unless U.S. lifts sanctions\n\nPompeo\u2019s meeting with North Korean counterpart called off at last minute\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "AP PHOTOS: Russians keep alive winter boots tradition", "description": "AP PHOTOS: As freezing temperatures set in, Russians are rediscovering an old winter staple \u2014 felt boots called valenki", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ap-photos-russians-keep-alive-winter-boots-tradition/2018/11/21/519d4df4-ed6a-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T08:49:13Z", "content": "MOSCOW As freezing temperatures are setting in, Russians are rediscovering an old winter staple felt boots called valenki.

She had borrowed nearly $3,000 to pay an agent for a job in the garments industry here, lured not only by the offer of much higher wages but also by the chance to learn new skills in a country known for its advanced technology.\n\nShe ended up simply packing garments into cardboard boxes from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. or midnight, six or even seven days a week. The basic pay, the equivalent of just $530 a month, was half what she had been promised, while her boss didn\u2019t stop shouting at her.\n\n\u201cIt was inhumane,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day I was stressed, I was anxious. I don\u2019t know how to express it in words. I was crying.\u201d\n\nWar Nu had come to Japan under its Technical Intern Training Program or TITP, a long-established program designed to ease the country\u2019s chronic labor shortage while supposedly aiding countries in the region. As its name implies, it is designed to offer workers, mainly Asians, training for three to five years before sending them home. In practice, it often amounts to forced labor, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nFaced with a declining and rapidly aging population, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this month submitted a draft law to parliament that would let in up to 345,000 semiskilled foreign workers in the next five years. The move has sparked an intense debate both in parliament and the media, with the country\u2019s weak and disorganized opposition parties enjoying a rare moment in the spotlight as they blast Abe\u2019s plans as vague and ill-prepared.\n\nIn particular, many critics say Abe first needs to clean up the mess that is the intern training program, before opening the doors to hundreds of thousands of additional foreign workers.\n\n\u201cIn the name of technical training, this program has used foreigners as cheap and disposable labor to fill the labor shortage,\u201d said Shiori Yamao, a leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. \u201cWe should revise this program design for the sake of national dignity.\u201d\n\n[Aging Japan needs new blood. But a plan to allow more foreign workers sparks concerns.]\n\nAs the debate rages, Japanese media has awakened to the problems inherent in the TITP, with headlines and stories in recent weeks about \u201cforced labor,\u201d \u201chellish conditions,\u201d sexual harassment and workers being treated like \u201cslaves.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Federation of Bar Associations last month issued a report calling for the entire trainee system to be abolished. \u201cIn practice, we think it is hardly about giving training,\u201d said lawyer Masashi Ichikawa.\n\nThe main problem, lawyers say, is that workers are not allowed to change employers as a condition of their visa: If they dare complain, they face losing their jobs and being deported.\n\n\u201cIn a normal situation, workers have the chance to switch jobs if their conditions are not satisfactory,\u201d Ichikawa said. But the so-called trainees \u201chave to endure even if they face human rights violations or oppression.\u201d\n\n\n\nWar Nu, 27, came from Myanmar to Gifu, Japan, and says she was forced to work long hours for very low pay under an abusive boss at the King Style garment factory. (Simon Denyer/The Washington Post)\n\nIn its annual report on human trafficking, the State Department says this often amounts to forced labor and that workers pay agents thousands of dollars to land jobs in Japan, only to find themselves trapped in terrible situations.\n\nToday, around 270,000 foreigners, many from Vietnam, China, the Philippines and Indonesia, work in Japan under the TITP program. The number of workers rose 20 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\nSome work in agriculture \u2014 picking strawberries in Ibaraki and lettuce in Nagano, for example \u2014 while others work in manufacturing or construction.\n\nGifu, a city in central Japan, is a center for the textiles industry, which increasingly relies on cheap foreign labor to remain competitive. Working at a company called King Style, War Nu said she was treated more like a slave than a trainee by her boss.\n\n\u201cEvery day the abusive language wouldn\u2019t stop, and I wasn\u2019t even allowed to talk to my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t obey what he said, he would say, \u2018Myanmarese are no good, they are bad,\u2019 and he threatened to send me back to Myanmar. I was very scared, but I endured.\u201d\n\nShe and four other women shared two rooms above the factory, with barely enough time to eat and sleep. \u201cIt was inhumane,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Washington Post interviewed eight other women in Gifu who told similar stories of employers who paid less than they had promised, made them work longer hours than they expected and often gave them no training.\n\nBoth the State Department and Human Rights Watch say workers often borrow large sums of money to land jobs, but end up working long hours at below the minimum wage. Many work in dangerous or unhygienic conditions and some face heavy \u201cfines\u201d if they fail to stay for the duration of their contracts.\n\n\u201cSexual abuse and rules that violate privacy \u2014 for example, prohibitions on owning a cellphone or having romantic relationships \u2014 are also significant problems,\u201d Human Rights Watch said.\n\nSuch is the abuse inherent in the system that many workers abscond: Around 7,000 effectively vanished last year, and 4,300 more fled their jobs in the first six months of this year, many ending up underground as undocumented workers.\n\nRealizing the scheme was giving the country a bad name, Japan revised the trainee law in 2017 to strengthen oversight of companies that may be breaking the rules, and established a new Organization for Technical Intern Training to supervise the scheme.\n\nEven before the law took effect, an investigation by the Labor Ministry in 2017 found that employers were breaking the rules at more than 4,000 locations \u2014 more than 70 percent of those investigated \u2014 through long hours, inadequate safety standards or low pay.\n\nKenichi Tatezaki, an OTIT spokesman, said that in the future companies found breaking the rules could face having their permission to employ foreign workers withdrawn. So far, just one company has had permits withdrawn, but he said other investigations are underway.\n\nNevertheless, activists say little has changed at the ground level.\n\n\u201cJapanese companies don\u2019t get penalized,\u201d said Myint Swe, the president of the Federation of Workers\u2019 Unions of the Burmese Citizen. \u201cThat\u2019s discrimination.\u201d\n\nExperts say the program simply reinforces stereotypes of foreigners as cheap labor rather than members of society and of absconders as criminals rather than victims of forced labor. Such stereotypes are often played up in the media and a controversial television show dramatizing the work of immigration officers called \u201cAt the Moment of Deportation.\u201d\n\nThe program is also fundamentally dishonest, experts say, meant to lure foreigners under false pretenses as a source of cheap labor while offering little in return. As a result, it was developing a bad reputation in other Asian countries.\n\nAs China, Taiwan and South Korea also face aging populations, they too will need more and more foreign workers in the years ahead. Japan\u2019s government knows it has to be more competitive if it wants to attract the best foreign workers, which is why Abe has finally decided to ease restrictions and introduce new visas for \u201csemiskilled\u201d workers.\n\n\u201cUntil now, the government had been hoping this program would provide enough labor, but finally they realized they can\u2019t lie anymore,\u201d said Yoshihito Kawakami, a lawyer who defends exploited workers.\n\nWith the help of Myint Swe and JAM \u2014 the Japanese Association of Metal, Machinery, and Manufacturing Workers, an influential labor union \u2014 War Nu was able to leave her employer and keep her visa, finding work in a different garment factory in Gifu where conditions are much better, and where she and her friends are much happier.\n\nTakeyuki Hara, a lawyer at the Olympia Law Firm representing King Style, said the company acknowledged there had been violations of labor standards in the form of unpaid wages. It had been in talks with the Burmese labor union, he said.\n\nBut Myint Swe said the problems run far deeper than one company.\n\n\u201cThis system is wrong. There are many abuses,\u201d he said. The government could change it but doesn\u2019t \u201cbecause there are people who want to use workers cheaply like slaves and are only thinking about their own benefits.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "German police conduct anti-terror drill at Cologne airport", "description": "German police have conducted a large-scale anti-terror drill at Cologne-Bonn airport, in the west of the country, amid ongoing concerns about the threat posed by Islamic extremists", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/german-police-conduct-anti-terror-drill-at-cologne-airport/2018/11/21/dedd1c3a-ed65-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T08:17:23Z", "content": "BERLIN German police have conducted a large-scale anti-terror drill at Cologne-Bonn airport, in the west of the country, amid ongoing concerns about the threat posed by Islamic extremists.

It failed by one vote in the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), House majority whip, in an interview with Maria Bartiromo, Fox Business News, Nov. 13, 2018\n\n\u201cWe actually got rid of Obamacare, except for one vote.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, remarks during a Cabinet meeting, Aug. 16\n\n\u201cWe had it done, but unfortunately, somebody decided to vote against that at the last moment, even though they campaigned for years saying they were going to do it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, remarks during a Cabinet meeting, Oct. 17\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) may have passed away in August, but his late-night thumbs-down vote that in 2017 blocked passage of a slimmed-down repeal of the Affordable Care Act continues to be an all-purpose excuse for Republicans.\n\nWe\u2019ve documented in our database of President Trump\u2019s false and misleading claims that the president repeatedly claims he was just one vote away from triumphally killing Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement. He\u2019s made the claim at least 30 times.\n\nSimilarly, in a Wall Street Journal opinion article, Rep. Jason Lewis (R-Minn.), who was defeated for reelection, made a similar \u201cone-vote\u201d claim to argue that McCain\u2019s vote cost the Republicans the House.\n\nBut we were especially struck by Scalise\u2019s recent statement that block-granting Medicaid \u2014 part of the repeal bill \u2014 failed by one vote in the Senate. He certainly impressed Bartiromo, who responded, \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nBut this \u201cone-vote\u201d rhetoric is very misleading. Let\u2019s explain what\u2019s going on here.\n\nThe Facts\n\nAs anyone who has taken basic civics knows, the House of Representatives and the Senate must pass the same law before it is presented to the president for his signature. If the two bodies pass different versions of a similar law \u2014 as is often the case \u2014 negotiators must meet to hammer out an agreement, known as a conference report.\n\nThen, both houses must vote on the final deal. There are many occasions when a lawmaker might vote for a bill initially, if only to advance it for further tinkering, but then vote against the final conference report.\n\nIn other words, there are no guarantees.\n\nSo where was Obamacare repeal in this process? Barely out of the starting gate.\n\nThe House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), 217 to 213. An earlier version had failed, but amendments were added that brought along conservatives who had previously balked. The Senate, however, was not happy with the AHCA and crafted its own version of the law, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA).\n\nThere were significant differences between the two versions, though both sought to reduce projected Medicaid spending by instituting a per capita cap on spending. (Scalise called it a block grant in the interview, but that was only an option for states.)\n\nCurrently, states and the federal government share in the cost of Medicaid, but the proposed laws would have capped federal funding per enrollee. There were differences in how each body would have calculated the caps, but the net result is that federal spending on Medicaid would have dropped significantly \u2014 $772 billion over 10 years in the BCRA and $834 billion in the AHCA.\n\nThat was too much for many senators, and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced an amendment that would have restored $100 billion of Medicaid funding. But even after that was added, the BCRA was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 43 to 57, including \u201cno\u201d votes from nine Republicans.\n\nMcCain actually voted for this version of the bill, which needed 60 votes for passage because the Senate parliamentarian determined that certain provisions violated rules that otherwise would have allowed passage with 51 votes (50 votes plus the vice president casting the tiebreaker).\n\nSo that\u2019s not one vote short. It\u2019s 17 votes short.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) offered a plan to repeal Obamacare and then delay implementation for two years while lawmakers worked out the details. That would have only needed 51 votes for passage, but it was rejected, 45 to 55, with seven Republicans (including McCain) voting against it.\n\nFinally, there was a vote on \u201cskinny repeal.\u201d This would have repealed the individual and employer mandates but it would have left much of the rest of the law intact, including Medicaid expansion. In other words, this would not have put any cap on Medicaid spending. This is the bill that McCain, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted against, along with all Democrats, so it only had 49 votes.\n\nEven if it had passed, the differences between the AHCA and the skinny repeal would have been stark and perhaps insurmountable. Given the votes on the floor, Senate negotiators would not have been empowered to accept a major cap on Medicaid spending \u2014 and if the bill included that, it probably would have gone down in defeat in the Senate. (Similarly, a bill without a cap on Medicaid spending might have lost conservative votes in the House.) McCain had said he voted against the skinny repeal because he wanted the legislation to go through a regular committee process, so a jammed-together conference process might not have won him over.\n\n\u201cOne reality about conference committees is that, technical restrictions aside, they can accept or reject almost any provision. So it is at least possible that if the bill had gone to conference, they might\u2019ve been able to add that provision,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI would be dubious that the Senate conferees, knowing the unpopularity of the provision, would have gone along.\u201d\n\nLauren Fine, a spokeswoman for Scalise, insisted that it was possible that the Medicaid provision could have survived if the bill had gone to conference. \u201cThe Medicaid provision was in the House-passed AHCA bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe McCain \u2018no\u2019 vote ended the possibility of going to conference, where that provision would have been part of the negotiations on melding the House and Senate versions.\u201d\n\nWhen we expressed doubt on that outcome, she responded: \u201cYou have no idea how a conference committee would have absolutely turned out, and that Whip Scalise is certainly as informed as anyone else to speculate what would or would not be decided in conference committee.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nEven if McCain had supported the skinny repeal, lawmakers still would have had to negotiate a compromise agreement. Then passage would have been needed in both chambers, which was not assured, given the narrow margin for passage of the House bill.\n\nSo at a minimum, it is misleading to say that the Obamacare repeal was just one vote short, as Trump often does. But in the case of the specific Medicaid provision touted by Scalise, it was 17 votes short even with a $100 billion sweetener. There\u2019s a slim possibility some sort of Medicaid funding reduction would have emerged if there had been a conference agreement, but nothing of the size \u2014 $800 billion \u2014 claimed by Scalise.\n\nBartiromo was certainly fooled by Scalise\u2019s language, which is why it is important for politicians to be precise about what took place.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2018-11-21 13:04:49 UTC Washington Post 2 1 5 Washington Post Rating: Three Pinocchios Washington Post Rating: \u201cReforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of health care, by block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative and coming up with better ways to run health care for lower income people. \u2026 That saved $800 billion.

It was the most momentous day in the country\u2019s post-independence history, the day Zimbabwe shed something else: Robert Mugabe, then 93, who was forced out of office by the military after 37 years as president.\n\nPeople who had once cowered when they saw their own army instead walked alongside the tanks and took selfies. People who had once feared arrest for insulting the autocratic Mugabe openly bid him good riddance.\n\nOne year later, Zimbabwe\u2019s optimism has dimmed. Depending on whom you ask, things are as bad, or perhaps slightly less bad, as before. The current government says reform takes time and asks for patience.\n\nFor now, the dreams are stifled. An already ruined economy has been further ravaged by new inflation. Rapprochement with the West, which shunned Zim\u00adbabwe for decades and held back investment and job growth, has been hesitant at best. And the results of the first post-Mugabe elections are still contested four months later by the main opposition party.\n\nTemba Mlandeli, an engineer in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, exuded optimism in an interview before the election. Now he\u2019s struggling to stay positive.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, it\u2019s not exactly what I expected. As they say, sometimes you have to go through bad times to get to good times, go uphill before you descend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where we\u2019re going, really. Generally, life has gotten tougher.\u201d\n\nThe events of the past year read like a series of continuities from the Mugabe era, with the occasional departure from the norm.\n\n\n\nThen-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, second from left, inspects an honor guard in Zimbabwe in August 2017. (Jekesai Njikizana/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMugabe was deposed in what his successor calls a \u201cmilitary-assisted transition.\u201d It came as the culmination of a succession battle between Mugabe\u2019s wife, Grace, and his former right-hand man and spy chief, Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.\n\nMugabe fired Mnangagwa, who fled the country. Sensing a power play by the deeply unpopular Grace Mugabe, the army emerged onto the streets. Under pressure, Mugabe resigned. Mnangagwa returned and was sworn in as president three days later. The army\u2019s top general became his deputy.\n\nAt his inauguration, Mnangagwa promised to build a Zimbabwe that would not look like Mugabe\u2019s. It would have freedom of expression, a strong currency, billions of dollars in foreign investment, re-engagement with the West and elections in July complete with international observers.\n\n[Zimbabweans voted for change. They got a new crisis instead.]\n\nIronically for a member of Mugabe\u2019s party, who served by his side for decades, Mnangagwa campaigned on a platform of change. The elections would cement his legitimacy, he said, but if he lost them, he would bow to the will of the people.\n\nBetween his 2017 inauguration and the election on July 30, Zimbabwe seemed, from the outside, to be in suspended animation. Minor blips made headlines \u2014 Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition party\u2019s ailing doyen, succumbed to cancer, Mnangagwa survived an assassination attempt \u2014 though they never threatened to throw the vote off schedule.\n\nBut in the rural areas where Mugabe and Mnangagwa\u2019s ZANU-PF party had established a deep system of patronage over nearly four decades, a scene similar to the past\u2019s less-than-fair elections was playing out.\n\nThe lives of opposition candidates and their followers were threatened. ZANU-PF candidates openly paid people to attend their rallies with state-owned goods like fertilizer and corn flour. State-owned media gave exceedingly disproportionate time to ZANU-PF political ads.\n\nOn election day, the mood was still mostly buoyant \u2014 and voting went off without a hitch. But as the vote-counting process dragged on, the opposition became louder about electoral manipulation, unfairness and even alleged rigging.\n\nAnd then on Aug. 1, hopes for a new Zimbabwe were crushed. After an opposition protest in the center of Harare devolved into rioting, the army came out onto the streets for the first time since that day last November. They shot live rounds indiscriminately into the crowds, killing six and wounding dozens. It was a scene of carnage and heartbreak.\n\n\u201cIf we are just going to have citizens facing live ammunition in the streets of Harare, it makes us wonder where we are at,\u201d said Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, a nonprofit human rights monitoring group.\n\nMnangagwa would claim a narrow victory two days later, which the opposition still rejects despite a top court\u2019s seal of approval. An inquiry into the killings was opened, but top army generals have used it to claim that it was not their men who did the shooting but an elaborate ruse by the opposition to tarnish their image.\n\nZimbabwe is now as politically divided as it has ever been. Opposition supporters see any praise of Mnangagwa as an attempt to whitewash his power-grab and subsequent abuses. Mnangagwa\u2019s supporters see the opposition as sore losers unwilling to submit to the democratic process. They point to the fact that the opposition can hold protests and rallies at all as a sign of progress.\n\nMukoko said that while freedom of expression and assembly are greater now than under Mugabe, it hasn\u2019t translated into Zimbabweans feeling free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people brought before the courts under Mugabe-era insult laws \u2014 insulting the office or the person of the president. There have been many arrests for exercising rights that are constitutionally guaranteed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are in a very precarious situation as a country.\u201d\n\nAfter the court struck down a challenge of the election results by opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, he refused to back down, saying, \u201cPresident Mnangagwa is disputed as leader. I have a legitimate claim that I am supposed to be leading the people of Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mnangagwa\u2019s promised surge in investment has proved paltry, and the economy continued to be a source of misery. The political instability stemming from the contested election and its aftermath has led many international investors to conclude that Zimbabwe is still too risky for investment.\n\n\n\nSupporters of Zimbabwe\u2019s main opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, cheer at a rally to commemorate the 19th anniversary of his party, the Movement for Democratic Change, in Harare on Oct. 27.

(Jekesai Njikizana/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA decade ago, during Zim\u00adbabwe\u2019s worst economic crisis, inflation spiraled out of control, leading the government to print hundred-trillion-dollar notes before eventually scrapping the Zimbabwean dollar altogether, opting instead for bond notes pegged to the U.S. dollar. But that bond currency has been undermined by the government\u2019s continued printing of it to pay the salaries of its employees. In October, it took a nose-dive and just like in 2008, untold numbers of people lost all their savings.\n\n\u201cOrdinary Zimbabweans are paying for the excesses of a venal predatory elite not being held to account,\u201d said Piers Pigou of the International Crisis Group.\n\nMlandeli, the engineer, said he wishes the government would swallow its pride, scrap the bond notes and start trading in the U.S. dollar and South African rand.\n\nIn another echo of 2008, 50 died this September in a cholera outbreak that struck Harare over the same week Mnangagwa gave his inaugural address to parliament.

Libyan authorities have forcibly removed dozens of migrants who had barricaded themselves in a container ship in the port city of Misrata for the past 10 days after being picked up at sea. (Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Libyan authorities forcibly removed dozens of migrants who had barricaded themselves in a container ship in the port city of Misrata for the past 10 days after being picked up at sea.\n\nThe migrants had refused to disembark, saying Libya is too dangerous for them. They were attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe earlier this month when they were rescued at sea by a cargo ship, Nivin, that was already bound for Misrata.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said some migrants were taken to hospital late Tuesday while others were taken to a detention center in Misrata.\n\nLibya\u2019s navy spokesman, Ayoub Jassem, said security forces boarded the ship after negotiations with the migrants failed to convince them to disembark voluntarily.\n\n\u201cOnly 14 of at least 94 migrants agreed to leave the ship,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cOnly six migrants were wounded in the operation and they were taken to a nearby hospital.\u201d\n\nLibya was plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, and has since emerged as a major transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and seeking a better life in Europe. Rights groups say migrants face exploitation and abuse in Libya at the hands of smugglers and local militias.\n\nIn recent years, European countries have provided training and funds to Libyan authorities to reduce the hazardous sea crossings, which have claimed thousands of lives. But critics say those efforts leave the migrants trapped in Libya.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst possible conclusion to the desperate plea of the people on board the Nivin to avoid inhuman detention in Libya,\u201d said Judith Sunderland, of HRW.\n\n\u201cThe situation is the result of efforts by Italy and the European Union to obstruct rescue operations by non-governmental organizations and empower the Libyan coast guard even when Europe knows that Libya is not a safe place.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch has urged Libyan authorities to \u201cimmediately allow United Nations and non-governmental personnel to visit the people removed from the cargo ship, find alternatives to their detention, and investigate the possible use of unlawful force.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Libya, Maria Ribeiro, said in a statement Tuesday that the \u201chumanitarian community is saddened by the turn of events.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir reluctance to leave the relative safety of the ship that rescued them from peril at sea is an understandable human reaction. ... It is regrettable that mediation efforts undertaken did not lead to a peaceful resolution,\u201d Ribeiro said.\n\nThe migrants had been in the Misrata port since earlier this month, with the captain and crew of the ship taking refuge on the upper decks.\n\nWith just one rescue ship patrolling the Mediterranean, and European ports refusing to take in rescued migrants, commercial ships have become increasingly leery of rescuing people at sea. Repeatedly in recent months, they have found themselves caught in the middle between governments hostile to new migrants and an obligation under international maritime law to save.\n\nThe United Nations migration agency says more than 850 migrants have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean since the start of 2018, down from some 2,100 deaths during the same period in 2017. The agency estimates that more than 40,000 have reached Europe since January, compared to around 80,000 over the same period in 2017.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(South Korea National Police Agency/pool via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The U.S. won, Russia lost and Interpol narrowly escaped disaster \u2014 that\u2019s the upshot of an unusually high-drama vote for the international police agency\u2019s president, dominated by fears that Russia wants to turn Interpol into a tool to hunt down its enemies.\n\nWhile rights groups and Kremlin critics celebrated the surprise victory of South Korean candidate Kim Jong Yang over his Russian rival, the vote exposed flaws within Interpol that won\u2019t vanish overnight. Now the pressure is on Kim and Interpol\u2019s day-to-day boss, Secretary-General Juergen Stock, to fix them.\n\nThe White House came out publicly against the candidacy of Kim\u2019s Russian rival, Alexander Prokopchuk. After the election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Kim \u201cthe right man to lead one of the world\u2019s most critical law enforcement bodies in its mission to preserve the rule of law and make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nFor Interpol, the vote staved off possible collapse, after rumblings from some member countries about quitting the agency.\n\nThe vote shows that members \u201cthought really hard about whether they want to back away from this institution or make sure it\u2019s run properly and operate fairly,\u201dsaid Jago Russell, chief of Fair Trials International, which has championed and monitored Interpol\u2019s reform efforts.\n\nAuthoritarian governments have long sought to leverage Interpol\u2019s reach \u2014 and notably its system of \u201cred notices\u201d that flag suspects for arrest wherever they go \u2014 for political ends. While it has tried to clean up this system, it remains vulnerable to pressure from powerful member states: Its last president vanished in China in a possible political purge, while Interpol quietly looked on.\n\nStock, the secretary general, acknowledged that \u201csystems can be improved\u201d but stressed that Interpol\u2019s information-sharing systems have led to the arrest of 10,000 serious criminals so far this year. \u201cIt is fundamental to Interpol\u2019s existence that we are neutral and that we are independent,\u201d he insisted.\n\nThat was a central argument for the U.S. and governments in Europe and elsewhere who lobbied against Russian security service veteran Prokopchuk. The Western powers warned that a Russian victory would have led to further abuses of Interpol by the Kremlin, seeking to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents.\n\nRussia accused its critics of overly politicizing the vote and campaigning to discredit Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional. Russian officials were subdued in their response to the vote, and it got only modest attention in the state-dominated media.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s government called Kim\u2019s election a \u201cnational triumph\u201d that could elevate the country\u2019s international standing. Kim secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol\u2019s general assembly in Dubai, though the agency does not release how member states voted.\n\nThe new president is unlikely to make immediate change, though. Kim had already been the acting president, and Interpol\u2019s president has more of an oversight role than a hands-on position. Meanwhile, Prokopchuk will remain an Interpol vice president.\n\nBut watchdog groups say there\u2019s no time to lose.\n\n\u201cInterpol has for too long traded on its James Bond image, the global good guys fighting crime,\u201d said Russell of Fair Trials International. \u201cThat reputation needs to be underpinned with meaningful rules to prevent abuse. ... I hope that this vote further focuses the mind on the need to do that.\u201d\n\nKim will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Meng Hongwei, who was detained in China as part of a wide anti-corruption sweep there.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, the 95-year-old policing body is best known for its \u201cred notices\u201d that identify suspects pursued by other countries, effectively putting them on a global \u201cmost-wanted\u201d list.\n\nCritics say countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists. Interpol\u2019s rules prohibit the use of police notices for political reasons, and the agency has toughened rules to enforce that.\n\nHowever, countries can issue requests \u2014 known as \u201cdiffusions\u201d \u2014 that flag a person wanted for arrest, before Interpol reviews the notice, leading to what critics say is a major loophole in the system.\n\n\u201cWe accept the fact that systems can be improved and recognize that a very small number of noncompliant red notices can seriously affect the lives of innocent citizens,\u201d Stock said.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, says Russia used the diffusion system against him, which led to his brief arrest in Spain earlier this year.\n\nLawyers who have championed Interpol reform also welcomed the vote, as did Amnesty International\u2019s Denis Krivosheev, who said, \u201cIf Russian law enforcement agencies engage in abusive practices, then the country pays with its reputation, and this is a stark reminder of it. To Russia it matters a lot, and this is obviously quite embarrassing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCharlton reported from Paris.

Officials said they were working with anthropologists to recover the body. (Sarah Prince/Associated Press)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The first time American John Allen Chau made it to the remote North Sentinel Island in the Indian Ocean, he came bearing gifts that included a football and fish.\n\nHe interacted with some of the tribesmen \u2014 who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants and are known for attacking anyone who comes near with bows and arrows and spears \u2014 until they became angry and shot an arrow at him.\n\nIt struck a book Chau was carrying, and the 26-year-old adventurer and Christian missionary swam back to a boat of fishermen that was waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his adventures and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to the island the next day, on Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as the tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach.\n\nDependera Pathak, director-general of police on India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said Wednesday that the seven fishermen have been arrested for helping the American reach North Sentinel Island. Visits to the island are heavily restricted by the Indian government, and officials were working with anthropologists to recover the body.\n\n\u201cIt was a case of misdirected adventure,\u201d Pathak said.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak told The Associated Press.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed in a hotel while he prepared to travel to the island. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2015 and 2016. North Sentinel is part of the Andaman Islands and sits at the intersection of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired the seven fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, which also towed the kayak Chau used to reach the island the first time, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said. Police charged the seven fishermen with endangering the life of the American by taking him to a prohibited area.\n\nOne of Chau\u2019s friends said the adventurer spent a month at his home in Cape Town, South Africa, before going to India.\n\nCasey Prince, 39, declined to discuss what Chau told him about his upcoming travel plans, saying he\u2019d rather talk about the kind of man his friend was.\n\n\u201cIf he was taking a risk, he was very aware of it,\u201d Prince said, recalling the time Chau told him about being bitten by a rattlesnake.\n\nThe two first met about six years ago, when Chau was a manager on the soccer team at Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma. Chau and others on the team traveled to South Africa to volunteer at a soccer development and social leadership program Prince founded, Ubuntu Football Academy.\n\nPrince described him as easy to like, kind, joyful and driven by twin passions: a love of the outdoors and fervent Christianity.\n\n\u201cHe was an explorer at heart,\u201d Prince said. \u201cHe loved creation and being out in it, I think having probably found and connected with God that way, and deeply so.\u201d\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with some of his relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHe was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us,\u201d The Chau family wrote in its Instagram post. \u201cTo others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer. He loved God, life, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.\u201d\n\nSurvival International, an organization that works for the rights of tribal people, said the killing of the American should prompt Indian authorities to properly protect the lands of the Sentinelese and other Andaman tribes.\n\n\u201cThe British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survives. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable,\u201d Stephen Corry, the group\u2019s director, said in a statement.\n\nShiv Viswanathan, a social scientist and a professor at Jindal Global Law School, said North Sentinel Island was a protected area and not open to tourists. \u201cThe exact population of the tribe is not known, but it is declining. The government has to protect them,\u201d Viswanathan said.\n\nPoachers are known to fish illegally in the waters around the island, catching turtles and diving for lobsters and sea cucumbers. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Gene Johnson and Phuong Le in Seattle, and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Hadi Mizban/Associated Press)\n\nQAIM, Iraq \u2014 More than a year after the Iraqi town of Qaim was freed from the Islamic State group, booms from airstrikes still echo and columns of smoke rise beyond the berms and concrete walls marking the border with Syria. There, on the other side, the fight is raging to capture one of the militants\u2019 last enclaves.\n\nIraqi troops and Shiite militiamen outside Qaim watch over a giant earth barricade topped with barbed wire that runs along the long, featureless desert border, trying to prevent IS infiltration. Iraqi artillery and U.S.-led coalition warplanes bombard IS positions inside Syria, while Iraqi militiamen along with allied Iranian troops cross the border to back Syrian government forces there.\n\nThe battle on the doorstep means life in Qaim is still on hold, with residents waiting for their town to be rebuilt. There is still no central electricity, and running water works only intermittently. On the outskirts lie the wreckage of houses, their walls blasted open and roofs collapsed from bombardment during the assault a year ago by militias and U.S.-backed Iraqi troops who retook Qaim from IS.\n\nThe dusty, quiet streets are dotted with security checkpoints, manned by the military and the government-sanctioned, Iranian-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, who are viewed with deep suspicion by many in this Sunni Muslim town. Many checkpoints fly both Iraqi national flags and the militias\u2019 banners proclaiming Shiite slogans.\n\nOn the main commercial road, militiamen and Iranian fighters shop in the markets. One fruit seller, Nabil Mashhad, said that since he doesn\u2019t speak Farsi, he shows the Iranians the prices on his cellphone\u2019s calculator.\n\n\u201cThe situation is bad,\u201d Mashhad said. \u201cWhere are the services? The schools? There\u2019s no life. We\u2019re working just trying to get by.\u201d\n\nThe fight next door underscores the tenacity of the Islamic State group, a year after it was driven out of almost all the territory it once held, which at its height encompassed nearly a third of both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe IS enclave across the border is the last area with a significant population that it holds, a 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch of towns on the east bank of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe militants are surrounded. On one side are the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by American warplanes, who have been waging an offensive since mid-September. On the west bank of the river is the Syrian military, backed by Russian airpower along with Iranian troops and Iraqi militiamen.\n\nIS has fought back ferociously. Last month, it attacked under cover of a sandstorm and captured a number of villages from the SDF. During the fighting, the militants drove explosives-packed cars through tunnels to emerge at their opponent\u2019s lines and at one point lured SDF fighters into an ambush by sending a woman to cry for help, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors Syria\u2019s war.\n\nThe extremist group is estimated to have several thousand fighters, including many Iraqis, in the enclave. The Iraqi military believes senior IS leadership are among them, possibly top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. IS holds one other pocket in Syria, but that is a largely uninhabited desert expanse surrounded by government-held territory.\n\n\u201cWe never thought or said this fight would be easy. These are some of ISIS\u2019s most determined fighters, and they\u2019ve had a lot of time to prepare,\u201d the deputy commander of the U.S.-led coalition, British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, told The Associated Press.\n\nRetaking the enclave has also been slowed by the rivalries among the various forces besieging it, said Iraqi Gen. Qassim Mohamed, commander of Iraqi forces in the Qaim area. Each must move carefully to avoid friction with the other.\n\nMeanwhile, IS has turned to insurgent tactics inside Iraq. Last week, it claimed an attack on the home of a tribal leader that killed nine members of the security forces in Anbar, the province that includes Qaim. There has been an uptick in bombings and kidnappings elsewhere in the country, though not all are claimed by IS.\n\nA reminder of the group\u2019s presence came last week when the U.S. military announced that American and Iraqi forces killed more than 50 militants in October in the Makhmour Mountains of north-central Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe security situation is under control,\u201d Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told a televised press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that Daesh is trying to recover its strength,\u201d he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group. \u201cOur forces monitor them, repel them and are in control of all the crossings.\u201d\n\nIn Qaim, the border crossing is sealed by a concrete wall with a metal gate. Militiamen cross into Syria using a gap in the earth berm south of the town.\n\nThe town was once a thriving stopover on the highway between Damascus and Baghdad. Long before a hard border materialized in the latter half of the 20th century, tribes sent their grooms and brides across the frontier to marry, extending the branches of their families on both sides.\n\nWhen IS overran the town in 2014, it linked the group\u2019s holdings in both countries and connected them to key highways leading to multiple parts of Iraq.\n\nMany of Qaim\u2019s 120,000 residents fled IS. A third of them still have not returned.\n\nSecurity forces issue passes to allow residents to move in and out, a measure against infiltrators. But to apply for an ID, residents must be vetted by both the army and the militias, raising uncomfortable questions about who is in control.\n\nAmong Iraq\u2019s Sunnis, the Shiite militias are widely resented, and relations between the two communities have been poisoned ever since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nQaim resident Talal Obeid said he had been hesitant about returning home because of reports of militia abuses.\n\n\u201cWe are more scared of the yellow flags than the black ones,\u201d he said, referring to the yellow banners of the Kataeb Hezbollah militia and the black flags of IS.\n\n\u201cI worry if they stay, there will be friction and provocations.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIssa reported from Baghdad.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\n\n\nBe afraid?\n\nVenezuela is a country in crisis.\n\nThe economy is in shambles. By the end of this year, experts predict inflation there will hit 1 million percent, one of the highest rates in history. Public services and health care are nearly impossible to come by. Blackouts are common, water is scarce, and public transportation has all but stopped running.\n\nCrime has become rampant: Four of the world\u2019s 10 most dangerous cities are in Venezuela. There is so little food that 60 percent of Venezuelans say they\u2019ve lost weight. Diseases once largely eradicated, such as diphtheria and tuberculous, are soaring. Things are so bad that parents are leaving their children at orphanages because they can\u2019t afford to feed them.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Venezuela needs help. Instead, the Trump administration is now threatening to add it to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Just four governments \u2014 Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria \u2014 have received that designation, which is given to states accused of repeatedly providing \u201csupport for acts of international terrorism.\u201d My colleagues John Hudson and Lena H. Sun called it \u201ca dramatic escalation against the socialist government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\u201d the country\u2019s leader.\n\n\n\nVenezuelan migrants at a humanitarian camp in Bogota, Colombia, on Nov. 13. (Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQualifications for the list, which was created in 1979, are vague. Joseph DeThomas, a former State Department official and professor of international affairs at Pennsylvania State University, has called placing countries on it \u201cmore of an art than a science,\u201d saying that \u201cpolitical and diplomatic context plays a considerable role in such designations.\u201d States on the list can face sanctions, bans on arms-related sales, prohibitions on economic assistance and other punishments.\n\nBut it\u2019s a questionable tool, and there\u2019s little evidence that it has helped keep the United States safer. A report by the Brookings Institution from 2008 argued that the whole idea of a list of state sponsors of terrorism is outdated and counterproductive.\n\n\u201cThe very concept of a binary list, with countries either on it or off, is flawed and often does more harm to U.S. interests than good,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cOnce a country is listed it is hard to remove even if it does not support terrorism (as Sudan has found out), and the list provides little incentive for partial or incomplete counterterrorism cooperation (which is all several countries are realistically likely to give).\"\n\nThe authors argued that the list fails to accurately capture which states support and condone terrorism. Pakistan, which has long aided a range of terrorist groups, is not on the list. Fifteen of the 19 terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were from Saudi Arabia, yet that country has never been included. What\u2019s needed, the report said, is an international consensus on what constitutes state-sponsored terrorism \u2014 and clear punishments for those that meet the definition.\n\nAnd even if the list were important and clearly defined, it\u2019s not obvious why Venezuela belongs on it. Republican lawmakers such as Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) have argued that the Maduro government has ties to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia and the FARC, a paramilitary group in Colombia. But experts say that\u2019s largely untrue. \u201cI suspect this will be based on hearsay and sources of questionable integrity,\u201d David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, told my colleagues.\n\nRanking member on Foreign Affairs Committee says he has seen \"no evidence\" that Venezuela meets criteria of State Sponsor of Terrorism List. New statement in response to our @washingtonpost report last night. https://t.co/YlL4B7VvpE \u2014 John Hudson (@John_Hudson) November 20, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s possible that adding Venezuela to the list could further weaken the Maduro government by making it harder for American oil companies to keep doing business with Venezuela. But that\u2019s unlikely to actually help push Maduro out of power. In fact, it could have the opposite effect, allowing him to argue that imperialist America is the real enemy and cause of the country\u2019s woes.\n\nUltimately, adding Venezuela to the list would make it harder for the United States to provide humanitarian aid and global leadership on the issue. And support from the United States is needed if the international community is going to tackle the crisis, which is spreading across South America.\n\nNearly 2 million Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries such as Colombia and Brazil in the last year. Venezuelans are leaving their home country at a rate of 15,000 a day, inundating the health systems and public services of nearby countries.\n\nIn one town in Brazil, hospital workers say they are swamped, and police say 911 calls have risen 1,000 percent. Schools are struggling to absorb the influx of Spanish speakers, and migrants have been forced to live on the streets. Other places report similar pressures. Francisco Santos, Colombia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, has said his country is struggling to absorb the people streaming over its border.\n\n\"This could generate a crisis of unprecedented proportions in Colombia,\u201d he said recently. \u201cAnd not just Colombia. This can be a destabilizing force in all of Latin America.\u201d\n\nIn response, an ad hoc delegation of Latin American countries formed the \u201cLima group.\u201d Its dozen members states pushed for fair and free elections in Venezuela last year. They\u2019ve also worked to broker a peaceful transfer of power away from the Maduro government and even sued the administration in the International Criminal Court.\n\nBut without the backing of the United States, it\u2019s hard to imagine any of these largely symbolic gestures will have a long-term impact. What Venezuelans need now is help, in the form of food and medicine and aid. \u201cSo far, the Trump administration has offered less than $70 million in humanitarian aid, and it has denied nearly half of Venezuelan asylum applicants,\u201d a Bloomberg opinion columnist pointed out. \u201cIf the U.S. government feels compelled to act, it should start here.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

(Andy Wong/Associated Press)\n\nHOTAN UNITY NEW VILLAGE, China \u2014 In this corner of China\u2019s far west, rows of identical white concrete houses with red metal roofs rise abruptly above the sand dunes of the harsh Taklamakan Desert. A Chinese flag flutters above the settlement, and a billboard at the entrance says, \u201cWelcome to the Hotan Unity New Village.\u201d\n\nThis is a Communist Party showcase for its efforts to tame Xinjiang province, the heartland of China\u2019s often restive Uighur Muslim minority and an unforgiving terrain. The free or low-cost houses are assigned alternately to Uighurs and Han Chinese, who work side-by-side in greenhouses and send their children to school together. It is the future the party envisions for Xinjiang after a massive security crackdown that has sent by some estimates more than a million Muslims to internment camps, and many of their children to orphanages.\n\nBut a closer look at what the party calls \u201cethnic unity\u201d reveals what isn\u2019t there: mosques for Muslim worshippers, or traditional Uighur brick homes, often adorned with pointed arches and carved decorations. In their place are colorful murals of what authorities consider to be scenes of unity, such as a Uighur man and his family holding a Chinese flag.\n\nIn the village\u2019s new public square, Uighur children banter with Han Chinese children in fluent Mandarin, the language of the Han majority, rather than in their native tongue. Young Uighur women wear Western clothing without the headscarves that are part of traditional Muslim dress.\n\nWhile these are voluntary settlements with economic benefits, experts and Uighur activists believe they are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ethnic unity\u2019 is a euphemism for taming, breaking the Uighur people,\u201d says Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur identity at Newcastle University in the U.K. \u201cThis is putting flowery bright wallpaper over a damp wall, a rotting wall.\u201d\n\nConstruction of the village began in 2014 with a planned investment of 1.7 billion yuan ($247 million). The goal was to build 5,000 homes and 10,000 greenhouses, according to local reports, to turn a large swath of desert into farmland and create a shared prosperity among Uighurs and Han Chinese.\n\nAround the same time, the Communist Party came forth with a new strategy focused on ethnic mingling. Subsequently, at least one county offered financial incentives for Uighur-Han intermarriages, while others have launched programs encouraging Uighur families to move into Han Chinese residential areas.\n\nChina is building several such mixed settlements in Xinjiang. A similar village is under construction as a tourist attraction near Kuqa, around 600 kilometers (372 miles) from Hotan. A concrete yurt known as the \u201csolidarity farmhouse\u201d already has been completed, and a giant sculpture of a pomegranate is prominently placed at the center of the village to symbolize unity.\n\nIn Hotan, there are signs that the government\u2019s experiment is making inroads. Uighur farmers toil alongside Han Chinese to farm crops in what was once barren desert land, and both groups live in modern houses equipped with gas, electricity and water. A billboard displays a picture of President Xi Jinping and a group of Uighur elders joining hands and, according to the caption, \u201clinking hearts.\u201d\n\nYet there are also signs of enduring mistrust. As elsewhere in Xinjiang, high walls around homes are topped with barbed wire, and police officers stand guard from behind fences at the entrance of the village. Adults don\u2019t mix socially \u2014 at night, a group of Han Chinese dance in the square while the Uighur residents chat among themselves on the sidelines.\n\nA Uighur farmer who moved to the village last September says authorities provided him with free housing and utilities, two greenhouses, a small orchard with grapevines and a barn with sheep, chickens, and pigeons. But the crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang has made it risky for ordinary Muslims to discuss their religious practices, and when speaking to reporters in front of government observers, he insists he was never a Muslim. Another Uighur farmer in his early seventies, Muzitohtahon, says he is no longer a Muslim.\n\nUighur and Han villagers do seem united by at least one factor \u2014 their desire to escape poverty. Rural areas in Xinjiang, including Hotan, rank among the poorest in China, with many families lacking even the most basic utilities and food. The financial incentives are also a key draw for Han Chinese from other impoverished regions of China.\n\nLast May, 58-year-old Xiao Erying, who is Han Chinese, moved to this village from her hometown in the southern province of Hunan, over 4,000 kilometers away. \u201cIt is better than our hometown,\u201d she says, as she rakes sheep, chicken and cow manure inside her greenhouse.\n\nFor 60,000 yuan ($8,700), her family bought a two-bedroom home with a small orchard and two greenhouses. The two grandchildren she lives with are given free tuition, school lunches, and even a free set of clothes. Xiao admits she doesn\u2019t speak Uighur and cannot communicate with her Uighur neighbors, but she says the layout encourages interaction.\n\nIn a greenhouse a few dozen meters away, Uighur Abudu Mijiti has just begun planting chili with his wife. He moved to the village three years ago to make a more stable living. Two of his three children go to the local school and are fluent in Chinese, he says, as a government minder looks on.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s good, it helps learning our national language,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because our next-door neighbor is Chinese, as we go in and out, it helps improve ethnic unity.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the picture presented at the Hotan Unity New Village reflects the government\u2019s vision of an \u201cidealized place,\u201d says David O\u2019Brien, an expert at the University of Nottingham.\n\n\u201cEvery single part of it is the official narrative,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cThe narrative is, water will flow to the desert. The narrative is, if you come here great opportunity awaits you. The narrative that people will be secular, they will learn Mandarin.\u201d\n\nYet the settlement remains only partly inhabited. The city says there are 534 households in the compound, but most of the houses are empty. A drive through reveals rows of empty greenhouses and house after house with a sign that says \u201csealed off\u201d patched onto padlocked or chained gates.\n\nUnder the sweltering desert sun, one Han Chinese farmer tending to her plot of Chinese chives complains that water is scarce and her previous batch of chives had to be thrown out. Even when the crops work out, the chives sell for less than one yuan (14 cents) per kilogram.\n\n\u201cNot even enough for food,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cYou cannot feed yourself just working on greenhouses.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of government minders, the woman goes on.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people are not able to eat meat. The officials can, but not the ordinary people,\u201d says the woman, who declines to give her name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nAs dusk approaches and temperatures fall, residents slowly make their way out onto the streets to enjoy the evening breeze. On the Uighur side of the street, a young Uighur woman rests on an electric bike after a day\u2019s work, looking at her cell phone.\n\nAsked what she thinks of unity, she looks up.\n\n\u201cUnity?\u201d she asks. Silently and slowly, she shakes her head, and returns to her phone.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The motive for the abduction isn\u2019t clear and the identity of the attackers is not yet known, he said.\n\nRomano had been working for the Italian-based humanitarian group Africa Milele, according to Boinnet and Italy\u2019s foreign ministry.\n\nThe gunmen came looking for a white woman, according to Ronald Kazungu Ngala, 19, who said he witnessed Romano\u2019s violent kidnapping. Ngala\u2019s high school education is being sponsored by Africa Milele and he had gone to the NGO\u2019s offices to present his grade 10 end of year report card to Romano, he said.\n\nHe heard gunfire which prompted all the shops in the area to close and many people in the trading center to hide.\n\nAt around 7.30 p.m. six men, some armed with guns and others with machetes and clubs stormed into the Milele offices and demanded to know where is the \u201cmgeni\u201d (Swahili for visitor).\n\n\u201cI told them she had left to go and get a power bank, but they didn\u2019t believe me and surged into the room where they found her,\u201d he said.\n\nNgala said he followed them and heard one gunman ask the other if she is the one and when he was answered in the affirmative, he proceeded to \u201cslap her very hard until she fell.\u201d\n\n\u201cRonald please, please! Ronald, please help,\u201d Romano said, according to Ngala. \u201cI tried to push away a man who was smothering her while holding her down for her hands to be tied behind her back, but someone hit me in the head with a club and I got dizzy. She told me to help myself and I ran for the man at the door with a club and pushed him away and escaped.\u201d He said two of the gunmen who were outside the room shot at onlookers.\n\nNgala said the gunmen took Romano across the Galana River. He said the gunmen looked and spoke like members of a local herding community known as Orma. Many herding communities in Kenya that live near the border areas are armed to protect themselves against rivals, who may come across the border to steal their livestock.\n\nIn one of her latest postings on Twitter, Romano said she was grateful to the kids she was working with for showing her how to live without material things.\n\n\u201cThese children, these people have taught me to live with no material things but with love, Joy, gratitude, smiles, sincere eyes ... and be happy in such simple way. Thank you Kenya, thank you Chakama. This has been the deepest experience of my Life,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Milan, where Romano lived, friends and her former employer said she had found fulfillment in Kenya and had even delayed a planned return to Italy.\n\n\u201cShe told me about the beautiful people that she met, people who although they had nothing were always joyful, ready to smile at you,\u201d said Silvia Cirstaldi, a friend who worked at the Zero Gravity gym where Romano taught gymnastics. \u201cThis is what I think pushed her to go back.\u201d\n\nGym manager Francesco Pisani said he had heard from Romano in September, when she called to say she wouldn\u2019t be coming back as planned. He played for The Associated Press a WhatsApp audio file Romano sent him, where she said she has been offered a position through November or December.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with what I have studied and anyway in these two months I found it very fascinating and I have felt really satisfied and happy inside,\u201d Romano said. \u201cI feel as though it is the right decision for my future and it will enrich me a lot as it has in the past two months like never before in my life and well, big hugs and let me know.\u201d\n\nSomali-based Islamic extremists have been blamed in the past for a spate of kidnappings of foreigners along Kenya\u2019s coast. Kenya said it was prompted to send troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight al-Shabab militants after the kidnappings of four foreigners.\n\nOne of the foreigners, a cancer-stricken quadriplegic Frenchwoman kidnapped off a Kenyan resort island, died in captivity in Somalia.\n\nConfronted by a slump in tourism following the kidnappings, Kenya deployed troops to Somalia later in October, 2011, to fight the militants. Al-Shabab has since carried out numerous attacks in Kenya, saying it is vengeance for the country\u2019s troop presence in Somalia.\n\n___\n\nAP photographer Antonio Calanni contributed from Milan and AP writer Nicole Winfield contributed from Rome.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show how the kidnap victim\u2019s name is spelled by the Italian foreign ministry.

Members, including business moguls and socialites, often raise pet projects, make policy suggestions and share oddball ideas \u2014 everything from trying to sell the president on the benefits of nuclear-powered cars to pitching their own formulas for Mideast peace.\n\nTrump sometimes directs his staff to follow up on their suggestions.\n\nFormer administration officials described the lengths to which aides have gone to try to run interference: scanning daily guest lists, reserving the dinner table next to Trump\u2019s to keep as close an eye on him as possible and keeping tabs on the people who approach him to make sure none raises alarms.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency has forced the club to adopt new security measures, among other changes. He\u2019s hosted Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the club for diplomatic summits, plotted a response to a North Korean missile launch from the club\u2019s candlelit outdoor dining terrace and delivered a statement to the nation from one of its ballrooms.\n\nMembers now clamor for dinner reservations on nights they know Trump will be in town. Membership fees are up. And some groups that used to hold events at the club now steer clear to avoid controversy over patronizing the president\u2019s playground. But much has also stayed the same, with Trump returning to his old, pre-presidential role of glad-handing host and \u201cmayor of Mar-a-Lago,\u201d schmoozing with members and their guests as he\u2019d done for years before his 2016 election.\n\nTrump is expected to have a limited public schedule over his Thanksgiving break. Last year, his only public events took place on Thanksgiving Day, when he held a video conference call with service members from one of the club\u2019s ornately decorated rooms and visited a nearby Coast Guard station to hand out lunches.\n\nThat was before a Thanksgiving dinner that felt more like a homecoming, as Trump joined more than 500 of the club\u2019s members and guests in a gilded ballroom for a meal that included traditional turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes, as well as local favorites like Florida stone crab.\n\n\u201cIt was very thrilling because when the president and first lady entered, without anybody saying anything, the whole room rose and everyone started applauding,\u201d Toni Holt Kramer, a Mar-a-Lago member who founded a boosters\u2019 group called Trumpettes U.S.A., recounted last year. \u201cThe unity was overwhelming.\u201d\n\nDuring last year\u2019s Thanksgiving stay, Trump visited both of his nearby golf properties, playing with champions including Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and the Nicklauses.\n\n___\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Kin Cheung/Associated Press)\n\nHONG KONG \u2014 A U.S. aircraft carrier docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday, days after a pair of American B-52 bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea.\n\nThe arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group in the Asian financial hub is being seen as a friendly gesture ahead of a planned meeting later this month between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. That will mark the first time they\u2019ve sat down together since the start of a bitter trade war and amid tensions over the South China Sea.\n\nChina has demanded the U.S. cease military activity of all kind near its South China Sea island claims that it has been rapidly fortifying. The U.S. says it takes no stance on sovereignty claims, but will continue to sail and operate wherever international law permits.\n\nIn late September, a Chinese destroyer came close to the USS Decatur in the South China Sea in what the U.S. Navy called an \u201cunsafe and unprofessional maneuver.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment Wednesday on the incident, Rear Adm. Karl O. Thomas, commander of Carrier Strike Group 5, said the \u201cvast majority of our interactions out there at sea are very professional.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a rare, unusual occurrence,\u201d Thomas told reporters at a ship-board news conference. \u201cIn that particular case, the ship made some aggressive, continuing aggressive maneuvers and our ship warned them and had to maneuver to prevent a collision. It was unfortunate and I\u2019d like to see that not happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Navy said in a statement that during the Reagan\u2019s visit, interactions will take place with Hong Kong citizens through sports, community relations projects and tours of the carrier. More than 4,400 men and women are usually aboard the ship.\n\nThe Reagan\u2019s visit comes two months after China rejected a similar request by another U.S. Navy ship amid a spike in tensions between the countries\u2019 militaries.\n\nAnd while the port call is seen as a positive for bilateral relations, other events this week point to the ongoing rivalry between the sides.\n\nU.S. Pacific Air Forces said two B-52 bombers flew over the South China Sea on Monday, calling it a \u201croutine training mission.\u201d\n\nThe B-52H Stratofortress bombers departed Andersen Air Force Base in Guam as part of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command\u2019s Continuous Bomber Presence operations that began in 2004, Pacific Air Forces said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis recent mission is consistent with international law and United States\u2019 long-standing commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAlso this week, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, reported that China had installed a new platform on Bombay Reef, a remote undeveloped feature in the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Vietnam and Taiwan also claim the reef.\n\nThe platform appears to be topped with a radome and solar panels, and its strategic location makes it likely it is intended to extend China\u2019s radar or signals intelligence collection in the area, the report said. Bombay Reef already has a lighthouse to serve as an aid to navigation.\n\nUnlike China\u2019s large man-made islands created by piling sand on top of coral reefs, installing the modestly sized Bombay Reef platform did not require inflicting major environmental damage, CSIS said. However, that illustrates how easily China could expand its footprint to other features such as Scarborough Shoal, which it seized from the Philippines in 2012, it added.\n\nCompared to dredging and reclamation, the installation of a modest platform would be \u201charder to prevent at the time and more difficult to rally international condemnation against after the fact,\u201d the report said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Wednesday at a daily news briefing in Beijing that he had no information about the details of the report, while reasserting China\u2019s claims to the island group it calls Xisha.\n\n\u201cThe Paracel Islands are China\u2019s territory. This is indisputable. China\u2019s construction on its own territory is beyond reproach,\u201d Geng said.\n\n___\n\nBodeen reported from Beijing.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Directed with finesse and sensitivity by Ryan Coogler \u2014 who famously went on to make the blockbuster \u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 the 2015 drama had it all: a classically contoured boxing story, a strong emotional core, rich, deeply felt atmosphere and a strikingly good cast led by Michael B. Jordan.\n\n\u201cCreed II\u201d is a respectable if not revelatory sequel to the sequel, even if it lacks its predecessor\u2019s grace and narrative texture. This installment finds Jordan\u2019s Adonis Creed the reigning heavyweight champion of the world, and getting ready to propose to Bianca (Tessa Thompson), the beautiful neo-soul singer with whom he lives in Philadelphia. Still haunted by the absence of his father Apollo \u2014 who met his death at the merciless hands of Ivan (\u201cI will break you\u201d) Drago in \u201cRocky IV\u201d \u2014 Adonis barely has time to recover from his championship bout when he\u2019s challenged by Ivan\u2019s son Viktor (Florian Munteanu), a grudge match that possesses all the mythical overtones suggested by the Creed family names.\n\n\u201cIt all feels so Shakespearean,\u201d a fight announcer says at one point, and indeed, \u201cCreed II,\u201d which was directed by Steven Caple Jr. from a script by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor, leans heavily into the larger-than-life dimensions of Adonis\u2019s struggle, even as it pays close attention to the subtleties at play in his domestic life. Taking the protagonists from Philly to Los Angeles and finally to Moscow, \u201cCreed II\u201d juxtaposes pummeling action sequences with tender scenes between Adonis and the whisper-voiced Bianca, as well with as his quietly perceptive mother, played in a lovely, understated performance by Phylicia Rashad. His trainer, Rocky Balboa, played by Stallone in a sad-eyed, punch-drunk turn that\u2019s somehow modest and self-serving at the same time, still visits his late wife\u2019s grave, in between delivering slurred sermons to his protege about guts, heart and what\u2019s really worth fighting for.\n\n\n\nTessa Thompson co-stars in Creed II.\u201d (Barry Wetcher/Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures/Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nBecause Rocky still blames himself for Apollo\u2019s death, and because Viktor has become a stone-cold killer under the tutelage of his own father Ivan (Dolph Lundgren with scowl still intact), \u201cCreed II\u201d is suffused with grim father-son drama, as well as regrets, recriminations, fierce fighting words and somber determination to vindicate past wrongs, both real and perceived. The movie sags under the weight of it all, with Stallone\u2019s mopey speeches taking on lugubrious repetitiveness, and the plot machinations setting up Adonis as an underdog becoming increasingly painful to watch.\n\nBut \u201cCreed II\u201d picks up considerably in the third act, its bluntly efficient training and fight sequences combining with a slew of callbacks, hat tips and surprise comebacks to create a rousing and thoroughly enjoyable finale. (In an echo of \u201cRocky IV,\u201d Adonis trains for the big Russian fight the old-fashioned way, with sledge hammers and tractor tires, while Viktor looks like he\u2019s working out in a Hozier video.) Connoisseurs might miss the deft camera work of \u201cCreed\u201d cinematographer Maryse Alberti, as well as Coogler\u2019s careful calibration of feeling and tone. But Caple thankfully preserves that movie\u2019s most important element, which is a marvelous cast: Jordan, Thompson, Rashad and Stallone still express the calm, assured chemistry that characterized their first outing together. Jordan is especially impressive as a character whose toughest fight is the embrace of maturity, with all the commitments and responsibilities that entails. In this world, it\u2019s the boxer\u2019s interior life, rather than brute strength, that proves the measure of the man. \u201cCreed II\u201d may not take the franchise into thrilling new territory, but it has ensured that it lives on, bloodied but unbowed."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Carolyn Hax", "title": "Carolyn Hax: He\u2019s an early bloomer, but remember that cut flowers eventually wilt", "description": "Let him grow at his own rate and in his own direction.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-hes-an-early-bloomer-but-remember-cut-flowers-eventually-wilt/2018/11/20/e7d636c6-e9f7-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6VMbUteNX9PxP3wmdO31K0sB_-U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O5XGDNHENQI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:59:00Z", "content": "Dear Carolyn: My son is almost 9 and loves to chat, with his friends mostly.

Within this reality there are smaller realities, such as, a kid can excel at some things and lag in others; a kid can roar out of the gate at something (or everything) and prove over a lifetime to be the bearer of special gifts; a kid can be an early standout at speaking, reading, music, sports, whatever \u2014 and by 11 or 16 or umpty-three be overtaken by mid- to late-bloomers and absorbed as one of the crowd. A kid can grow up great at/immersed in/preoccupied for an entire childhood by X and drop it one day for Y. Abruptly and for good.\n\nIt is good to feed kids\u2019 interests and talents. Of course you hand instruments to budding musicians.\n\nBut there is a fine line between feeding their interests and co-opting their talents in service of your own pride.\n\nThe way not to cross it is to banish \u201cfuture\u201d for now. You sign him up for X because he loves it, not because visions of X scholarships dance in your head.\n\nThe reason for this is within the sub-realities of development. It\u2019s painful to watch a front-runner child who has been encouraged to \u201ctrain for the future\u201d \u2014 whose one spark or another has been attentively fanned and coached and tutored, and whose identity is built on that talent \u2014 wrestle with the universe-altering reality of watching the rest of the pack catch up.\n\nThe other extreme is painful, too, where the child remains a standout but feels trapped and isolated by a life of narrow pursuit.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the poor kids tagged as \u201cthe ____ one.\u201d\n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t what you meant by \u201cturn his speaking power into an asset for him in future.\u201d But it tripped me up hard because your child\u2019s precocity has no bearing whatsoever on the answer to his classroom disruptions. Which is:\n\n1. Set clear limits.\n\n2. Enforce them kindly and firmly.\n\n3. Encourage him to roam freely within those limits, and roam joyfully with him.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Unless it comes to:\n\n4. Develop Plan B if your child\u2019s needs aren\u2019t being met \u2014 anything from developmental screening (for the \u201cdoes not calm down\u201d thing) to a school with more generous recess.\n\nSo the only answer to the \u201chow and where should I train him\u201d question is to encourage him every day, at each opportunity, with an eye to balance and a healthy tolerance for trial and error, to be true to himself and respectful of others.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., during their televised Mississippi U.S. Senate debate in Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)\n\nMississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, her campaign rocked off-kilter by her comment that she would sit with a supporter at a public hanging, offered a limited apology during a debate Tuesday night as she defiantly blamed her Democratic opponent for the controversy generated by her words.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s remark, which she said was an exaggerated gesture of friendship, has generated a fierce backlash even among some Republican backers. To them and her opponents, she conjured an image that Mississippi wants to leave behind \u2014 of lynchings of African Americans. That historic reference is even more pointed because her opponent, former congressman Mike Espy, is seeking to become the first black senator since just after the Civil War.\n\n\u201cYou know, for anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements,\u201d the GOP senator said. \u201cI have worked with all Mississippians. It didn\u2019t matter their skin color type, their age or their income. That\u2019s my record.\u201d\n\nBut targeting Espy, she added that \u201cthis comment was twisted, was turned into a weapon to be used against me, a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gain by my opponent. That\u2019s the type of politics that Mississippians are sick and tired of.\u201d\n\nEspy responded by tossing the charge back at Hyde-Smith and noting that some prominent supporters had distanced themselves from her.\n\n\u201cWell, no one twisted your comments because your comments were live \u2014 you know, they came out of your mouth,\u201d Espy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nHe said she caused damage throughout a state that has a dark history of racism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given our state another black eye that we don\u2019t need,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just rejuvenated old stereotypes, you know, that we don\u2019t need anymore. And we have companies like Walmart that wrote you today and told you that your comments did not reflect the values of their company.\u201d\n\nThe debate, held one week before the runoff between Hyde-Smith and Espy, represented her most extensive response since a videotape of her remarks emerged last week and turned racial animosity into the dominant issue in the final election of the deeply divisive midterms. While a runoff in Mississippi would not normally be competitive, her comments triggered both parties to pour resources into the state. This week, several larger corporations \u2014 including Walmart \u2014 asked her campaign to return their contributions.\n\nGov. Phil Bryant (R) last spring appointed Hyde-Smith to replace veteran Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired because of illness. That prompted a special election Nov. 6 and the runoff after no candidate won over 50 percent of the vote. The winner will fill the final two years of Cochran\u2019s term and will have to run for a full term in 2020.\n\nIf Hyde-Smith wins Tuesday, Republicans would expand their majority in the Senate to 53-47. Democrats, fresh from their takeover of the House, are hoping to limit the GOP\u2019s Senate advantage to four seats with a win in the Deep South powered by strong turnout among the state\u2019s African American voters and others put off by Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to return to the state for two rallies on Monday, just hours before voters head to the polls. Hyde-Smith mentioned Trump\u2019s campaign appearances during her opening and closing statements, directing viewers to go to the president\u2019s campaign website to register for their free tickets.\n\nThroughout the debate the senator repeatedly invoked the president, saying that she would support his policies while Espy would not, and tried to return to positions that have been the backbone of numerous campaigns in conservative states, such as preserving gun rights and restricting abortion rights.\n\n\u201cMy opponent is too liberal for Mississippi,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cYou know I will stand up and protect our conservative values.\u201d\n\nShe also brought up immigration throughout the hour-long debate.\n\n\u201cI think we should definitely build that wall,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cWe have to secure the borders . . . I have been in the Rio Grande River with a bulletproof vest and machine guns all around.\u201d\n\nAs Hyde-Smith sought to appeal both to Trump voters and traditional Republicans concerned by her remarks, Espy hit on themes familiar to Democratic campaigns this year.\n\nEspy brought up health care several times, pointing out that Hyde-Smith has voted against preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act that would protect preexisting conditions.\n\nBoth candidates seemed unpolished and struggled at times to get their points across. Espy several times couldn\u2019t complete his thoughts because he ran out of time.\n\nHe also struggled to respond to criticism of his acceptance of $750,000 from a lobbying contract with former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo. He said that he rescinded the contract when he discovered that the despot was \u201ca bad guy.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith often looked down at her notes, and claimed that Espy was in Congress \u201cnearly a century ago\u201d when she apparently meant 25 years ago. She also referred to a bill that she co-sponsored with Thom Tillis, the senator from North Carolina, but she called him Tom Thompson and said he was from South Carolina.\n\nThe debate on Tuesday night is the first and only one between the two candidates, and both campaigns are focused on trying to turn out their supporters for an election awkwardly placed after the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nAlthough polls have tightened in recent days, Espy remains the underdog, his odds dependent on a widespread repudiation of Hyde-Smith by a substantial chunk of the state\u2019s dominant Republican voters. To that end, in his closing statement, Espy again returned to Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment about public hangings.\n\n\u201cWe have a senator here talking about public hangings and voter suppression,\u201d Espy said in his closing statement. \u201cI am not going back to yesteryear. . .We are moving forward.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/des.bieler", "title": "UFC fighter reportedly files for restraining order after alleged domestic assault - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post UFC fighter reportedly files for restraining order after alleged domestic assault Washington Post A UFC fighter filed for and was granted a temporary restraining order against her husband, per reports Tuesday, whom she accused of domestic abus\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/21/ufc-fighter-reportedly-files-restraining-order-after-alleged-domestic-assault/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0y4b6_oPzIbkpKFpb8PpKvsK3ss=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQ5U2IW74EI6RC5MX7QB7TODUY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:09:47Z", "content": "A UFC fighter filed for and was granted a temporary restraining order against her husband, per reports Tuesday, whom she accused of domestic abuse.

She accused Berdon of having previously attacked her in May, leaving bruises on her leg in that incident.\n\nA source close to Berdon, per TMZ Sports, said that he intends to claim he was attacked first and was defending himself. According to MMA Fighting, Honolulu police said that the alleged assault, for which Ostovish was reportedly hospitalized Sunday and released the next day, was preceded by an argument.\n\nHaving begun her professional career in 2014 and moved from Invicta to two appearances on the UFC\u2019s competition-reality show, \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d Ostovich (4-4) was set to face Paige VanZant (7-4) in January at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center. Their matchup would have taken place on the UFC\u2019s first card with its new rights deal with ESPN.\n\nThe UFC is seeking a replacement for Ostovich to fight VanZant on the card, per MMA Fighting. Her management company, Sucker Punch Entertainment, released a statement early Tuesday morning in which it said that a \u201cvery unfortunate incident occurred Sunday night\u201d with Ostovich.\n\n\u201cRachael is now home from the hospital with her family and will be going back for further check ups on her orbital,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe family would like to ask for some privacy as they sort through this matter. We would like to thank the UFC for all their support on this matter as well as the fans and media for your concern.\u201d\n\nThe restraining order is set to expire on May 18, 2019.

Ghosn, who became one of the auto industry\u2019s most powerful executives by engineering a turnaround at the Japanese manufacturer, was arrested Monday and will be fired for allegedly underreporting his income and misusing company funds, the automaker said. (Kin Cheung/Associated Press)\n\nTOKYO \u2014 The arrest of Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn could extinguish any remaining hopes for a merger with key shareholder Renault, which the Japanese company\u2019s CEO has publicly opposed.\n\nGhosn had this year said he was open to the idea of a merger between Nissan and Renault, where he is chief executive and which he has tied into a cost-saving alliance.\n\nBut Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has opposed such a move, which would see a Japanese corporate icon come under foreign control. And with the company\u2019s board gathering Thursday to decide on ousting Ghosn for alleged financial misconduct, it appears the possibility of a merger may be shelved for good.\n\n\u201cIt has been interesting to see Nissan\u2019s current CEO Saikawa vocally oppose the idea of a merger,\u201d said Max Warburton in an analysis of the scandal. \u201cNow we have Ghosn being defenestrated... It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan.\u201d\n\nRenault owns 43 percent of Nissan after it helped save the company two decades ago and turned it around under Ghosn\u2019s leadership. Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\nAnalysts say the companies are likely to continue their alliance. Besides the financial ties through the share ownership, they share technology, like the basic parts on which vehicles are built, as well as parts purchases. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back on it that easily,\u201d said Masahiro Akita, auto analyst with Credit Suisse.\n\nBut the scandal is likely to end speculation of a merger, experts say.\n\nThat was clear in the share price of Renault, which Warburton says would have benefited from a Nissan merger. It tanked over 8 percent on Monday when news broke of Ghosn\u2019s arrest and has not fully recovered.\n\nGhosn will be detained for another 10 days as he is questioned over allegedly falsifying income reports by millions of dollars and misusing company assets for personal gain, Kyodo News service reported Wednesday. It cited the Tokyo District Court, which must grant approval for such detentions.\n\nThe court and prosecutors declined to comment.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither Ghosn nor Greg Kelly, another senior Nissan executive who was arrested, has been charged so far.\n\nGhosn is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe maximum penalty, upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nDetainees undergoing interrogation in the Tokyo area are generally held in a center that is separate from the prison for those who have been convicted and sentenced. It is supposed to be nicer than a prison but it is austere with limited access to outside visitors.\n\nProsecutors have not confirmed where Ghosn is being held.\n\nWesterners are sometimes given better treatment than Japanese in custody, to account for cultural differences, and so it is unclear what kind of conditions Ghosn might be in.\n\nIn 2015, Julie Hamp, a Toyota Motor Corp. public relations executive, an American, was arrested on suspicion of importing oxycodone, a narcotic pain killer, into Japan. The drug is tightly controlled in Japan. Police said the drugs were in a parcel Hamp mailed to herself.\n\nShe was released from custody after about three weeks of interrogation without charges and she quickly left Japan.\n\nIt is unclear that precedence has any relevance to Ghosn\u2019s situation because the allegations involve so much money, span a significant period of time, and involve the assets of a major company.\n\nMeanwhile, Renault has decided to retain Ghosn as CEO and that the chief operating officer, Thierry Bollore, would fill in on a temporary basis.\n\nRenault\u2019s board also requested that Nissan share details of its internal investigation into Ghosn, which the company says was sparked by a whistleblower.\n\nFrom the start, Nissan has sought to distance itself from the arrests.\n\nSaikawa denounced Ghosn and Kelly as \u201cthe masterminds,\u201d and made clear he thought they should be removed at Nissan\u2019s board meeting Thursday.\n\nGhosn, 64, is credited with turning around Nissan from near-bankruptcy after he was sent to Nissan by Renault in 1999. He served as Nissan\u2019s chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously.\n\nIn 2016, he became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance. Ghosn spearheaded Nissan\u2019s lead in the industry in electric cars, with the Nissan Leaf the best-selling electric car.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan in the U.S. in 1988, and became a board member from 2012. His background over the years has been in human resources and alliance management. He has a law degree from Loyola University School of Law and a bachelor\u2019s degree in public administration from Augustana College.\n\nWhen Saikawa was asked how such actions could have gone undetected for five years, perhaps longer, he blamed a murky system of checks and balances at Nissan and emphasized that he believed Ghosn had too much power.\n\nDespite the arrests, analysts said the impact on Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s auto sales would likely be minimal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it impacts car sales very much,\u201d said Christopher Richter, auto analyst for CLSA Securities Japan Co. \u201cConsumers are discerning enough.\u201d\n\nRichter noted sales dips after previous Nissan scandals were temporary. The deviations the automaker acknowledged in those scandals were more directly related to product quality, such as mileage, emissions and plant inspections.\n\nNissan shares tanked 5.5 percent Tuesday after the scandal surfaced and edged up 0.4 percent on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Lee Jin-man/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea said Wednesday it will dissolve a foundation funded by Japan to compensate South Korean women who were forced to work in Japan\u2019s World War II military brothels.\n\nThe widely expected decision, if carried out, would effectively kill a controversial 2015 agreement to settle a decades-long impasse over the sexual slavery issue and threatens to aggravate a bitter diplomatic feud between the Asian U.S. allies over history. Many in South Korea believed the Seoul government settled for far too less in the sex slave deal and that Japan still hasn\u2019t acknowledged legal responsibility for atrocities during its colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono sharply criticized South Korea\u2019s decision to shut down the foundation, saying that Seoul would violate the \u201cmost basic rule to live in the international society\u201d by walking back on the deal. Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Takeo Akiba summoned South Korean Ambassador to Japan Lee Su-hoon to the ministry to lodge a protest.\n\n\u201cThe announcement is problematic and unacceptable,\u201d said Kono, urging Seoul to stick with the agreement signed under its previous government. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry couldn\u2019t immediately confirm Kono\u2019s comments that Ambassador Lee told Japanese officials Seoul doesn\u2019t plan to scrap or renegotiate the agreement.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it will take legal steps to dissolve the foundation, a process ministry officials said could take months. Lee Nam-hoon, an official from the gender equality ministry, said Seoul\u2019s Foreign Ministry plans to consult with Tokyo on what to do with the 1 billion yen ($8.8 million) Japan funded to the foundation that was formally launched in July 2016.\n\n\u201cAfter considering diverse opinions over the \u2018Reconciliation and Healing Foundation\u2019 based on victim-centric principles, we have decided to push for the dissolution of the foundation,\u201d Gender Equality Minister Jin Sun Mee said in a statement. She said the ministry will continue to push policies to \u201crestore the honor and dignity\u201d of the sexual slavery victims.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by hundreds of protesters gathered in Seoul for a weekly rally denouncing sexual slavery by Japan\u2019s wartime military. Organizers played a recorded message by a hospitalized 92-year-old victim, Kim Bok-dong, who said she was happy that the foundation was getting dissolved but also demanded a proper apology and compensation from Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWe won, (but) it\u2019s just the start,\u201d said Yoon Meehyang, who heads an activist group representing South Korean sexual slavery victims. \u201cIn saying that we won, we mean that we turned back history to the day before Dec. 28, 2015. We will invest all our passion to write a new history of justice while the victims still have time and overcome past three years that were lost.\u201d\n\nHistorians say tens of thousands of women from around Asia, many of them Korean, were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex to Japanese soldiers.\n\nLiberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been a harsh critic of the 2015 deal reached under his conservative predecessor, told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a meeting in September that the foundation was failing to function properly because of strong opposition by the victims and public. A South Korean government panel in December last year concluded the deal as seriously flawed because Seoul\u2019s previous conservative government failed to properly communicate with the victims before reaching the deal.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are already at odds over a ruling by Seoul\u2019s Supreme Court last month that a major Japanese steelmaker should compensate four South Koreans for forced labor during Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II. Abe said Tokyo will respond \u201cresolutely\u201d to the ruling, which he described as a violation of a 1965 treaty between Seoul and Tokyo that restored diplomatic ties and was accompanied by more than $800 million in economic aid and loans from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo\u2019s bitter disputes over history have complicated Washington\u2019s efforts to strengthen trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s growing influence in the region.\n\nAt the time of the sex slave deal, Seoul said there were 46 surviving South Korean victims. But 19 of them since died. Twelve victims who rejected payment from the foundation sued the Seoul government over the deal in August 2016, saying it didn\u2019t go far enough to establish Japan\u2019s responsibility.\n\nLee, the ministry official, said the foundation had used 4.4 billion won ($3.8 million) in cash payments to 34 victims who were alive at the time of the 2015 deal and to relatives of 58 victims who were dead by then. Only 27 of around 240 South Korean women who registered with the government as victims of Japan\u2019s wartime sexual slavery are currently alive, Lee said.\n\nUnder the 2015 agreement, which was then described by both governments as \u201cirreversible,\u201d Japan pledged to fund the foundation to help support the victims. However, Japan said it didn\u2019t consider the 1 billion yen it provided to the fund as compensation, saying such issues were settled in a 1965 treaty. South Korea, in exchange, vowed to refrain from criticizing Japan over the issue and will try to resolve a Japanese grievance over a statue of a girl representing victims of sexual slavery that sits in front of the Japanese Embassy in downtown Seoul.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Only the first appearance in the top 10 by any Group of Five program, with UCF\u2019s bob from No. 11 to No. 9, provided any curious bubbling.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (11-0), No. 2 Clemson (11-0), No. 3 Notre Dame (11-0) and No. 4 Michigan (10-1) remained in the top four spots aspiring toward the four-team playoff to be announced on Sunday, Dec. 2. Just beneath those lurked No. 5 Georgia (10-1). The 13-member selection committee, in its weekly meetings in Grapevine, Tex., discussed transposing Alabama and Clemson but decided against, chairman Rob Mullens said, but did not include Notre Dame into that discussion even though the Fighting Irish have the strongest win in the country this season (over No. 4 Michigan) plus three other wins against top-25 teams.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at those, we see Alabama and Clemson, through Week 12, as more complete teams, with strengths on both sides of the ball,\u201d said Mullens, the athletic director at Oregon, describing the Alabama-Clemson discussion as ongoing and weeks-long. Alabama has appeared in the top four in 25 of the 29 rankings so far during the five seasons of the College Football Playoff concept, with Clemson appearing in 22 and nobody else appearing more than eight times.\n\n[The four key questions that could decide the four teams in the College Football Playoff field]\n\nAfter the top five came perhaps a mini-controversy when No. 8 Washington State (10-1), which continued to gather note as a formidable side when it ran up a 55-14 halftime lead on a 5-5 Arizona team toward a 69-28 win last Saturday night, remained in the spot it has held for all four times this season. The committee left the Cougars behind No. 6 Oklahoma (10-1) and No. 7 LSU (9-2).\n\nThe committee members \u2014 five athletic directors, five former coaches, one university president, one former player and one journalist \u2014 left Oklahoma at No. 6 even after it finished a three-game run in which it has allowed 46 points to Texas Tech, 47 to Oklahoma State and 40 to Kansas. Oklahoma ranks No. 87 in total defense, No. 78 in yards-per-play defense and No. 86 in scoring defense.\n\nLSU remained ahead of Washington State for the Tigers\u2019 stout collection of victims, which include No. 5 Georgia, set against the Cougars\u2019 schedule. In non-conference games, LSU scheduled and defeated Miami (Fla.), which has struggled at 6-5, but which is a Power Five member, unlike the three non-conference conquests of Washington State (Wyoming, San Jose State and Eastern Washington). Washington State will get a chance at masking that shortcoming Friday when it gets a visit from No. 16 Washington (8-3) in the annual Apple Cup fracas.\n\n[College football winners and losers: Questions continue for struggling USC]\n\nBefore this season, no team from the Group of Five, the sport\u2019s second tier, had exceeded No. 12 in any of the 25 rankings across the first four seasons. UCF bucked that last week when it inched from No. 12 to No. 11. Then, after its 38-13 blasting of then-No. 24 Cincinnati on Saturday night, the Knights leapfrogged Ohio State to take up the No. 9 spot vacated by West Virginia, which slid only to No. 13 after its 41-31 lead turned into a 45-41 loss at Oklahoma State. No. 13 West Virginia (8-2) plays Oklahoma on Friday in Morgantown.\n\nLeft at No. 10 was Ohio State (10-1), which clung to a 52-51 overtime win at Maryland when the latter missed a two-point-conversion pass to end a long afternoon of play. Much like Oklahoma, the Buckeyes suffer from some eyesore defensive numbers, ranked No. 73 total, No. 92 in yards-per-play allowed and No. 52 in scoring. \u201cWhile UCF may not have the depth of talent that Ohio State has,\u201d Mullens said, \u201cthe committee felt they\u2019re playing more as an all-around team than Ohio State, after Week 12.\u201d\n\nWeek 13, of course, will bring Ohio State the chance at upward mobility when No. 4 Michigan arrives in Columbus.\n\nAs to why the committee continues to rank Oklahoma at No. 6 and Ohio State at No. 10 when the two share traits of runaway offense (Nos. 1 and 2 in total yardage per game) and troubled defense, Mullens said of Oklahoma, \u201cTheir only loss is to a ranked Texas team (No. 14) on a neutral site.\u201d Ohio State\u2019s only loss occurred at Purdue (5-6), by a 49-20 blowout.\n\nNotable with the list Tuesday was its number of four-loss teams \u2014 five \u2014 when, at this stage last season, there were none. That exemplifies the top-heaviness of the sport this season, the large gap from the primo contenders to the others ranked, and the difficulty some poll voters have had in finding obvious teams to fill out lists.\n\nStill, where the Associated Press and coaches\u2019 polls released on Sunday included Army at Nos. 23 and 24, respectively, the Knights (9-2) did not make a debut in the committee\u2019s top 25. That left Navy as the only service academy thus far to appear on the list, as it did for five weeks in 2015 (peaking at No. 15) and for three weeks in 2016 (peaking at No. 19).\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nThe Flacco brothers have a lot in common.

Authorities say Alam used digital platforms to spread false information that instigated the chaos and tarnished the country\u2019s image.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International and others demanded Alam\u2019s release after his arrest in August, and they criticized Hasina for taking repressive measures against free speech.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump said he wouldn't let the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi jeopardize U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe Knight First Amendment Institute on Tuesday sued the U.S. government to learn whether agencies complied with what the institute asserted was a duty to warn journalist Jamal Khashoggi that he faced a threat of harm.\n\nKhashoggi, who lived in Northern Virginia, was killed Oct. 2 by a team of Saudi operatives soon after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his impending marriage.\n\nThe Columbia University institute is seeking records that relate to any actions taken to warn Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen, under what is known as Directive 191, a government policy that requires agencies to warn individuals of \u201cimpending threats of intentional killing, serious bodily injury or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit states that before Khashoggi\u2019s killing, \u201cU.S. intelligence agencies apparently intercepted communications in which Saudi officials discussed a plan to capture Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post last month reported that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered an operation to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from Virginia and then detain him, according to U.S. intelligence intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plan.\n\nIt is not clear if the intelligence the agencies had at the time triggered the duty to warn. Some former officials said it would depend on whether the intelligence clearly indicated Khashoggi was in danger. A threat of detention alone would not have sufficed, one former official said. But others say that if agencies had knowledge of a potential plan to kidnap him \u2014 by luring and detaining him, then they had an obligation to warn him.\n\nSince Khashoggi\u2019s death, the CIA has concluded that the crown prince ordered the assassination, contradicting the Saudi government\u2019s claims that he was not involved.\n\n[CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination]\n\nOn Tuesday, in an exclamation-mark-laden statement, President Trump declared firm support for Saudi Arabia and undercut the CIA\u2019s conclusion. He said: \u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nLast month, the Knight Institute filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records related to the murder of Khashoggi. It sent requests to the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency, State Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThe institute is seeking documents concerning any duty to warn actions taken with respect to Khashoggi and related to any issues among intelligence agencies regarding the determination to warn Khashoggi or waive the duty-to-warn requirement, or regarding the means for communicating threat information to him.\n\nSo far none of the agencies have released any records. So the institute filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to force them to comply.\n\n\u201cOur request for information about agencies\u2019 compliance with the \u2018duty to warn\u2019 was urgent when we filed it, but it has become even more so in light of the White House\u2019s shameful efforts to minimize the gravity and significance of this reporter\u2019s murder, and to shield from responsibility the people who authorized it,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight Institute.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists filed its own FOIA request calling for the release of the same records sought by the Knight Institute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that the U.S. government makes public what it knew about threats to Jamal Khashoggi before his murder,\u201d CPJ executive director Joel Simon said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/des.bieler", "title": "Let the side bets begin: Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods wager $200000 on The Match's first hole - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Let the side bets begin: Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods wager $200000 on The Match's first hole Washington Post At a news conference Tuesday to promote their head-to-head showdown later in the week, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didn't exactly m\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/21/let-side-bets-begin-phil-mickelson-tiger-woods-wager-matchs-first-hole/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lTDZS7Qoftta6B1Wz6VyggVyE1c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6IWCUCXNCEI6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T01:46:09Z", "content": "At a news conference Tuesday to promote their head-to-head showdown later in the week, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson didnt exactly make like Conor McGregor and come armed with insulting taunts.

Woods laughed and then immediately began to plant negative thoughts in his opponent\u2019s mind by pointing out ways he thought Mickelson could get into trouble on the hole.\n\nPhil Mickelson bet $100k that he\u2019ll birdie the first hole during The Match.

The performance at the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach is the single greatest performance in the history of the game of golf, and possibly all of sports, and he continued to play at that level for a number of years.\u201d\n\nWoods returned the favor, calling Mickelson \u201cone of the greatest players to ever pick up a golf club.\u201d Woods praised the way his opponent has \u201cdone it for so long,\u201d calling himself \u201can unfortunate living example\u201d of how injuries inevitably interrupt lengthy careers but haven\u2019t seem to have done so with Mickelson.\n\n\u201cCan we just appreciate the nice thing you just said about me?\u201d Mickelson said with a smile. \u201cDid y\u2019all get that on tape?\u201d\n\nContinuing the discussion of what each has meant to the sport, Mickelson said, \u201cI just know that in 1997, when Tiger came along, won the Masters, he turned pro in \u201996, and the game took on a whole different meteoric rise. And the purses started to climb and the TV ratings started to climb, golf was on the front page of USA Today and it was a whole different revelation for the sport.\"\n\nMickelson referred to Woods\u2019s struggles before this year with back injuries that kept him from playing competitively for long stretches, saying that \u201cit was noticeable when he was away for a few years, and he comes back and plays so well this year.\u201d He noted the extraordinary \u201creaction\u201d to Woods\u2019s win at September\u2019s Tour Championship, saying that the 14-time major winner \u201cbrings out an emotion in people that this sport craves, and we\u2019re very appreciative of that.\u201d\n\nWhen not complimenting Woods, Mickelson was making self-deprecating remarks. Asked if Woods has been living in his head for 20 years, as Woods claimed last week, Mickelson replied, \u201cYeah, but there\u2019s a lot of empty space in there.\u201d\n\nBoth golfers showed up for the media session clad in familiar attire, with Mickelson wearing black clothes and Woods, notably, opting for the red-and-black look he dons for the final rounds of tournaments. Woods may have been seeking an early psychological advantage with the sartorial choice, but Mickelson jokingly noted a way in which he was already facing an uphill climb.\n\nA reporter referred to the official name of the event \u2014 \u201cThe Match: Tiger vs. Phil\u201d \u2014 and asked if there had been any thought of possibly listing Mickelson\u2019s name first. \u201cThat was my first loss,\u201d Mickelson said to laughs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to get it back even, 1-1, on Friday.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAfter dad dresses as ref to sway high school football game, losing team parents sue to reverse result\n\nIs Kurt Suzuki really the \u2018front-line\u2019 catcher the Nationals were seeking?

Williams, 38, was not hurt.\n\nOfficer David Dowling, the lead investigator, said in his report that video from a nearby security camera shows Williams legally entered the intersection from a road exiting her gated neighborhood on a green light. As she started to cross, a dark sedan cut her off, forcing her to stop. When the sedan cleared her path, Williams began moving forward in her 2010 Toyota Sequoia, but that put her in the path of the Barsons, who now had the green light.

And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday night, the Associated Press reported that Hyde-Smith had apologized for her \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comment, saying there was \u201cno ill will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been hurtful to anyone,\u201d Hyde-Smith said in a debate against Espy, according to the AP. \u201cThis comment was twisted. It was turned into a weapon to be used against me.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Politico reported that Hyde-Smith had posed for a photo wearing the hat of a Confederate soldier and holding a rifle. The photo, which was posted on Facebook, was taken during a 2014 visit to the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library. During the Civil War, Davis was the president of the Confederacy.\n\n\u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d wrote Hyde-Smith in the Facebook post.\n\nI enjoyed my tour of Beauvoir. The Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library located in Biloxi. This is a must see.... Posted by Cindy Hyde-Smith on Friday, August 8, 2014\n\nAt the White House on Tuesday, before leaving for Florida, President Trump said that Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment about attending a public hanging was made \u201cin jest\u201d and that she \u201cfeels bad\u201d about it. He went on to predict that she will still win the Mississippi runoff against Espy.\n\nHistorically, Mississippi had one of the highest statewide rates of lynching in the United States, according to extensive research by the Equal Justice Initiative, which works to end mass incarceration and racial injustice in the country. Between 1877 and 1950, 614 African Americans were lynched in Mississippi, according to the EJI.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Espy campaign said it was confident that \u201cvoters will follow Walmart\u2019s lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cCindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments have embarrassed Mississippi, and shown why she can\u2019t be trusted to work with the businesses Mississippi needs to grow good-paying jobs,\u201d said Danny Blanton, communications director for the Espy campaign.\n\nWalmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said the retailer made three donations to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, including one in June and one in September for $1,000 each. On Nov. 8, two days after the midterm elections, Walmart made a third campaign donation for $2,000. Walmart has asked that all $4,000 be returned.\n\nJenkins said this was the first time, for any candidate in any race, that Walmart requested a donation be returned.\n\n\u201cWhen we are made aware of comments like this, we have to do what\u2019s best for our company and our core values,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nBoston Scientific and Union Pacific on Monday each distanced themselves from Hyde-Smith in tweets. Both companies are requesting a refund.\n\nKate Haranis, a spokeswoman for Boston Scientific, said a $2,500 contribution was made to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign on Nov. 8. Haranis said that the company wasn\u2019t aware of Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks about public hangings before the donation was made and that Boston Scientific hadn\u2019t given to the campaign previously.\n\nUnion Pacific is also requesting a refund and said the company \u201cin no way, shape or form condones or supports divisive or perceived to be divisive statements.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s comments about public hangings were made before the Nov. 6 election. But it took roughly one week for her comments to circulate and even longer for Walmart, Boston Scientific and Union Pacific\u2019s donations to come under fire on Twitter. On Monday, for example, \u201cWill & Grace\u201d actress Debra Messing tweeted a story about Walmart\u2019s donation from the site Popular Information. The tweet quickly went viral.\n\nBusinesses have always had to tread carefully when it comes to wading into social or political issues. Most recently, U.S. companies have come under pressure to take stances on immigration policy and gun control.\n\nBut the decision to come out against one person is unique, said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at the public relations firm Weber Shandwick. Rather than have a CEO come out with a critical statement and then quietly walk away, Walmart, Boston Scientific and Union Pacific went a step further, she said.\n\nTypically, to take a moral stance on a social issue, companies \u201cdonate to the [American Civil Liberties Union], or they take action with an amicus brief on the immigration ban,\u201d Gaines-Ross said. \u201cThis is different. They\u2019re asking for a refund.\u201d\n\nThe strategy could also align with what the public increasingly expects from corporations and their leaders. According to a June 2018 survey by Weber Shandwick, 74 percent of Americans agreed that when CEOs take a public position on a hotly debated issue, they should back up their words with actions.\n\nStill, what ultimately motivates those actions isn\u2019t always clear, said Joseph Holt, an expert on business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. Often, it\u2019s only after a public outcry that a company will sever ties with a person or group, as many tech companies did this summer with Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and prominent right-wing talk show host.\n\nPlus, Holt said, simply withdrawing a campaign contribution doesn\u2019t clarify exactly how Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments conflict with the companies' \u201ccore values.\u201d Holt gave the example of how when Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier resigned from Trump\u2019s American Manufacturing Council in August 2017, following Trump\u2019s response to the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Frazier clearly explained that he was taking \u201ca stand against intolerance and extremism.\u201d\n\nWhen asked specifically what company values Hyde-Smith violated when she spoke about public hangings, Boston Scientific pointed to a list of six values, including global collaboration and diversity. Union Pacific said it could not comment. Walmart also would not elaborate.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not saying why, and which value it violates,\u201d Holt said, \u201cthen that is an indication that you don\u2019t have a clearly held set of values in mind.\""}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump says he can't imagine anyone but himself as Time Person of the Year - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trump says he can't imagine anyone but himself as Time Person of the Year Washington Post President Trump was asked by a reporter Tuesday about Time magazine's Person of the Year issue, which comes out every December.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAs political pressure builds over the killing and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of the Saudi state, President Trump has continued to shine an unwelcome spotlight on U.S. weapons manufacturers as he seeks to justify an increasingly controversial U.S.-Saudi military alliance.\n\nNear the top of an official White House statement that started with the lines \u201cAmerica First!\u201d and \u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!,\" Trump named specific U.S. defense contractors as beneficiaries of a $110 billion arms deal that followed his highly public visit to the kingdom last year. (Analysts have disputed that number.)\n\nThe statement closely followed a Washington Post report that the CIA had concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the assassination of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post contributing columnist, contradicting the Saudi government\u2019s earlier claims.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s statement noted that the \u201ccrime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one,\u201d it was focused primarily on the economic benefits of Saudi defense spending, as well as Iran\u2019s role in supporting terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States,\" the president wrote Tuesday. \"Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time the president has brought up arms sales in the context of Khashoggi\u2019s killing. He named the same three companies in an October interview on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\" saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose an order like that.\u201d\n\n[Trump defends Saudi Arabia's denial about the planning of Khashoggi's death]\n\nThose presidential mentions have been met with consternation across the defense industry, with representatives from prominent manufacturers and trade associations preferring to stay silent. In a little over a month, Saudi business has been transformed from a badge of honor to an untouchable conversation-stopper for U.S. defense contractors.\n\nAndrew Hunter, a former Defense Department official who is now a senior fellow specializing in procurement issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thought the defense industry \u201cwould very much like to not be put in the center of this debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sales are critical to their overall business plans, but it is incredibly awkward to be in put in a position where the interests of the companies are competing against issues of human rights and basic justice, especially where there\u2019s a U.S. resident involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not where they want to be.\u201d\n\nDefense industry executives, analysts, consultants and lobbyists contacted by The Post \u2014 most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they thought publicly discussing the issue would be bad for business \u2014 said the president\u2019s repeated references to defense industry job creation in the context of Khashoggi\u2019s killing have not been helpful.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments put the defense industry \u201cin a very, very difficult situation,\u201d a longtime defense industry consultant said. Those who work for defense contractors \u201care responsible Americans, and they don\u2019t want to be associated with a situation like we\u2019re seeing in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman from the National Defense Industrial Association declined to comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Aerospace Industries Association referred reporters to an earlier statement that said it will \u201ccontinue to look to the government for direction on how best to support [national security] goals.\u201d\n\nDefense executives have told investors they will honor existing Saudi contracts and defer to the U.S. government regarding arms sales to the kingdom, without mentioning Khashoggi\u2019s killing publicly. Raytheon chief executive Thomas Kennedy, for example, said in a call with investors that his company has consistently weathered different \u201cperiods of uncertainty\u201d in Saudi Arabia over the past 50 years by remaining \u201clocked in step behind\u201d the U.S. administration.\n\n[For Trump, the relationship with Saudi Arabia is all about money]\n\nExecutives say they have long considered the risk that the Saudi regime\u2019s poor human rights record could become a problem for the U.S. defense industry but are waiting to see how the situation plays out before publicly broadcasting their intentions.\n\nDefense lobbyists are closely watching Congress, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers is hoping to curtail sales to Saudi Arabia in response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has repeatedly sought to cut off weapons sales. Last year, he and his allies were four votes short, and he vowed to fight the next deal that comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n\u201cThe President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser of two evils compared to Iran and so the U.S. won\u2019t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree,\u201d Paul wrote on Twitter, vowing to continue pressing for legislation that would stop arms sales to the nation. \u201cWe should, at the very least NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians.\u201d\n\nOne executive said defense contractors are waiting to see whether the crown prince will be replaced before determining a course of action.\n\nU.S. defense contractors \u201care really in a duck-and-cover mode, hoping to tie themselves to this as little as possible,\u201d said a prominent defense executive. \u201cTo say that we\u2019re going to support this because we have a few thousand jobs at stake ... we don\u2019t want that,\" the executive said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "UMd student dies from adenovirus; virus confirmed in five other students - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post UMd student dies from adenovirus; virus confirmed in five other students Washington Post A student at the University of Maryland died recently from an adenovirus-associated illness, the university said Tuesday.

(Ng Han Guan/Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 A Chinese university\u2019s plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire, illustrating the limits of the population\u2019s tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on Muslim minorities may be creeping into the rest of the country.\n\nThe Guilin University of Electronic Technology is reconsidering a search of cellphones, computers, external hard disks and USB drives after a copy of the order leaked online and triggered such an intense backlash that it drew rare criticism in state-run newspapers.\n\nSearches of electronics are common in Xinjiang in China\u2019s far west, a heavily Muslim region that has been turned into a virtual police state to tamp down unrest. They are unheard of in most other areas, including where the school is located in the southern Guangxi region, a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery, not violence or terrorism.\n\nThat\u2019s why the planned checks worry some.\n\n\u201cXinjiang has emerged as China\u2019s surveillance laboratory,\u201d said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic politics and national identity at La Trobe University in Australia. \u201cIt is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in China\u2019s west are now being rolled out in other regions.\u201d\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities. Sometimes, these measures have run into a new generation of Chinese accustomed to greater freedoms, sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat.\n\nThe leaked notice in Guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and foreign powers are \u201cwantonly spreading illicit and illegal videos\u201d through the internet. It said the search for violent, terrorist, reactionary and obscene content, which was to be conducted this month, was necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful.\n\nThe order triggered a public uproar last week.\n\nPosts on China\u2019s Weibo microblogging site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times. Users voiced privacy concerns, comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the George Orwell novel \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nThen came critical editorials in state-run publications saying the notice could violate Chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential.\n\n\u201cIf colleges and universities check the phones, computers, and hard disks of teachers and students, they\u2019re suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy,\u201d said an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily. \u201cThose responsible at the school should be held accountable, as they had a great negative impact on the school\u2019s image.\u201d\n\nAdministrators told another state-owned publication, \u201cThe Paper,\u201d that the search had not yet been carried out, and that they were considering reducing its scope. University and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office, which did not answer repeated phone calls.\n\nWeibo, while not a government body, ran into hot water in April when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog. The company backpedaled under intense criticism, including from state-run publications.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the Guilin university\u2019s planned search. It could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local administrator, said Christopher Colley, a National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates assistant professor who has lectured at Chinese universities.\n\nEither way, he said, the backlash shows that though online censorship is common in China, physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept.\n\n\u201cMost people in China are willing to tolerate Big Brother as long as it contributes to social stability, but for many, this is going too far,\u201d Colley said.\n\nSchools in Xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region\u2019s highest court in early 2014 issued a notice forbidding audio and video recordings promoting terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic division.\n\nTeachers and administrators at Xinjiang Normal University\u2019s College of Physics and Electronics searched electronic devices in every dormitory on campus on Nov. 9, 2014. A post about the search on the school\u2019s website says, \u201cThrough investigating violent and terroristic videos, religious extremism on campus has been weakened.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, China University of Petroleum\u2019s branch in Karamay, a city in oil country in Xinjiang\u2019s north, ordered various school departments to assign inspectors to search the computers of all teachers on campus.\n\nXinjiang is home to a large Uighur population, a Muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from Beijing. A series of riots and attacks blamed on separatist Uighurs has prompted a sweeping crackdown on Muslims in the region.\n\nChina has rolled out one of the world\u2019s most aggressive surveillance and policing programs both in Xinjiang and neighboring Tibet.\n\nUighurs are regularly singled out and stopped at checkpoints to have their smartphones scanned for religious content. As The Associated Press reported in May, they risk being detained and sent to internment camps if police find songs or videos they deem suspicious or apps that are commonly used to contact people outside China, such as WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cXinjiang today appears to be the leading-edge of a highly intrusive and coercive surveillance society that the (Communist Party) is intent on constructing across China,\u201d Leibold said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

At 20 years, 63 days, Pulisic bettered Landon Donovan, who was 22 years, 220 days when he first captained the Americans in a World Cup qualifier at El Salvador on Oct. 9, 2004, a match regular captain Claudio Reyna missed because of a quadriceps injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor. For the coaches, the staff, the team to trust me to be captain of the team, it means everything,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cI was never a captain in my life and now to be for the United States men\u2019s national team, it\u2019s an incredible honor. It doesn\u2019t matter what age you are. I will never forget this moment.\u201d\n\nBefore last week, Pulisic had played just once for the U.S. since the October 2017 defeat at Trinidad and Tobago that ended the Americans\u2019 streak of seven straight World Cup appearances. He missed some games because of minor injuries, others to concentrate on his club career with Borussia Dortmund in Germany.\n\nCoach Bruce Arena quit after the loss in Trinidad and was replaced on an interim basis by Sarachan, his top assistant. As the U.S. Soccer Federation restructured under new president Carlos Cordeiro, Sarachan transitioned to a younger roster and guided the Americans to three wins, five losses and four ties in 12 exhibitions.\n\n\u201cWell, it was my last game. I haven\u2019t been told that, but it\u2019s evident there\u2019s going to be a change in the very near future,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cTo look back on the games that we played, the players that we\u2019ve exposed to this level, that we brought forth, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s going to pay dividends down the line. So for me I feel as though when the next person comes in, they\u2019re going to have a great starting point and that makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nPulisic was moved from wide midfield to forward in a 3-5-2 formation against Italy. The new coach will face the issue of where to deploy Pulisic, who usually is wide for Dortmund.\n\nRomain Gall, a 23-year-old midfielder, replaced Pulisic in the 83rd minute and became the 23rd player to make his debut under Sarachan. New U.S. general manager Earnie Stewart has said a new coach will be hired later this year, and Columbus Crew coach Gregg Berhalter is the favorite. The new coach will take over for a January training camp followed by a pair of friendlies, and his first competitive matches will be next June at the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways with the interim role, it\u2019s a difficult space to navigate, and I think he did it extremely well,\u201d midfielder Wil Trapp said of the 64-year-old Sarachan. \u201cHe could have mailed it in in a lot of ways but he didn\u2019t do that one bit. He did all of us as a players a real service.\u201d\n\nNine of the 11 U.S. starters were 23 or younger, and the lineup\u2019s average age of 22 years, 71 days was an American record low, besting the 22-160 against Bolivia on May 28.\n\nEthan Horvath, a 23-year-old goalkeeper on his home field for Club Brugge, made his third international appearance and first since last November at Portugal. He had five saves before the goal by Politano, a 25-year-old winger playing his second match for the Azzurri.\n\nPolitano passed to Marco Verratti about 25 yards above the penalty arc and sprinted through the penalty area. Roberto Gagliardini beat defender Aaron Long to Verratti\u2019s feed into the area and poked the ball ahead to the onrushing Politano, who cut past Jorge Villafana, touched the ball from his left foot to his right and beat Horvath from 8 yards. The goal with about 25 seconds left capped a buildup that included a dozen passes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of disappointed with the late goal, but on the other side I think I can be proud of how I performed tonight,\u201d said Horvath, who in the last month has gotten regular club playing time for the first stretch this season. \u201cThe past year has not been easy. And all I can do is believe in myself and believe what I\u2019m doing each day is the correct thing.\u201d\n\nNotes: The U.S. will play Costa Rica in an exhibition on Feb. 2 at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, California. ... The U.S. finished with three wins, five losses and three draws in 2018, its fewest games in a year since going 1-2 in 1987, all that June at the President\u2019s Cup in South Korea. The Americans have one win and three draws in 12 matches against Italy.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s internal watchdog has uncovered widespread errors in how the agency awards benefits to some of its most vulnerable patients: those diagnosed with the devastating neurological disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\n\nVA Inspector General Michael Missal, in a review released Tuesday, found that dozens of veterans suffering from ALS were deprived of financial support because staff mishandled their benefits claims.\n\nOfficials with the inspector general\u2019s office are concerned that the Veterans Benefits Administration, under pressure from Congress and veterans service organizations to reduce an enormous backlog of compensation claims and appeals, may be cutting corners.\n\nOf 960 claims that were examined by Missal\u2019s office, 430 contained errors. Of those, 230 claimants were awarded the wrong benefits, the inspector general\u2019s report says. Most received no money or were underpaid. In other cases, officials could not determine whether the benefits VA paid were too low or too high.\n\nOfficials estimated that if the errors continue at the same rate over the next five years, VA will fail to pay $7.5 million in benefits to ALS patients and award an additional $6.5 million in erroneous payments.\n\n\u201cALS is a devastating, aggressive disease,\u201d Missal told The Washington Post. \u201cAccordingly, VA needs to ensure that claims reviewers are proficient and trained to properly and accurately assure that veterans are getting the full range of benefits to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\n[Veterans aren\u2019t getting their GI Bill payments \u2014 because VA\u2019s 50-year-old computer system broke]\n\nALS, a rapidly progressive neurological disease that most often leads to death within three to five years from the onset of symptoms, afflicts at least 2,000 veterans a year. Studies show that military service puts veterans at up to twice the risk of contracting the disease, although scientists have not determined why that link exists.\n\nVeterans diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, have been entitled since 2008 to automatic, service-connected benefits. Compensation ranges from $36,000 to $100,000 annually, depending on marital and family status, and related needs as the disease progresses .\n\nThe inspector general faulted poor training for the staff, comprising mostly low-level employees, tasked with reviewing the claims.\n\nEmployees who improperly denied claims failed to accurately evaluate the disease\u2019s many medical complications, and in dozens of cases they did not inform veterans or their caregivers that they were eligible for additional compensation to assist with related needs such as transportation , dressing and feeding, and specialized housing, investigators found.\n\nPaul Lawrence, VA\u2019s undersecretary for benefits, agreed with the report\u2019s recommendation that his office create specialized training for reviewers handling ALS claims and inform the staff that they must tell veterans they are entitled to additional benefits for related needs.\n\nA spokesman for VA, Curt Cashour, said that evaluating the disease\u2019s severity is \u201ccomplex work that requires a detailed assessment of a veteran\u2019s medical history.\u201d The agency is committed, he added, \u201cto improving its ALS claims-processing efforts so veterans receive the maximum benefits to which they are entitled.\u201d\n\nALS claims are among the most complex in VA\u2019s benefits system, in part because the disease progresses quickly with varied symptoms. The onset of symptoms \u2014 which can include twitching, cramping, muscle stiffness or weakness and slurred speech \u2014 may be so subtle that changes are overlooked.\n\nVA employees are supposed to tell veterans about their right to extra compensation. But they did not, based on a narrow interpretation of a legal case, the inspector general\u2019s report says.\n\n\u201cWithout information about [additional compensation], veterans with ALS may not know about and understand the benefits available to them and may mistakenly believe there are no additional benefits available,\u201d the report said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Anne Gearan", "title": "For Trump, the bottom line on Saudi Arabia takes precedence over human rights", "description": "The president\u2019s declaration that he won\u2019t hold Riyadh accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi shows his transactional, personalized approach to foreign affairs.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-the-bottom-line-on-saudi-arabia-takes-precedence-over-human-rights/2018/11/20/a8813bb0-ecf4-11e8-baac-2a674e91502b_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/buDMI3SRvKzWy5nGkPdl1SVJFqQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V3HFCSXNBII6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:44:22Z", "content": "President Trumps declaration Tuesday that he wont hold Saudi rulers accountable for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi distilled the presidents approach to foreign policy to its transactional and personalized essence.

In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Trump said in an oddly brisk statement laying out that the U.S. business and security relationship with Saudi Arabia, and with its designated next leader, is paramount.\n\nHe cited arms sales with the kingdom, its role as a bulwark against Iran and the threat of higher oil prices as risks to the United States if his administration ruptured the relationship over the Khashoggi killing.\n\nThe statement was issued as Trump prepared to head to his golf resort in Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday and in the wake of the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the Oct. 2 killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and U.S. resident.\n\nThe nothing-to-see-here tone, the fractured syntax and falsehoods, and the abundance of exclamation points were pure Trump \u2014 and as far from the massaged, nuanced products of past White Houses as one could imagine.\n\n\n\nIn March, Trump holds a chart highlighting arms sales to Saudi Arabia during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018America First,\u2019 \u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday before departing for Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about America First. We\u2019re not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China and everybody else have them.\u201d\n\nTrump said that Saudi Arabia had helped him keep oil prices down and that without those efforts, \u201coil prices would go through the roof.\u201d\n\nAs with U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, he overrode his advisers and downplayed their findings in favor of his own priorities and interpretation of events.\n\n\u201cKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s clannish management style is also a factor in the Saudi decision. He has entrusted the relationship to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has built a close partnership with MBS, as the young Saudi heir is known. Kushner has argued within the administration that the crown prince is crucial to assisting White House policy against Iran and in providing backing for a U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace package expected soon.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday defended Trump\u2019s decision to not hold Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders accountable for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nTelling reporters later that there is no \u201cdefinitive\u201d proof, Trump washed his hands of the matter.\n\n\u201cI think that statement was pretty obvious, what I said,\u201d Trump said, as reporters shouted questions above the din of the presidential helicopter blades. \u201cI\u2019m not going to destroy the world economy\u201d or harm U.S. interests in the Middle East or elsewhere over this case, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has applied sanctions on 17 Saudis allegedly involved in the killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, but Trump appeared to be effectively writing off the possibility of larger consequences. Those might have included sanctions or a rebuke against the royal family, cancellation of weapons sales, or a boycott.\n\nTrump has also bucked convention and the advice of Cabinet and career government officials in pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord and in deploying punitive tariffs against allies and foes alike.\n\nThe president always places himself at the center of events and decides what to do from that standpoint, said Ross Kennedy, an American history professor and presidential scholar at Illinois State University. In the case of Saudi Arabia, the kingdom\u2019s lavish welcome in Riyadh for Trump in 2017 set the tone, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cHe really personalizes his interactions, not just with people in domestic audiences or in business or with people he meets\u201d at the White House, Kennedy said. \u201cHe does it with foreign leaders, and he bases much of what he does by how they treat him personally. The Saudis really laid it on thick.\u201d\n\nPast administrations, both Republican and Democratic, have prized a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia and sometimes tempered criticism of human rights abuses, including religious persecution and the jailing of dissidents.\n\nBut President George W. Bush also argued that U.S. national security interests were served by defending human rights abroad, and his administration claimed to raise particular cases each time U.S. officials met with leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Russia and other countries with poor human rights records.\n\nOn Iran, Riyadh has leveraged Trump\u2019s opposition to the nuclear deal reached under President Barack Obama, appealing to Trump\u2019s impulse to reverse his predecessor\u2019s policies and giving Trump additional diplomatic footing to pull out of the agreement, Kennedy said. Trump\u2019s statement Tuesday begins with an indictment of Iranian activities in the Middle East.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded by mocking Trump on his English-language Twitter feed, including a reference to the U.S. president\u2019s false claim that Finland spends \u201ca lot of time raking\u201d its forests to prevent wildfires.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump bizarrely devotes the FIRST paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse IRAN of every sort of malfeasance he can think of,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re also responsible for the California fires, because we didn\u2019t help rake the forests \u2014 just like the Finns do?\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo did not attempt to wrap the Saudi decision in diplomatic niceties.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there, the Middle East in particular,\u201d Pompeo said when asked whether the Trump administration is excusing murder. \u201cThe United States will continue to have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They are an important partner of ours. We will do that with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its people. That is the commitment that the president made today. It\u2019s that straightforward.\u201d\n\nSamantha Power, who was Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, called the president\u2019s statement an \u201cabomination that will define the ignorance, corruption, cruelty and recklessness of this presidency for generations to come.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has become a reliable Trump ally, took the president to task for letting the Saudis off easy.\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned during the Obama years is that when you look the other way regarding problems in the Middle East, it seldom works out,\u201d said Graham, who added that there is \u201cstrong bipartisan support\u201d for serious sanctions against Saudi Arabia and members of the royal family.\n\nTrump, fresh off the traditional pardoning of Thanksgiving turkeys at the White House, did not sound bothered about such criticism when he was asked who should be Time\u2019s annual \u201cPerson of the Year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to Time Magazine,\u201d he said, noting that he had \u201cbeen there before.\u201d Trump was named \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d in 2016 but was runner-up last year.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anybody else other than Trump,\u201d he added, referring to himself in the third person. \u201cCan you imagine anybody other than Trump?\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Dead whale had 115 plastic cups, 2 flip-flops in its stomach - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Dead whale had 115 plastic cups, 2 flip-flops in its stomach Washington Post JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 A dead whale that washed ashore in eastern Indonesia had a large lump of plastic waste in its stomach, including drinking cups, bottles and flip-\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/dead-whale-had-115-plastic-cups-2-flip-flops-in-its-stomach/2018/11/20/079e9f3a-ed26-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:40:31Z", "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia A dead whale that washed ashore in eastern Indonesia had a large lump of plastic waste in its stomach, including drinking cups, bottles and flip-flops, a park official said Tuesday, causing concern among environmentalists and government off\u2026 [+2271 chars]", "fulltext": "In this undated photo released by Akademi Komunitas Kelautan dan Perikanan Wakatobi (Wakatobi Marine and Fisheries Community Academy or AKKP Wakatobi), researchers collect data of the carcass of a beached whale at Wakatobi National Park in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia.

The 84 include Gulen himself, who lives in Pennsylvania and denies involvement in the 2016 coup attempt.\n\nCavusoglu gave no indication as to the reaction to the list from either Pompeo or Bolton. But he said he was pleased that the U.S. was looking at Turkey\u2019s request. Turkey has sought Gulen\u2019s extradition in the past but has been rebuffed.\n\nIn addition to the extraditions, Cavusoglu said he had raised Turkey\u2019s request to make permanent a temporary waiver of U.S. sanctions it was granted earlier this month to allow it to continue to import Iranian oil without penalty. He said a permanent waiver is necessary because Turkey could not make up for a loss in Iranian oil purchases. \u201cWe cannot diversify further,\u201d he told reporters at a news conference at the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this month re-imposed all sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the terms of the nuclear deal that the president withdrew from in May. Those include sanctions on countries and companies that continue to do business with designated Iranian firms, such as its state-owned oil company.\n\nThe U.S. has been demanding the countries reduce their Iranian oil imports to zero but granted waivers to eight nations to give them more time to do so. Cavusoglu, however, said Turkey could not and would not halt all imports from its neighbor.\n\nAfter meeting Cavusoglu, Pompeo said U.S. relations with the NATO ally had improved since the release of jailed American pastor Andrew Brunson in October.\n\nPompeo said he had welcomed \u201cpositive momentum in our relationship following the release of Pastor Brunson and urged reopening additional channels to address issues of mutual concern.\u201d\n\nStill, he said the U.S. remains concerned about several local U.S. Consulate employees and a NASA scientist who remain jailed in Turkey. He made no mention of the Turkish demands.\n\nIn the news conference, Cavusoglu made clear that differences between Washington and Ankara remain deep. He said the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to \u201ccorner\u201d Iran was \u201cunwise\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for stability in the broader Middle East.

They actually appear more disturbing when trying to put on a good face because the facade requires too much denial. They say the right things, even though they specialize in doing wrong. They are likable as individuals, but combustible in a bunch. The longer they stay together, the more dangerous they are to each other.\n\nThey\u2019re a time bomb, yet they\u2019re afraid to acknowledge the ticking sound. After a shoot-around late Tuesday morning, they tried to extinguish their latest controversy \u2014 a series of expletive-laced verbal confrontations during a practice last week \u2014 by trying to make the squabbles seem like normal family disagreements. They tried to characterize the incidents as old news that the media found out about after the wounds had healed. Perhaps they would have been more persuasive if their words weren\u2019t delivered in such a flat manner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve put past us,\u201d said guard John Wall, who was fined an undisclosed amount after yelling a profanity at Coach Scott Brooks during the heated practice. \u201cWe talked about it, apologized about it, kept it at that.\u201d\n\n[Wizards try to cast aside turmoil; Wall says he wants to stay]\n\nSaid Brooks, \u201cThis has happened many times, in all of sports and even the championship teams.\u201d\n\nNah, not normalizing it.\n\nOf course, teams fight. Sometimes it\u2019s good that they fight because it allows the air to clear. But the Wizards aren\u2019t some dominant squad that just got tangled up in their best intentions. They are a leaderless crew with a long history of chemistry problems, and now that they\u2019re playing lifeless basketball on the court, this was bound to happen. Their problems represent issues with status, privilege, trust and inequitable player management. Nothing galvanizes this team. There is simply no belief.\n\nWhile Brooks and the Wizards\u2019 maximum-contract trio of Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. attempted damage control, other people anonymously indicated that little has been resolved. Several people painted it as an issue of Wall against the rest of the locker room. There\u2019s a belief that Wall has been coddled for too long and that neither the coaching staff nor the front office can properly manage him.\n\n[\u2018I\u2019m sick of this\u2019: Wizards\u2019 dysfunction boils over at practice]\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s interesting to revisit a previous Washington Post report in which multiple people recalled Beal saying during the infamous practice that he\u2019s \u201csick of this s---\u201d before telling team President Ernie Grunfeld, \u201cIt starts at the top.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Beal was asked about the Wizards\u2019 culture. He hesitated at first before letting loose with a series of loose thoughts.\n\n\u201cI feel like our culture is what we created it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically tore the team apart and created a new team, starting with John as the foundation, and we created it into what we are now. We\u2019re a team that\u2019s a playoff team. You know, but we\u2019ve struggled. We\u2019ve had our fair share of struggles.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re a team that\u2019s not in unison. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re a team that hates each other. I say it every game: We\u2019re in the locker room, it\u2019s positive energy. It\u2019s not like I hate the next man and the next man hates that man. It\u2019s none of that. It\u2019s just figuring it out on the floor. We just can\u2019t seem to put it together right now.\u201d\n\n[Boswell chat: Don\u2019t let the Wizards ruin your day!]\n\nBreak Beal\u2019s comments into two parts. At first, in a nice way, he\u2019s saying the Wizards built the team around Wall, and the results are the results. Then he starts to generalize and smooth things over. Still, there\u2019s a strong insinuation from Beal that the Wizards have been intentional in everything they\u2019ve done, right and wrong, and that includes building around Wall without accounting for some of his shortcomings.\n\nSimply put, the Wizards have created a monster. Wall is not a bad guy. He should not be blamed for all of the team\u2019s flaws. But he suffers from entitlement. He thinks he can do whatever he wants, and when his four-year, $170 million \u201csupermax\u201d contract kicks in next season, he will be virtually untradeable. This is his team, which is great when he\u2019s playing like a top 15 NBA talent. But at his worst, it feels like Wall is squatting as the franchise player. He won\u2019t go. You can\u2019t make him go. You will do things his way.\n\nAnd that\u2019s part of why the Wizards are so inconsistent. Wall\u2019s focus and intensity wavers. He dominates the ball, and he is not as good as he once was at making other players better. Even as the Wizards try to adjust their style and encourage more ball movement, Wall, 28, is going to play his way. That was fine a few years ago when he was carrying some extremely limited squads. But right now, the Wizards are as deep and balanced as they\u2019ve been during his nine seasons. Nevertheless, Wall has yet to fully adjust.\n\nThe most troubling part of all the arguing last week is that it started with Wall being challenged, and what was his reaction? To recoil and curse out his coach. Until Brooks coaches him harder \u2014 until the front office creates an atmosphere of accountability in which it is easier to coach Wall harder \u2014 the Wizards won\u2019t excel. They might get out of their early-season hole and catch the last train to the playoffs with a .500 record. But considering that Wall, Beal and Porter have been together for six seasons, that\u2019s not worth celebrating. That\u2019s not even holding steady. That\u2019s nothing more than stagnant and shameful.\n\nThere should be more to the Wizards. There isn\u2019t. They are dead inside. They can wake up temporarily and mount an incredible comeback like they did during a 125-118 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. They can win a few games on talent, but when it gets hard, they show how empty they are.\n\nSo it would be foolish not to shake up this dynamic in a major way. It would be foolish not to make multiple deals between now and the February trade deadline. But with a roster full of big and undesirable contracts, it won\u2019t be easy without having a fire sale. And for as disappointing as the Wizards have been, they aren\u2019t in such a dire place that they should throw away two all-stars and a team that has made four playoff appearances in the past five seasons without establishing some kind of new direction.\n\nTo his credit, Wall wants to be a part of the solution.\n\n\u201cI love being a Wizard,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for nine years. It\u2019s where I want to finish my career.\u201d\n\nIn a league in which stars prematurely force their way out of difficult situations, it matters that Wall wants to remain in the District. It shows his character. Then again, he also likes being king. But his goal shouldn\u2019t be just to wear the crown. He needs to wear it with distinction. He needs to realize he rules a kingdom that no one currently respects.\n\nWill Wall do something about it? Or will something have to be done about him?\n\nWall still has a choice because the Wizards are wary of detonating this team. But listen to the ticking sound. One way or another, they\u2019re going to explode.\n\nFor more by Jerry Brewer, visit washingtonpost.com/brewer."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Kane", "title": "House Democratic leaders find strength in numbers to fight challenge to Pelosi", "description": "Once combatants, Reps.

Hoyer (Md.) and James E. Clyburn (S.C.) have cheered on great Democratic accomplishments and rallied after brutal elections. They have overseen great political victories and then clashed in bitter moments of personal enmity, with each angling to take another out of power at one time or another.\n\nThose old rivalries have been set aside, not necessarily forgotten, as they try to tamp down a rebellion of junior Democrats clamoring for new leadership.\n\nThis small but vocal bloc has made Pelosi its focal point, trying deny her return to the post of House speaker through a complicated parliamentary move. But the trio recognized that a threat to one is a threat to all, leaving the potential for all three party elders to get swept out.\n\nClyburn laid out the strategy most clearly Thursday after a two-hour caucus meeting when he declared his opposition to a fellow member of the Congressional Black Caucus floating a potential challenge to Pelosi for speaker.\n\n\u201cShe would be a threat to me, as well,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cBecause we put together a team, I\u2019m supporting that team, and that team is Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nHouse win unleashes majority-size ambitions among younger Democrats\n\nHoyer rejected the idea that the midterms were a call for a generational change in leadership, saying voters want \u201ca change in policies, not so much personalities or people.\u201d\n\nHe praised Pelosi\u2019s ability to count. \u201cIf she says she\u2019s got the votes, I wouldn\u2019t bet against her,\u201d Hoyer told CNN.\n\nPelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn have drawn support from vastly different wings of the caucus. This creates a natural tension but also explains why such a large majority of Democrats have been content to have each of them atop the caucus, a near-perfect reflection of the national party over the last few decades.\n\nPelosi, 78, has always commanded strong support from her state\u2019s massive delegation and liberal women in the House. Those two voting blocs have only grown stronger after this month\u2019s midterm elections crushed California Republicans and bolstered Democrats\u2019 female ranks to record levels.\n\nHoyer, 79, has been the natural ally of moderates from the suburbs and Midwestern Democrats who complain about the party\u2019s coastal elite lean. In the minority the past eight years, this ideological position seemed precarious, but \u2014 as always happens when Democrats claim the majority \u2014 those ranks are now swelling.\n\nAs majority whip from 2007 to 2011, Clyburn, now 78, hit the highest perch among members of the Congressional Black Caucus and is now on a path to become the first member to reclaim that powerful post.\n\nThis relative unity is a marked contrast to where things stood 12 years ago this month, the last time Democrats flipped seats and reclaimed the majority in a midterm election. Then, as Pelosi faced no internal opposition to becoming speaker, she turned her sights on Hoyer and tried to eject him from leadership.\n\nJust days before the secret ballot, Pelosi broke her silence and swung her full support behind then-Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), one of her closest allies, in his bid to defeat Hoyer for the majority leader post.\n\nIt shocked the caucus, but Hoyer routed Murtha, and afterward Pelosi tried to quickly settle the bitter dispute. \u201cLet there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with us. Let the healing begin,\u201d Pelosi said at the news conference.\n\nBoiling resistance to Trump produces Democrats\u2019 herbal tea party\n\nPelosi and Hoyer\u2019s relationship dates to their days as congressional aides in the same office in the 1960s, but the rivalry hit its peak in the late 1990s when they began campaigning against each other for a leadership post. That race came to fruition in 2001, when Pelosi defeated Hoyer handily and set herself on the path to take over the entire caucus in 2003.\n\nThose two races have left Pelosi and Hoyer in a knowing deadlock \u2014 he cannot beat her for the top spot, nor can she find anyone who could oust him as the No. 2 Democrat.\n\nIn recent days. Pelosi has touted the endorsements of Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) and Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), along with Katie Hill and Mike Levin, two Californians who won Republican-held seats and helped propel Democrats into the majority.\n\nWhat do all four have in common? They joined more than 150 Democrats last week in signing a letter endorsing Hoyer for majority leader.\n\nClyburn has always been the junior partner in the triumvirate, but he has had moments of ambition directed above. After the disastrous 2010 midterm elections, when Democrats lost 63 seats and the majority, Hoyer and Clyburn briefly squared off against each other.\n\nIn the minority, by tradition, there is one less leadership seat, leaving minority leader and minority whip. Hoyer had the edge over Clyburn, and rather than having a bitter clash, as in 2006, Pelosi created a new assistant leader position that Clyburn took.\n\nIn recent months, as some questioned whether Pelosi could win the speaker\u2019s race, Clyburn chafed at how few times he was mentioned as a successor.\n\n\u201cI would probably offer myself for the position. I\u2019m worthy of consideration,\u201d Clyburn told The Washington Post in late August.\n\nSo far, no challenger has emerged to face Pelosi. A potential candidate, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), endorsed Pelosi on Tuesday after the leader announced that the Ohio congresswoman would chair a subcommittee on elections. Clyburn beat back a challenge so quickly that he will now stand unopposed for whip in next week\u2019s leadership elections. The letter endorsing Hoyer last week made a challenge to him pointless.\n\nHis remarks 12 years ago sum up how the three feel now.\n\n\u201cIt was that a team that had been successful was asked to continue to do that job,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nNow, 12 years later, all three veterans are hoping that success keeps them doing that job.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Despite UN call for Yemen truce, new clashes around key port", "description": "Yemeni officials, witnesses: Fighting flares up again between Saudi-led coalition, Shiite rebels around port of Hodeida", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/despite-un-call-for-yemen-truce-new-clashes-around-key-port/2018/11/20/66f45c40-ed21-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:07:16Z", "content": "SANAA, Yemen Fighting between Saudi-led coalition forces and Yemens Shiite rebels flared up again around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida despite U.N. calls for a cease-fire, Yemeni officials and witnesses said Tuesday.

(Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 A leading international aid group said Wednesday that an estimated 85,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 may have died of hunger and disease since the outbreak of the country\u2019s civil war in 2015.\n\nSave the Children based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of severe acute malnutrition, or SAM, in young children. The United Nations says more than 1.3 million children have suffered from SAM since a Saudi-led coalition went to war with Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in March 2015.\n\nThe aid group said its \u201cconservative estimate\u201d was that 84,701 children may have died, based on historical studies that find that 20 to 30 percent of untreated cases lead to death. Save the Children says it calculated the figure based on the number of cases reported in areas where aid groups were unable to intervene.\n\n\u201cFor every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it\u2019s entirely preventable,\u201d said Tamer Kirolos, Save the Children\u2019s Yemen director. \u201cChildren who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop.\u201d\n\nThe war has given rise to the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Three-quarters of Yemen\u2019s people require life-saving assistance and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the fighting.\n\nThe Associated Press has reported from areas of Yemen that are on the brink of famine.\n\nSave the Children blamed the widespread starvation on a Saudi-led blockade that was tightened a year ago after the Iran-aligned rebels fired a ballistic missile at the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nThe charity also cited recent fighting in and around the port city of Hodeida, a lifeline through which Yemen imports some 70 percent of its food and humanitarian aid.\n\nIt said commercial imports through the rebel-held port have fallen by more than 55,000 metric tons a month \u2014 enough to meet the needs of 4.4 million people. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the northern Yemen through the southern port of Aden, slowing aid deliveries.\n\nThe overwhelming poverty in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s most impoverished nation, has compounded the situation.\n\nChildren \u201chave no access to food although it\u2019s available on the market .... families cannot provide for their children and cannot afford it,\u201d said Sukaina Sharafuddin, a Save the Children employee in Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa.\n\nThe fallout from the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom\u2019s Istanbul consulate has drawn renewed attention to the war and devastation in Yemen. The United States has scaled back its support for the coalition and called for a cease-fire by the end of this month.\n\nU.N. envoy Martin Griffiths says both sides have agreed to attend peace talks \u201csoon.\u201d Griffiths arrived in the Houthi-held Sanaa later Wednesday for meetings with rebels, including their leader, Abdul-Malek al-Houthi.\n\nBut the fighting is still raging in Hodeida and other areas, and previous peace efforts have failed to produce any agreement to stop the violence.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those Nations League group winners are sure of a place in a playoff round held in March 2020 regardless of their finish in the traditional qualifying groups.\n\nAnother quirk of Euro 2020 is there are 12 host countries \u2014 from Ireland in the west to Azerbaijan in the east \u2014 and none gets an automatic entry.\n\nHere is the Euro 2020 outlook:\n\nEURO 2020 QUALIFYING DRAW\n\nAll 55 teams in the Dec. 2 draw are seeded according to Nations League results.\n\nThey will be drawn into five groups of five teams and five six-team groups, with games played from March to November next year.\n\nThe Nations League top-tier group winners \u2014 Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England \u2014 must be in the smaller, five-team groups. They will play the Final Four tournament hosted by Portugal in June when others are playing Euro 2020 qualifiers.\n\nThe top two finishers in each group qualify automatically for Euro 2020.\n\nPot 1: Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Poland.\n\nPot 2: Germany, Iceland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Wales, Czech Republic.\n\nPot 3: Slovakia, Turkey, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Finland, Bulgaria, Israel.\n\nPot 4: Hungary, Romania, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Georgia.\n\nPot 5: Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus, Luxembourg, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Gibraltar, Faeroe Islands.\n\nPot 6: Latvia, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Malta, San Marino.\n\nEURO 2020 PLAYOFFS\n\nThe last four places at the tournament will be decided through a 16-team playoff, the format of which is completely new.\n\nFour teams from each of four Nations League tiers will play in a mini-tournament featuring semifinals and a final next March 26-31. The four winners advance to complete the 24-team Euro 2020 lineup.\n\nIf one of the Nations League group winners have already secured a spot, the next-best team in that tier will make the playoffs.\n\nIt is a golden opportunity for fourth-tier League D teams which are unlikely to qualify automatically.\n\nSo, one of Georgia, Macedonia, Kosovo or Belarus will make its tournament debut at Euro 2020. For Kosovo, it\u2019s a first entry in qualifying after gaining membership of UEFA and FIFA only in 2016.\n\nOther potential playoff lineups:\n\nLeague C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Finland.\n\nLeague B: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden.\n\nLeague A: Switzerland, Portugal, Netherlands, England.\n\n12 HOST COUNTRIES\n\nEuro 2020 will be hosted in 12 cities in 12 different countries, kicking off in Rome on June 12.\n\nIt was supposed to be 13 cities \u2014 each hosting three group-stage games plus a knockout game from the round of 16 or a quarterfinal \u2014 but Brussels dropped out when a new stadium project failed.\n\nThe semifinals and final were awarded to Wembley Stadium in London, which also stepped in to get the four Brussels games.\n\nHost nation teams who qualify will have at least two home games in the group stage.\n\nThe host city pairings are:\n\nGroup A: Rome, Italy; Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nGroup B: St. Petersburg, Russia; Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nGroup C: Amsterdam, Netherlands; Bucharest, Romania.\n\nGroup D: London, England; Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nGroup E: Bilbao, Spain; Dublin, Ireland.\n\nGroup F: Munich, Germany; Budapest, Hungary.\n\nRound of 16 games (June 27-30) will be in: London, Amsterdam, Bilbao, Budapest, Copenhagen, Bucharest, Glasgow, Dublin.\n\nQuarterfinals (July 3-4) will be in St. Petersburg, Munich, Baku, Rome.\n\nThe semifinals will be July 7-8 in London, and the final on July 12.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
