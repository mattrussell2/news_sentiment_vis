(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nGENEVA \u2014 England surged into the UEFA Nations League finals tournament on Sunday, and Belgium threw away its place in a stunning 5-2 loss at Switzerland.\n\nOn a day of come-from-behind wins and twisting fortunes for the World Cup\u2019s beaten semifinalists, England edged Croatia 2-1 to avenge defeat when the teams met in Russia in July.\n\nEngland had to beat Croatia to advance over group leader Spain and trailed late, before Jesse Lingard leveled in the 78th and captain Harry Kane got the decisive goal in the 85th.\n\nBelgium, which finished third in Russia, seemed certain to join England and host Portugal in the inaugural Final Four of world soccer\u2019s newest tournament in June.\n\nThe top-ranked team still needs a trophy to back up its status and eased into a quick 2-0 lead against Switzerland.\n\nNeeding to score at least four to advance, the Swiss got three by halftime and added two more later to shock the Belgians.\n\n\u201cToo many individual errors. I have no words,\u201d Belgium defender Toby Alderweireld said.\n\nThe group was settled on a head-to-head tiebreaker with both teams on nine points. Switzerland\u2019s three-goal margin outweighed Belgium\u2019s 2-1 win in Brussels last month.\n\nSunday\u2019s dramatic games between top 10-ranked teams added to the strong impression made by the first Nations League.\n\nUEFA created the competition \u2014 amid some skepticism given the busy soccer calendar \u2014 to replace mostly meaningless and unpopular international friendly games.\n\nIt gives unheralded national teams in the lower tiers a route to qualify for the European Championship through a subsequent playoff round.\n\nAt the top, the best national teams get guaranteed games against each other and fight for a trophy in the odd-numbered years between World Cups and Euros.\n\nPortugal, England and Switzerland will be joined in the Final Four by either France or the Netherlands. The Dutch will advance if they get at least a draw on Monday in Germany, which has already been relegated to the second tier.\n\nThe Nations League Final Four draw takes place Dec. 3 in Dublin.\n\nBELGIUM COLLAPSE\n\nBeaten by France in the World Cup semifinals, Belgium won the third-place game against England in Russia and made a smooth start to the Nations League.\n\nMany thought an overdue trophy could come next year for the so-called golden generation led by Eden Hazard, though missing the injured Kevin De Bruyne on Sunday.\n\nNot now.\n\nThorgan Hazard scored after 66 seconds and 17 minutes in Lucerne but, by halftime, Ricardo Rodriguez scored a penalty and forward Haris Seferovic struck twice to bring the Swiss within one goal of advancing. They got two more, both from headers gifted by poor Belgian marking.\n\nDefender Nico Elvedi scored to make up for a bad mistake gifting Hazard his early opener, and Seferovic clinched his first international hat trick in the 84th, winning over home fans who are often criticizing him.\n\nENGLAND RISING\n\nEngland started a tough three-team group with a home loss against Spain, and trailed again at Wembley Stadium on Sunday when Andrej Kramaric scored in the 57th. That result would have been enough for Croatia to advance, despite its opening 6-0 rout by Spain in September.\n\nThings can change fast in the rapid-fire Nations League groups, and England scored twice late on to win the group and condemn Croatia to relegation into the second tier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen (Wembley) like this in an England shirt,\u201d said Kane, captain of an England team riding a wave of acclaim and affection at home under coach Gareth Southgate.\n\nBELARUS ADVANCES\n\nIn League D, Belarus sealed winning Group 2 with a sixth straight shutout in a 2-0 win at San Marino, making Luxembourg\u2019s 1-1 draw at Moldova immaterial.\n\nBelarus joins Georgia in being promoted to League C in two years\u2019 time, and taking their places in the League D playoffs in March 2020.\n\nThose playoffs featuring the four fourth-tier group winners will send one of Europe\u2019s lowest-ranked teams to the 2020 European Championship tournament.\n\nThe other two playoff entries are decided Monday and Tuesday, with Macedonia and Kosovo currently leading their groups.\n\nIn other games Sunday, Austria won 2-1 at Northern Ireland in a League B group already won by Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nIn a League C group, Finland had already won promotion and Estonia was already relegated before the final round of games Sunday ended with Hungary beating Finland 2-0, and Greece losing 1-0 at home to Estonia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nRedskins quarterback Alex Smith will miss the rest of the season after breaking two bones in his right leg during Washington\u2019s 23-21 loss to Houston on Sunday.\n\nSmith fractured tibia and fibula bones on a sack by Texans defensive back Kareem Jackson midway through the third quarter. His distress was evident immediately; he glanced at his leg, its lower half and ankle bending in the wrong direction, and immediately threw off his helmet and put his hands over his face before he was attended to by trainers, who carted him from the field.\n\nThe team quickly announced that Smith was out with an ankle injury, and Coach Jay Gruden said after the game that Smith will require surgery, confirming he will miss the remainder of the year. He left FedEx Field via ambulance; CBS reported he was taken to Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center.\n\nSmith had led the team to a 6-3 record and entered the game with 2,045 passing yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\n[Redskins fall to Texans, 23-21]\n\n\u201cI played with him so long, he\u2019s like a brother,\u201d said tight end Vernon Davis, who played with Smith in San Francisco. \u201cTo see him go down and suffer is like, \u2018Why not me?\u2019 Maybe I should suffer and let him continue to go out there and do his job and help this team win. Because I know how bad he wants it. I know how much work he\u2019s put in. Starting from San Francisco, going to Kansas City. He\u2019s worked extremely hard. He\u2019s resilient. He\u2019s the most resilient person I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s been through so much.\n\nThe Redskins traded a third-round pick and cornerback Kendall Fuller to the Chiefs for Smith during the offseason. The organization then signed him to a four-year, $94 million extension.\n\n\u201cNow it becomes a situation where, of course we\u2019re playing for each other, but we\u2019re also playing for Alex,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe injury drew comparisons to the broken leg that Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann suffered in 1985. Theismann, at FedEx Field on Sunday, tweeted, \u201cAlex\u2019s leg is exactly like mine 33 yrs ago.\u201d\n\n[From 1985: Theismann breaks leg, lost for the season]\n\nTheismann\u2019s injury also took place on Nov. 18 and, in yet another eerie similarity, the final score of that Monday night game against the New York Giants was also 23-21 (though the Redskins won).\n\nThe Redskins trailed 17-7 at the time of Smith\u2019s injury. Backup quarterback Colt McCoy replaced Smith and led a comeback effort that fell two points short. Smith threw two interceptions against the Texans.\n\nTeammates and officials urgently signaled for the medical staff after Smith went down. It typically takes some time for a decision to be made on whether the cart will be necessary to transport an injured player off the field, but that was not the case Sunday for Smith.\n\n\u201cI know it was very painful for him and heartbreaking for a lot of people,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy and a hard worker and one of the key leaders on this football team. These things happen in pro football, unfortunately. You just hate to see them happen to a guy like Alex.\u201d\n\nTeammates were visibly shaken and players emptied the bench to give words of encouragement to Smith while he sat on the cart. Most of the Texans also left the bench to acknowledge their opponent. Smith waved to the crowd, placed his hand over his heart and made a praying-hands gesture to the stands as he rolled into the tunnel.\n\nRunning back Adrian Peterson, who has suffered season-ending ACL and neck injuries during his career, sympathized.\n\n[Exactly 33 years to the day, Theismann 'just so upset' about Smith injury]\n\n\u201cHe has to accept it for what it is and get his mind wrapped around it and look toward the recovery,\u201d said Peterson, a few feet from Smith when he was hit. The veteran running back knew immediately Smith\u2019s season would be over. \u201cThat has always been my No. 1 approach to those types of injuries. It\u2019s all about how your respond individually and the mind-set that you have going in to attack that type of recovery. He\u2019s going to have our support and our prayers go out to him and his family.\u201d\n\nColt McCoy is the only other quarterback on the roster and he quickly entered the game and threw a nine-yard touchdown to tight end Jordan Reed on the second play from scrimmage. He led another scoring drive to give Washington a brief 21-20 lead. McCoy completed 6 of 12 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 35 yards on five carries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been places where if the quarterback goes down,\u201d guard Tony Bergstrom said, \u201cit\u2019s like, shoot, might as well start trying for a draft pick. But we\u2019re in a spot where you couldn\u2019t ask for someone better to be out there. Colt would be starting in any other system.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change. Colt can do all the same things.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins will work out Mark Sanchez, T.J. Yates and E.J. Manuel on Monday, a person familiar with the team\u2019s front office decisions said.\n\nSanchez last played in 2016 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys and signed a one-year deal in 2017 with the Chicago Bears, in part, to help mentor Mitchell Trubisky. He was a four-year starter for the Jets after being selected No. 5 overall in 2009.\n\nYates started three games for the Texans last season, but has never been a full-time starter in the NFL. His best season came as a rookie in 2011 when he threw for 949 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions in six games.\n\nManuel played two games with the Oakland Raiders last season after a tumultuous four years in Buffalo after being the No. 16 overall pick in 2013. He was cut by the Raiders in September. Manuel threw for 1,972 yards with 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a 10-game starter in 2013.\n\nAnd any time a quarterback vacancy arises, former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s name is discussed. He last played a game in 2016 and many believe Kaepernick has been blackballed from the league for kneeling during the national anthem and speaking out against police brutality and racial inequality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be less workout related,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cMaybe more . . . familiarity with either [offensive coordinator Matt] Cavanaugh or [passing game coordinator Kevin] O\u2019Connell, maybe. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll take a look at the names, all talk about them and go from there.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "David Weigel", "title": "The Trailer: The Trailer: The voting wars aren't over.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Since 1976, Secretary of State Bill Gardner has overseen New Hampshire's elections from a cramped office in the state capitol, elected by the legislature every two years no matter which way the electoral winds blew. This week, Democrats took their first serious step toward removing him, as just 23 members of their incoming state House majority \u2014 one in 10 \u2014 voted to give Gardner another term.\n\nThe vast majority backed Colin Van Ostern, the 2016 Democratic nominee for governor, who challenged Gardner, who is also a Democrat, after the incumbent raised no objection to laws restricting student voting, and after he participated in President Trump's ill-fated \u201cvoter fraud\u201d commission.\n\n\u201cI know some may never forgive me for having done that,\u201d Gardner told reporters, \u201cbut it was better that New Hampshire be represented than not.\u201d\n\nThe heated battle for Gardner's job, which will conclude when the new legislature sits next month, is the next stage in what the election law guru Rick Hasen has dubbed the \u201cvoting wars.\u201d The legal battles in Florida and Georgia, which ended today with Republicans affirming their victories in close elections, were trial runs for the hardball legal strategies both sides plan to employ across the country in the 23 months before the next presidential election.\n\nThe project of electing and, in New Hampshire's case appointing, Democrats to state elections offices, and lifting the profile of those races and their issues, began 12 years ago. Democrats will hold 21 of those offices next year, up from 18 before the election, making three gains in swing states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, and Michigan.\n\nAs Democrats have amped up their approach to expanding voting rights, Republicans have seized on another strategy: attempting to undermine public confidence in voting systems and outcomes.\n\nRepublicans are increasingly comfortable making Trump-like arguments, accusing Democrats of working to rig elections. Before late-counted ballots pushed Democrat Gil Cisneros ahead in California's 39th District, Republican candidate Young Kim alleged \u201cfoul play,\u201d accusing Cisneros of \u201charassing and intimidating vote counters.\u201d In an op-ed, California RNC committeeman Shawn Steel referred to the Democrats' turnout surge with young voters as \u201cborderline fraudulent turnout rates outdoing dead voters in Chicago.\u201d Both had been in politics long enough to know that California's late-arriving ballots skew Democratic and neither put forth evidence backing up their allegations of fraud.\n\nUnder the flag of fighting \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d Republicans in key states have argued for new laws that restrict the ability of parties or third-party groups to turn in ballots or register voters. In Arizona, Republicans passed a law banning \u201cballot harvesting,\u201d the practice by which campaigns canvass voters who have not turned in mail ballots yet and offer to deliver them.\n\nThe Democratic response, which began in 2017 and will intensify, is to posit that anything less than an election system that allows for maximum turnout is tantamount to fraud. The hand-wringing about whether questioning an election's integrity will undermine voters' faith is over; Democrats start with the presumption that votes are being suppressed. That attitude is shared by every leading figure in the party, from DNC Chairman Tom Perez on down, with exceedingly little worry about whether that. too, might undermine confidence in voting.\n\nThose attitudes surfaced among both parties' candidates in the races where Democrats picked up elections offices. In Arizona, Democrat Katie Hobbs said that she would use the office to educate lower-propensity voters, such as former felons, on how to get the ballot; Republican Steve Gaynor promised to focus on stricter standards for voters, including ID requirements and a continued fight against \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, Democrat Jena Griswold pledged to oppose the Trump administration's hunt for \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d in a state where her Republican predecessor's cooperation with Trump had been a source of controversy. In Michigan, Democrat Jocelyn Benson ran on a memorable \"30-minute guarantee,\" saying it should take no longer than that for anyone to register a vehicle or to cast a vote. In swing states, from New Hampshire on down, Democrats are comfortable portraying elections themselves as under threat from Republicans who want to rig elections.\n\nThat's the argument that Stacey Abrams has taken national since her narrow defeat in the race for governor in Georgia. Historically, it's dangerous for politicians who might want to seek office again to cast doubt on the election they lost and demand a recount; the list of candidates who did so and emerged weaker in later elections includes Maryland's Ellen Sauerbrey, Florida's Jan Schneider and Virginia's Creigh Deeds.\n\nBut Abrams has used the days since the election to ask for testimony from voters who had trouble casting a ballot, and publicize cases in which they were stymied by long lines or in voter roll purges that proportionately punished minority voters more than whites. In a Sunday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Abrams repeatedly refused to say that former secretary of state Brian Kemp, her Republican opponent, had legitimately won the election.\n\n\u201cYes, when he takes the oath of office, he will be the legal governor of the state of Georgia,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cBut what you are looking for me to say is that there was no compromise of our democracy, and that there should be some political compromise in the language I use. And that's not right. What's not right is saying that something was done properly when it was not.\u201d\n\nNeither Abrams nor Florida's Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum, who also hopes to expand voting rights, will hold power in January. But House Democrats will, and they've signaled that they'll introduce legislation and hold hearings on voter suppression. On CBS's \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d incoming House Oversight chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said that \u201cwe cannot have a country where people are being blocked from voting,\u201d citing Georgia and Florida as the reason for further investigation.\n\nJust a few election cycles ago, Democrats hesitated to go this far as a party for fear of a backlash. That fear appears to have dried up. The long tail of the midterm recounts will be more pitched battles over voting rights, with Republicans continuing to defend laws that police the voting rolls and Democrats raising the specter of suppression to campaign for laws that would make voting easier.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker speaks at a get-out-the-vote event hosted by the N.H. Young Democrats at the University of New Hampshire in Durham in late October. (AP Photo/Cheryl Senter)\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 As Democrats seriously begin to explore presidential campaigns, they're circling around a New Hampshire that has changed dramatically since the last wide-open primary in 2008.\n\nOne: Independents, who can vote in either party's primary, will be more likely to pick a competitive Democratic race than a token primary against the Republican president. In 2008, both sides had competitive primaries.\n\nTwo: As many as three candidates might come from neighboring states: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.\n\nThree: The 2018 elections in this state went well for Democrats, elevating young party strategists who are, at the moment, up for grabs. Kari Thurman helped get Chris Pappas through an expensive primary and elect him to Congress; Erin Turmelle, a veteran of Hillary Clinton's campaign, was the party's political director for a breakout year; Nick Taylor, just 24 years old, helped design the campaign that flipped the state House.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that nobody's going to hire anybody in the early states until somebody else does,\" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley. \u201cOnce you start hiring, there's an expectation from people in the early states that they're going to get their calls returned and get their emails returned. I don't think there'd be any hires until the start of the year, but someone could surprise me.\"\n\nThe Democrats who have been in closest contact with New Hampshire political talent are seen as second- or third-tier presidential hopefuls; Sen. Jeff Merkley's (D-Ore.) name comes up often. A better measure of early interest has been party fundraising. At least three Democrats \u2014 Warren, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti \u2014 raised more than $100,000 for the party in 2018. When former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe helped launch a canvass but did not raise money, it got noticed.\n\nThe first party event of the cycle is set for Feb. 16, when Democrats hold a fundraising dinner in Manchester.\n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nA woman shows an 'I Voted' sticker at a polling station in Huntington Beach, Calif., one of the areas won by Democrats. (Photo by Mark RALSTON/AFP)\n\nOn Saturday night, the Associated Press called the close race in California's 39th District for Gil Cisneros. It was official: The next Congress would have no Republicans representing Orange County. Across the county, 524,083 votes (so far) have been counted for Democrats; 454,705 votes have been counted for Republicans.\n\nWhen you take a closer look at the numbers, two patterns emerge, both more complicated than a simple Democratic rout. One: In every close race, Democrats at least doubled their vote total from the last midterm, while Republicans' vote was only 30 percent higher than it was in 2014. Two: In every close race, Democrats won by getting fewer votes than Republicans received in these districts two years ago. The problem for Republicans: they got far fewer votes than in 2016.\n\nHere are the numbers, for comparison, from 2014 through this year.\n\nCalifornia 39\n\n2014\n\nEd Royce (R) - 91,319\n\nPeter Anderson (D) - 41,906\n\n2016\n\nEd Royce (R) - 150,777\n\nBrett Murdock (D) - 112,679\n\n2018\n\nYoung Kim (R) - 109,580\n\nGil Cisneros (D) - 113,075\n\nCalifornia 45\n\n2014\n\nMimi Walters (R) - 106,083\n\nDrew Leavens (D) - 56,819\n\n2016\n\nMimi Walters (R) - 182,618\n\nRon Varasteh (D) - 129,231\n\n2018\n\nMimi Walters (R) - 136,902\n\nKatie Porter (D) - 145,895\n\nCalifornia 48\n\n2014\n\nDana Rohrabacher (R) - 112,082\n\nSuzanne Savary (D) - 62,713\n\n2016\n\nDana Rohrabacher (R) - 178,701\n\nSuzanne Savary (D) - 127,715\n\n2018\n\nDana Rohrabacher (R) - 124,816\n\nHarley Rouda (D) - 141,903\n\nCalifornia 49\n\n2014\n\nDarrell Issa (R) - 98,161\n\nDave Peiser (D) - 64,981\n\n2016\n\nDarrell Issa (R) - 155,888\n\nDoug Applegate (D) - 154,267\n\n2018\n\nDiane Harkey (R) - 111,967\n\nMike Levin (D) - 139,763\n\nIf a Republican is looking for optimism, here it is: In 2016, each of these districts cast more votes for the incumbent Republican than were cast for Democrats two years later. At least the first three seats will remain top targets in 2020. But there may not be as much opportunity for a snapback as it looks. In each district, Democrats dramatically gained in voter registration from 2016 to 2018. And each district rejected Donald Trump's campaign in 2016, which was the reason Democrats targeted these races in the first place.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nWest Virginia State Sen.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nOn Saturday night, incoming members of Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib dialed in to a call organized by Justice Democrats, the not-quite-two-year-old insurgent group that had endorsed both of them. The message, in Ocasio-Cortez's words: \u201cThrow your hat in the ring.\u201d Both women urged left-wing, working-class candidates not just to run for office, but to challenge incumbents.\n\nAny threat to dislodge incumbents makes news, because it's so rarely done. Just two Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, defeated incumbent members of Congress in primaries this year. And importantly, both did so in safely blue districts; high-profile challengers in tough districts, such as Nebraska's Kara Eastman and Pennsylvania's Jess King, went down to defeat.\n\nSo, any 2020 wave of primaries is likely to focus on seats where a Democrat is favored to win the general election. Here are the Democrats being circled at the moment, and the reasons.\n\nRep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.). The 2016 Clinton margin in his district was 15.3 points, and Republicans made no effort to challenge him in 2018. That helped inspire a near-miss primary challenge by Marie Newman, a first-time candidate who has not ruled out running again. Lipinski, who was helped by antiabortion activists in the final stretch of the campaign, moved left on immigration and gay rights during the primary, but liberals still view him as vulnerable and unreliable.\n\nRep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). Clinton margin: 18.3 points. Nashville is getting bluer \u2014 Clinton outran Barack Obama's margins in this Nashville-based district \u2014 but it's represented by a member of the Blue Dog Coalition who casts protest votes for Speaker of the House. Cooper has dismissed and prevented threats to his job for years, but he raised less than $500,000 to secure his new term, making him an appealing target for a movement that can pile up millions of dollars.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.). Clinton margin: 19.8 points. Cuellar actually won his first race as the moderate challenger to a more liberal incumbent, after a mid-decade Republican gerrymander. He's one of just three Democrats who back a 20-week abortion ban, and he angered his party by helping Rep. John Carter (R-Tex.) fend off one of the year's strongest near-miss challenges, from a female Democrat.\n\nRep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.). Clinton margin 26.0 points. Lynch, one in a line of moderate, labor-backed Democrats who's held this Boston district, represents the bluest seat of any Democrat who opposed the Affordable Care Act. He held off two liberal challengers this year by 42 points, but two members of the Massachusetts delegation \u2014 Pressley and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) \u2014 got to Washington by ousting incumbents. Lynch is now seen by liberals as the most vulnerable member who no one has ever tried to challenge.\n\nRep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.). Clinton margin 78.2 points. The 77-year \u2014 old Democrat faced his first serious challenge this year from Anthony Clark, after trying to kick the insurgent off the ballot. Davis prevailed by 48 points, but he remains a special kind of primary target, the aging incumbent who does not make the sort of news or alliances that an Ocasio-Cortez does.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"Are the Democrats going to overthink themselves out of 2020?\u201d by Peter Hamby\n\nThe party is getting ready for an agonizing debate over the face it will present to America, and none of that may be necessary.\n\n\u201cStung by Trump and midterms, the Koch network changes its approach,\u201d by Will Lennon\n\nThe pre- and post-election attention paid to this cycle's megadonors obscured just how far the Koch network had pulled back.\n\n\u201cOrange County goes blue,\u201d by Mark Z.

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 The Lamar Jackson era arrived Sunday in Baltimore.\n\nOr Jackson made a successful first NFL start as a temporary fill-in for the injured Joe Flacco.\n\nThat can be sorted out later. For now, what matters is that Jackson, the quarterback chosen with the final pick of the first round of this year\u2019s NFL draft, had an eye-catching performance as a dual threat and kept the Ravens\u2019 season from unraveling any further. They beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 24-21, at M&T Bank Stadium to end a three-game losing streak and get back to .500.\n\n\u201cWe came out with a win,\u201d Jackson said when asked to assess his NFL starting debut. \u201cIt was pretty good, I guess.\u201d\n\nJackson was electrifying as a runner, with 117 rushing yards on 27 carries \u2014 an astounding volume for a quarterback. He was okay as a passer, connecting on 13 of 19 throws for 150 yards. He threw an interception and didn\u2019t have a touchdown pass. And that, combined with the 115 rushing yards on 17 carries provided by rookie running back Gus Edwards, was good enough for the Ravens.\n\n[Alex Smith will miss rest of season after suffering serious lower leg injury in loss to Texans]\n\nThey evened their record at 5-5 in a season in which they probably must reach the AFC playoffs to save the job of Coach John Harbaugh. This has been characterized as a win-or-else season for both Harbaugh and Flacco. But now even a postseason run might not be good enough to preserve the starting status of Flacco, the Super Bowl winner who was on the inactive list Sunday because of a hip injury.\n\nThat injury opened the door for Jackson to make his first NFL start. He was the last of the five quarterbacks taken in the opening round of this year\u2019s draft to do so. But unlike the New York Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold, the Buffalo Bills\u2019 Josh Allen, the Cleveland Browns\u2019 Baker Mayfield and the Arizona Cardinals\u2019 Josh Rosen, Jackson became the starter for a team with legitimate playoff aspirations.\n\n\u201cI thought he played spectacular,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI thought he played winning football. \u2026 For a first-time-out rookie in an environment like that to have all those operational things go well speaks to his intelligence, his studiousness, just his ability to run the show. After that, the playmaking, that comes from God.\u201d\n\nEventually, Harbaugh must decide whether to stick with Jackson as the starter or go back to Flacco. After the season, the Ravens will have to decide whether to trade Flacco and trust that Jackson can be the centerpiece of the offense.\n\nFor now, at least, Jackson is the starter. Harbaugh said he knew all week that would be the case for this game. There was a brief scare when stomach pain sent Jackson to the hospital Thursday, but he was back at practice Friday. Harbaugh acknowledged Sunday that it\u2019s unlikely Flacco will be ready to play this coming week.\n\nJackson showed Sunday that he clearly can give a defense trouble \u2014 particularly a unit with as many issues as Cincinnati\u2019s. The Bengals entered the game ranked last in the league in total defense and 31st in scoring defense, and Coach Marvin Lewis just had fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin and taken over control of the unit. Lewis also employed the help of Hue Jackson, the recently fired Browns head coach who joined Lewis\u2019s staff this week.\n\nThe Ravens tweaked their offensive approach, taking advantage of Jackson\u2019s running skills and trying to mask his inexperience in the passing game. Jackson made few risky throws down the field.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t envision the game being that close. \u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run the ball that much,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nThat approach probably is not sustainable, Harbaugh conceded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to take that many carries every week,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to be shooting for, by any stretch. But if it takes that many, we\u2019re going to do it. He took some hits. I thought that they knew the quarterback was running the ball. They were going after him a little bit, as you would expect. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to look at going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens ran the football on each of their first 13 plays Sunday. That included an 11-play touchdown drive on their opening possession on which Jackson ran for 46 yards on five carries. According to the NFL, it was the first time since 2003 that any team had no passing attempts on an opening scoring drive with at least 10 plays and covering at least 75 yards.\n\nA 56-yard field goal by Justin Tucker as time expired in the first half sent Baltimore to the locker room with a 13-7 lead. After the Bengals game back, the Ravens tied the game at 21 late in the third quarter on a touchdown and two-point conversion by Edwards. Tucker provided a go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter, and Baltimore held on from there, aided by a missed 52-yard field goal try by Cincinnati kicker Randy Bullock.\n\nThe Bengals, playing again without injured wide receiver A.J. Green, lost for the fourth time in five games to drop to 5-5. They\u2019re tied with the Ravens for second place in the AFC North. But the two teams emerged from Sunday\u2019s game with far different outlooks. For the Ravens, it was a day of optimism about what could be to come.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect. But it was us. It was the Ravens.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Spain beats Bosnia-Herzegovina 1-0 in friendly", "description": "Spain ended the year with a narrow 1-0 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in a friendly game on Sunday", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/spain-beats-bosnia-herzegovina-1-0-in-friendly/2018/11/18/6e5dc1bc-eb85-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:58:15Z", "content": "LAS PALMAS, Spain Spain ended the year with a narrow 1-0 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in a friendly game on Sunday.

Her speakership during the Obama presidency left a legacy of achievement in other areas as well, including a far-\n\nreaching reform of Wall Street regulation and a massive economic stimulus that helped save a collapsing economy.\n\nIt would be hard to find a more effective fundraiser for Democrats, and she just led her party to its largest House gains since 1974. Someone as canny and experienced as Pelosi would seem the natural choice to lead a House of Representatives that will, for at least two years, serve as the only check on a debased presidency and a supine, Republican-led Senate.\n\nOh, yes, and there is no obvious alternative to her leadership.\n\nThese are among the reasons Pelosi is the overwhelming choice of House Democrats to return as speaker, and why it\u2019s very hard to find anyone willing to bet against her.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nProblem No. 1: the rules. If the speakership were determined by a caucus vote, she\u2019d win easily. But on Jan. 3, 2019, the first vote of every member of the House will be for a new speaker. To win, a candidate needs a majority \u2014 218 if everyone votes, and fewer if some members abstain or stay away.\n\nPelosi\u2019s Democratic opposition has the power to vote for someone else in January, and they may be able to muster enough support to leave her with a plurality but not a majority. This would create a deadlock and lead to multiple ballots until someone won a majority. If you want to ponder the nightmare Democrats hope to avoid, consider that it took 133 ballots before Nathaniel Banks was elected speaker in 1856. No one expects anything that dramatic, but even just a few rounds of voting would court a return of the cliched headline the party loathes: \u201cDemocrats in disarray.\u201d\n\nProblem No. 2: Pelosi, after years of attacks from Republicans, polls badly enough that some freshmen Democrats promised voters they would oppose her election as speaker no matter what. There appear to be nine incoming freshmen who made hard commitments to vote against Pelosi, while other new members issued somewhat vaguer vows to support new leadership.\n\nThe 2018 national exit poll found that only 31 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of Pelosi, while 56 percent had a negative view. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who ran against Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 \u2014 he got 63 Democratic caucus votes to her 134 \u2014 argues that \u201cit\u2019s just not smart strategy\u201d to burden the party\u2019s candidates with a leader who polls so badly and requires so many of them to disown her. He\u2019s talking up the virtues of his Ohio colleague, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, who is pondering entering the contest.\n\nPelosi\u2019s defenders reply that only a weak and foolish party would let the GOP onslaught influence its choice: Republicans vilify her because they fear her effectiveness. And there is the fact that Pelosi is the first woman to serve as speaker of the House. Her supporters are not shy about calling out opponents, inside the party and out, as sexist.\n\nProblem No. 3: The top three Democrats in the House are old in a party that increasingly relies on younger voters. Pelosi is 78, as is the No. 3 in the leadership, Rep. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. The No. 2, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, is 79.\n\nThe bottom line: Despite these problems, most in the party keep coming back to Pelosi as the right leader for the moment. This is one reason she has been able to rally so many endorsements from activist groups that might in other circumstances be part of an insurgency.\n\nA former House staffer not associated with the Pelosi camp noted another factor that may work in her favor: frustration and concern among some new members that the party might bog itself down in a divisive, inward-looking struggle when its focus should be on legislating \u2014 and containing President Trump.\n\nPelosi is understandably reluctant to become an instant lame duck by promising to leave by the end of this term. But her frequent descriptions of herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d figure point to how this contest is likely to be resolved. Democrats need her experience now. They also need the promise of change. Here\u2019s betting that if anyone can figure out how to bring these clashing impulses together (and also survive Trump\u2019s tweeted Saturday morning \u201cendorsement\u201d), it\u2019s Pelosi. Think of this as the supreme test of her wizardry.\n\nRead more from E.J.

Schiff (Calif.) as \u201clittle Adam Schitt\u201d in a tweet.\n\nIn the weeks since Trump forced Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general and chose Whitaker to serve as his interim replacement, Whitaker has faced calls from Democrats to recuse himself from oversight of the investigation, given his previous criticism of the inquiry. Trump said in Sunday\u2019s interview that he \u201cdid not know [Whitaker] took views on the Mueller investigation as such\u201d before he appointed him.\n\nTrump essentially shut the door to sitting down with Mueller, telling host Chris Wallace that his written answers mean \u201cprobably this is the end\u201d of his involvement in the inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably: We\u2019re finished,\u201d Trump said. He said that he had given \u201cvery complete answers to a lot of questions\u201d and that \u201cthat should solve the problem.\u201d\n\nTrump said Friday that he had answered written questions from Mueller \u201cvery easily.\u201d The president told Wallace in Sunday\u2019s interview that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a big deal\u201d and that he expects his legal team to submit the answers \u201cat some point very soon.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s answers had long been sought by Mueller during the inquiry, which began 18 months ago. The investigation has led to charges against 32 people, including 26 Russians. Although four Trump aides have pleaded guilty to various charges, Mueller\u2019s team has not indicated whether it thinks Trump associates conspired with Russians or whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring Justice Department leaders.\n\nKey lawmakers also weighed in on Whitaker on Sunday.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Whitaker \u201cwas chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation\u201d and that he \u201cshould have absolutely nothing to do\u201d with the inquiry. Schiff also said Whitaker should be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n\u201cHe auditioned for the part by going on TV and saying he could hobble the investigation,\u201d Schiff said, calling Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional and \u201can attack on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nTrump fired back in a tweet Sunday afternoon in which he said that Mueller had not been confirmed by the Senate, either. However, Mueller, unlike the attorney general, is not a Cabinet-level official; he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, and his role does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nMueller was twice confirmed by the Senate to serve as FBI director \u2014 in 2001 and 2011.\n\n\u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d Trump said , misspelling Schiff\u2019s last name.\n\nThe lawmaker responded sarcastically in a tweet: \u201cWow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one. Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, or did you write this one yourself?\u201d\n\nSome Republicans on Sunday were focusing on Whitaker\u2019s potential successor. Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.) said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Whitaker \u201cseems to be a person who has the ability to do that acting job\u201d but that the Justice Department needs a permanent leader as soon as possible.\n\nBlunt, a member of the Senate GOP leadership who sits on the Intelligence Committee, said it would be a \u201chuge mistake\u201d for Trump to try to end the Mueller inquiry.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s wide-ranging interview, Trump said that he is thinking about replacing people in \u201cthree or four or five positions\u201d in his administration and that of those, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s going to end up being two.\u201d He declined to say whether Chief of Staff John F. Kelly will remain in his job through 2020, as previously indicated, saying only, \u201cI mean, it could be. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen but also said he wants her to \u201cget much tougher.\u201d He has voiced dissatisfaction about Nielsen\u2019s performance on immigration enforcement and has told advisers that he has decided to remove her in the coming weeks.\n\nThe president said that despite Republicans\u2019 loss of at least three dozen seats in the House, their holding on the Senate was \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201ca tremendous victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run.

Eight of them qualified this weekend, the penultimate round of games, led by former champions Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Algeria.\n\nNigeria is back at the tournament \u2014 for the first time since it won the title in 2013 \u2014 after a 1-1 draw with South Africa in Johannesburg on Saturday. A Nigerian state governor promised the team $25,000 for every goal in the crucial game but one was enough as Nigeria secured the point it needed to guarantee it one of the two qualifying places from the group.\n\nIvory Coast, the 2015 African champion, made sure of its place despite an underwhelming qualification campaign when it drew 1-1 in Guinea on Sunday. The result qualified both teams. Morocco\u2019s place was confirmed after Malawi surprisingly lost 2-1 in Comoros. That eliminated the Malawians and caused their federation head, Walter Nyamilandu, a newly elected member of the FIFA Council, to complain about the makeup of the Comoros squad.

Although it\u2019s a \u201chome\u201d game for Libya, the North Africans haven\u2019t played on home soil for five years because of the conflict, instead holding their home games in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLUCERNE, Switzerland \u2014 Top-ranked Belgium fell to a stunning 5-2 loss against Switzerland on Sunday, with Haris Seferovic\u2019s hat trick lifting his team into the UEFA Nations League finals.\n\nBelgium led 2-0 after 17 minutes thanks to Thorgan Hazard\u2019s two goals and was cruising toward the inaugural Final Four mini-tournament to be hosted by Portugal in June.\n\nOnly defeat by a two-goal margin could stop Belgium winning the group \u2014 and a Swiss team inspired by Xherdan Shaqiri hit back with five unanswered strikes, including three by halftime.\n\n\u201cWe all disappeared from the match suddenly,\u201d Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said. \u201cIt leaves us with a lousy feeling.\u201d\n\nThe shock was on in the 62nd minute when defender Nico Elvedi made up for a bad early error to put Switzerland 4-2 up with a glancing header.\n\nSeferovic sealed the victory by getting his third with a header in the 84th after Shaqiri\u2019s trickery set up Kevin Mbabu for a cross.\n\nSwitzerland won Group 2 in League A on the head-to-head record because both teams had nine points from four games, and Belgium beat the Swiss by just 2-1 in Brussels last month. Iceland placed last and is relegated.\n\nThe tiebreaker option seemed moot when Thorgan Hazard scored after 66 seconds and again in the 17th minute.\n\nBut Switzerland struck three times in an 18-minute spell before halftime, and kept up the pressure in the second half.\n\nA wild match played out in a noisy, intimate 16,000-capacity stadium in Lucerne gave Swiss fans what they looked for after an infuriating World Cup exit in July, in a lackluster 1-0 Round of 16 loss to Sweden.\n\nThe game also recalled Belgium\u2019s stunning 3-2 comeback win over Japan in its World Cup round of 16 \u2014 only this time it was the Red Devils wasting a two-goal lead.\n\nBelgium quickly led when captain Eden Hazard\u2019s brother Thorgan seized on a bad mistake. Thorgan Hazard had been offside when a forward pass went directly to Elvedi, but the defender misplayed the ball behind him into space. Thorgan Hazard, now onside because of the opponent\u2019s pass, pounced to flick the ball over goalkeeper Yann Sommer.\n\nIn the 17th, Thorgan Hazard was allowed to move into the Swiss penalty area and fired an angled shot past Elvedi and the diving Sommer, his teammates at Borussia Moenchengladbach.\n\nSwitzerland now had to score at least four goals to edge the tiebreaker \u2014 and had three by halftime.\n\nA penalty by Ricardo Rodriguez in the 26th was awarded for Nacer Chadli\u2019s foul on right-back Mbabu. Minutes later Rodriguez crossed for Shaqiri to guide a header across the goalmouth for Seferovic to tap in as Courtois scrambled in vain.\n\nSeferovic then swept in a curling shot with his weaker right foot. He now has 17 goals for Switzerland one year after he was booed off the field by home fans in a World Cup playoff despite the team advancing.\n\nBelgium\u2019s capitulation had echoes of a 3-1 loss to Wales in the Euro 2016 quarterfinals. It leaves this team still seeking a trophy to justify the \u201cGolden Generation\u201d label that is often a curse in world soccer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For governor, White voted for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey because he likes many of the things the governor has done so far, including responding to public pressure to increase teachers\u2019 wages.\n\nEven at a time of intense political division in the country \u2014 when it seems as if every voter is firmly planted in one political tribe or another \u2014 there are still hundreds of thousands of voters like White who cast votes for both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cI really think that most people are toward the middle \u2014 I don\u2019t think most of us are far left or far right,\u201d said White, 59, a recently retired electrical engineer and independent who lives 15 miles north of the Mexican border. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on each person to do their own research and not be a sheep.\u201d\n\nOf the more than 2.3 million Arizonans who voted in the midterm election, roughly 188,000 appear to have voted for Democrat Sinema and Republican Ducey. Maricopa County, Arizona\u2019s most populous county and home to Phoenix and its suburbs, also split its votes overall.\n\nAlthough Ducey was easily reelected, Sinema won by just under 54,000 votes out of more than 2.3 million cast, so those split-ticket voters played a major role in the outcome. Democratic and Republican strategists say that although they started in different camps, Sinema and Ducey both found victory by being aggressively moderate and presenting themselves as problem solvers, not partisans.\n\n\n\nRandall White, a split-ticket voter, with his dog, Sirius, in Hereford, Ariz. (Dominic Valente/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI think that resonated with a lot of voters,\u201d said Chad Campbell, a Democratic strategist in Arizona who said he was surprised by the number of \u00adsplit-ticket voters and wonders if the intense partisanship in the country has actually \u201creinvigorated the middle.\u201d\n\nHe imagines split-ticket voters casting their ballots and reasoning: \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for these two quote-unquote moderates and maybe they can get something done.\u201d\n\nA handful of other states also elected leaders from a mix of parties \u2014 and had basically the same rate of split-ticket voting that they did during the last major election in 2016, despite assumptions that the intense polarization in the country could dramatically lessen the number of those voters.\n\nMassachusetts, Maryland and Ohio also elected Republican governors and Democratic senators. In Massachusetts and Maryland, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats in U.S. House races \u2014 as did voters in Vermont, where its Republican governor also won reelection. Iowa voters elected a Republican governor, along with Democrats to three of their four House seats, baffling many political strategists. John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster, noted Iowa\u2019s new governor is a Republican woman and the two newly elected members of Congress are Democratic women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like gender ticket splitting,\u201d said Anzalone, a partner at ALG Research, which worked on two races in Iowa, Sinema\u2019s campaign in Arizona and a number of others.\n\nEven in states where one party eventually won all or most major statewide races, there was often variance between the amount of support the winners received, another indication of split-ticket voters.\n\nIn Texas \u2014 where Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke actively tried to woo Republican voters \u2014 Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won by a nearly 220,000 vote margin. But the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won by 1.1 million votes. In both races, about 8.3 million Texans cast ballots.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin won by more than 288,000 votes while Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers won by roughly 30,600 votes. And in Minnesota \u2014 which had two Senate elections this year to fill the seat vacated by Al Franken (D), who resigned amid accusations of sexual misconduct \u2014 Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) won 51 of the state\u2019s 87 counties, including many in rural and conservative parts of the state, while Sen. Tina Smith (D) won 20 counties and received 195,000 fewer votes than Klobuchar. Minnesota\u2019s Democratic candidate for governor, Tim Walz, similarly won 22 counties.\n\n\u201cThere was clearly a set of voters who have a special feeling for and relationship with Amy Klobuchar, so they crossed over to vote for Amy and then returned to their party for all of the other races,\u201d said Jeff Blodgett, a Democratic strategist in the state, who noted that Klobuchar frequently campaigns in rural parts of the state, far from the major metropolitan areas where Democrats usually focus.\n\nStrategists say voters also seem to have different motivations as they pick which politicians they want to send to Washington, where many assume not much will get done, and which ones they want running their state and making decisions on taxes, the state budget and education that they feel have more impact on their lives. A vote for a politician headed to Washington was often closely tied to a voter\u2019s feelings about President Trump, while many gubernatorial candidates were able to distance themselves from the polarizing president.\n\nAnzalone, the pollster, cautions that there are variables to explain many of these splits beyond Americans seeing past party, including a big one: Some of the races that attract split-ticket votes aren\u2019t especially competitive, making it easier easy for a Republican to contemplate casting a ballot for a Democrat or vice versa.\n\nAs Anzalone pointed out, the top two Democratic candidates in Florida\u2019s highly competitive races \u2014 Andrew Gillum, who was running for governor, and Sen. Bill Nelson \u2014 both got about the same number of votes despite being far different in style and ideology.\n\nIn Arizona, Sinema ran on a militantly moderate message aimed at winning over independents and Republicans \u2014 even though she started her career as a Green Party spokeswoman, was an antiwar activist in the 2000s and once considered herself the most liberal member of the Arizona legislature.\n\nBut Sinema has moderated her positions over the years, especially after being elected to the U.S. House in 2012. In her campaign to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, she rejected many of the liberal stances that other Democrats have championed, including expanding access to Medicare to all Americans.\n\nIn her victory speech, delayed by an extended vote count, Sinema praised the late Republican senator John McCain, who she said \u201ctaught us to always assume the best in others, to seek compromise instead of sowing division and to always put country ahead of party.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe, from the very onset, did not run a progressive campaign,\u201d said J. Charles Coughlin, a GOP strategist in Arizona. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take the bait of the left, and she didn\u2019t take the bait of the right and bash Trump.\u201d\n\nSinema had the advantage of not having a contentious primary \u2014 unlike her opponent, Republican Rep. Martha McSally, who was dragged through a particularly nasty one that forced the congresswoman to closely align herself with Trump.\n\nMcSally continued that messaging in the general election, abandoning Republican voters more in line with Flake and McCain, both longtime critics of the president.\n\nThe gubernatorial race was almost the reverse of the Senate contest. Democrat David Garcia, a Latino Army veteran, college professor and education activist, ran on a sharply liberal platform in which he proposed \u201creplacing\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a different agency and taxing the richest 1 percent of Arizonans to raise money for public schools \u2014 positions Democrats cautioned were too liberal for the state.\n\nDucey\u2019s campaign says it heeded early warning signs that many women, especially those in the suburbs, would turn out in record numbers to vote for Democrats. Those voters became the campaign\u2019s No. 1 target.\n\nWhen volunteers working at phone banks learned one of these voters was undecided, the campaign would mail her a letter from Arizona first lady Angela Ducey, explaining her husband\u2019s positions. The governor focused on touting that he increased the pay of teachers \u2014 although critics accuse him of doing so too late and only under political pressure \u2014 and promising to secure the border without using the phrase \u201cillegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe result appealed to voters who also sided with Sinema \u2014 in each case choosing the candidate who appeared more reasonable.\n\nWhite \u2014 the Ducey-Sinema voter who lives in southern Arizona \u2014 said that whenever he heard Republicans talking about protecting the border, he knew they were trying to stir the same emotions that Trump capitalized on in 2016. White, who voted for Hillary Clinton because of Trump\u2019s demeanor, said he has had less and less reason to vote for Republican candidates since Trump, and Trump acolytes, began dominating the party.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans only offered fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the only thing they offered \u2014 fear of immigration, fear of your guns being taken away. It was the only thing they ran on, fear of everything.\u201d\n\nDucey\u2019s warnings of danger at the border were almost enough to lose White\u2019s vote, but the retiree felt as though the Democratic candidate, Garcia, didn\u2019t provide a clear vision for the future. White, who said he wishes more voters would decide the way he does, plans to carefully monitor Sinema and Ducey over the next few years and is prepared to vote for someone else if they fall short of his expectations.\n\n\u201cIf these people knew that their jobs were on the line, they would do better,\u201d he said of politicians in general. \u201cThey don\u2019t care what their constituents think.\u201d\n\nScott Clement and Emily Guskin contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Rhodes scholar class features plenty of women, immigrants - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Rhodes scholar class features plenty of women, immigrants Washington Post BOSTON \u2014 The latest crop of U.S. Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year's recipients of the prestigious scholarship to \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/latest-us-rhodes-scholar-class-includes-more-women-that-ever/2018/11/18/5669a13e-eb30-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:33:45Z", "content": "BOSTON The latest crop of U.S. Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this years recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes \u2026 [+2972 chars]", "fulltext": "This September 2018 photo provided by Louis-Henri Merino shows Alaleh Azhir in Los Angeles.

Inside the room behind him, doctors had told him his quarterback, Alex Smith, had fractured the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg and would be headed to immediate surgery.\n\nAs Gruden walked, his eyes stared at nothing in front of him. He let out a deep breath. Smith had gone down midway through the third quarter on a sack from Houston\u2019s Kareem Jackson, his leg breaking in such a grotesque manner that it provided an eerie reminder of another Redskins quarterback, Joe Theismann, 33 years to the day since his own gruesome leg injury. Anyone who watched Gruden making this postgame walk had to wonder whether the season was crumbling before him.\n\n\u201cTo Dallas,\u201d he said when asked where his mind turns now.\n\n[Exactly 33 years since his own gruesome injury, Joe Theismann \u2018just so upset\u2019 for Alex Smith]\n\nSunday\u2019s loss to Houston left Washington 6-4, and its starting quarterback is lost for the season. The combination makes Thursday\u2019s Thanksgiving game against the Dallas Cowboys perhaps its most important of the season as the Redskins cling precariously to a one-game lead in the NFC East over the Cowboys, the team\u2019s biggest rival.\n\n\u201cIt just breaks your heart,\u201d he said of Smith, the quarterback the team wanted most this offseason when it let Kirk Cousins leave in free agency and to whom the franchise gave $94 million to lead its offense through 2022. \u201cPhysically, he\u2019ll be fine. Mentally, he\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s just hard to watch that happen to any athlete on the football team.\u201d\n\n1 of 29 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The best photos from the Redskins? 23-21 home loss to the Houston Texans View Photos The Redskins fall to 6-4 on the season.

Players looked around with somber faces. There was none of the shouting that sometimes even follows a loss. Everyone knew how badly Smith was hurt and how devastating the loss of a quarterback is to a team.\n\n\u201cIt hurts to watch it,\u201d center Chase Roullier said.\n\nBut football is a game that does not mourn injured players long. And lost in the despair of watching Smith disappear into the tunnel on the back of a cart was the fact that the Redskins nearly came back and won this game. At the time Smith went down, they were trailing 17-7 to one of the NFL\u2019s best defensive teams. Smith already had been intercepted twice , and the first of those interceptions had been returned 101 yards for a touchdown by the Texans\u2019 Justin Reid. Smith, himself, had a quarterback rating of 29.1 for the day and was having one of his worst games in what has been a slow start with a new team.\n\n\u201cWhenever someone goes down, the next man has to come up, step up for him,\u201d said tight end Vernon Davis, the player who knows Smith the best from years they played together in San Francisco.\n\n[As Colt McCoy takes over as starting QB, he tells Redskins, \u2018You\u2019re in good hands with me\u2019]\n\nAnd backup Colt McCoy ran onto the field after the Redskins got the ball back with an interception at the Houston 27. Once a star at the University of Texas and considered a possible quarterback of the future for the Cleveland Browns, the 32-year-old McCoy has been the Redskins\u2019 emergency option at quarterback since he played five games in the team\u2019s lost season of 2014.\n\n\u201cYou pray for opportunities to get to play,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cYou never like to see how it happened today, but for me I just have to go out there and give it all I got.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get this win\u201d is all Gruden told him.\n\nMcCoy ran for four yards on his first play Sunday. Then he lofted a pass that landed in the arms of tight end Jordan Reed, who streaked across the back of the end zone for a nine-yard score, cutting Houston\u2019s lead to 17-14. After a Texans field goal, McCoy then led a drive of 67 yards over the course of 4:22, hitting Reed and wide receivers Josh Doctson and Trey Quinn with quick passes and running 15 yards himself, setting up a seven-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson that put the Redskins up 21-20.\n\nIt was Peterson\u2019s second touchdown run of the day, and in addition to putting the Redskins ahead, it marked the first time all season the lead had changed in a Washington game.\n\nA crowd that filled two-thirds of FedEx Field roared with hope. Arms waved. Fans sang. It was probably as loud as the stadium has been all season.\n\nAnd then the great comeback ended.\n\n[Redskins-Texans takeaways: Houston hangs on for 23-21 win]\n\nThe Texans moved 47 yards on eight plays, allowing kicker Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn to hit a 54-yard field goal that put Houston ahead for good.\n\nWashington\u2019s final two drives could not bring magic Sunday. Taking over with 52 seconds left on the Washington 35, McCoy (who had 54 yards passing and 35 rushing) moved the Redskins to the Houston 45. Out of timeouts with eight seconds left in the game, Gruden mulled his options: a throw to the end zone or a 63-yard field goal attempt. After conferring with special teams coach Ben Kotwica, he turned over his shoulder to kicker Dustin Hopkins.\n\n\u201cDo we have a shot?\u201d Gruden asked Hopkins.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got a shot,\u201d Hopkins replied.\n\nHopkins thought he had hit his kick well. The ball climbed high and straight toward the goal posts, but he noticed the ball was flying too high. It wasn\u2019t moving far enough. He turned his head before the game-winning attempt fell short. Much like Smith\u2019s injury, which many Redskins said they will avoid replays of, it wasn\u2019t worth watching.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to change anything,\u201d Gruden said about the team\u2019s offense going forward. \u201cI think [McCoy] and Alex have very similar skill set, so [the] offense won\u2019t change. That\u2019s the good thing. [We] will continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing and build off the things we\u2019ve done well.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "India's top court ruled that women can enter a prominent temple.

More than 15,000 police officers monitored the area and devotees filed through a thicket of barricades to reach the shrine.\n\nThe heavy security had a single purpose: preparing for the moment when women once barred from the temple might attempt to enter.\n\nIt has been more than 50 days since India\u2019s Supreme Court issued a historic ruling giving all women the right to worship at the Sabarimala temple, a centuries-old shrine that sits inside a tiger reserve in the state of Kerala and draws tens of millions of visitors a year. The temple is devoted to Lord Ayyappa, a god considered celibate, and women of menstruating age had been prohibited from entering.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling set off intense protests in Kerala and became a crucible for women\u2019s rights, religious belief and state power in India. Since the verdict, no woman between the ages of 10 and 50 has managed to enter the temple, despite at least a dozen attempts. Meanwhile, women who have publicly stated their intention to visit the shrine have faced intimidation and threats.\n\nOn Friday evening, the temple marked the start of its main two-month-long pilgrimage season, after previously opening for two short stretches in October and November. Trupti Desai, an activist from the state of Maharashtra, had announced that she would arrive in Kerala early Friday with several other women and that they would attempt to enter the temple the following day.\n\nDesai never made it out of the airport in the city of Kochi, which is nearly 100 miles from the temple. Taxi drivers refused to pick up Desai and her group, fearing possible violence directed at them. A crowd of more than 1,000 protesters assembled outside the exits to the airport, clapping and chanting hymns to Ayyappa, preventing Desai from leaving the arrivals area.\n\n\n\nIndian Hindu devotees and activists arrive to take part in protest Saturday against the Supreme Court verdict revoking a ban on women's entry to the Sabarimala hilltop temple. (Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMany of the protesters were women opposed to the Supreme Court\u2019s interference in matters of Hindu observance. This protest is about \u201csaving our faith and that is why I came,\u201d said Indira Krishnakumar, who traveled to the airport from the nearby city of Ernakulam. If these women \u201care to reach the temple, they will have to walk over our bodies.\u201d\n\nBut the protests are also political. The Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 which holds power at the national level but only a single seat in the Kerala legislature \u2014 has seized on the temple controversy as a chance to present itself as the defender of Hindus and their faith. The BJP\u2019s leader in Kerala earlier this month called the issue a \u201cgolden opportunity.\u201d At Friday\u2019s protest at Kochi airport, several state BJP leaders delivered speeches. Eventually, after being stuck for the entire day, Desai boarded a flight back to Maharashtra but vowed to return.\n\n[Kerala, one of the few places where a communist can still dream]\n\nSo far, the state government in Kerala has pledged to uphold the court\u2019s verdict but has refrained from enforcing it fully, fearing clashes between protesters and police officers. Last month, the police arrested more than 2,000 protesters at Sabarimala. On Saturday, they arrested the leader of a right-wing Hindu group who had arrived at the temple in the middle of the night in defiance of official restrictions. They also arrested a senior BJP leader.\n\nPolice say that about 800 women between the ages of 10 and 50 have registered online to visit the shrine during the pilgrimage season, but none so far have requested official protection for the trek, which involves a nearly three-mile walk to reach the temple. Temple authorities, meanwhile, intend to ask the Supreme Court on Monday for more time to implement the verdict. The Supreme Court has also agreed to hear petitions challenging its ruling in January.\n\n\n\nMembers of Indian right-wing group Hindu Sena shout slogans in New Delhi as they protest against the Supreme Court decision to allow women of all ages to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple. (Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn Saturday, to reach the temple, devotees braved bus delays and a call by right-wing Hindu groups to close all roads, shops and businesses. \u201cIt is sad that Lord Ayyappa had become [the center] of a controversy, but he will be here with us every step of the way,\u201d said Bhagyalakshmi, a 62-year-old devotee who uses only one name. She declined to give her views on the conflict but said that she is positive that whatever happens will be the god\u2019s will.\n\nYounger women devotees are still awaiting their chance. Reshma Nishanth, a 32-year old teacher from the city of Kannur in Kerala, has spent recent weeks making the traditional preparations for the Sabarimala pilgrimage, including observing a 41-day fast. But after she announced her intention to make the sacred journey, activists from right-wing Hindu groups came to her house and even followed her to the railway station Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt has become more and more difficult with [these] hooligan elements,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who create violence in the name of God are not devotees at all.\u201d\n\nSlater reported from New Delhi.\n\nRead more:\n\nGay sex, adultery, women\u2019s rights: India\u2019s Supreme Court is taking on the patriarchy\n\nWomen fight for access to sacred places in India\n\nIn India\u2019s new hit film, men \u2014 not women \u2014 are afraid to roam the streets\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/helena.andrews.77", "title": "At the 'Becoming' book tour, you can snag a candle, a onesie and get to know the real Michelle Obama - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post At the 'Becoming' book tour, you can snag a candle, a onesie and get to know the real Michelle Obama Washington Post \u201cT-shirts and tote bags, ladies,\u201d called a part-time businessman, brandishing an arm heavy with Michelle Obama's smiling face.\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/11/18/becoming-book-tour-you-can-snag-candle-onesie-get-know-real-michelle-obama/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T21:09:53Z", "content": "T-shirts and tote bags, ladies, called a part-time businessman, brandishing an arm heavy with Michelle Obamas smiling face.

Is it when it\u2019s selling out basketball arenas and not dwindling book stores? Check. When the tickets are going for hundreds, if not thousands of dollars? Check. When most of the crowd hasn\u2019t even read the book yet? When white parents are bringing their 10-year-olds as a treat (and a lesson), and grown black women are bringing their 70-year-old mothers for the same reason? Check and check.\n\nInside the arena, Michelle Obama\u2019s personal playlist was blasting \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9, Janet Jackson, Alessia Cara, Mary J. Blige \u2014 while photos of her through the years flashed across the big screens. Thirty minutes after the event was supposed to begin, a line of attendees was still around the block. Meanwhile, the crowd indoors was whipped into a frenzy with a video montage of Mrs. Obama\u2019s greatest dancing hits \u2014 with talk show host Jimmy Fallon, Barack Obama and that one time with a turnip. It\u2019s Michelle Obama or bust.\n\n\n\nThe crowd watches Michelle Obama in conversation with Valerie Jarrett. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nFinally, a voice rose from the behind the billowing ivy curtains on the main stage.\n\n\u201cHey, Washington, D.C.!\u201d boomed the former first lady \u2014 or \u201cforever\u201d first lady, according to this crowd \u2014 from backstage at 8:47 p.m. \u201cI have one question for you: Who are you becoming?\u201d\n\nWith Alicia Keys\u2019s \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d playing in the background, Mrs. Obama strutted onstage in a drapey black pantsuit accented on one side with crystals. The applause shook the room, but just as suddenly, a devout hush took over. For the next hour and half, Jarrett provided the road signs to Mrs. Obama\u2019s life story as the former first lady dove into one story after another from her childhood onward.\n\nShe talked about everything: from in vitro to marriage counseling, the South Shore to Buckingham Palace, Princeton to her first black Saab. Nothing seemed off-limits. Obama\u2019s voice echoed through the sold-out arena as she dispensed truism after truism about overcoming self-doubt, ignoring insults but admitting the pain, and putting yourself first. \u201cSay that!\u201d and \u201cYassssss\u201d filled the rafters like \u201camens\u201d in this crowd.\n\nAs the gab fest began to wrap up, Mrs. Obama admitted that she and her husband were just now, in 2018, starting to reflect on how much they had accomplished. \u201cI just looked at him and said, \u2018Man, you did this,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nAnd speaking of \u2026\n\nThe former president himself made a surprise appearance onstage with flowers just as the night was winding down. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d shouted someone (everyone?) as the crowd leaped to its feet and stayed there until Obama told them to \u201csit down\u201d as he perched on the arm of Michelle\u2019s chair. He planned to stay awhile, or at least long enough to get the story of their first meeting straight: Yes, he was late. Yes, he was wet (it was raining and he didn\u2019t have an umbrella). And yes, Michelle had assumed that with a name like Barack Hussein Obama, he was going to be a nerd. He thought she was a little \u2014 how do you say . . . uptight? \u2014 but cute.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really tall,\u201d he recalled of seeing Michelle for the first time. \u201cAnd most of it is legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d chided Mrs. Obama, her hand on the former president\u2019s thigh. \u201cThere are children here.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, it wasn\u2019t just the legs.\n\n\u201cShe was one of a kind.

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\nFormer New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced Sunday he is giving a record $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University to support student financial aid at his alma mater and make its admissions process \u201cforever need-blind.\u201d\n\nThe gift, believed to be the largest private donation in modern times to higher education, is a landmark in a growing national movement to make elite universities more accessible to students from low- to middle-income families.\n\nIt will enable the private research university in Baltimore to eliminate loans from financial aid packages for incoming students starting next fall, expand grants for those in financial need and provide relief to many current undergraduates who had previously taken out federal loans to pay their bills.\n\nIn years past, Hopkins President Ronald J. Daniels said, the university struggled to achieve its goal of welcoming all talented students regardless of their means or backgrounds.\n\n\u201cOur dedicated financial aid endowment was simply too small,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cNow, as a consequence of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s extraordinary gift, we will be fully and permanently need-blind in our admissions and be able to substantially enrich the level of direct assistance we provide to our undergraduate students and their families.\u201d\n\nBloomberg, who graduated from Hopkins in 1964, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times that his gift is intended to support the idea that opportunities should be based on merit and not wealth. \u201cThis will make admissions at Hopkins forever need-blind; finances will never again factor into decisions,\u201d he wrote.\n\n[Selective colleges pledge to recruit more low-income students]\n\nWith the donation, the 76-year-old businessman and politician underscored his philanthropic commitment at a moment when he is mulling a run for the presidency in 2020 as a Democrat. (He also has been a Republican and an independent in his political career.) Bloomberg had given $6.4 billion to education and other causes before Sunday\u2019s announcement.\n\nNow, his total lifetime giving to Hopkins alone will exceed $3.3 billion.\n\nThe gift will reverberate throughout higher education as selective colleges and universities seek financial resources that will enable them to recruit more students from lower- and middle-income families. Direct aid from colleges is crucial because the maximum federal Pell Grant provides $6,095 a year for students in need, less than a tenth of what many selective private schools charge for tuition, fees, and room and board. Some, including Hopkins, charge $70,000 a year.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s gift will help Hopkins make up the difference, and it challenges others to do the same for colleges elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s raising here is a call to action across the board, to institutions, to donors and particularly to policymakers to make sure that American higher education is an engine of social mobility,\u201d said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very big gift in all capital letters,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cA remarkable gift in many ways.\u201d Often, major gifts focus on endowing faculty positions or building laboratories and classrooms. This one is endowing aid.\n\n[Dozens more selective colleges join pledge to add lower-income students]\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about buildings, the university bureaucracy or anything else,\u201d said Jon Schnur, an adviser to Bloomberg on education. \u201cIt\u2019s all about directly supporting these students.\u201d\n\nComparing donations across eras is difficult. Inflation calculators show the $7 million bequest from Johns Hopkins in 1873 that established the namesake university would be worth far more than $100 million today.\n\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education tracks major donations to higher education since 1967. Two $1 billion gifts top that list: A 1999 pledge from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for a program called Gates Millennium Scholars and a 2006 pledge from the Anil Agarwal Foundation to establish Vedanta University in India.\n\nNow, Bloomberg has eclipsed that mark. It\u2019s the latest in a series that started with a $5 donation to Hopkins the year after he graduated.\n\nBloomberg in recent years has championed an initiative to secure pledges from selective colleges to add tens of thousands of low- to moderate-income students to their rolls. More federal and state funding, he said, will be crucial for achieving that goal. He also has financed efforts to provide those students with more effective college counseling.\n\nFor Hopkins, the latest gift is a milestone in a several-year effort to diversify its student body. The university has about 25,000 students, federal data show, including roughly 6,000 undergraduates. It enrolls about 1,300 freshmen a year to its main campus in Baltimore.\n\n[Bloomberg pledges $350 million to Johns Hopkins University]\n\nThis year, about 15 percent of freshmen qualify for Pell Grants. Through Bloomberg\u2019s gift \u2014 to be distributed \u201cessentially immediately,\u201d according to a Bloomberg aide \u2014 Hopkins plans to take steps to raise that share to at least 20 percent. It also will advertise widely for the first time that its highly competitive admissions process is \u201cneed-blind\u201d \u2014 meaning that financial circumstances are not taken into account as the school chooses a class.

Now he takes on a land so rich in available increments that they might qualify as countless, after losing his last job for going 19-10 in his last 29 games and committing the ghastly sin of conducting a humdrum offensive approach.\n\n[College football winners and losers: Questions continue to mount for struggling USC]\n\nIt\u2019s not much of a promising hire, and it\u2019s a hire indicative of a country forever hooked on brief doses of bedazzlement, but it does have its football curiosities.\n\nOne is that Miles, that native Ohioan who played for Bo Schembechler at Michigan and coached Oklahoma State before coaching LSU, turned 65 on Nov. 10. In a business that often overlooks its allegedly aged in search of youthful energy that might or might not matter, this counts as refreshing.\n\nAnother is that on Sept. 25, 2016, Miles became one of four coaches this century who had experienced both a national championship at one place and a firing from that same place based only on losses found to be too frequent. The others have been Phillip Fulmer, the 1998 national champion who had to step down at Tennessee in 2008; Larry Coker, the 2001 national champion at Miami seen off in 2006; and Gene Chizik, the modern free-fall record-holder, who got the heave from Auburn just shy of 23 months after winning the 2010 national championship at a school that appeared to be that same Auburn.\n\nNow comes Miles, whose span of title-to-firing did last almost a decade, from the title clinched in January 2008 to the exit in September 2016. He will become the second of the four to wring a new head-coaching job from his flashy piece of championship jewelry, with Coker having helmed Texas San Antonio for five seasons from 2011 to 2015, going 26-32.\n\nFinally, Miles\u2019s resumption will stoke some fun questions of scheming, now that he will occupy the wacko Big 12. There\u2019s the question of whether he\u2019ll change his X-and-O ways seen as both predictable and primordial. There\u2019s the amusing question of whether he could keep his offensive approach as stagecoach as ever and somehow turn up as a Big 12 anomaly. There\u2019s the memory of the emblematic night of Nov. 7, 2015.\n\nThat night, Miles and LSU brought to Tuscaloosa both an unbeaten record and one of the best football players of this or any era, running back Leonard Fournette, averaging 193 rushing yards per game. Yet because Miles and crew had not developed anything in its offense to distract Alabama from Fournette, which ought to count as an unfairness to Fournette, the star got hemmed in for 31 rushing yards on 19 carries. No. 4 Alabama dominated No. 2 LSU by more than the 30-16 score hinted.\n\nLSU did pass for a whopping 128 yards.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much where Miles left off, as a strategic dinosaur. Now, to see whether an old Wolverine can learn new tricks, one could take a peek at Kansas now and then, for reasons that extend beyond the exhausted quirks for which Miles somehow remains known, such as those famed occasions of eating grass.\n\nHe\u2019ll figure to lure some attention, with a reminder that back in the mid-to-late last decade, he coached the only two-loss national champion, which lost zero games in regulation, and then he said: \u201cThe day before the game, I came in here, had a nice little press conference, and somebody asked me what it must be like: Did you give any thought to raising the crystal ball? And I thought for the first time about doing that. And it was hard on me. And I did not handle it well. And then I tried to think it through: In fact, if I did have the opportunity to hold that crystal ball, what it might mean. And I couldn\u2019t really embrace the thought.\n\n\u201cI went back to my team and I told them in an impassioned plea to focus on the next 48 hours. Because I had lost focus for about 60 seconds about holding up this trophy. And I didn\u2019t want them to have that same experience. And they looked at me like I had lost my mind, because I came back there hot. And I was barking. And that team never lost focus. They just had a coach yank on them a little bit, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nReminded that he would participate in title reunions, as he did in 2017, Miles then said, \u201cI just only hope I can live 25 years from now.\u201d He has lived for almost 11 already, and now he lives again."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Cyprus gets back looted 6th century mosaic of St. Mark", "description": "Cyprus' communications minister says an extremely rare, 6th century portrait mosaic of St. Mark which was looted from the east Mediterranean island has now returned safely after decades abroad", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/cyprus-gets-back-looted-6th-century-mosaic-of-st-mark/2018/11/18/56b23986-eb70-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T20:27:16Z", "content": "NICOSIA, Cyprus The communications minister of Cyprus says a rare 6th-century portrait mosaic of St. Mark which was looted from an Orthodox Christian church more than four decades ago has returned intact to the Mediterranean island nation.

The Redskins experience\u2026 [+9518 chars]", "fulltext": "\n\nColt McCoy scrambles during Sunday\u2019s game after replacing Alex Smith, who left the game in the third quarter with a gruesome leg injury. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nHere are four takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 23-21 loss to the Texans on Sunday at FedEx Field.\n\nIt\u2019s Colt McCoy\u2019s team now: Midway through the third quarter, with the Redskins trailing 17-7, Alex Smith\u2019s day went from bad to much, much worse. On third-and-nine from the Houston 27-yard line, Smith was dragged down in the backfield by Texans defensive back Kareem Jackson. As J.J. Watt helped finish the sack, Smith\u2019s right ankle was caught in the turf and his lower leg bent in a way that legs aren\u2019t supposed to bend. Smith, who threw a pair of first-half interceptions, including one that was returned 101 yards for a touchdown, was eventually carted off the field, 33 years to the day since Lawrence Taylor broke Joe Theismann\u2019s leg on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said after the game that Smith broke the tibia and fibula in his right leg and underwent immediate surgery. Colt McCoy came on in relief and threw a touchdown pass to Jordan Reed on his first drive. McCoy, who knows Gruden\u2019s offense better than anyone, had a chance to be the hero when he took the field with 52 seconds to play. At that point Washington trailed 23-21 and was out of timeouts, needing about 30 yards to move into field goal range. The Redskins got 20 yards on their final drive, and Dustin Hopkins\u2019s 63-yard field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining fell short.\n\nPenalties were a major factor: The Redskins were flagged six times for 43 yards, none bigger than a defensive holding penalty on Josh Norman late in the fourth quarter. On third-and-five from the Washington 37-yard line after the two-minute warning, Jonathan Allen and Matt Ioannidis combined to bring down Deshaun Watson short of the sticks, but officials ruled that Norman had grabbed DeAndre Hopkins while Watson was still scrambling behind the line of scrimmage. Replays showed it was a questionable call on Norman at best. The penalty gave the Texans a first down, forcing the Redskins to burn their final two timeouts and allowing Houston to run the clock down to 56 seconds before attempting a long field goal. Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn\u2019s 45-yard attempt was no good, but the penalty still proved costly for Washington, which essentially ran out of time on its potential game-winning drive.\n\nFinally, a lead change: Adrian Peterson\u2019s seven-yard touchdown run with 11:57 to play gave Washington a 21-20 lead and moved Peterson ahead of Redskins legend John Riggins and into sole possession of sixth-place on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing touchdowns list. The 105th rushing score of Peterson\u2019s career also gave the Redskins their first lead change of the season, something they hadn\u2019t experienced since Week 16 of last year. Less than five minutes later, Fairbairn gave the Texans the lead right back with a 54-yard field goal. Houston held on to became the second team in NFL history, the the first since the 1925 New York Giants, to win seven straight after starting the season 0-3. The Redskins missed an opportunity to improve to 7-3 for the first time in 22 years.\n\nRushing defense and pass rush struggles: Watson completed 16 of 24 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown, but the Texans quarterback also threw a pair of interceptions, his first since Week 6. Overall, Washington\u2019s defense looked better than it did last week when it allowed 501 total yards to the Buccaneers. While Greg Manusky\u2019s unit limited Houston to four conversions on 11 third downs, the Redskins had no answer for the Texans\u2019 running game. Lamar Miller had 20 carries for 86 yards, while Alfred Blue added another 46 yards on eight carries. The Redskins sacked Watson three times, but they couldn\u2019t get to him early in Houston\u2019s final drive, when he picked up a crucial third-and-seven with a short pass over the middle to Miller.\n\nGame updates and analysis\n\nFinal: Texans 23, Redskins 21\n\nDustin Hopkins\u2019 63-yard field goal attempt in the final seconds landed in the end zone, short of the crossbar, allowing Houston to escape with its seventh consecutive win in a wild game at FedEx Field. Colt McCoy completed 6 of 12 passes for 54 yards and a touchdown in relief of Alex Smith, who left the game in the third quarter with what appeared to be a season-ending leg injury. Washington falls to 6-4.\n\n4th Quarter\n\nDustin Hopkins\u2019 63-yard field goal falls short: Rather than attempt a Hail Mary or attempt to pick up a few extra yards with eight seconds remaining and no timeouts left, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden sent Dustin Hopkins on to attempt a career-long 63-yard field goal. Hopkins\u2019 kick was straight, but fell about five yards short. (Texans 23, Redskins 21, 0:03 4th Quarter)\n\nThe Redskins have life: A questionable holding call on Josh Norman gave the Texans a critical first down on the first play after the two-minute warning, but the Redskins\u2019 defense eventually forced a 45-yard field goal attempt by Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn with 56 seconds left. Fairbairn missed badly to the right, giving Washington the ball with no timeouts and less than a minute to play. (Texans 23, Redskins 21, 0:52 4th Quarter)\n\nHere is the holding call on Josh Norman on that 3rd down play, giving the Texans a 1st down inside 2 mins. #Redskins pic.twitter.com/IOnXyoKJs5 \u2014 Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) November 18, 2018\n\nAt the two-minute warning, the Texans are driving: Houston is on the move again after converting a third-and-long with a 13-yard pass play to Lamar Miller. The Redskins elected to preserve their two remaining timeouts on the Texans\u2019 next two plays. Coming out of the two-minute warning, Houston faces third-and-five from the Washington 37-yard line. The Redskins need a stop. (Texans 23, Redskins 21, 2:00 4th Quarter)\n\nJadeveon Clowney spoils Redskins\u2019 latest drive: On third-and-10 from the Washington 36-yard line, Jadevon Clowney burst through the line and sacked Colt McCoy for a loss of nine, forcing a Redskins punt with five minutes remaining in the game. It\u2019ll be on the Redskins\u2019 defense to stop the Texans and give the ball back to McCoy with a chance to win the game. (Texans 23, Redskins 21, 4:38 4th Quarter)\n\nTexans re-take the lead: After not being involved in a lead change for nine games and three quarters, the Redskins have seen two changes in five minutes. Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn\u2019s 54-yard field goal capped an eight-play, 37-yard drive to give Houston a two-point lead. (Texans 23, Redskins 21, 7:30 4th Quarter)\n\nRedskins take the lead on Adrian Peterson touchdown run: It happened. The Redskins experienced a lead change. It\u2019s Washington\u2019s first lead change since Week 16 of last season and it came on a seven-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson early in the fourth quarter. Peterson moved into sole possession of sixth-place on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing touchdown list with the 105th of his career. (Redskins 21, Texans 20 11:57 4th Quarter)\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nTexans get three back: A big play to Keke Coutee fueled a scoring drive for the Texans to regain some of the ground lost to the Redskins\u2019 second TD of the game. (Texans 20, Redskins 14, 3rd Quarter)\n\nAfter a cruel blow, interception provides a spark: Preston Smith picked off a pass from Deshaun Watson deep inside Texans\u2019 territory on the ensuing possession, giving Colt McCoy, on in relief of the injured Alex Smith, prime field position to make his season debut. McCoy promptly put six points on the board and gave Washington some hope, finding Jordan Reed on a touchdown pass. (Texans 17, Redskins 14, 4:47 3rd Quarter)\n\nAlex Smith carted off: After sustaining what appeared to be a gruesome leg injury, the Redskins quarterback was carted off the field and the early reports are not encouraging.\n\nAlex\u2019s leg is exactly like mine 33 yrs ago \u2014 Joe Theismann (@Theismann7) November 18, 2018\n\nAlex Smith officially out with an ankle. #Redskins \u2014 Kareem Copeland (@kareemcopeland) November 18, 2018\n\nSmith waves to the crowd as he's carted off. Making prayer hands to the crowd. \u2014 Kareem Copeland (@kareemcopeland) November 18, 2018\n\nHalftime: Texans 17, Redskins 7\n\nAlex Smith\u2019s first-half numbers are even uglier than the score would indicate. Smith is 10 for 24 for 112 yards and two interceptions, including one that was returned 101 yards for a touchdown. Adrian Peterson has the Redskins\u2019 only touchdown, but he\u2019s struggled to find running lanes against Houston\u2019s defensive front and has only 27 yards on 10 carries. One of the bright spots for Washington was rookie wide receiver Trey Quinn, who has a team-high three catches for 38 yards in his first game since injuring his ankle in Week 1. Houston will receive the ball to start the second half.\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nHouston misses field goal: The Texans failed to turn Alex Smith\u2019s second interception into points. Preston Smith sacked Deshaun Watson for a loss of 12 yards and first down. Three plays later Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn hooked his 44-yard field goal attempt wide left. (Texans 17, Redskins 7, 0:36 2nd Quarter)\n\nAlex Smith throws another interception: Alex Smith entered Sunday with three interceptions in his first nine games. He\u2019s now thrown two picks in his last three attempts after Texans linebacker Brennan Scarlett stepped in front of a short pass intended for Kapri Bibbs and returned it to the Washington 22-yard line. The Texans have excellent field goal position and all three timeouts. (Texans 10, Redskins 7, 1:19 2nd Quarter)\n\nTexans take 17-7 lead on 101-yard interception return: A defensive holding penalty on Texans safety Kareem Jackson set the Redskins up with a first-and-goal from the Houston 7-yard line and a golden opportunity to record their first lead change of the season. Instead, Alex Smith threw a backbreaking interception in the end zone that Houston rookie safety Justin Reid returned for a touchdown. Smith and tight end Jordan Reed didn\u2019t appear to be on the same page on the play, as Reed ran a stop route and turned inside. Smith\u2019s pass went outside, resulting in an easy pick and a 10-point deficit. Reid\u2019s interception return was the longest against Washington in franchise history. (Texans 17, Redskins 7, 2:23 2nd Quarter)\n\nTexans dealing with their own injuries along the offensive line: Houston guards Zach Fulton and Senio Kelemete are both questionable to return after leaving Sunday\u2019s game in the first half with injuries. According to CBS\u2019s Melanie Collins, the Texans are down to five healthy offensive linemen. (Texans 10, Redskins 7, 9:12 2nd Quarter)\n\nRedskins can\u2019t capitalize on turnover: Mason Foster made a diving interception of a Deshaun Watson pass that was deflected by fellow linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons, giving Washington excellent field position at the Houston 45-yard line. Three plays later, Tyrann Mathieu made up for his costly defensive holding penalty earlier in the game by sacking Alex Smith for a loss of seven and forcing another Tress Way punt. (Texans 10, Redskins 7, 12:54 2nd Quarter)\n\nAdrian Peterson cuts into Texans\u2019 lead: Adrian Peterson capped Washington\u2019s 10-play, 75-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run, tying former Redskins great John Riggins for sixth on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing TD list with No. 104. (Texans 10, Redskins 7, 14:12 2nd Quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nRedskins are on the move: A defensive holding penalty on Tyann Mathieu negated a strip-sack by J.J. Watt on third down, giving Washington a fresh set of downs. Two plays later, rookie Trey Quinn. (Texans 10, Redskins 0, End of 1st Quarter)\n\nDeAndre Hopkins extends Texans\u2019 lead with touchdown catch: Washington\u2019s defense didn\u2019t offer much resistance on the Texans\u2019 second possession, and this time, Houston found the end zone. DeAndre Hopkins beat Josh Norman for 16-yard touchdown catch along the left sideline to cap a six-play, 69-yard touchdown drive. Hopkins now has a touchdown catch in five straight games. Meanwhile, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson is 7 for 8 for 98 yards, and Lamar Miller and Alfred Blue have combined for 34 yards on seven carries.

Smith is 1 for 5 to start the game, while Adrian Peterson has been limited to 10 yards on four carries. (Texans 3, Redskins 0, 6:28 1st Quarter)\n\nTexans take early 3-0 lead: The Redskins defense picked up where it left off last Sunday in Tampa Bay, by bending, but not (completely) breaking. Houston marched 68 yards on 10 plays, including a 28-yard completion to tight end Jordan Akins on third-and-one, but Washington buckled down in the red zone. After Deshaun Watson overthrew DeAndre Hopkins, who was blanketed by Josh Norman, in the end zone on third down, the Texans settled for a 23-yard field goal by Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn. This is the point in the live updates post where we remind you that the Redskins have yet to experience a lead change this season. Washington is 0-3 when the opponent scores first. (Texans 3, Redskins 0, 9:32 1st Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: The Texans won the toss and elected to defer, giving the Redskins the ball first. Washington\u2019s first drive went nowhere, with Alex Smith sandwiching a pair of incompletions around a one-yard run by Adrian Peterson. (Redskins 0, Texans 0, 14:10 1st Quarter)\n\nJay Gruden said this week that they absolutely can't get into a bunch of third-and-longs against the Texans.

The same can\u2019t be said for the Redskins, who strengthened their lead atop the NFC East with a win at Tampa Bay last week despite a rash of injuries. Washington\u2019s makeshift offensive line held its own against the Buccaneers, but Houston\u2019s defensive front, which features Jadeveon Clowney and J.J. Watt, presents a much tougher challenge. All-pro left tackle Trent Williams was upgraded from out to questionable on Friday, but it would be a surprise if Williams returned before next week\u2019s game against the Cowboys.\n\nThe Redskins defense allowed 501 yards of total offense last Sunday, but only gave up three points, thanks in large part to four Tampa Bay turnovers. Washington probably can\u2019t count on the Texans being so generous. Quarterback Deshaun Watson has thrown seven interceptions all season, and zero in his last three games. DeAndre Hopkins and recently acquired fellow wide receiver Demariyus Thomas will provide a stiff test for the Redskins\u2019 secondary, including safety D.J. Swearinger, who continues to carry a grudge against Texans Coach Bill O\u2019Brien stemming from their time together in Houston in 2015.\n\nPregame reading:\n\nRedskins-Texans matchups: Five keys to Sunday\u2019s game\n\nTexans QB Deshaun Watson brings \u2018Michael Vick wiggle\u2019 to Washington\n\nAdrian Peterson says he is feeling \u2018refreshed\u2019 and \u2018amazing\u2019\n\nAlex Smith and Redskins\u2019 rebuilt offensive line face big challenge in Texans\n\nFour years after leaving Texans, D.J.

On the U.S. side, Marines have been fortifying the border with extra barbed wire, and U.S. authorities have warned that they won\u2019t allow large groups of migrants to enter. On the Mexican side, Tijuana\u2019s mayor has referred to the migrants as \u201cbums\u201d and a \u201chorde,\u201d and a small group of residents held a protest Sunday morning shouting \u201cNo to the invasion!\u201d and \u201cThey are terrorists!\u201d\n\nJaime Malacara, 48, who works in private security, joined several dozen others at a traffic circle to express dismay at the caravan.

The residents at the protest mostly worried about rising crime, a possible confrontation with the United States, and how more caravans might follow if this one is allowed to pass.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re against uncontrollable migration,\u201d said Edgar Mart\u00ednez, 42, a teacher and dual U.S.-Mexican citizen.\n\nHe said he feared that the caravan would eventually try to push its way across the border, prompting the United States to shut down the legal crossing that many in Tijuana rely on for daily work and errands.\n\n\u201cIf they bumrush, they\u2019re going to close the border. That is going to affect the people here,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cWe wait up to three hours to cross the border sometimes.

Volunteers from church groups and others have given food and medicine, and entertained the migrant children by singing songs and making balloon animals.\n\nMayor Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum has been less supportive.

Bill Nelson (D) conceded to Gov. Rick Scott (R) Sunday after a bitter and drawn-out campaign to retain his seat, acknowledging that preliminary results from a manual statewide recount left him with no path to victory.\n\nAlthough results of the race are not due to be certified until Tuesday, Nelson said in remarks posted on Twitter that things had worked out \u201ca little differently\u201d from the way he and his wife had hoped. He went on to issue a call for bipartisanship in an era of brutally divisive politics.\n\n\u201cWe have to move beyond a politics that aims not just to defeat but to destroy \u2014 where truth is threatened as disposable, where falsehoods abound and that the free press is assaulted as the enemy of the people,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThere has been a gathering darkness in our politics in recent years.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s victory boosts the Republican Senate majority to 52, with a final seat in Mississippi due to be decided in a Nov. 27 runoff. In a statement, Scott thanked Nelson for his service.\n\n\u201cNow the campaign truly is behind us, and that\u2019s where we need to leave it,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \u201cWe must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country.\u201d\n\nGoing into the recount, Nelson trailed Scott by more than 12,000 votes, and his campaign had hoped a reexamination of ballots \u2014 particularly in heavily Democratic Broward County \u2014 would help him close the gap. But when the recount ended at midday Sunday, Scott still led Nelson by 10,033 votes out of more than 8 million cast, according to the Florida Division of Elections.\n\n\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott joins daughter Allison Guimard as he addresses supporters on election night. (Joe Skipper/Reuters)\n\nScott\u2019s razor-thin victory leaves Florida, the nation\u2019s third-most-populous state, with two Republican senators for the first time since the Reconstruction era immediately after the Civil War. While Republicans retain an advantage among Florida\u2019s older white retirees, the state\u2019s younger, nonwhite population is surging, with many of those Democratic-leaning people now reaching voting age.\n\n\u201cPeople are not happy that the blue wave hit the rest of the country and missed Florida,\u201d Jacob Sanders, a Democratic consultant in St. Lucie County, told The Washington Post in anticipation of a Nelson defeat. \u201cPeople are looking around and saying, \u2018What happened?\u2019 The recount was a really good way to make people stop asking. There\u2019s going to be a reckoning now.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Scott and Nelson was among the most closely watched Senate races in the country. Scrutiny intensified after Election Day as Scott\u2019s lead narrowed and the race headed toward a recount. Together, the Nelson and Scott campaigns racked up at least 10 lawsuits trying to gain legal advantage. Protesters descended on county election offices, where officials scrambled to tally ballots in scenes reminiscent of the 2000 presidential recount battle between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.\n\nThis time, Republicans also sought to cast doubt on the validity of the results, with President Trump making unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and arguing the recount should halt, even though it was mandated by state law. A machine recount that preceded the hand recount did settle Florida\u2019s closely watched gubernatorial race, with Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) conceding Saturday to Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.).\n\nOn Sunday, Trump congratulated Scott via tweet. \u201cFrom day one Rick Scott never wavered,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!\u201d\n\nAs Nelson\u2019s campaign was receiving results of the manual recount, it was also absorbing losses in three lawsuits filed by Democrats and voting rights advocates that could have benefited his campaign. Democrats lost what may have been Nelson\u2019s final legal recourse on Friday when a federal judge denied a request to accept some mail-in ballots received after Election Day.\n\nA fifth-generation Floridian, Nelson, 76, grew up in Melbourne, Fla., along what would become known as the Space Coast after the construction of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. He trained as a lawyer and entered politics in 1972 with a successful bid for a seat in the state House. Nelson served six years there, then moved to Congress, carving out a role as a leader on space issues. In 1986, as part of a NASA program to bring nonprofessional astronauts to space, he joined the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia and spent six days in orbit.\n\nNelson lost a race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1990. But he won his next attempt at statewide office, becoming the state treasurer and insurance commissioner in 1994. He held that post until 2000, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate, where he compiled a record as one of the most moderate members of the Democratic caucus.\n\nBut he also emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump administration, calling out its response to the disaster that Hurricane Maria wrought in Puerto Rico and criticizing its immigration and environmental policies.\n\nOf the five senators who lost their reelection bids, Nelson takes with him the longest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in public life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rewarding journey,\u201d Nelson said Sunday, \u201cas well as a very humbling experience.\u201d\n\nTory Newmyer contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Sonne, The Washington Post", "title": "Trump suggests Navy SEAL commander should have found bin Laden faster - The Advocate", "description": "President Donald Trump derided retired Adm.

After Trump revoked former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance in the summer, McRaven wrote an article in The Washington Post defending Brennan as a man of unparalleled integrity and asked the president to revoke his clearance, as well, in solidarity. McRaven also criticized Trump more broadly.\n\n\u201cLike most Americans, I had hoped that when you became president, you would rise to the occasion and become the leader this great nation needs,\u201d McRaven wrote. \u201cA good leader tries to embody the best qualities of his or her organization. A good leader sets the example for others to follow. A good leader always puts the welfare of others before himself or herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour leadership, however, has shown little of these qualities,\u201d McRaven added. \u201cThrough your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\u201d\n\nThe commentary amounted to a rare public rebuke by a former flag officer, most of whom tend to stay quiet on political matters after retiring, and escalated calls for McRaven to run for public office.\n\nOn Sunday, about three months later, Trump fired back at the retired admiral when Wallace brought him up in the interview.\n\n\u201cBill McRaven, retired admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of U.S. Special Operations, who led the operations, commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden, says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime,\u201d Wallace said, as Trump interrupted him to call the former top commander a \u201cHillary Clinton fan.\u201d\n\nTrump then accused McRaven of not finding bin Laden fast enough.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan, in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer, but living in Pakistan right next to the military academy. Everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nMcRaven didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that tension between Trump and retired military officers has spilled into public.\n\nEarlier this month, Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined other retired military officers in hitting at Trump\u2019s deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico the week of the midterm elections. Dempsey called the operation, a show of force against the caravans of Central American migrants traveling north to the U.S. border, a \u201cwasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump attacked retired Marine Corps Gen. John Allen for supporting Clinton, describing the former commander of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan as \u201ca failed general.\u201d\n\nMcRaven served as chancellor of the University of Texas after leaving the military but stepped down this year over health concerns.

(Ramon Espinosa/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Hundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road, and with many more months ahead of them while they seek asylum. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nOn Sunday, displeased Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \u201cOut! Out!\u201d in front of a statue of the Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the U.S. border. They accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \u201cinvasion.\u201d And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in Tijuana,\u201d protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don\u2019t have criminal records.\n\nA woman who gave her name as Paloma lambasted the migrants, who she said came to Mexico in search of handouts. \u201cLet their government take care of them,\u201d she told video reporters covering the protest.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keila Samarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don\u2019t represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: Childhood has no borders.\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \u201cWe want them to return to Honduras,\u201d said Rivera.\n\nHonduras has a murder rate of 43 per 100,000 residents, similar to U.S. cities like New Orleans and Detroit. In addition to violence, migrants in the caravan have mentioned poor economic prospects as a motivator for their departures. Per capita income hovers around $120 a month in Honduras, where the World Bank says two out of three people live in poverty.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants\u2019 plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at them. The cold reception contrasts sharply with the warmth that accompanied the migrants in southern Mexico, where residents of small towns greeted them with hot food, campsites and even live music.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nMexico\u2019s Interior Ministry said Saturday that the federal government was flying in food and blankets for the migrants in Tijuana.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city\u2019s privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \u201cWe are fleeing violence,\u201d said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \u201cHow can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\u201d\n\nSome from the caravan have diverted to other border cities, such as Mexicali, a few hours to the east of Tijuana.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \u201cthe U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \u201cCatch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGuthrie reported from Mexico City.

During the race, she had accused Kemp of actions antithetical to democracy: making it harder and in some cases impossible for certain groups of Georgians to vote.\n\nSo, with Abrams admitting Kemp was the winner, Tapper pressed during her first national interview since the election. He wanted to know whether she thought Kemp had a legitimate claim on the office, even as other Democrats publicly stated that the race had been stolen.\n\n\u201cThe law as it stands says that he received an adequate number of votes to become the governor of Georgia,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cBut we know sometimes the law does not do what it should, and something being legal does not make it right.\n\n\u201cYes, when he takes the oath of office, he will be the legal governor of the state of Georgia,\u201d Abrams continued, using another L-word. \u201cBut what you are looking for me to say is there was no compromise of our democracy and there should be some political compromise in the language that I use, and that\u2019s not right.

I will not say that.\"\n\nAbrams, who hoped to become the nation\u2019s first female African American governor, has accused Kemp of widespread voter suppression and said voting irregularities tainted the election. The accusations had special sting because Kemp, as secretary of state, was essentially the referee in a race he was involved in.\n\nOn Friday, Kemp had 50.22 percent of the tally, an edge of nearly 55,000 votes.\n\n[Democrat Stacey Abrams accepts defeat in contentious Georgia governor\u2019s race]\n\nLast week, Abrams said she planned to bring \u201ca major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for gross mismanagement of this election.\u201d She also said she planned to seek elected office again.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Vanessa Williams and Felicia Sonmez reported, Kemp and Abrams have clashed over voting rights in Georgia for years.\n\nKemp has pushed for restrictive voter identification and registration laws that have purged more than 1 million voters from the rolls in recent years. Several of those laws were successfully challenged in court, which said they were violations of the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\nMore recently, Abrams and other Democrats accused Kemp of championing a law that disproportionately affected black voters and launching an 11th-hour investigation of the Democratic Party, which he accused of trying to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\n\n[Kemp\u2019s office orders \u2018hacking\u2019 probe of Georgia Democrats on eve of election he\u2019s competing in]\n\nKemp, in a statement issued Friday by spokesman Ryan Mahoney, praised Abrams\u2019s \u201cpassion, hard work, and commitment to public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe election is over and hard-working Georgians are ready to move forward.

Bezos to insist that, no, he was not trying to troll President Trump.\n\nYes, Amazon\u2019s two new headquarters are set to be in Queens and Northern Virginia, which happen to be Trump\u2019s birthplace and a stone\u2019s throw from the White House, respectively.\n\nBut the choice of locations had nothing to do with the president, Carell-as-Bezos said in an SNL sketch titled \u201cMessage From Jeff Bezos.\"\n\n\u201cSure, he attacked me repeatedly on Twitter,\u201d he stated softly, as an upbeat melody played in the background. \u201cBut I chose our locations because they were ideal for growing business, not just to make Donald Trump think about how I\u2019m literally 100 times richer than he is.\u201d\n\nHe then deadpanned that Amazon \u201cneeded access to a young, educated workforce,\u201d which was why a new satellite office was set up in Palm Beach, Fla., directly across from Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCarell-as-Bezos also riffed on \u201chis\u201d 2013 purchase of The Washington Post. While (the real) Bezos owns the newspaper, which operates independently from Amazon, Trump has often conflated the two, leveling false attacks against both entities on Twitter.\n\nOn SNL, the fake Bezos couldn\u2019t help but take a dig at Trump, opening a mock-up of the print version of The Post \u2014 literal fake news \u2014 that featured an unflattering photo of the president playing tennis.\n\n\u201cI also love our Style section,\u201d Carell-as-Bezos announced, smiling.\n\nAnyway, he continued, he wasn\u2019t there to talk about Trump. He was there to unveil a new Amazon delivery option: \u201cAmazon Caravan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny package going to any Trump building will get delivered by hundreds of Honduran and Mexican immigrants, and I\u2019ll pick up the bill,\u201d he explained, a clear jab at Trump\u2019s escalation of fears surrounding caravans of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border\n\nHe paused, before sneaking in a barb about Trump\u2019s multiple business bankruptcies.\n\n\u201cUnless you order \u2018The Art of the Deal.\u2019 That costs more to ship, because it\u2019s heavier,\u201d Carell-as-Bezos said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s the only book with four Chapter Elevens.\u201d\n\nSeveral nonverbal digs at Trump also were sprinkled throughout the sketch, such as when \u201cBezos\u201d walks past framed pictures of prominent figures, including Nintendo\u2019s Toad. (This Style section reporter is not going to attempt to explain that reference in here, a family publication.) \u201cBezos\u201d also showed off drones outfitted with \u201ccompletely random\u201d hairpieces that will look familiar.\n\nAnd SNL\u2019s writers squeezed in a final joke at Trump\u2019s expense, centered on the president failing to visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that SNL chose to skewer Trump, something the show has done weekly since the president took office. The decision to do it through \u201cBezos,\u201d though, felt like more of a convergence of necessity: Carell as guest host, a slew of Trump jokes at the ready and an obligation to at least mention Amazon\u2019s newsy week.\n\nIf anything, the sketch was a missed opportunity to level sharper criticism at Bezos and Amazon. The recent announcement that the retail behemoth had selected a region of Northern Virginia (curiously rebranded as \u201cNational Landing\u201d) and Long Island City as its new headquarters locations sent up red flags in both communities, with critics arguing that the arrival of the twin headquarters could worsen income inequality, traffic and infrastructure problems, and other ills.\n\nMeanwhile, cities that Amazon courted but ultimately didn\u2019t choose were left wondering whether they had been bamboozled by false hope. Some in the rejected cities seemed relieved, citing the outsize tax breaks Amazon would have required and reviving criticisms over poor working conditions at Amazon\u2019s warehouses.\n\nThe SNL sketch barely scratched the surface of those controversies, though there was fleeting mention in the beginning that the headquarters announcement was not well received by everyone.\n\n\u201cAmazon just announced the location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia,\u201d Carell-as-Bezos said. \u201cAnd everyone \u2014 except for the people who live there and the people who live in all the places we didn\u2019t choose \u2014 is thrilled!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nSteve Carell\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 monologue turned into a mini \u2018Office\u2019 reunion\n\nFacebook, wildfires and fraud claims: SNL\u2019s cold open takes us through the week\u2019s headlines\n\nWhy Dan Crenshaw got a public apology and others didn\u2019t.

From there, he called Uruguay President Tabare Vasquez seeking protection.\n\nLate Saturday, a judge in Lima granted prosecutors\u2019 request that Garcia be banned from leaving Peru for 18 months as investigators probe allegations he received illegal payment from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.\n\nOdebrecht is at the center of Latin America\u2019s biggest corruption scandal after admitting in a 2016 plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department that it paid corrupt officials across Latin America nearly $800 million in exchange for major infrastructure contracts.\n\nThe scandal has led to the jailing of numerous politicians across the region, especially in Peru, where former President Pedro Pablo Kucyznski was forced to resign for hiding his past work as a consultant to Odebrecht and Garcia as well as two other former presidents, Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, are being probed for allegedly taking illegal payments.\n\nOutside the ambassador\u2019s residence in the leafy San Isidro neighborhood, a few dozen protesters shouted \u201cGarcia, you coward, the people repudiate you\u201d while a similarly sized group of supporters was held back by police. Inside, Garcia received visits from several family members.\n\nPresident Martin Vizcarra, who has made tackling corruption the focus of his accidental administration since taking over from Kuczynski, rejected Garcia\u2019s claims the case against him was built on false testimony.\n\n\u201cPolitical persecution doesn\u2019t exist in Peru, and all of us Peruvians must obey justice, without exceptions,\u201d he wrote on Twitter shortly after news of Garcia\u2019s asylum request.\n\nUruguay\u2019s foreign minister said his government would study Garcia\u2019s request but refused further comment. Peru said it would provide Uruguay with unspecified information to help it in its evaluation of the asylum request.\n\nGarcia is under investigation for bribes allegedly paid during the construction of Lima\u2019s metro during his 2006-2011 government. He downplayed the threat of arrest when he arrived home on Thursday from Madrid, where he splits his time.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s not a punishment to be confined 18 months to my homeland,\u201d he said while denying that he had ever received money from Odebrecht.\n\nGarcia, 69, was a populist firebrand whose erratic first presidency in the 1980s was marked by hyperinflation, rampant corruption and the rise of the Shining Path guerrilla movement.\n\nWhen he returned to power two decades later he ran a more conservative government, helping usher in a commodities-led investment boom in which Odebrecht played a major supporting role.\n\nThis is the second time Garcia has sought to flee to another country amid corruption charges. Following the end of his first government he spent nine years in exile in neighboring Colombia and then France after his successor, Alberto Fujimori, raided his house and reopened a corruption probe.\n\n--\n\nAP Writer Joshua Goodman contributed to this report from Bogota, Colombia\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTwo years have passed since Donald Trump made his famous campaign promise in disaffected regions across the country: \u201cWe are going to start winning again!\u201d For many voters who felt that they had lost ground in recent decades, the candidate argued, a vote for him would be rewarded with renewed prosperity and prominence.\n\nIt was a classic campaign promise, overly ambitious and cleverly vague. What exactly did \u201cwinning\u201d mean? Certainly, many reporters believed voters perceived the promise as an economic one. So let\u2019s measure the promise\u2019s success that way. How have Trump voters fared economically, compared with Hillary Clinton voters?\n\nNot noticeably better, according to the data. By most measures, my latest research shows, Trump counties \u2014 and especially counties with higher proportions of Trump voters \u2014 continue to fall farther behind the rest of the country economically. The story of our economy, like the story of our politics, continues to be a story of division and divergence.\n\nTrump\u2019s America vs. Clinton\u2019s America\n\nIt is no secret that the country is as geographically fractured as it is economically unequal. In fact, the two trends are intertwined. In separate studies, economists Rebecca Diamond and Peter Ganong and Daniel Shoag revealed a widening gap in incomes, skills and wages between low-income and high-income regions, beginning around 1980. After decades of converging, in other words, our cities and states have been growing apart. The wider the income gap grows between the regions, they show, the harder it becomes for those in service and even blue-collar jobs to afford to live in high-income, high-rent places with high-quality amenities such as clean air, good schools, low crime, strong job markets, transportation infrastructure and retail stores.\n\nDriven out of thriving communities by those rents, people who were just getting by are surrounded by others who were also struggling, in areas that the better-off had fled. That leaves a skimpy tax base, shrunken opportunities and economic segregation.\n\nThus, we increasingly live in two Americas, and we vote accordingly.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nConsider the stark differences in basic measures of local economic performance \u2014 employment and housing prices \u2014 between counties where the majority of votes were cast for Donald Trump and counties where the majority voted for Hillary Clinton. The average Clinton county employs seven to eight times as many workers as the average Trump county, with nearly double the market value per single-family home. In part, this difference reflects the higher population density of the urban areas, which voted disproportionately for Clinton. But as my analysis shows, it has been growing over time, as the Clinton counties outperform their Trump counterparts.\n\nPost-election, the more things change, the more they stay the same?\n\nAfter November 2016, many Trump supporters told reporters that they expected this gap to narrow. In essence, they were hoping to see faster job growth \u2014 and income growth, which would drive up housing prices \u2014 to catch up to the rest of the country.\n\nLooking at 13 months of data since the election, we can see that that hasn\u2019t happened. The average Trump county added 1.13 percent more jobs, while the average Clinton county added 0.49 percent. These increases are quite small, especially considering that significantly fewer jobs existed in Trump counties to begin with.\n\nHousing prices tell a similar story, with even more data stretching into 2018. Regardless of how I compare the counties, Clinton supporters consistently come out on top. Even though their housing prices started significantly higher than their counterparts in Trump counties, their value increases even faster after November 2016.\n\nThe major shortcoming of this comparison is that it fails to account for pre-election trends. Maybe the Trump counties aren\u2019t growing faster than the Clinton counties, but at least they are improving relative to their previous performance? Maybe they\u2019re bending their trend closer to the trend of the Clinton counties, even if they\u2019re not overtaking them?\n\nNot at all, it turns out. Using a standard statistical technique called \u201cdifference-in-differences,\u201d I estimate the difference between Trump and Clinton counties before and after the election and show whether the difference \u2026 differs. In other words, I look at whether the economic performance gap narrows. The answer: No. Statistically, there appears to be no significant improvement in job growth. The gap in housing price growth actually widens. In fact, the larger the Trump electorate and the larger the degree of Trump support, the worse the county\u2019s economic performance.\n\nFinally, you might wonder whether it\u2019s fair to lump all Trump voters together. Many of them would have voted Republican regardless of the nominee. Perhaps it makes more sense to focus on the voters who switched to Donald Trump after voting for Barack Obama in 2012. Arguably, these voters were wooed specifically by the candidate\u2019s promise to \u201cstart winning again.\u201d\n\nEven among these counties, however, there does not appear to be any improvement. Their performance is statistically indistinguishable from the performance of their fellow Obama counties that stuck with the Democrats in 2016.\n\n[Here are 4 things to expect from a new, Trumpier, more polarized Congress]\n\nWhat can we expect for the next two years?\n\nThe two Americas remain as economically divided after the midterm election as they did after the presidential election two years ago. We do not know, however, whether these different economic directions will now begin to converge. Two years is a very short time in which to reverse macroeconomic trends. It is still possible that Trump counties will be rewarded in the long run. For that reason, I will be updating these estimates throughout the coming years.\n\nLet me acknowledge that it\u2019s possible that these comparisons don\u2019t account for differences between voters within counties \u2014 or what statisticians call the \u201cecological fallacy.\u201d Perhaps Trump voters are experiencing stronger economic growth than their neighbors, even if their counties are underperforming the nation. Perhaps future data will allow us to make this person-to-person comparison within counties.\n\nUntil then, these preliminary findings reveal the economic state of our nation remains much as it did before Trump\u2019s election: divided as much by economics as it is by politics.\n\nAnthony W.

After Trump revoked former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance in the summer, McRaven wrote an article in The Washington Post defending Brennan as a man of unparalleled integrity and asked the president to revoke his clearance, as well, in solidarity. McRaven also criticized Trump more broadly.\n\n\u201cLike most Americans, I had hoped that when you became president, you would rise to the occasion and become the leader this great nation needs,\u201d McRaven wrote. \u201cA good leader tries to embody the best qualities of his or her organization. A good leader sets the example for others to follow. A good leader always puts the welfare of others before himself or herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour leadership, however, has shown little of these qualities,\u201d McRaven added. \u201cThrough your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\u201d\n\nThe commentary amounted to a rare public rebuke by a former flag officer, most of whom tend to stay quiet on political matters after retiring, and escalated calls for McRaven to run for public office.\n\nOn Sunday, about three months later, Trump fired back at the retired admiral when Wallace brought him up in the interview.\n\n\u201cBill McRaven, retired admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of U.S. Special Operations, who led the operations, commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden, says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime,\u201d Wallace said, as Trump interrupted him to call the former top commander a \u201cHillary Clinton fan.\u201d\n\nTrump then accused McRaven of not finding bin Laden fast enough.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan, in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer, but living in Pakistan right next to the military academy. Everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nMcRaven didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that tension between Trump and retired military officers has spilled into public.\n\nEarlier this month, Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined other retired military officers in hitting at Trump\u2019s deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico the week of the midterm elections. Dempsey called the operation, a show of force against the caravans of Central American migrants traveling north to the U.S. border, a \u201cwasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump attacked retired Marine Corps Gen. John Allen for supporting Clinton, describing the former commander of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan as \u201ca failed general.\u201d\n\nMcRaven served as chancellor of the University of Texas after leaving the military but stepped down this year over health concerns.

Leavenworth County Commissioner Louis Klemp apparently had taken issue with a development project presented by a planning consultant, who also happened to be the only black person in the video filmed during the meeting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m picking on you because we\u2019re part of the master race.

She told CBS affiliate KCTV that she does not want to be part of the story.\n\nLeavenworth County Administrator Mark Loughry defended Klemp, saying the commissioner has made similar comments about people who have a gap in their teeth. Klemp, Loughry said, meant that he and the woman are part of the master race.\n\n\u201cThe use of the term \u2018Master Race,\u2019 as ill-advised as it may be, was not a reference to Nazis or used in a racist manner in this instance,\u201d Loughry said in a statement. \u201cLeavenworth County has a zero tolerance for racism or discrimination in any form from any staff members.

It was more than a belief system: German scientists began a program of forced sterilizations of people they considered inferior: ethnic minorities, the physically disabled, the mentally ill and Jews.\n\nKlemp\u2019s comments did not happen in a vacuum. In December, a month after he was appointed to fill a vacancy on the commission, he went on a meandering, disjointed soliloquy about a number of racially incendiary topics: slavery, the Civil War, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and exactly which historical figures are deserving of a national holiday.\n\n\u201cNot everybody does them all, because we have Robert E. Lee, who, God, Robert E.

He then adjourned the house until Monday. Parliament passed the first motion on Wednesday, also by voice vote due to the clashes.\n\nRajapaksa says the vote should not have been done by voice.

(Richard Drew/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nA midterm election cycle that looks more like a tsunami in Democrats\u2019 favor after nearly two weeks of vote-counting should prompt Republicans to assess their policies and political prospects. While data confirm President Trump is a problem, he may not be the Republicans\u2019 biggest problem.\n\nIn a post-midterm poll, the Pew Research Center finds \u201cnearly two-thirds of those who say they voted in the midterm elections (64%) say Trump was a consideration in their vote, while 35% say the president was not much of a factor. Overall, 39% say their vote was a vote against Trump, while fewer (25%) say their choice was a vote for Trump.\u201d While a majority of Republicans (61 percent) don\u2019t want a primary challenger, 37 percent do; moreover, the groups that the GOP has the most trouble holding on to \u2014 women and younger voters \u2014 are more open to a challenger (43 percent and 48 percent, respectively).\n\nSo Trump is a problem insofar as he appears to have provoked a huge defection from the GOP of women and, more generally, college-educated voters and suburbanites. That, however, is not the worst of it for Republicans.\n\nAfter an election in which Trump\u2019s tax cuts were a political loser and attempts at killing Obamacare were a political death sentence, Republicans should wake up. On nearly every issue, what they are selling voters aren\u2019t buying. Pew found:\n\nWhen asked if Donald Trump or Democrats in Congress will have the better approach to a range of specific issues \u2013 or whether there\u2019s not much difference between the two \u2013 the public prefers the approach of Democrats in many areas. For example, 55% of the public says Democrats will have a better approach to the environment, while 19% think Trump\u2019s approach will be better. A quarter says there won\u2019t be much difference between the two. On ethics in government, about half (48%) say Democrats will have a better approach, compared with just 22% who say Trump will have a better approach. Nearly three-in-ten (29%) say there\u2019s not much difference between the respective approaches. The pattern of opinion is similar in attitudes toward Medicare, health care, and Social Security, with pluralities favoring the approach of Democrats over Trump.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d/anti-Western-democracies (or whatever it is) approach is not impressing voters. Only 35 percent favor his approach while 43 percent favor Democrats\u2019 approach. On Trump\u2019s favorite issue \u2014 immigration \u2014 voters prefer Democrats\u2019 approach (46 percent) over his (40 percent). Trump does so poorly on ethics and the environment that a majority of Republicans don\u2019t prefer his approach on these issues. (Only 46 percent favor Trump on ethics, while 41 percent favor him on the environment.) Trump does better than Democrats on jobs and economic growth, however.\n\nThere are a few conclusions to draw from these results.\n\nFirst, if Republicans stick with Trump, their least enthusiastic voters (women and young people) may continue to drift away. Democrats have an opening to entice these groups to vote Democratic in 2020, as many did in the midterms. Outside of deep-red enclaves, Trump generates a strong political backlash, aiding Democratic turnout.\n\nSecond, for some time now Republicans have lacked a compelling agenda. Tax cuts for the rich, entitlement cuts and insistence on \u201csmall government\u201d were, by 2016, the unpopular views that allowed an ideological heretic such as Trump to take over the party. Once in office, he has reverted to tax cuts for the rich, tried to take away Obamacare and run up a huge debt. Cronyism and corruption are rampant. What\u2019s popular about that? Not much, voters are telling Republicans. Right now, the right is an intellectual wasteland whern good policy goes to die \u2014 killed off by economic illiteracy on trade and immigration, denial of science and lack of interest in investing in workers (e.g., education, worker training).\n\nThird, all of this takes place in a remarkably strong economy. There is reason to believe, however, that the bull economy won\u2019t last for two more years. Ben White of Politico writes that Trump has reason to fear the end of the \u201csugar high\u201d from tax cuts. He explains, \u201cFiscal stimulus from the GOP tax cuts is likely to start running out. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep bumping up interest rates. And few analysts expect a divided Congress \u2014 facing soaring deficits and with its eyes on 2020 \u2014 to join hands and pass a big infrastructure package or sweeping middle-class tax cuts to keep the fiscal juice flowing.\u201d\n\nIn part, the prospects for sustained growth look mediocre at best because the promised surge in corporate investment didn\u2019t materialize. Instead, corporate tax cuts sparked a flurry of stock buybacks.\n\nAmong the stale ideas in the GOP\u2019s policy cupboard is the party\u2019s infatuation with tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations as the end-all and be-all of economic policy. As Jared Bernstein and Dean Baker wrote in The Post, \u201cThe advocates of the tax cut promised an investment boom, which they claimed would provide long-term benefits in the form of higher productivity growth. However, there is no evidence of this boom to date, with investment up only modestly from year-ago levels. In fact, in the last quarter, business investment grew at less than a 1.0 percent rate. Nor do we see evidence of a forthcoming boom in the various measures of business intentions or orders for capital goods, i.e., measures of future investment.\u201d Throw in China\u2019s slowdown in growth and Trump\u2019s trade war, and the economy may not be firing on all cylinders in a year or so.\n\nIn sum, Trump personally is an anvil around the necks of his party members outside deep-red enclaves. More systemically, Republicans are out of popular policy ideas, and the only thing keeping them politically afloat is the economy \u2014 which sure doesn\u2019t seem like it will perform indefinitely as Trump promised. Democrats cannot beat something with nothing, but if they could scrape together a competent, non-offensive presidential nominee, advance some popular ideas (e.g., infrastructure, ethics reform, shoring up health care and cutting drug prices) and champion economic policies based on something other than more tax cuts for the rich and for corporations, they might win in 2020.

(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Harry Kane\u2019s goalless streak was only five minutes from extending to eight games when the captain finally found the net again for England.\n\nAs Ben Chilwell floated a free kick into the penalty area, Kane slid in, stretched out his right foot and nudged the ball into the Croatia net.\n\nIt came four months too late to secure a place for England in the World Cup final. But the World Cup Golden Boot winner ensured England went some way to avenging the Moscow semifinal loss to Croatia by turning the tables with a 2-1 victory at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\nWhile England advanced to the final four of the inaugural UEFA Nations League, Croatia was relegated to the second tier.\n\nAny doubts about what soccer\u2019s newest international competition means to England were dispelled in the relief and glee on Kane\u2019s face as he darted toward the crowd in celebration before being leapt on by Jesse Lingard as the Wembley crowd roared.\n\nRarely in the 11 years since English soccer\u2019s national stadium was rebuilt has there been such tension for an international game. Not, perhaps, since the opening months when England was beaten by Croatia and denied a place at the 2008 European Championship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen (Wembley) like this in an England shirt,\u201d the 25-year-old Kane said. \u201cWe are going to enjoy it so I hope the fans do too.\u201d\n\nFor a competition that only debuted in September \u2014 to replace some largely meaningless friendlies \u2014 it has been quickly embraced in soccer\u2019s often-cynical heartland. The comeback from such a young side demonstrated a fortitude so often missing from a country that hasn\u2019t won a major title since the 1966 World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is the connection with the fans,\u201d England coach Gareth Southgate said. \u201cThe energy that came back to the team in those difficult moments helped us get over the line.\u201d\n\nNow England has seven months to contemplate just how meaningful winning the Nations League would be in June. Portugal secured the hosting by winning its group on Saturday. Switzerland sealed the third spot on Sunday night by beating Belgium 5-2, before France or the Netherlands complete the lineup on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another semifinal, two wins away from winning a trophy,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe showed that we can beat the big teams. Croatia and Spain are two of the very best in the world. So this is kind of our next step after the summer.\u201d\n\nCroatian players have said since July that they were inspired in the semifinal by what they perceived as arrogant undertones in the \u201cFootball\u2019s Coming Home\u201d lyric in the \u201cThree Lions\u201d team anthem. Croatia went on to lose to France in the World Cup final.\n\nThe song was played immediately after the final whistle on Sunday and even cited by Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic to congratulate England.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming home,\u201d Dalic said in his only post-match comments in English. \u201cVery soon.\u201d\n\nFatigued after going the distance to beat Spain on Thursday, Croatia was unsettled throughout the first half by England\u2019s pace. But Croatia found its stride in the second half, taking the lead after 12 minutes after cutting through England down the right.\n\nJosip Brekalo played in Nikola Vlasic, who cut the ball across to Andrej Kramaric. Switching the ball between his feet, the midfielder twisted unchallenged before raising a shot into the roof of the net, via a deflection off Eric Dier\u2019s thigh.\n\n\u201cWe let a soft goal in,\u201d Southgate said, \u201cand it is a real test of resilience and patience.\u201d\n\nThe game turned on Southgate\u2019s double substitution in the 73rd minute that saw Jadon Sancho and Lingard enter. The impact was felt within five minutes and the set pieces that served England so well on the run to its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years proved decisive again.\n\nJoe Gomez\u2019s long throw-in was headed down by Kane through the legs of Hrvoje Millic and Lingard tapped in from close range for his second goal in two games after scoring in a 3-0 friendly win against the Unites States on Thursday.\n\nAt the other end, Lingard came to England\u2019s rescue. Domagoj Vida\u2019s header had beaten goalkeeper Jordan Pickford but Lingard cleared off line.\n\nParity was maintained but England was still facing relegation from Group A4. Only a win would secure top-tier status and with it a place in the semifinals.\n\nFor the first time since the last-16 World Cup game against Colombia, and after 747 frustrating minutes, Kane found the target in an England shirt again.\n\n\u201cHarry is the best goalscorer in the world,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe have huge belief in him. He is so hungry to lead the team on and further.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I would not get involved,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since Trump forced Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general and chose Whitaker to serve as his interim replacement, Whitaker has faced calls from Democrats to recuse himself from oversight of the probe given his previous criticism of the investigation. Trump said in Sunday\u2019s interview that he \u201cdid not know [Whitaker] took views on the Mueller investigation as such\u201d before he appointed him to his position.\n\nTrump also essentially shut the door to sitting down with Mueller, telling host Chris Wallace that his written answers mean \u201cprobably this is the end\u201d of his involvement in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably: We\u2019re finished,\u201d Trump said. He said that he had given \u201cvery complete answers to a lot of questions\u201d and that \u201cthat should solve the problem.\u201d\n\nTrump said Friday that he had answered a set of written questions from Mueller \u201cvery easily.\u201d The president told Wallace in Sunday\u2019s interview that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a big deal\u201d and that he expects his legal team to submit the answers \u201cat some point very soon.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s answers had long been sought by Mueller during the course of his 18-month-old investigation. The probe has led to charges against 32 people, including 26 Russians. While four aides to Trump have pleaded guilty to various charges, Mueller\u2019s team has not given any public indications as to whether it has concluded that Trump associates conspired with the Russians or whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring Justice Department leaders.\n\nKey lawmakers also weighed in on Whitaker on Sunday.\n\nIn an appearance on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d incoming Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) contended that Whitaker \u201cwas chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation\u201d and said he \u201cshould have absolutely nothing to do\u201d with the probe. Schiff also said Whitaker should be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n\u201cHe auditioned for the part by going on TV and saying he could hobble the investigation,\u201d Schiff said, calling Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional and \u201can attack on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nTrump fired back in a tweet Sunday afternoon in which he argued that Mueller had not been confirmed by the Senate, either. However, Mueller, unlike the attorney general, is not a Cabinet-level official; he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, and his role does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nMueller, however, was twice confirmed by the Senate to serve as FBI director \u2014 in 2001 and 2011.\n\n\u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d Trump said, misspelling Schiff\u2019s last name.\n\nThe lawmaker responded sarcastically in a tweet of his own: \u201cWow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one. Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, or did you write this one yourself?\u201d\n\nSome Republicans on Sunday were looking past Whitaker and focusing on his potential successor. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said that Whitaker \u201cseems to be a person who has the ability to do that acting job\u201d but that the Justice Department needs a permanent leader as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe need to move as quickly as we can beyond whoever\u2019s the acting attorney general to an attorney general who\u2019s going to be there for, hopefully, a much longer period of time,\u201d he told ABC.\n\nBlunt, a member of the Senate GOP leadership who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said that he has confidence in the Mueller investigation and that it would be a \u201chuge mistake\u201d for Trump to seek to end it. \u201cWe need to get beyond this. We don\u2019t need to have this starting again,\u201d the senator said.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s wide-ranging interview, Trump said he does not feel it is necessary for him to listen to an audio recording of journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\n\u201cWe have the tape. I don\u2019t want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape,\u201d Trump said. He described it as \u201ca suffering tape\u201d and told Wallace, \u201cI know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it . . . It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.\u201d\n\nThe CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi leaders and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. But Trump maintained on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the crown prince had told him \u201cmaybe five different times\u201d and \u201cas recently as a few days ago\u201d that he had nothing to do with the killing. Aides have said that Trump has been looking for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed.\n\n\u201cWell, will anybody really know?\u201d Trump said in Sunday\u2019s interview when asked whether the crown prince might have been lying to him. He added: \u201cYou saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But, at the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\u201d\n\nTrump also weighed in on the performance of several top members of his administration and maintained that his party had succeeded in the midterm elections despite losing the House.\n\nTrump said there are people in \u201cthree or four or five positions\u201d in his administration whom he is thinking about replacing and that of those, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s going to end up being two.\u201d\n\nHe declined to say whether chief of staff John F. Kelly will remain in his position through 2020 as previously indicated, saying only, \u201cI mean, it could be. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are certain things I love what he does,\u201d Trump said of Kelly. \u201cAnd there are certain things that I don\u2019t like that he does that aren\u2019t his strength . . . It\u2019s not his fault; it\u2019s not his strength.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen but also suggested that she may leave his administration at some point. Trump has voiced dissatisfaction about Nielsen\u2019s performance on immigration enforcement and has previously told advisers that he has decided to remove her in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI want her to get much tougher, and we\u2019ll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough,\u201d Trump said in Sunday\u2019s interview.\n\nHe claimed that despite Republicans\u2019 defeat in the House, where they have lost at least three dozen seats, their holding on to the Senate was \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201ca tremendous victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run. I wasn\u2019t running. My name wasn\u2019t on the ballot,\u201d Trump said. During the months leading up to Election Day, he repeatedly told supporters at his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies to \u201cpretend I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d\n\nTrump also said Sunday that he could not envision a situation in which he would try to amend the Constitution to run for a third term as president in 2024.\n\n\u201cJust won\u2019t happen,\u201d Trump told Wallace. \u201cI think the eight-year limit is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nTory Newmyer, Carol D.

(U.S. Soccer Federation)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Romain Gall is a Paris-born soccer player of French and Senegalese descent. His career pursuits have carried the 23-year-old attacker to the American desert and France\u2019s northwest coast, to the capitals of Ohio and Texas, and to two small Swedish cities, before ferrying him to Sweden\u2019s most decorated club.\n\nBut if you ask him from where he came, where he fully embraced the sport and began charting his course, he\u2019ll say: Herndon, Va.\n\nLong before reporting to the U.S. men\u2019s national team for the first time earlier this month, Gall was a student at Clearview Elementary and Herndon Middle and High schools in Fairfax County. His elite youth team was Herndon Real Juniors.\n\n\u201cI remember going to all of my trainings and games in the D.C. area, no matter how far it was,\u201d he said before a recent U.S. workout. \"I had a vision of what I wanted to do. I have a lot of moments where I look back and look where I am now.\n\n\u201cThis is also a beginning. It\u2019s a beautiful journey. It\u2019s been tough, but it\u2019s beautiful when you stick to it.\u201d\n\nGall joined the U.S. squad on the final leg of the 2018 rebuilding mission, one affording opportunity to young invitees like him as a new World Cup cycle begins. He was among seven players not in uniform for the 3-0 defeat to England on Thursday at Wembley Stadium. The last match of the year comes Tuesday against Italy in Genk, Belgium.\n\nGall and goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, a late injury replacement, are the first-timers in camp.\n\nInterim coach Dave Sarachan selected Gall after noticing his scoring exploits in the Allsvenskan, Sweden\u2019s first-tier circuit: six goals in 13 matches with Sundsvall and, after a midseason transfer, six goals in 12 games for Malmo to rank him tied for fifth in the league. He also scored twice in three Swedish Cup matches for Sundsvall early in the year.\n\nOverall, including UEFA Champions League qualifiers and Europa League with Malmo, Gall has posted 14 goals in 32 appearances \u2014 a hefty haul for someone who was not playing regularly until 2 1/2 years ago.\n\n\u201cHe had been off the radar a little bit and sort of re-emerged this year with his strong play,\u201d Sarachan said. \"When we talk about bringing along young guys and having the opportunity to see where they\u2019re at, he has put himself in the conversation with the minutes he\u2019s getting and his consistent production.\"\n\nGall\u2019s journey began in Paris. His father, Thierry, worked for France Telecom and took frequent business trips to the United States. When Romain (pronounced Ro-men) was 7, the family moved to Herndon, close to Thierry\u2019s office near Dulles Airport.\n\nSoon, he was immersed in the language \u2014 these days, he does not speak with even the slightest French accent \u2014 as well as the culture and the soccer scene. Gall joined Herndon Youth Soccer. Years later, he was part of D.C. United\u2019s under-17 academy team that prevailed against other MLS youth squads in winning the SUM Cup title in Houston.\n\nHe then chose to venture far from home, enrolling in Real Salt Lake\u2019s residential academy, which, at the time, was located in Casa Grande, Ariz., 40 miles outside of Phoenix.\n\nA year later, his European roots pulled him overseas. He spent three years in Lorient\u2019s youth system, located in the French region of Brittany. By then, he had become a U.S. citizen and drawn the attention of the under-18 national program.\n\nBecause Gall had retained amateur eligibility, playing college soccer also became an option. But after signing with Maryland in 2013, he decided to continue pursuing a pro career. With Lorient\u2019s B squad in 2013-14, he played in six matches but did not start.\n\nSummoned regularly by the U.S. under-20 national team, Gall appeared on MLS\u2019s radar. And so he decided to return stateside. Through a weighted lottery, he joined the Columbus Crew late in the 2014 campaign. The next season, though, he was loaned to the third-flight Austin Aztex, where he scored three times.\n\nColumbus waived him before the 2016 season. Europe beckoned again, this time taking him to Nykopings in Sweden\u2019s third division. It was a low-level league and he would play in a 1,000-seat stadium. It was, though, the start of a steady ascent.\n\nHe scored nine goals and caught the attention of first-tier Sundsvall. After tallying just twice last year, he struck six times in an eight-match span early this season. Malmo, Sweden\u2019s most-famous club, purchased him midway through the campaign, and the goals have continued to flow.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get here,\u201d Gall said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s been a tough road, but this year has been a blessing.\u201d\n\nSuccess with his club has led to a well-deserved look by the national team.\n\n\u201cI knew if I was able to climb my way up in Europe and had some good performances, my chance would come,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, this is the proof it can happen.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nEngland-USA friendly had two chapters, both all about England\n\nAs Wayne Rooney takes bow with England, Christian Pulisic takes mantle of USMNT"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The Latest: Labour leader: New EU vote 'not for today' - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Latest: Labour leader: New EU vote 'not for today' Washington Post LONDON \u2014 The Latest on Brexit negotiations (all times local):. 1:15 p.m..

He remembered telling Trump \u201cWe take care of our forests,\u201d but couldn\u2019t recall raking coming up.\n\nThe U.S. leader\u2019s comment generated amusement on social media in Finland, which manages its vast forests with scientific seriousness.\n\nForests cover over 70 percent of Finland\u2019s 338,000 square kilometers. The Nordic country with a population of 5.5 million is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest paper and pulp companies.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nOpinion writer\n\n\u201cThe President of the United States maintains that he has absolute, unbridled discretion to decide who can report from inside the White House. Under the President\u2019s view of the law, if he does not like the content of an article that a journalist writes about him, he can deny that journalist access to the White House,\u201d the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association wrote in its amicus brief in support of CNN and White House correspondent Jim Acosta this past week.\n\nThe WHCA brief continued: \u201cIf [President Trump] does not like the viewpoint that a journalist expresses about him, he can deny that journalist access to the White House. If he does not like a question that a journalist asks him, he can deny that journalist access to the White. If he decides that a journalist\u2019s story is \u2018fake news,\u2019 he can deny that journalist access to the White House. In fact, according to the President, if he alone considers a journalist a \u2018bad\u2019 or a \u2018rude\u2019 person, he can deny that journalist access to the White House. And he can do so without providing that journalist with any process whatsoever. The President\u2019s view of the law is wrong.\u201d\n\nThe federal court judge\u2019s ruling, in ordering the White House to hand back Acosta\u2019s press pass, struck a blow for the First Amendment and the rule of law. The president doesn\u2019t get to do whatever he pleases for whatever reason he pleases.\n\nThe WHCA \u2014 along with a gaggle of news organizations, including The Post, which jointly filed its own amicus brief \u2014 understood that if Trump gets away with this conduct, their rights to report and the public\u2019s right to receive their reporting will be impaired. From the WHCA brief: \u201cBeyond the impact that a denial of a hard pass has on the individual plaintiffs in this case, the Court cannot ignore the effect that a decision ratifying the President\u2019s sweeping claim of discretion would have on other journalists and news outlets that regularly cover the White House. Simply stated, if the President were to have the absolute discretion to strip a correspondent of a hard pass, the chilling effect would be severe and the First Amendment protections afforded journalists to gather and report news on the activities on the President would be largely eviscerated.\u201d\n\nCommentators and Hollywood entertainers have warned the media against making this all about them. \u201cThis,\u201d properly understood however, is the ongoing assault on our democracy, its norms and its institutions, including a free press. If not the media organization and reporter suffering harm, who would stand up for the First Amendment? If not in the courts, how are those rights to be vindicated?\n\nCandidly, I think Acosta is often over-the-top and gratuitously aggressive. Many Americans don\u2019t like him one bit. Trump calls him \u201crude.\u201d But that is precisely why we have a First Amendment \u2014 to protect unpopular, impertinent, rude and disruptive speech and similarly unpopular, impertinent, rude and disruptive speakers.\n\nBruce D. Brown and Joshua A. Geltzer explained: \u201cProtecting and encouraging a wide range of views, including vigorously questioning and even criticizing the government, is at the core of the First Amendment\u2019s protections. . . . If those reporters were now to pull their punches \u2014 and, thankfully, we trust that few intend to do so \u2014 it will harm us all. After all, White House correspondents ask questions on behalf of the entire country, as most of us don\u2019t know the right questions to ask, let alone have the opportunity to put those questions to our most senior officials.\u201d\n\nBrown and Geltzer continued, \u201cIn vigorously questioning the President, Acosta engaged in precisely the kind of constitutionally protected newsgathering activity \u2014 including constitutionally protected speech in the form of tough questions \u2014 that the First Amendment safeguards and upon which our democracy depends.\u201d\n\nFor defending the First Amendment and pursuing their rights and all of ours through the courts (another bulwark against authoritarianism), we can say to all involved in litigating this issue, well done."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Azeri opposition leader faces charges after illegal rally", "description": "The head of Azeri opposition party Popular Front faces legal action after authorities arrested him in Baku for attempting to lead an unsanctioned demonstration", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/azeri-opposition-leader-faces-charges-after-illegal-rally/2018/11/18/cd84512a-eb2f-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:45:18Z", "content": "BAKU, Azerbaijan The head of Azeri opposition party Popular Front faces legal action after authorities arrested him in Baku for attempting to lead an unsanctioned demonstration.

(At far left is George Brady.) (The Washington Post)\n\nForty years ago, more than 900 Americans were killed at an agricultural settlement in Guyana known as Jonestown. They were members of the Peoples Temple, a cult with roots in Indiana and Northern California led by a minister named Jim Jones. On Nov. 18, 1978, a visit by a congressman and journalist investigating abuses at Jonestown ended in bloodshed: Jones\u2019s acolytes shot and killed Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif.) and four others as they tried to help several cult members defect; and then Jones ordered the mass suicide-killing of his followers, many of them children, via cyanide poisoning.\n\nTwo weeks later, The Washington Post set out to capture the magnitude of the tragedy by focusing on a few of the victims \u2014 as recalled by relatives who had watched with frustration and horror as their loved ones vanished into the cult and then off to South America, never to be seen again. The story is republished here.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is always so much easier to deal with numbers. They don\u2019t die and rot so you have to wear gauze over your face and peel skin off fingers to get the prints to tell who they are.\n\nIt is comfortable to think about people as numbers when you don\u2019t really want to think about them. In World War I they spoke of \u201cwastage.\u201d During World War II, for 6 million Jews, it was the Final Solution.\n\nYou can say \u201c6 million\u201d and not feel a thing. You can say \u201c911\u201d and study the photographs of the bodies piled up at Jonestown, and it is a horror, all right, but an abstract horror.\n\nHow do you find a human scale for the Jonestown tragedy?\n\nThe story of these varied and scattered lives and how they ended in that steamy compound at Jonestown compels many of us to seek out parallels, references, some anchor that will make it seem more real to us. Some people speak of the bridge of San Luis Rey. Some start talking about an appointment in Samarra. It doesn\u2019t help. We are still left with all those converging fates, those lives so neatly wound up at the same time and place. The impossible mystery of why things happen anyway.\n\nThe Talleys\n\nThere were Maureen and Marlene and Christine Shannon Talley, who came to live with Helen Evans, and went to school in Long Beach and went to Guyana.\n\n\u201cThey were little Irish Dubliners,\u201d said Helen Evans, their aunt. \u201cThey had good report cards. They went to church every Sunday \u2014 Our Lady of Victory. They always wanted to help the underprivileged. They talked about how they wanted to live in the country. But the main thing about these kids was that they wanted to act as a family.\u201d\n\nMarlene was quiet and dark-haired, \u201cshe came back home every day and studied.\u201d Maureen had \u201cfiery red hair, with the disposition that went with it. She was always looking to do good.\u201d And Christine Shannon \u2014 she was her aunt\u2019s favorite, Christine who loved animals and wanted to be a veterinarian, joined the debate club and tutored the other students at the Catholic boarding school to which Helen Evans sent her.\n\n\u201cThey were all beautiful girls,\u201d said their aunt. But their parents\u2019 deaths and the death of a much-loved grandfather seemed to mark them permanently. Their father had been a battalion chief in the Long Beach fire department, a man well-liked by his men. He died of cancer in 1960. Four years later their mother, Betty Talley, died as well, dropped dead in the street, the night before their eldest daughter\u2019s engagement party.\n\n\u201cThey were hit every time they turned around,\u201d said Helen Evans. \u201cAnd Christine simply refused to accept the fact that her parents were dead.\u201d\n\nThe fireman and his wife left five children. Maureen, Marlene and Christine went to live with their aunt in the small frame house in Compton, a lower-income suburb, predominantly black. The eldest girl, Michaeleen, was married within the week of her mother\u2019s funeral. The only son, Ron, got a job in a Long Beach liquor store.\n\nIn Helen Evans\u2019 home, there was a strict upbringing, a firm discipline, a planting of austere principles that were supposed to keep the girls from blowing away in those windy times.\n\n\u201cI believed you should do what you should do when you should do it,\u201d Helen Evans said. There was a 10 p.m. curfew on weekdays, 1 a.m. on Saturday nights. They were never late. \u201cI was conservative, very conservative,\u201d Helen Evans said. \u201cBut I wanted them to have everything they needed, without too many of the fancies.\u201d Christine Shannon went to Europe with her classmates her sophomore year, came back glowing, the way young girls do when the wonder of the world first smiles at them.\n\n\u201cI tried,\u201d said Helen Evans. \u201cI put 11 years into trying.\u201d\n\nMarlene was the first to go. She had married the year she graduated from high school and was married for four or five years; it didn\u2019t work out. She had two young sons, she had no job, and she had very little money. She had always been very religious.\n\nShe was living in San Francisco in 1970, near the Peoples Temple. She told her aunt about the people there, and it may have been that they helped her with the food and support that living alone with two young children demanded. At the Temple they told her about the ranch in Ukiah, Calif., and she told her aunt how it seemed as if it might be a nice place to raise two young sons. She visited the ranch in the fall. In the spring, she moved there, working as a housekeeper in the compound there where retarded adults were cared for.\n\nOne by one, the others followed her, as quietly as leaves falling in a forest. Ron was next; he brought his ex-wife with him. And then Maureen and her former husband. Maureen went to work as a nurse in Ukiah, and Ron went to work for a large company there. Broken marriages and the hard scratch for money were buried, it seemed, among new dreams and duties in northern California.\n\nMichaeleen had worked as a beautician after her own marriage broke up, until she fell ill and could no longer care for her two daughters. Her sisters came and took the children away. Michaeleen could not get them back. She too went to Ukiah.\n\n\u201cI was nervous all the time,\u201d Helen Evans said. \u201cBut back then, you remember those times, all the young ones were doing their own thing, they were joining all sorts of groups and religions, it seemed to be in the air.\u201d\n\nNow there were eight of them together \u2014 three of the sisters, their brother, the four children. They were united now, except for Christine, and every other week they would come to Los Angeles on the big crowded buses filled with the faithful.\n\nThe family would visit their aunt. They said little about the cult, using only the brightest of paints and the broadest of brushes to describe their new lives. And they would call, to urge their aunt to let Christine come to Ukiah, calling often from the time Christine was 14 until the time she was 17.\n\nSometimes, some of the other members of the Temple would get on the line as well and urge Evans to let Christine come to Ukiah.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want her to go,\u201d Helen Evans said. \u201cI wanted her to wait until she was old enough to make up her own mind.\u201d Besides, there were other considerations. The children had been raised on their dead father\u2019s pension. As they grew up and left Evans\u2019 home, the money reverted to Christine. By the time she was 18, there was $57,000 saved.\n\nWhen Christine came close to reaching her majority, Helen Evans consulted with the school psychologist, the counselors. \u201cI wanted to do the right thing,\u201d she said, and so she sought their advice. They told her, and she agreed, that it would be useless to keep Christine from the Temple if she wanted to go, that the harvest would be bitterness and resentment. Christine went.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever political with her,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI think she just wanted to be with her brothers and sisters.\u201d Christine spent her senior year at the high school in Ukiah. Her aunt asked that her report cards be sent to her, to make sure she stayed in school. The report cards said she was doing well.\n\nChristine turned 18, old enough to assume control of the $57,000. She wrote her aunt, asking her to have the lawyer transfer the money to the cult\u2019s lawyer in Ukiah. \u201cI don\u2019t think she ever saw that money,\u201d Helen Evans said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even buy a new car for herself.\u201d\n\nMichaeleen was not very happy. \u201cShe didn\u2019t believe everything she was told,\u201d said her aunt. Michaeleen would leave the Temple and take her two daughters. At first, she would come to her aunt\u2019s house. After a while, she went elsewhere. \u201cShe knew,\u201d said Helen Evans, \u201cthat I would be the first one they\u2019d call. They always found her.\u201d And brought her back.\n\nEvery year, on her birthday, Evans would receive a beautifully made card from Christine. She said she was well. She gave her aunt her love.\n\nThe nine didn\u2019t tell their aunt they were moving to Guyana. The first letter was from Michaeleen in August of 1977. \u201cI\u2019m doing well,\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re growing all sorts of fruits and vegetables. I\u2019m going to stay. I\u2019m free and happy now and the girls are also with me and you know how important that is to me.\u201d\n\nA few other letters followed, dry as the paper they were written on, sounding, Helen Evans later discovered, just like all the other letters that the relatives from other families received.\n\nLast summer, there was a letter from Christine. \u201cI\u2019m the happiest I have ever been in my life,\u201d it said. \u201cMy family\u2019s close to me and I\u2019m in a beautiful country where it\u2019s warm and green all the time. . . . I have wonderful opportunities here . . . enough to keep a blossoming veterinarian busy. . . . Our senior citizens seem to do so well. The sun gives them a healthy look. . . . I wish you could picture the beautiful jungle.\u201d\n\nIt will cost $15,000 to bury the nine. Helen Evans does not think it fair. Now they have all been \u201cofficially\u201d identified and the plans have been made to bring them back, to bury them in Long Beach.\n\nHelen Evans remembered the day Maureen and Marlene came to the house in Compton \u2014 for Christine. The old aunt took her niece into the bedroom. \u201cI told her it was up to her to make the decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked her if she wanted to go. She said, \u2018I guess I\u2019ll go.\u2019\u201d Just then, just as the question had been asked and answered, the two sisters walked into the bedroom. The conversation was over.\n\n\u201cNow that I look back,\u201d said Helen Evans, \u201cthere was no excitement in Christine\u2019s voice, no enthusiasm. I often wonder what she would have done, if only the others hadn\u2019t walked in, at that moment.\u201d \u2014 L.D.\n\n\n\nThe scene of carnage at Jonestown, where more than 900 people died at the order of Rev. Jim Jones. (Frank Johnston/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Heaths\n\nThe Peoples Temple is a broad beige brick building in a poor-looking part of the Fillmore district, in effect San Francisco\u2019s black ghetto. A fast-food place stands on one side and an auditorium on the other. At night, police cars park outside the Temple, and a floodlight turns the adjacent alley dead white.\n\nBehind, in the big parking lot, stand several large buses and many cars. It looks like the backyard of any busy church that goes in for trips and picnics and outings.\n\nThe only thing wrong is that many of the cars are so thick with dust you can hardly tell what color they are.\n\n\u201cI believe this happened for a reason. They were chosen for this. It was meant as a warning to the whole world.\u201d\n\nNathaniel Alexander is 33. He and his brothers Steven and Robert own a plumbing business in Oakland. But Bobby isn\u2019t here at the moment because he has gone east to try and identify the bodies. There are six.\n\nThere is the grandmother, Mary Cottingham, 83. Their mother, Florence Heath, 53. Their uncle Grover Washington, 50. Their sister Mary Morton, 37, and her daughter Vicki, 10. And their 14-year-old brother Michael Heath.\n\nNate Alexander used to argue with his mother about the Temple. He went a couple of times himself, \u201cto see what she was getting into\u201d; but it didn\u2019t seem like a church to him. The first time he went, people wanted to know his address and other things about him. That wasn\u2019t so bad, but the second time there were red-hatted guards and Jim Jones, the man his mother thought so much of, was \u201cpreaching evil things, scaring people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first the changes in her were good,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was active and happy, and I was glad to see her getting out and around. It gave her something to do. She was getting through a divorce at the time. It was \u201972.\u201d\n\nEven though it meant commuting nearly 50 miles from Pittsburg, far on the other side of Oakland, Florence Heath still made the Peoples Temple the center of her life.\n\nShe was one of those who cooked for the others there; she drove people who needed rides; she visited the sick; she went on the Temple\u2019s famously uncomfortable bus trips to Los Angeles and other cities. Things were done for her too: medical attention, instructions about diet and healthy living.\n\n\u201cNate,\u201d she would say, \u201cI\u2019ve been in churches all my days, and nobody\u2019s done anything like this man has done.\u201d\n\nShe said Jim Jones was her God. \u201cAt least I have a God I can see,\u201d she would say, and when her son brought out the Bible to dispute her, she would say the Bible was just a white man\u2019s tool.\n\n\u201cWe talked about it every time she came over,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI told her Jones was a devil, and even though he was white he was telling them all this stuff about black genocide, things he thought they wanted to hear. Finally we agreed to stop arguing because she was afraid Jones would retaliate.\u201d\n\nFlorence Heath believed Jones could literally hear what they said there in Alexander\u2019s downtown Oakland apartment. And his sister Mary claimed Jones had cured her of cancer.\n\n(Alexander\u2019s aunt Essie Mae Flynn had no such luck. Her sister brought her down from Pittsburg, where she still lives in a country housing project, to be treated by Jones for her bad heart, epilepsy, asthma and a nervous condition. She got so sick that she had to be put to bed upstairs at the Temple. Later she went on a trip to Los Angeles with the group and was taken desperately ill, spending three weeks in a hospital. Essie Flynn, 49, never went back to the Temple. It wasn\u2019t a church, she said, wasn\u2019t truly ordained, so she and her sister and mother drew apart, though they remained on friendly terms.)\n\nFlorence Heath was born in Florence County, but soon moved to Queens, N.Y., to a house behind Kennedy Airport. Her husband was a construction worker.\n\nShe divorced him and married Alexander\u2019s father, a master sergeant in the Army, and for some years the family moved around the country: Takoma, Wash.; Seaside, Calif.; Georgia; South Carolina. Twenty years ago they moved to Pittsburg.\n\nHer brother, Timothy Washington, told reporters he believed she had sold the Pittsburg house for $25,000, giving half to her husband and half to Jim Jones, along with her car; but Nate Alexander says he knows nothing of all this and doesn\u2019t care to speculate about it.\n\nIn any case, she did sell the house and came to San Francisco. Alexander thought she would buy a place here, but instead she simply lived at the Temple, and then suddenly was off for Guyana.\n\n\u201cShe was a very helpful person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always concerned for her relatives and family and involved in other people. She was a housewife most of her life, but she did start some kind of nursing program to learn to take care of patients. She made some income from that, and then there was the alimony.\u201d\n\nHe got his last letter from her in March. Like all the others and like the letters from his sister, it was full of happiness. She wrote about the good fresh food they had at Jonestown, and how they had doctors and dentists and no crime.\n\nEven Grover, whom she had brought along because he needed someone to care for him, had learned to work and for the first time in his life to do something for himself, she wrote to another family member.\n\nNate Alexander didn\u2019t want his mother\u2019s last letter quoted. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep that private,\u201d he said. Most of the family snapshots have been taken to the State Department to help with identification, but he did have one small picture of Vicki Morton when she was even younger than her 10 years. He didn\u2019t want to part with that, either.\n\n\u201cIt was a sign of the times, this thing. People are confused and perplexed, and the morality, the economic system, are deteriorating. The monetary system is breaking down. Everything is corrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get wrapped up in an individual like Jones. You have to listen to what\u2019s being said. I can see his appeal \u2014 they\u2019ve been hearing stuff all their lives and nothing happens, and then he comes along and he produces, he gets action. That town wasn\u2019t just some dream, it was really there. But you\u2019ve got to be aware of what\u2019s happening, and not put your faith in a man. Those you thought might do something for you turn out to be just as corrupt as the rest. You\u2019re on your own, and you have to realize that.\u201d \u2014 M.K.\n\n\n\nJohn Cobb, who lost 11 relatives at Jonestown, looks at the names on a memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, Calif., this month. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nThe Rozynkos\n\nTen years ago, when Michael Rozynko was 11, his parents divorced. He had liked both his parents and had adjusted easily to the moves they made up and down the West Coast as their medical jobs changed. Then when the marriage disintegrated, he withdrew.\n\n\u201cThe breakup had a shattering effect on him. Mike was really a genius, but he fell apart,\u201d said his younger sister, Sandy. The three Rozynko children, Chris, Mike and Sandy, stayed with their mother Annie, a registered nurse, in Ukiah, Calif.\n\nAt school Rozynko was teased because he was short and fat. He seemed to find companionship only in food and books. His mother, a native of New Jersey who had moved out west at an early age and married a psychologist, shared his loneliness. She didn\u2019t have many friends, but she found Marceline Jones, wife of local minister Jim Jones, very sympathetic.\n\nOut of curiosity, and loneliness, she attended a meeting at Jones\u2019 church at Redwood Valley. \u201cMy mother dragged us, forced us to go. I was scared because everyone was singing these religious church songs,\u201d recalled Sandy Rozynko Mills, who joined the Peoples Temple with the rest of her family but left in 1975.\n\nMike Rozynko, who had been raised a nominal Presbyterian like his brother and sister, seemed to find himself. His scholastic record shot up to straight A\u2019s, he took up photography as a hobby and began to talk of medical school.\n\nHis mother found the emotional support she needed, though she questioned every statement of Jim Jones. \u201cMy mother was a very intelligent woman who lacked confidence. With the church she found support, just the feeling someone she knew was there,\u201d said Mills. At the church meetings, said her daughter, she would probe Jones\u2019 possessive philosophy. Her outspokenness embarrassed her children. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a person to join the crowd, but she was afraid to be alone.\u201d Mills left home when she was 13 because of what she described as her mother\u2019s strictness, but she didn\u2019t immediately leave the church. Chris Rozynko stayed home until he finished high school. Mike moved to a commune before he finished high school.\n\nThe two Rozynko boys had their own dreams. But, then, as Jim Jones began to think more and more of his followers as possessions, he dictated his own dreams for his young followers. Chris was forbidden to go to a law school where had been accepted. Mike was told the Temple was more important than medical school.\n\n\u201cMike had really looked forward to college, he really wanted to be a doctor. But Jones said that professional schools for the younger people kept them from being involved in the cause. The cause turned out to be him.\u201d\n\nSandy Mills, now 19, her ruddy complexion pale from her personal loss of her brothers and mother in Guyana, bent her long, blond, frizzed hair over her coffee cup. For awhile she turned the white cup round and round and didn\u2019t speak.\n\nIn his own way, while retaining his loyalty to the Temple, Mike Rozynko fulfilled his goal. He became a registered ambulance driver. At the Temple he became the photographer for the publishing center and would spend hours discussing different methods of photography.\n\nOnce, before her family moved to Guyana, Mills tried to talk to Mike. \u201cI told him that I loved him and that he would always have a place to come to if he left the Temple. His responses were very mechanical, unreal.\u201d\n\nJust last summer Mills talked to Mike on a ham radio. \u201cI said the people are not being hung from the Golden Gate Bridge, like you are being told. The Ku Klux Klan is not marching through the streets.\u201d Mills said she tried to keep her voice matter of fact, but her hope that her brother was really listening plummeted when he replied: \u201cWe know what you are doing. Why are you hurting my friend?\u201d Mills answered, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d And the last thing she ever heard her brother say was: \u201cYou know what you are doing.\u201d \u2014 J.T.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view from 1978 of the Peoples Temple compound in Jonestown, Guyana. (AP/AP)\n\nLeon Perry\n\nLeon Perry, 61, never went in for frills. He loved his family, his church and his machines. Around the Protestant church he had supported for many years and around his low-income San Francisco neighborhood he was known as Brother Perry. And that\u2019s what his family called him, with firm admiration for a man who never drank, gambled, cussed or danced. That\u2019s what they called him at the Peoples Temple.\n\n\u201cNo one is saying he was a saint because he did move up to Ukiah with a woman when he got involved with Jim Jones,\u201d said the oldest of Perry\u2019s two daughters, Veronica, 30. \u201cBut he was a good man, a man with his own means. He wasn\u2019t a lazy person who hid behind welfare.\u201d\n\nIt seems Brother Perry did work his own way. When World War II broke out, Perry left his childhood home of Beaumont, Tex., joined the Army and settled in San Francisco. An eighth-grade graduate, he drove a bus for the city, worked as a mechanic for the city and 12 years ago bought two Peter-Built trucks and did independent long-distance hauling.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t working on his trucks, he doted on his two daughters and his wife, Ruby, a cosmetologist. When Ruby, a practicing Roman Catholic, went to a dance, Perry stayed at home, waited for her call and then picked her up. Once he gave his daughters a red table, two red chairs and a pile of transfers from the bus company. They played bus.\n\nSeven years ago, right after a mild heart attack, Perry seemed to change. \u201cI think it was because no one from his church ever came by with any food or good wishes,\u201d said Veronica Perry. Sitting in a soul-food luncheonette in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore district, she angrily pushed aside a plate of fried chicken, and flipped through a family photo album. Brother Perry was a well-built man, appearing taller than his 5 feet 9 inches, with close-cropped hair, a thumbnail mustache and bright, friendly eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s not much that\u2019s negative about him. He did have a temper and once stopped the bus he was driving and yelled at some people fooling around in the back.\u201d\n\nHis daughter said this quickly, even though she does admit their differences, over her alliance with black nationalist organizations in the 1960s and over Jim Jones\u2019s purposes. He told her \u201call white people aren\u2019t bad,\u201d she said, laughing a laugh of distress and bitterness. \u201cNow what can I say? He had a strong belief in brotherhood.\u201d\n\nIn 1972 Perry moved to Ukiah, shared a house with a woman and operated his trucks for the Peoples Temple. \u201cThe trucks kept his name on them, but I am sure he gave Jones the money,\u201d said his daughter. \u201cBut he would be happy anywhere as long as he thought he would be doing something with his trucks.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1977, he came by his former home to tell his family he was going to Guyana. By this time his wife had divorced him. His daughters overheard him say he was going to haul dirt and lumber so Jim Jones could build a village in the jungle. Three months after his departure, his former wife had a massive stroke and remained in a coma for two months. Veronica Perry\u2019s $8 telegram went unanswered and, she said, her request to use the ham radio at the Peoples Temple headquarters was denied. Once she was told by Temple members, she recalled emotionally, \u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d When her father finally wrote, all he said was, \u201cHow is everything?\u201d and spoke of how the climate was helping his hypertension and his weight control.\n\nThe last time Veronica saw him, Leon Perry seemed to get extreme pleasure from the cup of tea he was drinking at her mother\u2019s kitchen table. \u201cAnd all it was was Lipton\u2019s, but I have been thinking about how he really enjoyed it.\u201d \u2014 J.T.\n\nLaurence E. Schacht\n\nThe other doctors at San Francisco General Hospital, especially the experienced ones, liked Laurence E. Schacht. He was quiet, intent, slightly more dedicated and anxious to please than the other interns who joined the staff in the summer of 1977.\n\nSchacht, a soft-spoken man of medium build with thinning light-brown hair, wore a tie and didn\u2019t espouse the nontraditional forms of medicine, like a natural food diet and acupuncture, that some of his young co-workers did. \u201cHe was plain, not very vocal. It was your effort to get to know him,\u201d remembered Brent Blue, the chief resident of family practice at the hospital. Schacht was assigned to the pediatrics out-patient clinic.\n\nSchacht, who grew up in Houston and left no legacy there except a restless annoyance with those who criticized his family\u2019s anti-Vietnam war views, arrived at the hospital with the highest recommendations. He had left Houston after finishing high school in 1967, joined the antiwar effort in California and then went to Guadalajara University. At some point he joined the Peoples Temple and they paid for his tuition. He finished medical school at the University of California at Irvine, 16th in his class.\n\nBack home in Houston, Schacht is remembered as a quiet youngster. His father, Ezra, is a self-employed electrical worker and his brother Danny, 33, works with the family firm. \u201cRight now all I can remember is that he was interested in art. He liked to draw. Ambitious? I can\u2019t recall. He was a typical teen-ager,\u201d said his father. Recalled Duke Lane, one of his high school teachers, \u201cEvidently he was just an ordinary student. I really can\u2019t recall him.\u201d In the Lamar High School Annual for 1966, Schacht\u2019s junior year, he is pictured with a group of fellow students who judged the bulletin board contest. In his graduating year, 1967, he is listed with the students who didn\u2019t have their pictures taken.\n\nWherever he worked, Schacht is remembered for his unobtrusive, steady presence. One former member of the Peoples Temple recalled, \u201cHe hardly ever said anything. I never saw him smile or crack a joke.\u201d\n\nAt the hospital one child-health worker spoke of his reliability and reticence. \u201cHe was very conscientious and particularly interested in nutrition, asking how to prepare diet and mix formulas,\u201d said Doris Wong, 24.\n\nA few weeks into his internship, Schacht took a vacation, unexplained and hurried. Then, one of his professors received a call from a woman claiming to be Shacht\u2019s sister. \u201cHis father,\u201d she explained, was in South America suffering from meningitis. \u201cHe wanted you to know that only something of that magnitude would take him away,\u201d the woman told the professor.\n\nIn the Guyana complex Schacht trained paramedics, had his own medical cabin and delivered twins by ham radio. The last person who saw Schacht, a Jonestown teacher who escaped, reported that he was brewing cyanide and Kool-Aid and spooning the liquid into the mouths of babies. \u2014 J.T.\n\n\n\nJordan Vilchez, a former Peoples Temple member, sits at memorial for victims at the Jonestown settlement in Guyana this year. (Kevin Kunishi/AP)\n\nKaren Tow Layton\n\nShe could have skipped through life, just being beautiful, gifted and comfortable in the affluent surroundings of her home, Paradise, Calif. But Karen Tow Layton, 31, was not cut from the conservative mold of her community and friends. She wanted to walk through the trenches.\n\nSo Karen Tow, the petite blond Miss Paradise of 1965, went to a nearby migrant labor camp and fought the bosses until they tore down the tar-paper shacks. It was a lonely battle. \u201cBut she was vocal about injustices, more outspoken than her friends,\u201d said her mother, Lea Tow. An old boyfriend, Carl Stackey, now a rice farmer, concurred: \u201cShe was concerned about the underprivileged and minorities. She was the most politically oriented person in our class.\u201d Besides her own efforts, Tow was an ally of Virginia Franklin, who was the focus of a celebrated case in which she was accused of teaching communism in the classroom.\n\nThat case put Paradise on the national map. Paradise is a small community with pine trees and clear air in the foothills of the Sierra Mountains. It was not too slow for Karen Tow but too stodgy politically. \u201cShe was affected greatly by the terrible times of the 1960s, by the racism, by the killing of the children in Alabama,\u201d recalled her mother, Lea Layton. \u201cShe accused her father of being a racist. There was a rift and I was torn between the two. But she was the radiance in our lives and she stayed at home until her second year in college.\u201d\n\nAfter two years at Chico State College, where she studied social work, Tow went to Hawaii to live with a man. The romance soured very quickly and she returned to take a job as a secretary in Ukiah. It was 1968. She was disillusioned about society at large, remembered her mother, but content with her own life. No one thought of her as a joiner. \u201cShe had a very positive attitude about life. You never had the feeling she could be swayed,\u201d said Thomas Dimas, a former teacher.\n\nSuddenly, however, Tow joined the Peoples Temple and became uncommunicative. \u201cWhen I asked to go, she said I wouldn\u2019t understand. It was eight years before I got into the church,\u201d said her mother. Tow married Larry Layton, now accused of murder by the Guyanese, but she told her mother and her older sister that it was \u201ca friendship, not a marriage.\u201d\n\nOne of Karen Tow Layton\u2019s stories about those years stands out. She went to an orthopedic surgeon to check a pain in her arm, and he diagnosed cancer. He told her she might have to have the arm amputated. The minute Karen got home, her mother recalled, the phone rang and the Rev. Jim Jones told Karen she had been to the doctor and that she had cancer. He suggested she ride to San Francisco with him. Along the way he occasionally touched her arm, Karen\u2019s mother recalled her saying, and when she got to San Francisco she realized the pain was gone. \u201cYou\u2019ve cured me,\u201d she told Jones.\n\n\u201cNow when you hear a story like this from your own daughter, you begin to take a second look,\u201d Lea Tow said. Eventually she attended a healing session herself and \u201creceived a message from Jones during the service that she would suffer.\u201d Six months later she had a massive heart attack. \u201cI was taken in for a year. Then I began to see that his message was socialism. I couldn\u2019t buy that,\u201dsaid Lea Tow.\n\nAt the Temple, Karen did secretarial work, always appeared attentive to Jones\u2019 sermons and lived in the San Francisco headquarters in a small, neat but sparse bedroom. One former member remembered Karen being chastised for being vain, but said she was steadfast in her loyalty.\n\nWhen Lea Tow told her daughter Jones was \u201cpsychotic,\u201d she didn\u2019t listen. Then in July 1977 Karen wrote her mother and asked her to take care of her dog. Again and again Lea Tow wrote her letters saying Jones\u2019 teachings and justice were frauds. Now, sitting by the phone in her home in Paradise, with the dog barking in the background, Lea Tow says, \u201cI tried and I didn\u2019t make it.\u201d \u2014 J.T."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chuck.culpepper1", "title": "Washington State win a prolific precursor to college football's jam packed week ahead - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Washington State win a prolific precursor to college football's jam packed week ahead Washington Post NEW YORK \u2014 Only in a football-addled country with far too many time zones could the citizens have had to comprehend the following at almost 1\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/18/washington-state-win-prolific-precursor-college-footballs-jam-packed-week-ahead/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_6gZzeLJ9SvObZ6maa27NaTTcNg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PT3HSGHK6MI6RL7R53BJW34SZI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T12:00:21Z", "content": "NEW YORK Only in a football-addled country with far too many time zones could the citizens have had to comprehend the following at almost 1 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, on top of all else.

Halftime total yards: Washington State 407, Arizona fewer. First-half touchdown-drive lengths: Washington State 75, 53, 49, 79, 75, 54, 80. Nutty first-half touchdowns on kickoff fumble recoveries: Washington State 1. Halftime numbers for Washington State quarterback Gardner Minshew: 28-for-33 for 311 yards, five touchdowns, zero interceptions.\n\nNumber of Minshew receivers in first half: 11.\n\nNumber of catch-less receivers left in Pullman, Wash.: few.\n\nHe might have left out some of the men at that fire station nearby.\n\nAlready the put-upon citizens of the nation were supposed to shovel into their college football-harassed brains The Citadel\u2019s halftime tie with eternal No. 1 Alabama; Ohio State\u2019s incomprehensible 52-51 overtime win over Maryland; the further ascendancy of Notre Dame; the deflation that happened in Stillwater, Okla.; the further deflation of Virginia Tech; the utter deflation of Southern California; and the impossible ending of the Utah State-Colorado State game in a dreamy Utah State season.\n\n[College football winners and losers: Questions continue to mount for struggling USC]\n\nIt\u2019s hard to cram in Pullman, but cram in Pullman we must. Because on Friday, it will become the site of another enticing Apple Cup, with Washington State the last conceivable Pacific-12 hope for the College Football Playoff, but with Washington inbound after having won their last three meetings 45-10, 45-17 and 41-14, thus maybe having figured out something.\n\nTack that thought onto a Thanksgiving weekend that already had a towering Michigan vs. Ohio State, a slightly diminished Oklahoma vs. West Virginia, Notre Dame\u2019s traditional visit to Southern California and \u2014 don\u2019t forget \u2014 the Utah State-Boise State scrap for the Mountain Division of the Mountain West.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that even the Iron Bowl goes submerged, in part because Auburn would appear to be headed to Bryant-Denny Stadium for a mauling. After Alabama forged halftime leads this season of 28-0 (Louisville), 40-0 (Arkansas State), 49-7 (Ole Miss), 31-13 (Texas A&M), 49-0 (Louisiana), 41-14 (Arkansas), 30-10 (Missouri), 42-14 (Tennessee), 16-0 (LSU) and 21-0 (Mississippi State), it took The Citadel \u2014 from the third-tier Football Championship Subdivision \u2014 to reach halftime in Tuscaloosa with a 10-10 draw.\n\nClearly, the College Football Playoff should award The Citadel a half-trophy.\n\nAlabama\u2019s eventual 50-17 win came larded with hilarity, as when Coach Nick Saban tried to say, \u201cI think there are some lessons to be learned today,\u201d when actually he exists precisely for such moments, and when he said of Heisman Trophy front-runner Tua Tagovailoa, \u201cI thought he played pretty well. I think he was 18-for-22.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether all listeners in the room managed to retain from laughing at that.\n\nOhio State\u2019s venture to College Park had its various fumbles into the end zone with various results, its fake punt, its occasions of Urban Meyer\u2019s bent-over stress, its 1,423 total yards, its 200 rushing yards for Maryland\u2019s Anthony McFarland before halftime, his 298 overall, and the game\u2019s closing overthrow, but mainly it had a preservation of the fact that both No. 4 Michigan and No. 10 Ohio State will remain 10-1 as they gather for their annual festival of malice come noon Saturday in Columbus.\n\nIt could have formed the nightcap of a swell Friday-Saturday doubleheader in close geographical range, but then something weird happened Saturday in Stillwater. No. 9 West Virginia (8-1) led so-so Oklahoma State (5-5) 41-31 with 7:37 left and a Friday night date with No. 6 Oklahoma (10-1) up ahead, but then saw the Cowboys go 78 and 75 yards for closing scores at 4:47 and 0:42, and saw next Friday night annex a sigh.\n\n\u201cThey have been in a lot of these games,\u201d West Virginia Coach Dana Holgorsen said of Oklahoma State, \u201cand you can tell they had a little bit better mind-set down the stretch than we did. It\u2019s disappointing that we had a chance to close them out and we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to objective sorts as well, as the West Virginia loss epitomized the top-heaviness of college football this season. It left the Mountaineers as, stunningly, one of only two two-loss teams among the 65 in the Power Five. It left probably eight teams with a shot at the playoff, with two-loss LSU included if a smattering of things happen. And it left the Big 12 in a big stew with Oklahoma at 7-1, West Virginia at 6-2, Texas at 6-2, and the Oklahoma-West Virginia loser probably out of the conference championship game.\n\nFirmly into the playoff setting lies Notre Dame (11-0), which looked thoroughly masterful against No. 12 Syracuse in a 36-3 win until quarterback Ian Book looked ahead to the Irish\u2019s final game and said, bewilderingly, \u201cUSC\u2019s a great team, so we\u2019re going to have to bring our A game.\u201d\n\n[Notre Dame makes College Football Playoff point, holding Syracuse pretty much pointless]\n\nHearing that, the fans of Southern California might have wondered if \u201cgreat\u201d means 5-6 and losing 34-27 to a UCLA that just ascended to 3-8 in a sadly tepid Rose Bowl. They might have seen benevolence in the words of the Sacramento native Book as they reserve no benevolence for fourth-year Coach Clay Helton, the former interim who seems days from being a former coach. They know that to get to the playoff at 12-0, Notre Dame can bring to Los Angeles its C-minus game.\n\nYet as misery makes its customary visits across the land from Los Angeles to Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech just finished careening to 4-6 while Miami (Fla.) oddly pounced, there\u2019s happiness out there to consider. An incredible season in Logan, Utah, has just found itself a singular moment on its way to Boise.\n\nAs 45-year-old Coach Matt Wells had guided the school for which he once played quarterback to 9-1 and a 29-24 lead Saturday at Colorado State, doom came in a 34-yard, desperation, last-play, touchdown pass from the Rams\u2019 Collin Hill to Preston Williams. Colorado State celebrated the win. The scoreboard registered it.\n\nThen the officials properly nixed it, having noticed dutifully that Williams\u2019s route to the end zone featured a veer out of bounds. The lead official announced the reversal. Luckily or unluckily, Colorado State already stood 3-7, a fact that helped lessen both the crowd and the amount of anguish. \u201cSurvive and advance,\u201d Wells said, \u201clike in the NCAA Tournament. I\u2019m going to celebrate after a win like this. I\u2019m going to let the players celebrate all the way until Monday. We have a special season going.\u201d\n\nAnd while he clearly had lost his mind to let players celebrate all the way to Monday, his linebacker Jontrell Rocquemore told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something like that. I went from my all-time low to, \u2018Oh, my gosh. I just won!\u2019 Sometimes, winning is ugly.\u201d He had just begun to process that which can\u2019t be processed in an incomprehensible country where, by just after 2 a.m., Washington State had won, 69-28.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland vs. Ohio State had nearly everything but a breakthrough win for the Terps\n\nOn the hunt for a special win, Virginia football misses the mark\n\nNavy holds off Tulsa to snap seven-game losing streak\n\n\u2018Big Game\u2019 between Cal and Stanford postponed due to poor air quality"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ronald G.

President Eisenhower started the first televised news conferences in 1955, but these were recorded and selected clips that were released to the press later.\n\n[Trump\u2019s \u2018Fake News Awards\u2019: Nothing like the first White House press conference]\n\nKennedy began live televised news conferences on Jan. 25, 1961. He often called on 72-year-old Craig, who was a seasoned war correspondent. On the woman question, Kennedy answered further: \u201cI must say I am a strong believer in equal pay for equal work, and I think that we ought to do better than we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019m glad that you reminded me of it, Mrs. Craig.\u201d\n\nMcClendon, who headed a group of small newspapers in Texas, brought what she called \u201ca pushy and sometimes confrontational\u201d style to news conferences. In 1958, she pressed Eisenhower on why his administration wasn\u2019t doing more to combat the recession. The president\u2019s face reddened, and he clenched his fist as he began his answer: \u201cNow, look \u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nReporter Sarah McClendon stands outside the White House in 1969. McClendon, who covered every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush, died in 2003 at the age of 92. (Bob Daugherty/AP)\n\nMcClendon\u2019s tactics sometimes got results. At a news conference in early 1974 she complained to then-President Richard Nixon that some Vietnam veterans were running into delays getting government checks to pay for college. When Nixon said the problem had been addressed, McClendon retorted: \u201cNo, you\u2019re just misinformed.\u201d\n\nThe president later said in a radio broadcast that because of questions from \u201ca very spirited reporter\u201d he had ordered changes. \u201cSarah McClendon,\u201d Nixon once said, \u201casks questions that no man would ever think of.\u201d\n\nNot everybody appreciated the \u201clittle lady with the big voice,\u201d as McClendon described herself. President George H.W. Bush warned her, \u201cThe loudest voice won\u2019t always get recognized because it isn\u2019t fair to the others.\u201d Eric Sevareid of CBS News said McClendon was a \u201clady who has been known to give rudeness a bad name at times.\u201d McClendon died in 2003 at age 92.\n\nThomas started covering the Kennedy White House for United Press International in 1961. She immediately gained a reputation as a tough questioner. Kennedy said of her, \u201cHelen would be a nice girl if she\u2019d ever get rid of that pad and pencil.\u201d\n\nThomas didn\u2019t stop asking pesky questions. When President Clinton called on Thomas to ask the first question following revelations about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Thomas said, \u201cYou may not like it.\u201d She then pressed Clinton about his previous denials of any involvement. When George H.W. Bush announced that the defense budget wouldn\u2019t be cut after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall, Thomas asked him, \u201cWho\u2019s the enemy?\u201d In 2006, she asked President George W. Bush, \u201cWhy did you really go to war\u201d in Iraq?\n\n[The first black female White House reporter had to pawn her watch every week just to eat]\n\nIn 1975, Thomas became the first female president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. She quit UPI in 2000 and soon joined the Hearst newspapers. Her long career abruptly ended under a cloud of controversy in 2010 after Thomas, who was of Lebanese descent, said Jews should leave Palestinian territories. She died in 2013 at age 92.\n\n\n\nThen-President Jimmy Carter talks to reporters Helen Thomas and Sam Donaldson aboard Air Force One in 1979. (Charles Tasnadi/AP)\n\nABC\u2019s Donaldson became known for shouting questions at presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Donaldson was all business all the time. When Reagan talked to reporters about his meeting with Mother Teresa, Donaldson bellowed: \u201cWhat about the tax bill?\"\n\nSome confrontations took place in the press briefing room that Nixon had installed over the White House swimming pool. Reagan\u2019s press secretary James Brady joked the president planned to install a button on his podium that he could press to open a trap door under reporters \u201cwho got out of line.\u201d The briefing room is now named after Brady, who was shot and badly wounded during the 1981 attempted assassination of Reagan. Brady died in 2014.\n\nDonaldson\u2019s bluster never led to his being banned. Indeed, Reagan seemed to enjoy the confrontations. Once when the TV newsman asked Reagan whether he took any blame for the lingering recession in the early 1980s, the president quipped, \u201cYes, because for many years I was a Democrat.\u201d Donaldson, who retired in 2013, is supporting the CNN lawsuit challenging the White House ouster of Acosta after Trump called the reporter \u201ca rude, terrible person.\u201d Donaldson, now 84, said, \u201cPresident Harry Truman summed up the necessary interplay between a president and the press corps when he advised government officials at every level: \u2018If you can\u2019t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven some journalists say Acosta sometimes draws too much attention to himself, but that pushing for answers is the job of White House reporters.

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTwo years have passed since Donald Trump made his famous campaign promise in disaffected regions across the country: \u201cWe are going to start winning again!\u201d For many voters who felt that they had lost ground in recent decades, the candidate argued, a vote for him would be rewarded with renewed prosperity and prominence.\n\nIt was a classic campaign promise, overly ambitious and cleverly vague. What exactly did \u201cwinning\u201d mean? Certainly, many reporters believed voters perceived the promise as an economic one. So let\u2019s measure the promise\u2019s success that way. How have Trump voters fared economically, compared with Hillary Clinton voters?\n\nNot noticeably better, according to the data. By most measures, my latest research shows, Trump counties \u2014 and especially counties with higher proportions of Trump voters \u2014 continue to fall farther behind the rest of the country economically. The story of our economy, like the story of our politics, continues to be a story of division and divergence.\n\nTrump\u2019s America vs. Clinton\u2019s America\n\nIt is no secret that the country is as geographically fractured as it is economically unequal. In fact, the two trends are intertwined. In separate studies, economists Rebecca Diamond and Peter Ganong and Daniel Shoag revealed a widening gap in incomes, skills and wages between low-income and high-income regions, beginning around 1980. After decades of converging, in other words, our cities and states have been growing apart. The wider the income gap grows between the regions, they show, the harder it becomes for those in service and even blue-collar jobs to afford to live in high-income, high-rent places with high-quality amenities such as clean air, good schools, low crime, strong job markets, transportation infrastructure and retail stores.\n\nDriven out of thriving communities by those rents, people who were just getting by are surrounded by others who were also struggling, in areas that the better-off had fled. That leaves a skimpy tax base, shrunken opportunities and economic segregation.\n\nThus, we increasingly live in two Americas, and we vote accordingly.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nConsider the stark differences in basic measures of local economic performance \u2014 employment and housing prices \u2014 between counties where the majority of votes were cast for Donald Trump and counties where the majority voted for Hillary Clinton. The average Clinton county employs seven to eight times as many workers as the average Trump county, with nearly double the market value per single-family home. In part, this difference reflects the higher population density of the urban areas, which voted disproportionately for Clinton. But as my analysis shows, it has been growing over time, as the Clinton counties outperform their Trump counterparts.\n\nPost-election, the more things change, the more they stay the same?\n\nAfter November 2016, many Trump supporters told reporters that they expected this gap to narrow. In essence, they were hoping to see faster job growth \u2014 and income growth, which would drive up housing prices \u2014 to catch up to the rest of the country.\n\nLooking at 13 months of data since the election, we can see that that hasn\u2019t happened. The average Trump county added 1.13 percent more jobs, while the average Clinton county added 0.49 percent. These increases are quite small, especially considering that significantly fewer jobs existed in Trump counties to begin with.\n\nHousing prices tell a similar story, with even more data stretching into 2018. Regardless of how I compare the counties, Clinton supporters consistently come out on top. Even though their housing prices started significantly higher than their counterparts in Trump counties, their value increases even faster after November 2016.\n\nThe major shortcoming of this comparison is that it fails to account for pre-election trends. Maybe the Trump counties aren\u2019t growing faster than the Clinton counties, but at least they are improving relative to their previous performance? Maybe they\u2019re bending their trend closer to the trend of the Clinton counties, even if they\u2019re not overtaking them?\n\nNot at all, it turns out. Using a standard statistical technique called \u201cdifference-in-differences,\u201d I estimate the difference between Trump and Clinton counties before and after the election and show whether the difference \u2026 differs. In other words, I look at whether the economic performance gap narrows. The answer: No. Statistically, there appears to be no significant improvement in job growth. The gap in housing price growth actually widens. In fact, the larger the Trump electorate and the larger the degree of Trump support, the worse the county\u2019s economic performance.\n\nFinally, you might wonder whether it\u2019s fair to lump all Trump voters together. Many of them would have voted Republican regardless of the nominee. Perhaps it makes more sense to focus on the voters who switched to Donald Trump after voting for Barack Obama in 2012. Arguably, these voters were wooed specifically by the candidate\u2019s promise to \u201cstart winning again.\u201d\n\nEven among these counties, however, there does not appear to be any improvement. Their performance is statistically indistinguishable from the performance of their fellow Obama counties that stuck with the Democrats in 2016.\n\n[Here are 4 things to expect from a new, Trumpier, more polarized Congress]\n\nWhat can we expect for the next two years?\n\nThe two Americas remain as economically divided after the midterm election as they did after the presidential election two years ago. We do not know, however, whether these different economic directions will now begin to converge. Two years is a very short time in which to reverse macroeconomic trends. It is still possible that Trump counties will be rewarded in the long run. For that reason, I will be updating these estimates throughout the coming years.\n\nLet me acknowledge that it\u2019s possible that these comparisons don\u2019t account for differences between voters within counties \u2014 or what statisticians call the \u201cecological fallacy.\u201d Perhaps Trump voters are experiencing stronger economic growth than their neighbors, even if their counties are underperforming the nation. Perhaps future data will allow us to make this person-to-person comparison within counties.\n\nUntil then, these preliminary findings reveal the economic state of our nation remains much as it did before Trump\u2019s election: divided as much by economics as it is by politics.\n\nAnthony W.

(Mark Peters/Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 A top Cambodian government official has reiterated his government\u2019s intention to end the work of the U.N.-backed tribunal that last week convicted the last two surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng, speaking Saturday at a government ceremony in the northern province of Oddar Meanchey, said the tribunal\u2019s work had been completed and there would not be any additional prosecutions for acts that led to the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people in the 1970s.\n\nHe cited the terms under which the tribunal, staffed jointly by Cambodian and international prosecutors and judges, had been established, limiting its targets to senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime that was in power from 1975 to 1979. The rules also allow prosecuting those most responsible for carrying out atrocities.\n\nSar Kheng\u2019s remarks were reported Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal sentenced Nuon Chea, 92, the main Khmer Rouge ideologist and right-hand man to its late leader Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 87, who served as its head of state, to life sentences. The two had already been serving life sentences on a previous conviction.\n\nIn nine years of hearings and at a cost of more than $300 million, the tribunal has convicted only one other defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nCases of four more suspects, middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, had already been processed for prosecution but have been scuttled or stalled. Without the cooperation of the Cambodian members of the tribunal, no cases can go forward.\n\nLong-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly declared there would be no more prosecutions, claiming they could cause unrest. Hun Sen himself was a mid-level commander with the Khmer Rouge before defecting while the group was still in power, and several senior members of his ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party share similar backgrounds. He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nIn his remarks, Sar Kheng, sought to reassure former Khmer Rouge members that they would not face prosecution.\n\n\u201cBecause there are some former Khmer Rouge officers living in this area, I would like to clarify that there will be no more investigations taking place (against lower-ranking Khmer Rouge members), so you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d said Sar Kheng, who is also interior minister.\n\nHe acknowledged that even without more prosecutions, the tribunal still had to hear the appeals expected to be lodged by Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, but aside from that task, its work was finished.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It was Carell\u2019s third time hosting SNL, but his first in a decade.\n\nIt all began with a pretend audience member asking the simple question: \u201cWill you ever reboot \u2018The Office\u2019?\u201d The host said no, so SNL cast member Kenan Thompson stood up and framed it as more of a suggestion. Carell explained reprising his role as the lunatic Dunder Mifflin Paper Company manager would be like Thompson returning full-time to the Nickelodeon sitcom \u201cKenan & Kel,\u201d on which he starred with Kel Mitchell from 1996 through 2000.

Maybe Carell didn\u2019t understand just how much money it would make them. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to do all those sad movies anymore,\u201d Helms said, referring to Carell\u2019s recent roles, such as the panicked father of a teenage drug user in \u201cBeautiful Boy.\u201d SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant had also poked fun at this in a promo video for the episode, in which she told Carell that he was \u201ckind of, like, a serious actor now. Are you ready to do comedy again? Because this is a comedy show.\u201d\n\nThose movies are done for pleasure, Carell said, not money. But this answer wasn\u2019t good enough for Jenna Fischer, who played the fan favorite Pam Beesley during the show\u2019s nine seasons. She asked Carell whether he remembered the unheard words Pam whispered to Michael before he moved to Colorado. They were, according to her: \u201cSteve, don\u2019t be a d---, do the reboot.\"\n\n[On SNL, a bald Steve Carell plays Jeff Bezos \u2014 and won\u2019t stop trolling Trump]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember that at all,\u201d Carell responded.

Ryan and his entourage to visit a remote cult compound known as Jonestown.\n\nRyan had constituents who had joined the agricultural commune following the charismatic, self-titled Rev. Jim Jones and his California-based Peoples Temple. After hearing reports from concerned family members \u2014 who claimed that temple members were held there against their will, assaulted and abused \u2014 the congressman decided to fly down to investigate, accompanied by several members of the press.\n\nBut Jones had no intention of allowing the visitors to leave and dispatched several of his armed followers on a flatbed truck to stop Ryan\u2019s plane. What followed \u2014 the assassination of Ryan and the murder of four others at the airfield, and the mass murder-suicide of more than 900 Peoples Temple followers, including hundreds of children forced to drink cyanide-laced grape-flavored punch \u2014 would reverberate across the world and leave an indelible mark on American culture.\n\n[\u2018I didn\u2019t want her to go\u2019: The families who lost loved ones to Jonestown]\n\nDespite his own injury, Krause kept reporting on Jonestown in the days after, filing detailed reports as the first journalist allowed to return to the gruesome site. He later wrote a best-selling book, \u201cGuyana Massacre: The Eyewitness Account.\u201d\n\nKrause, 71, who now runs the Center for Contemporary Political Art in Northwest Washington, recently spoke with The Post ahead of the Nov. 18 anniversary of the massacre about his recollections and the lasting lessons of Jonestown. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou\u2019ve written so much about Jonestown over the years. All this time later, are there still certain moments that stand out most vividly in your mind?\n\nWhen I first went back, I was looking for some of the people who I remembered were on that flatbed truck. At that point, the bodies were there, but they didn\u2019t realize that they were stacked on top of each other. So they had counted about 450 people who were dead, but they were missing close to 500 or something. And so we didn\u2019t know where they were. . . . I didn\u2019t find any of them actually. But it turned out that most everybody was killed.\n\nYou spent time with Peoples Temple members just days before they were killed. Were there any people you met who made a lasting impression?\n\nThere were two, a brother and a sister. When we finally got there, each of us was greeted by someone who would come up to us and say, \u201cHi, I want to welcome you to Jonestown.\u201d And it turned out that my minders, that\u2019s what they were, were a brother and sister. Their last name was Tropp. Their backgrounds were virtually identical to mine. They were both white, Jewish, both had been educated at Ivy League schools, and we really had a lot in common. They had done their research, and they figured out who would present the best case for Jonestown. And I must say, they did. Even after everything happened, I still, because of them, I still have certain doubts. I mean some of the things that were going on there were actually good, if it hadn\u2019t been for the psychosis of one man and the trap he led them into. The Tropps weren\u2019t there because they believed in miracles or snake oil. They were there because they believed it was a socialist community and a place where different races and religions could be together.\n\nWhat has it been like for you to process what you experienced and witnessed at Jonestown?\n\nOne of the things that I continue to wonder about is: Why did I survive? I was right next to the congressman, and they were shooting at him for sure. I wasn\u2019t a principal target, but they certainly were there to kill everybody they could. But why did I survive it? And that is a question that has haunted me all my life. You know, there must be a reason. And what I\u2019ve decided is that that reason is for me to continue to try to do what I can to try to make this world a little bit better. I guess I realized at that point that you have to live your life fully, and you can\u2019t postpone everything until tomorrow, because tomorrow you may not be here.\n\nWe now have generations of people who are too young to remember Jonestown, and are more familiar with derivative pop-culture references \u2014 like the phrase \u201cdrink the Kool-Aid\u201d \u2014 than the facts of the tragedy itself. But even that phrase isn\u2019t true to what happened, right?\n\nRight. I remember very distinctly, about three weeks after all of it, I heard from the president of Kool-Aid \u2014 and I was afraid, you know, are we going to start with a lawsuit and all of this? But it was just a very nice note saying, \u2018Look, we just wanted you to know that as it turns out it wasn\u2019t Kool-Aid, but we understand that Kool-Aid is sort of generic for all kinds of flavored drinks, and we wish you well.\u2019 Apparently, it was Flavor Aid. But regardless, it was mixed with cyanide \u2014 and no, people didn\u2019t take it voluntarily. In fact, there is a recording that exists, and you can hear the people asking, \u201cWhy are we doing this \u2014 do we really have to do this?\u201d And then they had men with guns. So they really didn\u2019t have much of a choice. And the children didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\n[The phrase \u2018drank the Kool-Aid\u2019 is completely offensive. We should stop saying it immediately.]\n\nWhat do you think are the lessons of Jonestown, what it ultimately taught us about who we are?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, frankly, that, at the time, the real lessons of Jonestown were very clear. You know, people focused on the mass suicide-murder, the bodies. Anyone who was alive at that time, it was a very striking image, and people may even remember Jim Jones because there was something about him that was frightening. But the real lesson of Jonestown, and I wish our country had understood this: These people followed someone who led them to destruction. They believed in this guy. He lied to them. He cheated. He was involved with the sexual abuse of boys and girls in his temple. He took their money. He really enslaved them. And then he betrayed them, and then he led them to their deaths. I wish we had learned to be more cautious about following people who promise things and then betray the trust that people have given them. And I just hope that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nForty years later, in a world that has changed in so many ways, do you think this sort of thing could happen again?\n\nYes, there is the potential for it to happen again. It has happened again a number of times. We\u2019ve had Waco, and we\u2019ve had other incidents where it\u2019s not as many people, but it\u2019s the same sort of situation. I feel strongly that we need to be more skeptical about political or religious leaders who promise things, who seem to be hypocritical, who talk the talk but don\u2019t walk the walk."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The lessons of Jonestown could help us prevent terrorism and mass shootings today - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The lessons of Jonestown could help us prevent terrorism and mass shootings today Washington Post Forty years ago today, a charismatic white minister named Jim Jones compelled 912 members of his Peoples Temple, most of whom were African Americ\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/11/18/lessons-jonestown-could-help-us-prevent-terrorism-mass-shootings-today/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5aSMvRALui_BaNpwWKA7PS5rCmc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JBCRPAHH2YI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T11:00:43Z", "content": "Forty years ago today, a charismatic white minister named Jim Jones compelled 912 members of his Peoples Temple, most of whom were African American, to drink cyanide in a rural encampment in Guyana.

Ryan, D-Calif., on the airstrip at Port Kaittuma, Guyana, after an ambush by members of the Peoples Temple cult. (Tim Reiterman/The San Francisco Examiner/AP)\n\nForty years ago today, a charismatic white minister named Jim Jones compelled 912 members of his Peoples Temple, most of whom were African American, to drink cyanide in a rural encampment in Guyana.\n\nThe combination mass murder-mass suicide \u2014 we will probably never know to what degree it was one versus the other \u2014 remains one of the most baffling events of the American century. It does not fit into any of our usual explanatory boxes: not left versus right, black versus white, rich versus poor or even religious versus secular.\n\nYet while Jonestown defies the standard political frameworks, it does have eerie parallels to the murder-suicides, mass shootings and terrorism that wrack our society today. Though the mystery of Jonestown remains inexplicable, the incident may yet offer a lesson on how to reduce mass violence.\n\nJones, a longtime admirer of African-American religion and crusader for the poor, built a massive following in African-American communities in California. A congressional investigation into the Jonestown massacre found that Jones recruited most of his followers in \u201cpoor ghetto neighborhoods,\u201d especially older black men and women who needed a support system in crime-ridden cities. He also recruited younger, idealistic middle-class folk, black and white, who said Jones led the only viable social mission in the area. But many young followers also had fundamentalist backgrounds or were drawn to Jones's evangelical style.\n\nThough Jones strove to ground himself in some sort of African-American tradition \u2014 even employing the lawyer who represented Huey Newton, co-founder of the Black Panthers \u2014 all hint of tradition seems to have vanished by the final year of his Temple's history, when his rituals reportedly began to include mass suicide drills.\n\nAfter a 1977 expos\u00e9 reported that Jones sometimes controlled members with beatings, extortion and death threats, Jones fled California, relocating most of his flock to a remote site in Guyana. In the following months, U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan sought congressional authorization to visit Jonestown to investigate disappearances of Jones\u2019s recruits, many of whom came from his district and, he worried, were being held against their will.\n\nRyan arrived in Guyana on Nov. 14, 1978, with two staffers, 18 members of Concerned Relatives of Peoples Temple and nine members of the media. Jones allowed Ryan, his assistant Jackie Speier (who now represents Ryan\u2019s former district in Congress), a deputy from the American embassy and 12 other members of their party to visit Jonestown and talk to residents. During that visit, one resident passed a note to Ryan and another hurriedly spoke to one of the press corps, conveying that they wanted to leave Jonestown.\n\nThe next morning, another Temple member got a message to Ryan that she and her family also wanted to leave. A truck provided by Jones arrived to take the visitors and some 15 People\u2019s Temple members who wanted to leave \u2014 probably against Jones\u2019s wishes \u2014 back to an airstrip, where two planes awaited them.\n\nOne plane took passengers on board and taxied for takeoff. At that point, everything went haywire. Larry Layton, a passenger posing as a defector, started shooting. Then a tractor-trailer from the People\u2019s Temple arrived, and its occupants opened fire on the entire group, including both planes. Five people were killed, including Congressman Ryan. Nine others, including Speier, were wounded.\n\nThe shooting lasted four or five minutes. The attackers disabled one plane, but the other took off successfully.\n\nWhen Jones learned that some people had escaped, he called his members together to start the suicide ritual they had rehearsed. They began serving soft drinks (not Kool-Aid, as widely believed, but the rival off-brand Fla-Vor-Aid) laced with cyanide and barbiturates. \u201cThey started with the babies,\u201d said Odell Rhodes, the only survivor known to have witnessed the final massacre.\n\nThe events at Jonestown baffled those who tried to make sense of them. Bernard Shaw, an African-American correspondent for ABC, was on the first planeload of journalists who rushed to Guyana. He later recalled discovering the bodies: \u201cI began to realize there were hundreds of dead,\u201d he told the journalist Wallace Terry. \u201cThey had committed suicide. Most of them were black! I got the same feeling I had when I received the bulletin that King had been shot.\u201d\n\nThe congressional investigating team found no clear explanations for what happened. The committee concluded that Jones was \u201cfirst and foremost a master of mind control.\u201d He learned several \u201crecognized strategies of brainwashing\u201d and practiced them \u201cwith engineered precision.\u201d\n\nThis calamity seemed to mark a horrifying new stage of the periodic outbursts of extreme religious groups that plagued the late 1960s and 1970s. People came to think it presaged the 1979 Iranian revolution, the mujahideen defeat of the Red Army in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the rise of religious extremism from Denmark to Indonesia and the desecularization of politics \u2014 including foreign and military policy \u2014 in non-Islamic, industrialized societies like the United States and Israel.\n\nScholars and pundits had dismissed less violent strains of religious extremism as \u201ccults\u201d or \u201cfundamentalism.\u201d But Jonestown proved transformative. It monopolized the world\u2019s attention, turning nobodies \u2014 the sort previously ignored \u2014 into somebodies and showed the pathway to fame to other disturbed individuals.\n\nWhile Jonestown was incomprehensible at the time, in many ways, it makes more sense today in a society plagued by mass killers and terrorists willing to sacrifice their own lives.\n\nReligious movements often spring up among excluded, frightened populations. A new, intense community experience gives a small but potentially deadly group a sense of direction. That can, on rare occasions, prompt mass killings, if participants discover that a willingness to commit suicide gives them the power to make history by making headlines.\n\nTo act, these killers do not even have to find the meaning they once sought in religion. They can simply convey their raw, indomitable rage. Their message is often just to make a big splash, drawing attention to themselves and their new comrades. Automatic weapons, explosive suicide vests and jets full of fuel and passengers require less planning than cyanide.\n\nThe message gets simpler and more powerful, too: They can command the attention of the world, forcing people to pay attention, so they do. The more frequent and sickeningly efficient mass killings become, the more intoxicating the lure of attention becomes for unbalanced people with or without a cause.\n\nThis is not inevitable. Such deranged, desperate individuals find mass killing an intoxicating substitute for meaning because, like political and celebrity assassins, they know the media will ratify any message they wish to send. The media will grant them a massive spotlight. The attackers become known \u2014 remembered through sobs, silence and shouts. The recognition feels like religious tribute to a higher power. In practice, however, it amounts to faith in the mass media more than in the sort of religion that Jim Jones began his career in.\n\nJones started this snowball. It was largely because of his example that this perverse faith in the media grew to such dangerous heights. The media made heinous acts famous by providing recognition that most people could not attain any other way.\n\nThe lesson from this troubled path beginning at Jonestown is that the media could deny attackers the spotlight they crave. The media could focus instead on the alienation and poverty that often fuel the self-sacrificing mass-murders epitomized by Jonestown. If so, we might see a reduction in these heartbreaking attacks."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Jonestown teaches us that no one person can solve our problems - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Jonestown teaches us that no one person can solve our problems Washington Post \u201cI haven't seen anybody yet [who] didn't die.

I\u2019m tired of being tormented to hell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m tired of. Tired of it.\u201d So said pastor Jim Jones on Nov. 18, 1978, in Guyana, right before he perpetrated the mass killing of more than 900 members of his Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ.\n\nSince then, Jonestown, the settlement Jones established, has remained at the periphery of social consciousness. Shocking and visceral photos of the aftermath sometimes catch people\u2019s attention, and the massacre has left a sinister mark on our culture: The phrase \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d entered the popular lexicon as a warning against blindly accepting an idea. But most people know little about the story of the Peoples Temple outside of the 1978 deaths.\n\nJones\u2019s path from rural California pastor to power broker to jungle demagogue is an intriguing story even without its harrowing ending. And it raises important questions: Did the members of the Peoples Temple really accept Jones\u2019s instructions without question? What was it about Jones that made people follow him in the first place? And how did he get nearly 1,000 Americans to make a pilgrimage to Guyana that ultimately resulted in their deaths?\n\nBorn in Lynn, Ind., Jones launched his church in 1954 in Indianapolis and experienced steady, though not spectacular, success in attracting congregants. He preached a message that emphasized socialism and racial equality, ideas that were not necessarily popular in the 1950s Midwest.\n\nThis led Jones to eventually resettle his Peoples Temple, first in Ukiah, Calif., and then in San Francisco, where his ideas were better received. It was in San Francisco that Jones turned his congregation into a political force. Its canvassing played a crucial role in the 1976 election of Mayor George Moscone, and national politicians began to take notice. Rosalynn Carter, wife of future president Jimmy Carter, met with Jones in September 1976, at the height of her husband\u2019s presidential campaign. Had Jones died before moving to Guyana, it is possible that he would be viewed differently by the public because of this political impact.\n\nIn San Francisco, Jones attracted a large congregation because he condemned an oppressive society. Members of the Peoples Temple were told that they lived under a system that sought to control and marginalize them. Because most of Jones\u2019s parishioners were black and lived in an era known for the murder of civil rights leaders, violent retaliation against antiwar protests and political corruption, these ideas rang true.\n\nBut Jones weaponized and exploited the fears of his disciples, promoting distrust of outside authority to the point of paranoia. As he told his followers in 1974: \u201cI cannot tell you, but I had it proven to me by a high law enforcement official, he said we can\u2019t even control our own [police] departments. We\u2019re afraid, he said, there are chiefs of police that are afraid to speak up today, because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll find themselves dead and it\u2019ll look like an accident.\u201d\n\nEven as he denounced oppression, Jones imposed suffocating rules on Peoples Temple members. A 1977 expos\u00e9 by the magazine New West detailed how \u201chumiliating sessions had begun to include physical beatings with a large wooden paddle.\" Church \u201cleaders also instructed certain members to write letters incriminating themselves in illegal and immoral acts that never happened,\u201d the magazine reported.\n\nRemarkably, even as the Peoples Temple was devolving into a cult, fear drove many mainstream politicians to continue to court Jones. In the words of Harvey Milk, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, \u201cmake sure you\u2019re always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s political clout reinforced the message that he alone could protect the oppressed. And the Peoples Temple seemed to serve as a monument to Jones, whose soup kitchens, nursing homes, excellent public speaking skills and natural charisma supported his extraordinary claims. This unique combination turned Jones and the Peoples Temple into a beacon for those seeking shelter from racial discrimination and poverty and to members of the professional classes who sought simple answers to these complex problems.\n\nNo discussion of Jones would be complete without mentioning his narcissism, which has been noted by psychologists such as Len Oakes and Peter Olsson. In one 1974 sermon, he referred to himself as \u201cthe center and circumference of the universe.\u201d Jones sought praise relentlessly and was extraordinarily sensitive to criticism. His reaction to rejection was explosive.\n\nIn 1973, the angry departure of eight college students from his church led Jones to seek a remote site in Guyana where he could exercise more control over his congregation. When New West ran its expos\u00e9 on Jones in 1977, he moved as many people abroad as were willing to travel, but not before enlisting his political allies, including California Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally, to insist the magazine stop its investigation. In California and in Guyana, Jones practiced suicide drills, instructing his followers to drink poison, then telling them that the poison was fake. Jones expected complete loyalty from his congregation, and the drills were initially a test to see who could provide it.\n\nNonetheless, resistance remained within the ranks of the Peoples Temple. When Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif.), motivated by constituent concerns, traveled to Guyana to perform a welfare check, 15 Temple members indicated they wished to leave. Jones was humiliated and implemented drastic measures. One member of the congregation, Larry Layton, posed as a defector and led Ryan\u2019s party into an ambush, in which the congressman, three journalists and a defecting member of the temple killed.\n\nAt Jonestown, the congregation prepared for its final suicide drill. Contrary to popular belief, the members of the Peoples Temple did not go gently. Parishioner Christine Miller argued at length with Jones about the logic of a mass suicide, contending, \u201cWhen we destroy ourselves, we\u2019re defeated.\u201d Eyewitnesses recall many people refusing Jones\u2019s orders and being injected with cyanide. Other members likely noted the presence of guards armed with crossbows and pistols and drank the poison as the least arduous way to die. Approximately 30 people managed to escape alive.\n\nThe lessons of Jonestown are as clear now as they were 40 years ago. No single person is a panacea to all the problems in the world, and people who claim they are should be ignored, not worshiped. When an individual promises to fix a broken system, one should look at both the structures they claim are broken and the schema they wish to implement. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, independent thought persists even under the most severe oppression, and the presence of oppression alone does not warrant blind obedience to any cause. On this Nov. 18, take a moment to consider the victims of Jonestown humanely and spare your jests for the bullies at the pulpit.\n\nThis essay used resources from the Jonestown Institute at San Diego State University, which has spent thousands of hours making primary documentation from Jonestown available to the public.

Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Low pressure moves through, which means a decent (60 percent) chance for some light rain showers during the evening into overnight. Can\u2019t rule out a few snowflakes mixing in north and west of the District, but temperatures should stay safely above freezing with lows in the upper 30s to low 40s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nAfter the chance of an early-morning rain or snow shower, Tuesday should see skies becoming partly sunny, with cool highs in the mid-40s to near 50. Another impulse of energy could give us a brief shower or sprinkle during the afternoon. Otherwise, you\u2019ll notice a bit of a breeze from the northwest, though it won\u2019t be too troublesome. Skies trend mostly clear Tuesday night with many spots near or a little below freezing, as lows range from the upper 20s to low 30s. Confidence: Medium\n\nHigh pressure takes firmer control by Wednesday. While we\u2019ll have plenty of sun, temperatures turn cooler again behind the front. Enjoy the fairly benign fall day, with daytime highs in the 40s. Don\u2019t try to thaw that turkey out in the garage Wednesday night, as it\u2019ll probably still be quite frozen after a reinforcing shot of cool air pushes lows into the 20s. Confidence: Medium\n\nYour Thanksgiving forecast is a chilly one. If you\u2019re going to be joining me for one of the many \u201cTurkey trots\u201d around the area early in the morning, in some futile effort to burn more calories than we\u2019ll be taking in, be sure to bundle up! Clear, cool and a bit of a breeze is the forecast for the day, with highs probably only in the mid-30s to near 40.

(Sam Mednick/AP)\n\nIf a teacher in South Sudan wants to buy a chicken for dinner, he would have to save everything he earns for two full months \u2014 and it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nFive years of intense civil warfare have decimated South Sudan\u2019s economy and killed an estimated 380,000 people. A third of the population is displaced, every second person is going hungry, and hundreds of thousands are at risk of starving to death in the world\u2019s newest country, according to the United Nations.\n\nParts of South Sudan \u2014 including key agricultural areas \u2014 are nearly emptied of people; they fled for safety or to find food. That means those who remain in South Sudan are relying on imports, even though a plunging exchange rate means imported food is overwhelmingly expensive. And despite the influx of billions of dollars in food aid, attacks on deliveries, bad roads, flooding and deliberate government interference mean that food often doesn\u2019t get to the people who need it.\n\nThe result, according to United Nations data, is that even when food is available, many prices are so high \u2014 a single meal costs two times the national daily income, according to a report released this year \u2014 that people can\u2019t buy the things they see in markets or shops. This is threatening to worsen a crisis that is already Africa\u2019s biggest refugee exodus since the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s.\n\nPeople are being forced to make difficult sacrifices to survive, said Nicholas Kerandi, a food security analyst with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Some eat only one meal a day. Others cut out education or health-care costs. Many become refugees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of coping. You have less income, but you still have to eat,\u201d Kerandi said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor someone like John Leju \u00adCelestino Ladu, those difficult choices are all too real. Ladu is an assistant professor at the University of Juba. He makes the equivalent of about $40 a month.\n\n\u201cThe situation is so terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very bad. It\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\nTo take the bus to and from work costs about $10 a month. Like many South Sudanese, Ladu is caring not only for his immediate family members; he has also taken in about 10 others. Some are un\u00adeducated and can\u2019t secure a job in the highly competitive market. Others lost family members in the war and need support.\n\nA kilogram of beef to feed 15 people costs about $5. Rather than spend money on meat, most days they eat beans and boiled corn flour called ugali.\n\nLadu, who has a doctoral degree in environmental science, supplements his income by driving his motorcycle as a taxi or picking up work as a laborer. He is one of the highest educated in a country where fewer than a third of the population can read. But even he has thought of becoming a refugee to survive.\n\nLast year, the United Nations declared famine in some parts of the country \u2014 and said millions more people were at risk. Already, billions of U.S. dollars have poured into food aid. The United States alone, the biggest donor, has given $1.78 billion since the beginning of the conflict, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, including $336 million this year. In May, the Trump administration threatened to cut funding to South Sudan unless the country\u2019s conflict ends.\n\n[The White House said it would reassess aid to South Sudan. Its government says cuts would be a disaster.]\n\nBut it\u2019s not just getting food donations to the country. South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers. The government and opposition forces actively prevent food from getting to areas of urgent need, according to a statement from the U.N. secretary general. South Sudanese government officials have repeatedly said they don\u2019t deny access.\n\nMichael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan\u2019s information minister, said that the U.N. estimates of people going hungry are unsubstantiated and that the reality on the ground is different. He acknowledged that some in South Sudan have become economic refugees but pointed to a recent peace deal as a sign of progress.\n\n\u201cDefinitely with the agreement, the economy will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause whatever was being spent on the war and all these will be used for other issues, especially for the improvement of the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2013, two years after the country became independent and before the war broke out, a teacher or government worker earned a salary worth about $350 a month. Five years after the war began, the same salary is now worth about $6 because of the devaluation of the South Sudanese pound.\n\nFor those teachers, half a gallon of milk now costs nearly half their monthly budget, at $2.70.\n\n[South Sudan\u2019s people are starving, and fighters are blocking aid]\n\nBut not everyone\u2019s salary is losing value. Peter Garang is one of the luckier people in South Sudan. He works as a security guard at a building in the capital, Juba, and he gets paid in U.S. dollars. That means every time the value of the South Sudanese pound goes down, he gets more money in exchange. But he says he still can\u2019t survive without cutting back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough to buy food,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you clear your salary, you cannot buy anything.\u201d\n\nGarang has four children, but only one is in school. The fees are too high. He\u2019s also responsible for his three brothers, two sisters, and his and his wife\u2019s parents.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t buy chicken or sorghum grains anymore. Even the price of a cup of tea from a street vendor forces him to think twice.\n\nSince the start of the latest round of peace discussions between South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and the leader of the opposition, Riek Machar, Garang says the prices have gone down slightly. He\u2019s hopeful that this time the agreement will hold.\n\nThe South Sudanese leaders have made numerous attempts at peace talks \u2014 and nearly all have broken down. After the last peace agreement collapsed in July 2016, more than 1 million people became refugees.\n\nHopes are higher for this peace agreement because it was negotiated with Sudan, which South Sudan seceded from in 2011 after decades of civil war.\n\nOil is South Sudan\u2019s primary export and a main driver of its economy. When the country separated from Sudan, it agreed to pipe its oil north. The fighting shut down several oil fields, but Sudan promised to get them working again as part of this peace agreement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s of course an incentive for Sudan to help,\u201d said Thomson Fontaine, the senior economic and financial management adviser for the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, the group responsible for monitoring the implementation of the South Sudan peace agreement.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense that with peace, the economy could really take off,\u201d Fontaine said.\n\nAside from oil, the country could rely on exports of natural resources such as gold; agricultural exports such as vegetables and gum arabic; and hardwoods such as mahogany and teak.\n\nBut much of South Sudan\u2019s most productive area, called Equatoria, has nearly emptied of people since fighting spread there two years ago. For fear of being accused of helping opposition soldiers or to avoid getting caught in the fighting, many people left their farms unharvested. The U.N. food agency estimates that the harvested area was reduced by nearly 50 percent since last year, distorting market prices even further.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting my family terribly,\u201d said Ladu, the university professor. \u201cLife is miserable. Very miserable.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nThey were rescued from a brutal conflict in South Sudan.

(Abir Sultan/Pool via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he would take on the defense minister portfolio, rejecting calls to dissolve his government even as early elections appeared increasingly likely.\n\nNetanyahu said heading to elections now, amid repeated violent confrontations with Gaza militants, was \u201cirresponsible\u201d of his coalition partners, who have been pushing for early polls since the resignation last week of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman over a Gaza cease-fire.\n\n\u201cToday, I take on for the first time the position of defense minister,\u201d said Netanyahu, speaking from Israel\u2019s defense headquarters in Tel Aviv in a statement broadcast live at the top of the evening newscasts.\n\n\u201cWe are in one of the most complex security situations and during a period like this, you don\u2019t topple a government. During a period like this you don\u2019t go to elections,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of the hawkish Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. He alleges the cease-fire agreement reached with Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers will put southern Israel under a growing threat from the group, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon\u2019s heavily armed Hezbollah group.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Netanyahu\u2019s other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single lawmaker until elections scheduled for November 2019.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, has already threatened to bring down the government if he is not appointed defense minister. He and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, also of Jewish Home, are set to deliver a statement to the media Monday. If the party leaves the coalition, it would strip Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.\n\nFinance Minister Moshe Kahlon, another senior partner, says another year of such instability will harm the economy. A meeting between him and Netanyahu Sunday meant to convince Kahlon to stay ended with no results.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Likud allies are already preparing to pin the blame on coalition partners if the effort to salvage the government fails.\n\n\u201cI think that there is no reason to shorten the term of a national government, not even for one day, and at this moment it\u2019s in the hands of the education minister and the finance minister,\u201d said Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security.\n\nNo Israeli government has served out its full term since 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nThough Netanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself in recent months, the current timing is not ideal for him.\n\nHe has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the Gaza cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party. But with Lieberman forcing his hand and the other coalition partners appearing eager to head to the polls he may not have a choice.\n\nMost opinion polls show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would secure him a place in Israeli history as the country\u2019s longest serving leader. But several factors could trip him up, including a potential corruption indictment that could knock him out of contention.\n\nPolice have recommended he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases and have questioned him at length on another. The country has long been eagerly awaiting the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to press charges.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily dismissed the accusations against him, characterizing them as part of a media-driven witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Basra province generates more than 90 percent of Iraq\u2019s oil exports but suffers from contaminated drinking water and regular blackouts.\n\nBasra police say al-Ghrawi was shot and killed in front of his house in the city center by unknown assailants late Saturday.\n\nHe was filmed at a protest on Friday saying clerics would issue a fatwa within days on taking up arms. The video was shared widely on Iraqi social media.\n\nAssociates and relatives of al-Ghrawi paraded his coffin around parts of the city on Sunday, demanding the police identify the killers and bring them to justice.\n\n\u201cWhy was Sheikh Wissam al-Ghrawi killed? Because he asked for clean water? Because he asked for jobs for the unemployed? Is this the price he paid for defending his country?\u201d said civic activist Mohanad al-Ghrawi, a distant relative of the deceased cleric.\n\nAl-Ghrawi is at least the second activist to be killed in what appeared to be a targeted assassination since protests swept Basra last summer. One of the organizers, Soad al-Ali, was killed by a gunman in September, after protesters began directing their ire toward Iran, which they saw as exerting undue influence over national politics.\n\nDemonstrators set fire to the Iranian consulate and attacked the headquarters of the various Iran-backed militias and parties that operate with impunity in the city. Most of the city\u2019s official government buildings were torched, as well.\n\nPolice said al-Ali\u2019s killing was over a personal matter.\n\nSuspicions again turned toward the militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe say here, once again, to the Basra security and police \u2014 have you done your job to stop these militias that kill the youth and intellectuals?\u201d said Mohanad al-Ghrawi.\n\n\u201cAnyone who speaks up is threatened with exile, arrest, or killing,\u201d said activist Naqeeb al-Louaibi, who moved to Baghdad from Basra in October after receiving threats to his life.\n\nThe PMF were integral to Iraq\u2019s war against the Islamic State group earlier this decade and paid salaries to hundreds of thousands of fighters, many of whom were drawn from Iraq\u2019s impoverished southern provinces.\n\nBut with the war declared won late last year, attention has turned to Iraq\u2019s high unemployment and decaying infrastructure. Demonstrations erupted in the south last summer after regular blackouts appeared to grow worse and, in Basra, murky water began flowing out of taps. Health authorities said tens of thousands of residents were hospitalized in the summer months for stomach illnesses.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Philip Issa contributed from Baghdad.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It later emerged that the long-time Communist Party insider with decades of experience in China\u2019s security apparatus was detained as part of a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials under President Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarian administration.\n\nInterpol member-states will also be deciding whether to accept Kosovo as a full member, which would allow officials there to file red notices for Serbian officials that Kosovo considers war criminals.\n\nThe red notices are alerts circulated by Interpol to all member countries that identify a person wanted for arrest by another country. Interpol says there are 57,289 active red notices around the world.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. The body, however, has faced criticism that governments have abused the \u201cred notice\u201d system to go after political enemies and dissidents, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits the use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced new measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nChinese authorities say Meng is being lawfully investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. China\u2019s beleaguered rights activists point out that as someone with a seat atop the country\u2019s powerful public security apparatus, Meng helped build the opaque system of largely unchecked power wielded by the ruling Communist Party to which he\u2019s now fallen victim.\n\nMeng\u2019s wife has told The Associated Press from France that the bribery accusation he faces is just an excuse for a lengthy detention and that he is being persecuted for political reasons.\n\nAs more than 1,000 delegates from most of the 192 member-states began filling the main hall for the annual event, Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock explained to reporters that the agency\u2019s rules did not allow for Meng to continue acting as president. Meng had been serving as president since November 2016, and his term was due to end in 2020.\n\nHe said Interpol received Meng\u2019s resignation letter from China on Oct. 7 and that Interpol was notified by Chinese authorities that Meng is no longer a delegate to Interpol.\n\n\u201cIt sounds a little technical but again that automatically leads to the fact, according to our rules, that he is not the president anymore,\u201d Stock said. \u201cWe had to take the measures to ensure the functioning of the organization.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s representatives say Interpol accepted an unsigned resignation letter without any resistance and without evidence of his consent.\n\nIn Meng\u2019s place on Sunday, senior vice president of Interpol\u2019s executive committee, Kim Jong Yang of South Korea\u2014 who was previously named acting president \u2014 helped open the ceremony for the general assembly meeting.\n\nA little more than a week ago, Stock told reporters in France\u2014 where Interpol is headquartered\u2014 that there was no reason for him to suspect that anything about Meng\u2019s resignation \u201cwas forced or wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he \u201cencouraged\u201d Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng\u2019s location and legal status but can do no more because the role of Interpol is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press)\n\nROME \u2014 Rome\u2019s monumental problems of garbage and decay exist side-by-side with the Italian capital\u2019s glories, including the Colosseum.\n\nAssociated Press photographers recently trained their cameras on some of the eyesores. With City Hall administrations often mired in scandal, Romans over the last few years have started trying to fix the mess themselves.\n\nPie\u2019 di Marmo, a giant marble foot dating back to the 1st century, rests on a pedestal in a narrow alleyway named for it. But the backdrop to its splendor is a collection of scribbled graffiti, and someone, perhaps heedless to the relic\u2019s proud history, left behind a soggy plastic bag in front of it.\n\nThe Colosseum is a universally recognized symbol of Roman civilization, so there\u2019s no mistaking that. But people have plastered over a road sign leading to it with stickers.\n\nSo much garbage piles up around overflowing trash bins on city streets \u2014 even near the pristine paths inside Vatican City \u2014 that even the trash collectors, when they do show up, seem overwhelmed.\n\nA man pushes his child in a stroller in the street, because the sidewalk has been swallowed up by uncollected trash left by Romans exasperated by often infrequent garbage collection.\n\nUnpruned plants and towering weeds rule the day in playgrounds. Grass sprouts up around Rome\u2019s iconic cobblestones.\n\nEven after a few minutes of heavy rain, uncleaned drains and sewers overflow, making intersections impassable, and sending sewage floating down neighborhood streets.\n\nRome is nicknamed the Eternal City, and recent years have increasingly seen its glory soiled by seemingly ever-present problems of urban decay.\n\nWhile many other urban capitals grapple with graffiti and citizen services that could use efficiency improvements, Rome also pays the price of decades of City Hall mismanagement and corruption. Trash even became in an issue in Italy\u2019s general election earlier this year.\n\nBut Romans have started saying \u201cbasta\u201d (enough) to shrugging shoulders and overall indifference. Citizens\u2019 groups with catchy names like Retake Rome scrub off graffiti in their neighborhoods on Sunday mornings. Romans have also started signaling dangerous potholes to organizations like Tappami (\u201dFill me up\u201d in Italian), which, armed with asphalt and shovels, fan out across the city to patch up neighborhood streets.\n\nRecently, several thousand fed-up Romans gathered beneath the office of Mayor Virginia Raggi, the first mayor for the Italian populist 5-Star Movement, which had vowed to do away with old-school City Hall politics.\n\nReduced so low by such widespread decay, Romans are starting to come to grips with the meaning of civic duty.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Zalmay Khalilzad, speaks to reporters at the United Nations headquarters. Taliban officials said Monday, Nov. 12, 2018 that Pakistan has released Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants\u2019 rule, along with a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin. It came as U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad launched a second tour of the region, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. (Mary Altaffer, File/Associated Press)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 The Taliban have held three days of talks with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in the Gulf state of Qatar, where the Afghan insurgent group has a political office, a Taliban official and another individual close to the group said Sunday.\n\nWithout referring explicitly to the talks in Qatar, Khalilzad told a news conference Sunday in the Afghan capital Kabul \u201cI am talking to all interested parties, all Afghan groups... and I think there is an opportunity for reconciliation and peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Afghan government wants peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Taliban are saying they do not believe they can succeed militarily, that they would like to see the problems that remain, resolved by peaceful means, by political negotiations.\u201d\n\nPeace efforts have accelerated since Khalilzad\u2019s appointment as Washington\u2019s peace envoy to Afghanistan aimed at eventually winding down America\u2019s longest war. Seventeen years after the U.S.-led invasion that ended Taliban rule, the militants control nearly half of Afghanistan and carry out near-daily attacks on local security forces and government officials.\n\nThe U.S. administration now appears focused on reaching a political settlement with the Taliban, and has given in to a number of the group\u2019s longstanding demands, beginning with the holding of direct talks. The Taliban have long refused U.S. demands to negotiate with the Western-backed government in Kabul, which the insurgents view as a puppet regime.\n\nPakistan has meanwhile released a number of high-level Taliban prisoners, including the movement\u2019s co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The releases are widely seen as a U.S.-directed move aimed at encouraging the Taliban to participate in talks.\n\nKhalilzad on Sunday said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d a peace settlement, which he preferred to call a \u201croadmap to Afghanistan\u2019s future,\u201d could be hammered out among rival Afghans. What that roadmap will look like and what rights and guarantees it will enshrine, including women\u2019s rights and rule of law, will be a decision for Afghans to make, said Khalilzad.\n\nThe United States has spoken \u201cloudly and proudly\u201d for equal rights for men and women, said Khalilzad, but how __ or even if __those rights are woven into Afghanistan\u2019s \u201croadmap for the future,\u201d will be decided by Afghans. Saying he would like to see a settlement \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d he urged both sides in Afghanistan\u2019s protracted conflict to consider next year\u2019s presidential elections, scheduled for April 20, as the deadline for peace.\n\nThe Taliban, who spoke about the talks in Qatar said Khairullah Khairkhwah, the former Taliban governor of Herat, and Mohammed Fazl, a former Taliban military chief, attended the marathon talks. The Taliban spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive negotiations.\n\nA third individual with knowledge of the discussions said the Taliban pressed for a postponement of next year\u2019s presidential elections and the establishment of an interim government under a neutral leadership. Abdul Sattar Sirat, an ethnic Tajik and Islamic scholar, was suggested as a candidate to lead an interim administration.\n\nThe individual, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, said Khalilzad wants to reach a settlement within six months, a timescale the Taliban said was too short. Khalilzad also proposed a cease-fire, which the Taliban rejected, the individual said, adding that there was no agreement on the release of prisoners, opening the Taliban office or lifting a Taliban travel ban.\n\nKhairkhwah and Fazl were among five senior Taliban members released from the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban after walking off his base in Afghanistan in 2009. The five are now based in Qatar, and are seen as having enough stature to sell a peace deal to insurgents fighting on the front lines.\n\nPresident Donald Trump harshly criticized the 2014 prisoner exchange, and in a speech last August pledged to send in additional U.S. forces and redouble efforts to defeat the Taliban. But that strategy has had little if any impact on the ground, with the Taliban keeping up a steady tempo of attacks and an Islamic State affiliate carrying out massive bombings targeting minority Shiites.\n\nIn a lengthy statement issued earlier this month, the Taliban had demanded the lifting of sanctions against the group\u2019s leaders, the release of prisoners and the recognition of their office in Qatar. The Afghan government is deeply opposed to any recognition of the Qatar office, which the Taliban in the past have billed as a government in exile.\n\nKhalilzad has been touring the region in recent days. In meetings in Kabul, Khalilzad is expected to press Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to cobble together his own negotiating team, which could prove difficult given the deep divisions within the government.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As Pirro, Strong shared outlandish fraud claims she heard in the Bass Pro Shops parking lot, one of which was Tyler Perry returning to the polls as Madea, the character of an elderly black woman that he will soon retire. Other theories involved \u201cstacking,\u201d when kids in a trench coat vote as an adult, and \u201cKlumping,\u201d a reference to Eddie Murphy portraying multiple characters in \u201cThe Nutty Professor.\u201d\n\nMoffat played Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who came on to address the recent New York Times report that claims his company hired an opposition research firm to \u201cdiscredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier George Soros.\u201d\n\nPoking fun at the common perception that Zuckerberg seems robotic, Moffat stood with his fingers intertwined and his arms outstretched. He had rehearsed his responses behind a table, he said with a strained laugh.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we knowingly employed a horrible company makes me laugh,\u201d he added.

(Hadi Mizban/Associated Press)\n\nBAGHDAD \u2014 It was spring 2007 in northern Iraq when 6-year-old Saja Saleem raced home from school with the good news about her excellent grades, hoping to receive the gift her father had promised her.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I found myself spinning into the air with fire trailing from my school uniform after a loud boom,\u201d Saleem, now 17, recounted to The Associated Press.\n\nSaleem lost her eyesight, right arm and an ear in the explosion, set off by a roadside bomb. Months later, her disfiguring injuries forced her to drop out of school after other students complained about her \u201cscary face.\u201d\n\nFeeling helpless, Saleem recently turned to social media to find help. Eventually, her appeal grabbed the attention of a surgeon who offered free treatment.\n\nOthers have also reached out on social media.\n\nEmotional videos and photographs of Iraqis with war wounds and disabilities have overwhelmed social media platforms, mainly Facebook, widely used in Iraq.\n\nThe widespread violence unleashed by the 2003 toppling of Saddam Hussein and the 2014-2017 battle against the Islamic State group has wounded hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Many are maimed and scarred, their suffering lingering long after the violence subsides.\n\nPoor medical services, scarcity of specialized staff and medical centers, and poverty have exacerbated the suffering. Those who cannot get treatment at state-run hospitals and cannot afford private clinics are looking to social media platforms to make appeals.\n\nAppeals are posted on the personal Facebook pages of patients or on the pages of aid organizations and public figures with tens of thousands of followers. Patients describe their condition along with contact details. Messages are also distributed on platforms like WhatsApp and Viber.\n\nSaleem and her family recall the explosion that upended her life, and the years that followed as they struggled financially to get her treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen I hit the ground, I felt severe pain all over my body ... I was bleeding, a pool of blood around me ... everything turned dark and I lost consciousness,\u201d she recalled from her bed at a Baghdad hospital where she is undergoing free reconstructive and plastic surgeries.\n\nSaleem\u2019s mother, Khawla Omar Hussein, remembers her daughter\u2019s screams when three weeks later, she regained consciousness and realized she had lost her right arm and ear.\n\n\u201cShe woke up screaming, crying: \u2018Mammy, mammy\u2019,\u201d Hussein recalled. \u201cThen she asked: \u2018Why can\u2019t I see and why is everything dark?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey told her it was the bandages over her eyes and that she would see after they were removed. When that day came, the doctors told her she had lost both eyes.\n\nNearly two years later, Saleem\u2019s family tried to send her back to school where she was accepted only as a \u201clistener\u201d in class, accompanying her brothers. But that arrangement ended soon as other students and teachers complained that her disfigured face was bothering them.\n\n\u201cI was crying day and night and became a very reclusive person,\u201d Saleem said.\n\nAfter the state-run hospital couldn\u2019t go beyond the necessary treatment to save her life, Saleem\u2019s family looked for plastic and reconstructive surgery for her at a private clinic, but they couldn\u2019t afford the doctor\u2019s $7,500 fee.\n\nThen, late last year, her mother made an appeal, posting photographs of Saleem and details about her ordeal in a public group on Viber. Days later, Baghdad-based Dr. Abbas al-Sahan, one of Iraq\u2019s best plastic surgeons, offered to do free surgeries.\n\nSince January, Saleem has undergone four surgeries \u2014 first so her face could accommodate the two glass eyes, or ocular prostheses, then a procedure to reduce some of the scars. She also had a surgery to adjust to a prosthetic arm and is due to have plastic surgery to reconstruct her missing ear, al-Sahan said.\n\nAl-Sahan runs the only state-run specialized hospital for reconstructive and plastic surgery in Iraq. He said that about 40 percent of the monthly surgeries his hospital preforms \u2014 between 600 to 850 \u2014 are for victims of bombings and other war-related explosions, as well as for casualties of military operations.\n\nSaleem\u2019s family feels she is lucky. Not everyone gets the help they need through social media.\n\nIraqi army Capt. Salar al-Jaff was shot by a sniper in January 2017, during the height of the fight to recapture the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State group. The bullet hit him in the head and left him paralyzed in one side of his body.\n\nSince then, he has been treated for the head wound and for complications from lying in bed all the time, but not for the paralysis. He sold his car and all his possessions to be able to afford three injections a day, each costing $100, to overcome the pain.\n\nHe also appeared in a video, posted on social media, alongside a cleric who asks that someone help al-Jaff.\n\nBut so far, there have been no offers for free treatment.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sinan Salaheddin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sinansm\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Sam McNeil, File/Associated Press)\n\nPETRA, Jordan \u2014 In ancient times, Arab tribesmen dug diversion tunnels to protect their low-lying trading post of Petra against desert flash floods. More than two millennia later, an alarm system warns visitors if flood water rushes toward what has become Jordan\u2019s main tourist attraction.\n\nEarlier this month, the alarms were activated for the first time, said Hussein al-Hasanat of the Petra Development & Tourism Region Authority. Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face.\n\nHundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said.\n\nAmateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra\u2019s main draw, as guides urged them to hurry. Later, visitors were seen standing on a higher patch near the Treasury as knee-high water poured through the canyon.\n\nElsewhere in Jordan, such alarms are still missing. Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November.\n\nThe last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan\u2019s Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above a certain level.\n\nOn Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority\u2019s control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra.\n\nThe network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra.\n\nOmar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan.\n\nHe said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas.\n\n\u201cNow towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,\u201d Dajani said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I see this as nothing more than sticking to our default state of childlessness, but my partner clearly thinks I have gotten my way and feels owed something in return.\n\nI suggested adopting a new pet, and that provoked anger, snide remarks and tears.\n\nWhat else can one person provide to make up for not having a child? Even if I sound glib about it here, I actually do feel guilty about this on a daily basis.\n\n\u2014 Baby Substitute\n\nBaby Substitute: You can\u2019t provide a substitute for a child. You didn\u2019t choose a different thing, you chose a different life.\n\nAnd the fact that you stuck to the same thing you already had doesn\u2019t mean your partner did as well. Your partner\u2019s \u201cdefault state\u201d was childlessness, technically, but that state included plans for future parenthood. So that default really was parenthood-to-be, which is not the same as your childlessness.\n\nYour decision lopped off your partner\u2019s expected life path. You came to it mutually, yes, but in areas where there is no compromise, just either-or, even a mutual decision means one of you 100 percent gets your way. You did here. This is not just something your partner \u201cthinks.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding that, and saying so out loud, and being sensitive to it hereafter \u2014 enough to imagine yourself in your partner\u2019s position before you start making suggestions \u2014 are three things you can provide to help make up for your partner\u2019s loss.\n\nFeeling guilty is not the same thing; that\u2019s just feeling as if you did something wrong. Your decision was no more wrong than it would have been had your partner\u2019s druthers prevailed.\n\nYour question sounds glib not because you\u2019re not trying \u2014 you obviously recognize you need to do something \u2014 but because your response to your partner so utterly lacks empathy. Look again: You say \u201cour default.\u201d When it comes to feelings, assuming \u201cmy\u201d means \u201cour\u201d is a potentially relationship-ending mistake, and your whole letter comes down to \u201cI\u2019m not grieving, so why are you sad?\u201d\n\nYour partner is grieving. Respond to those needs accordingly.\n\nHi, Carolyn:My husband and I are friends with a couple who are just starting the divorce process. We've been approached by both for advice, since we've been through divorces of our own. We're trying hard to be supportive of both and not take sides. Until recently, they were still living together and showing up to social events together with their kids. Wife appears cheery and \"normal,\" tries to steer clear of husband at these things, but husband is generally morose and tends to hover around wife. (He doesn't want the divorce.)\n\nNow they're officially separated. We are all part of a bigger social community, so how do we pick which one to invite? Or do we continue to invite both and hope they sort it out? We are closer to the wife, but we don't want the husband to feel like he's lost friends, especially since he's sought out my husband's support. But inviting them both seems tone deaf, especially given husband's visible awkwardness around her. Do we just alternate invitations, or invite the person we think would most enjoy the particular event (almost always wife)? Ack!\n\n\u2014 Trying to Be Sensitive\n\nTrying to Be Sensitive: Invite both and let them sort it out. The husband\u2019s \u201cvisible awkwardness\u201d is liable to change over time \u2014 possibly even soon \u2014 but the slap of being excluded by one\u2019s friends from a social event tends to sting for a very long time. Especially one delivered when you\u2019re already at a personal emotional low.\n\nIf one of them makes a habit of behaving badly at these group events, then, sure, revisit the idea of inviting only the well-behaved one \u2014 and also keep an eye out for their actual attendance. If one or both routinely opt out, then make plans with them individually and sustain the friendship that way.\n\nHowever you approach it, the new normal will soon have its say and start making these decisions for you; think of your choices now as just a bridge of decency to help them to that other side.\n\nDear Carolyn: My sister keeps her two daughters, ages 10 and 8, in car seats. Full-on, cushions-around-their-heads, CAR SEATS. The law in her state says to stop at age 8. Whenever I hint the kids should just ride in the car with seat belts, she goes ballistic on me. Thoughts? I think she's infantilizing them.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Maybe so. But infantilizing your (apparently infantile) sister is a delightfully ironic nonsolution.\n\nPlus, seats are but a tiny battle that also happens to be self-winning, since they\u2019ll soon outgrow the seats.\n\nOverprotected kids need adults who notice and reward their competence \u2014 that\u2019s the war.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Photo)\n\nTaking a look at the highs and lows of the day in college football from around the country:\n\nIt was a sure sign that things were not comfortable at Southern California when Coach Clay Helton fired offensive line coach Neil Callaway and took away offensive coordinator Tee Martin\u2019s play-calling responsibilities after the Trojans lost consecutive games last month.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen now that USC has wasted a 14-point halftime lead against California and fallen to a rebuilding UCLA bunch in back-to-back weeks?\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder whether it will be an offseason of massive change for the Trojans (5-6, 4-5 Pac-12), whose underachievement this season is all the more remarkable given the decidedly modest state of the Pac-12 South. USC now requires a victory over undefeated Notre Dame to reach a bowl game and avoid (at least temporarily) the program\u2019s first losing season since 2000.\n\nLast week\u2019s loss to Cal, which ended a 14-game winning streak in the series, was bad enough. But to give up 479 total yards in a 34-27 loss at UCLA is startling.\n\nTo their credit, the Bruins (3-8, 3-5) have continued to improve after an ugly start. They dropped five in a row to begin the season, though the last loss in that streak was a competitive showing against Washington.\n\nNonetheless, this is not a banner year for UCLA. It entered the week 93rd nationally in total offense and 101st in total defense. Of course, now it also possesses the Victory Bell.\n\nIf UCLA loses next week to Stanford, it will record its fewest victories in a season since 1989. Losing to such a team is not good look for Helton, who brought some unassuming stability to the Trojans after taking over for Steve Sarkisian in the middle of the 2015 season.\n\nConsiderable personnel losses, especially quarterback Sam Darnold, suggested USC wasn\u2019t headed for a top 10 season. But the Trojans are in a deeper hole than anyone could have anticipated back in August, a problem that has become especially plain over the last month.\n\nWinners\n\nNotre Dame. The Fighting Irish handled their penultimate hurdle of the season, smothering Syracuse, 36-3. Orange quarterback Eric Dungey left the game in the first quarter with an injury, but his presence might not have even made a significant difference. Notre Dame (11-0) controlled things from start to finish.\n\nIan Book, who sat out last week, threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns in his return. The Irish defense held Syracuse to 3.2 yards a play. And the Orange (8-3) didn\u2019t score until 10 seconds remained in the game.\n\nAll that stands between the Irish and a perfect regular season (and the lottery ticket/playoff berth nearly certain to come with it) is USC. Considering the state of the Trojans, Notre Dame\u2019s chances of earning a spot in the semifinals look quite good.\n\nPittsburgh. The Panthers (7-4, 6-1 ACC) have claimed the ACC\u2019s Coastal Division title after disposing of Wake Forest, 34-13. Quarterback Kenny Pickett threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns, as Pitt earned its first trip to the ACC title game. It will be the Coastal\u2019s sixth representative in the event in as many years.\n\nOn paper, Pitt will be a decided underdog against Clemson. Then again, things worked out all right for Pat Narduzzi\u2019s team in its last meeting with the Tigers, a 43-42 triumph in Death Valley that proved to be the only loss absorbed by the eventual national champions.\n\nJonathan Taylor. A 300-yard day for a Wisconsin back isn\u2019t unprecedented. Melvin Gordon dropped 408 yards on Nebraska in 2014. Anthony Davis nosed over 300 in 2002. Future Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne bulldozed Hawaii for 339 yards in 1996.\n\nSo Taylor\u2019s 321-yard day on 33 carries doesn\u2019t land in best-game-ever territory for the Badgers. But it was still exceptional. He had 61 of his yards in extra time as Wisconsin earned a 47-44 victory at Purdue, capping the game with a 17-yard jaunt in the third overtime period.\n\nThe Citadel. Okay, this stretches the definition of \u201cwinner\u201d more than usual. But the Bulldogs had a 45-yard field goal to take the lead at Alabama in the third quarter. That\u2019s impressive, considering the Crimson Tide haven\u2019t trailed in the second half all season.\n\nAlabama eventually rolled to a 50-17 victory, and the 10-10 tie at the break will soon be a distant memory. But in a week arguably designed to provide a breather for the Crimson Tide\u2019s starters before dealing with the Iron Bowl and the SEC title game, Nick Saban\u2019s team ended up facing one of its trickiest tests.\n\nClemson. The Tigers gave up a couple early field goals, then took control in a 35-6 victory over Duke. Clemson (11-0, 8-0 ACC) completed a perfect conference season and will have a stress-free Selection Sunday if it can handle South Carolina and Pittsburgh over the next two weeks. Even one loss in those two games might not be enough to deny the Tigers a fourth playoff berth in a row.\n\nTexas. The Longhorns (8-3, 6-2 Big 12) are a victory away from a conference title game appearance after dispatching Iowa State, 24-10. The scenarios are simple: If Texas beats Kansas next week, it will face the winner of Oklahoma-West Virginia on Dec. 1.\n\nIf Oklahoma beats the Mountaineers, Texas will finish in sole possession of second place in the Big 12, as long as it beats Kansas. If Texas and West Virginia both win, there will be a three-way tie at 7-2 and Oklahoma would be squeezed out, because it would have lost to both the Longhorns and the Mountaineers.\n\nCentral Florida. McKenzie Milton tossed three touchdown passes as the Knights won their 23rd in a row and improved to 10-0 this season, routing Cincinnati, 38-13. The victory secured a trip to the American Athletic title game, and it puts the Knights within two victories of another New Year\u2019s Six appearance.\n\nLosers\n\nWest Virginia. That\u2019s that for the Mountaineers\u2019 realistic national title hopes. A week after Oklahoma State hung close with Oklahoma, the Cowboys finished the job in a 45-41 victory over West Virginia. Tylan Wallace\u2019s 11-yard touchdown catch with 42 seconds remaining pushed Oklahoma State ahead.\n\nThe Mountaineers (8-2, 6-2 Big 12) still possessed a shot at reaching the playoff coming into the week. Now, they need to beat Oklahoma in the regular-season finale to feel good about their chances of even making the Big 12 title game.\n\nVirginia Tech. The Hokies\u2019 25-year bowl streak is even more at risk after a 38-14 loss to Miami. Given the disintegration of the Virginia Tech defense, it is appropriate its presence helped revive the previously dormant Hurricane offense. Miami (6-5, 3-4 ACC) snapped a four-game slide, while Virginia Tech (4-6, 3-4) needs to defeat Virginia and Marshall in the next two weeks to finish at .500.\n\nIllinois. If the Illini (4-7, 2-6 Big Ten) just absorbed a routine loss to Iowa, they wouldn\u2019t make the cut for this exercise. After all, Illinois isn\u2019t very good, and there isn\u2019t much point in dwelling on it.\n\nBut a 63-0 shellacking at home is a 63-0 shellacking at home. It isn\u2019t a Big Ten record-setter \u2014 not even close. But it did tie for the Illini\u2019s most lopsided loss ever, matching a 63-0 defeat against the University of Chicago in 1906.\n\nRead More:\n\nMonths after cancer diagnosis, Kentucky football player makes first start of the season\n\n\u2018Big Game' between Cal and Stanford postponed due to poor air quality\n\nDino Babers, college football\u2019s tent revivalist\n\nMaryland vs. Ohio State had nearly everything but a breakthrough win for the Terps"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Dan Balz, The Washington Post", "title": "BALZ: What has President Trump learned from defeat?", "description": "All presidents suffer defeats and setbacks, whether through elections, legislative battles, international events or scandals.

His actions and words in the days following the midterm elections indicate things actually could get worse rather than better. He has never been a gracious winner. In defeat, he has shown worse: ill-tempered, withdrawn, even more unpredictable.\n\nTrump was elected in 2016 to lead a divided country. The midterm results, however, make clear the degree to which he has widened those divisions. He has driven suburban voters, especially college-educated women, away from the Republican Party. His hold on rural America remains strong, but the midterms suggest possible slippage.\n\nHe was elected to lead a world in transition and under stress. He has added to that stress by weakening traditional alliances and embracing authoritarian leaders, while offering no clear strategy for key areas of the world. He has sought to dismantle or redraw global trade deals and other arrangements that his predecessors helped to construct.\n\n'Close to complete victory'\n\nIt may be premature to draw a conclusion about what lessons he has learned, but rather than moving to mitigate the damage done to his party in the midterms or to assert international leadership, Trump has done the opposite in the days since the elections. He has reinforced what his presidency has wrought, domestically and internationally, and left others to worry about what comes next.\n\nAt home, Trump claimed that the midterms were \u201cclose to complete victory\u201d for his party and especially for himself. It was an extravagant assertion at the time he made it \u2014 the day after the elections \u2014 and even more so today. Other presidents have accepted some responsibility for the losses of their party in midterm elections, or at least acknowledged the reality of defeat. Trump is having none of that.\n\nYet the scope of the Nov. 6 defeat is now undeniable. The president is correct that Republicans gained ground in the Senate, reinforcing their narrow majority, but equally incorrect is his saying the media haven\u2019t highlighted those gains. The media also have noted that Republicans enjoyed the most favorable Senate election map in generations.\n\nRepublicans defeated three red-state Democratic senators. GOP candidates also won or are leading in four high-profile statewide races \u2014 gubernatorial elections in Florida and Georgia and Senate races in Florida and in Texas. But the party surrendered GOP-held Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona and lost senatorial or gubernatorial contests in three presidential battlegrounds in the Midwest.\n\n[Five days of fury: What happened in the days after the election?]\n\nThe House results produced a string of defeats that have left the GOP weaker in key parts of the country, states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, for example. In New England, other than Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Republicans will have no congressional representation. In California, Orange (as in County) is the new blue, after several victories by Democrats in competitive House districts in a county that once was the symbolic and real heartland of American conservatism.\n\nJubilant Democrats will face a reckoning two years from now, however, when their newly minted House members stand for reelection. Many of the winners (in both parties, actually) carried their districts with slender margins. The 2020 elections will test the resilience of these new members, whose races will enjoy less prominence and potentially less money than they had this year, given the overriding attention the presidential race will receive.\n\nBut this year\u2019s elections laid a foundation, thanks in large part to voters\u2019 negative reactions to the president. Young voters supported Democrats by margins well beyond those rung up even by Barack Obama in his two presidential campaigns. Voters under age 30 supported Democrats by 44 points, according to a post-election analysis by the Democratic firm Catalist.\n\nThe suburban defeats are potentially the most damaging to the GOP, if Trump or other GOP leaders do not act to reverse them. Orange County is one example but not the only suburban area that produced gains for Democrats. DuPage County, outside Chicago, has been a Republican stronghold for years, though the GOP\u2019s grip had been weakening. Now, not a single House member in the new Congress whose district includes a part of DuPage County will be a Republican.\n\nSuburban voters in red states also showed increased support for Democratic candidates, whether it was Texas or Georgia, Utah or Oklahoma.\n\n[Trump wonders why no one talks much about this part of the midterms]\n\nRepublicans now hold a strong base in rural America. But in this election, their margins were not as big as Trump rolled up in 2016. The president\u2019s advisers argue, fairly, that people should be cautious about projecting forward as to how those rural areas will vote in 2020, when Trump\u2019s name is again on the ballot. But if the suburbs are trending away, he will need all the rural ground he had in 2016 and perhaps more.\n\nOff to Paris\n\nInternationally, the president\u2019s trip to Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the armistice of World War I brought a reminder of the degree to which he has chosen to stand apart from traditional U.S. allies. He was absent physically at key moments, and absent intellectually in providing the leadership that long has come with being the American president.\n\nThe armistice of World War I is an event marked yearly with ceremonies throughout Europe, in small towns and the great capitals. The centenary was meant to be the biggest such commemoration in decades. Yet Trump did not go, as scheduled, to pay respects at an American cemetery outside Paris, where more than 2,000 American troops are buried. Weather was blamed for the decision, but he later vented at his staff for making him look bad.\n\nThe next day he chose not to march in the rain with other global leaders on the Champs-Elysees, choosing instead to be driven to the Arc de Triomphe for the later ceremony. Another leader who skipped the solidarity march was Russian President Vladimir Putin. Later, Trump engaged in a Twitter spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, after Macron in his ceremony speech sharply rebuked the concept of nationalism that Trump has embraced.\n\nNicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served Republican and Democratic presidents as a career diplomat, said of the trip, \u201cIt was one of the most ineffective presidential trips I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nAfter returning to the United States last Sunday night, Trump chose not to make the traditional presidential trip to Arlington Cemetery the following morning to observe Veterans Day. Later in the week, apparently seeking to make amends, he went to the Marine Barracks in Washington for a lunchtime visit. On Friday, he acknowledged he had made a mistake by not going to Arlington Cemetery. He said he was busy making \u201ccalls for the country.\u201d\n\nSince returning from Paris, Trump has embraced bipartisan legislation on criminal justice restructuring. Is that a sign of the future or a one-off by the president? At home and abroad, he is being closely watched for signs of how the election defeats have affected him. He has plodded through the days after the election, seeming mostly unhappy in what was \u201cclose to compete victory.\u201d He now must know what was lost in the midterms, but he seems lost in knowing how to respond."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America...", "description": "'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America...

His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed. He logged onto his website and began to invent his first news story of the day.\n\n\u201cBREAKING,\u201d he wrote, pecking out each letter with his index fingers as he considered the possibilities. Maybe he would announce that Hillary Clinton had died during a secret overseas mission to smuggle more refugees into America. Maybe he would award President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize for his courage in denying climate change.\n\nA new message popped onto Blair\u2019s screen from a friend who helped with his website. \u201cWhat viral insanity should we spread this morning?\u201d the friend asked.\n\n\u201cThe more extreme we become, the more people believe it,\u201d Blair replied.\n\nHe had launched his new website on Facebook during the 2016 presidential campaign as a practical joke among friends \u2014 a political satire site started by Blair and a few other liberal bloggers who wanted to make fun of what they considered to be extremist ideas spreading throughout the far right. In the last two years on his page, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, Blair had made up stories about California instituting sharia, former president Bill Clinton becoming a serial killer, undocumented immigrants defacing Mount Rushmore, and former president Barack Obama dodging the Vietnam draft when he was 9. \u201cShare if you\u2019re outraged!\u201d his posts often read, and thousands of people on Facebook had clicked \u201clike\u201d and then \u201cshare,\u201d most of whom did not recognize his posts as satire. Instead, Blair\u2019s page had become one of the most popular on Facebook among Trump-supporting conservatives over 55.\n\n\u201cNothing on this page is real,\u201d read one of the 14 disclaimers on Blair\u2019s site, and yet in the America of 2018 his stories had become real, reinforcing people\u2019s biases, spreading onto Macedonian and Russian fake news sites, amassing an audience of as many 6 million visitors each month who thought his posts were factual. What Blair had first conceived of as an elaborate joke was beginning to reveal something darker. \u201cNo matter how racist, how bigoted, how offensive, how obviously fake we get, people keep coming back,\u201d Blair once wrote, on his own personal Facebook page. \u201cWhere is the edge? Is there ever a point where people realize they\u2019re being fed garbage and decide to return to reality?\u201d\n\n\n\nBlair, in the woods near his home, wanted to make fun of what he and others considered extremist ideas among the far right. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAt his keyboard, Blair has made up stories about sharia in California and undocumented immigrants defacing Mount Rushmore. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nBlair\u2019s own reality was out beyond the shuttered curtains of his office: a three-bedroom home in the forest of Maine where the paved road turned to gravel; not his house but a rental; not on the lake but near it. Over the past decade his family had moved around the country a half-dozen times as he looked for steady work, bouncing between construction and restaurant jobs while sometimes living on food stamps. During the economic crash of 2008, his wife had taken a job at Wendy\u2019s to help pay down their credit-card debt, and Blair, a lifelong Democrat, had begun venting his political frustration online, arguing with strangers in an Internet forum called Brawl Hall. He sometimes masqueraded as a tea party conservative on Facebook so he could gain administrative access into their private groups and then flood their pages with liberal ideas before using his administrative status to shut their pages down.\n\nHe had created more than a dozen online profiles over the last years, sometimes disguising himself in accompanying photographs as a beautiful Southern blond woman or as a bandana-wearing conservative named Flagg Eagleton, baiting people into making racist or sexist comments and then publicly eviscerating them for it. In his writing Blair was blunt, witty and prolific, and gradually he\u2019d built a liberal following on the Internet and earned a full-time job as a political blogger. On the screen, like nowhere else, he could say exactly how he felt and become whomever he wanted.\n\nNow he hunched over a desk wedged between an overturned treadmill and two turtle tanks, scanning through conservative forums on Facebook for something that might inspire his next post. He was 6-foot-6 and 325 pounds, and he typed several thousand words each day in all capital letters. He noticed a photo online of Trump standing at attention for the national anthem during a White House ceremony. Behind the president were several dozen dignitaries, including a white woman standing next to a black woman, and Blair copied the picture, circled the two women in red and wrote the first thing that came into his mind.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump extended an olive branch and invited Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cThey thanked him by giving him \u2018the finger\u2019 during the national anthem. Lock them up for treason!\u201d\n\nBlair finished typing and looked again at the picture. The white woman was not in fact Chelsea Clinton but former White House strategist Hope Hicks. The black woman was not Michelle Obama but former Trump aide Omarosa Newman. Neither Obama nor Clinton had been invited to the ceremony. Nobody had flipped off the president. The entire premise was utterly ridiculous, which was exactly Blair\u2019s point.\n\n\u201cWe live in an Idiocracy,\u201d read a small note on Blair\u2019s desk, and he was taking full advantage. In a good month, the advertising revenue from his website earned him as much as $15,000, and it had also won him a loyal army of online fans. Hundreds of liberals now visited America\u2019s Last Line of Defense to humiliate conservatives who shared Blair\u2019s fake stories as fact. In Blair\u2019s private Facebook messages with his liberal supporters, his conservative audience was made up of \u201csheep,\u201d \u201chillbillies,\u201d \u201cmaw-maw and paw-paw,\u201d \u201cTrumpTards,\u201d \u201cpotatoes\u201d and \u201ctaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could any thinking person believe this nonsense?\u201d he said.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n***\n\nIt was barely dawn in Pahrump, Nev., when Shirley Chapian, 76, logged onto Facebook for her morning computer game of Criminal Case. She believed in starting each day with a problem-solving challenge, a quick mental exercise to keep her brain sharp more than a decade into retirement. For a while it had been the daily crossword puzzle, but then the local newspaper stopped delivering and a friend introduced her to the viral Facebook game with 65 million players. She spent an hour as a 1930s detective, interrogating witnesses and trying to parse their lies from the truth until finally she solved case No. 48 and clicked over to her Facebook news feed.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Shirley! Thanks for being here,\u201d read an automated note at the top of her page. She put her finger on the mouse and began scrolling down.\n\n\u201cClick LIKE if you believe we must stop Sharia Law from coming to America before it\u2019s too late,\u201d read the first item, and she clicked \u201clike.\u201d\n\n\u201cShare to help END the ongoing migrant invasion!\u201d read another, and she clicked \u201cshare.\u201d\n\nThe house was empty and quiet except for the clicking of her computer mouse. She lived alone, and on many days her only personal interaction occurred here, on Facebook. Mixed into her morning news feed were photos and updates from some of her 300 friends, but most items came directly from political groups Chapian had chosen to follow: \u201cFree Speech Patriots,\u201d \u201cTaking Back America,\u201d \u201cBan Islam,\u201d \u201cTrump 2020\u201d and \u201cRebel Life.\u201d Each political page published several posts each day directly into Chapian\u2019s feed, many of which claimed to be \u201cBREAKING NEWS.\u201d\n\nOn her computer the attack against America was urgent and unrelenting. Liberals were restricting free speech. Immigrants were storming the border and casting illegal votes. Politicians were scheming to take away everyone\u2019s guns. \u201cThe second you stop paying attention, there\u2019s another travesty underway in this country,\u201d Chapian once wrote, in her own Facebook post, so she had decided to always pay attention, sometimes scrolling and sharing for hours at a time.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Democrat mega-donor accused of sexual assault!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Michelle Obama really dating Bruce Springsteen?\u201d\n\n\u201cIowa Farmer Claims Bill Clinton had Sex with Cow during \u2018Cocaine Party.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nChapian\u2019s glasses reflect a Facebook page as she reads it on her computer. She gets most of her news from the social-media site. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nChapian scrolls through her newsfeed. She sometimes wakes up to check Facebook in the middle of the night. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOn display above Chapian\u2019s screen were needlepoints that had once occupied much of her free time, intricate pieces of artwork that took hundreds of hours to complete, but now she didn\u2019t have the patience. Out her window was a dead-end road of identical beige-and-brown rock gardens surrounding double-wide trailers that looked similar to her own, many of them occupied by neighbors whom she\u2019d never met. Beyond that was nothing but cactuses and heat waves for as far as she could see \u2014 a stretch of unincorporated land that continued from her backyard into the desert.\n\nShe\u2019d spent almost a decade in Pahrump without really knowing why. The heat could be unbearable. She had no family in Nevada. She loved going to movies, and the town of 30,000 didn\u2019t have a theater. It seemed to her like a place in the business of luring people \u2014 into the air-conditioned casinos downtown, into the legal brothels on the edge of the desert, into the new developments of cheap housing available for no money down \u2014 and in some ways she\u2019d become stuck, too.\n\nShe had lived much of her life in cities throughout Europe and across the United States \u2014 places such as San Francisco, New York and Miami. She\u2019d gone to college for a few years and become an insurance adjuster, working as one of the few women in the field in the 1980s and \u201990s and joining the National Organization for Women to advocate for an equal wage before eventually moving to Rhode Island to work for a hospice and care for her aging parents. After her mother died, Chapian decided to retire and move to Las Vegas to live with a friend, and when Las Vegas become too expensive a real estate agent told her about Pahrump. She bought a three-bedroom trailer for less than $100,000 and painted it purple. She met a few friends at the local senior center and started eating at the Thai restaurant in town. A few years after arriving, she bought a new computer monitor and signed up for Facebook in 2009, choosing as her profile image a photo of her cat.\n\n\u201cLooking to connect with friends and other like-minded people,\u201d she wrote then.\n\nShe had usually voted for Republicans, just like her parents, but it was only on Facebook that Chapian had become a committed conservative. She was wary of Obama in the months after his election, believing him to be both arrogant and inexperienced, and on Facebook she sought out a litany of information that seemed to confirm her worst fears, unaware that some of that information was false. It wasn\u2019t just that Obama was liberal, she read; he was actually a socialist. It wasn\u2019t just that his political qualifications were thin; it was that he had fabricated those qualifications, including parts of his college transcripts and maybe even his birth certificate.\n\nFor years she had watched network TV news, but increasingly Chapian wondered about the widening gap between what she read online and what she heard on the networks. \u201cWhat else aren\u2019t they telling us?\u201d she wrote once, on Facebook, and if she believed the mainstream media was becoming insufficient or biased, it was her responsibility to seek out alternatives. She signed up for a dozen conservative newsletters and began to watch Alex Jones on Infowars. One far right Facebook group eventually led her to the next with targeted advertising, and soon Chapian was following more than 2,500 conservative pages, an ideological echo chamber that often trafficked in skepticism. Climate change was a hoax. The mainstream media was censored or scripted. Political Washington was under control of a \u201cdeep state.\u201d\n\nChapian didn\u2019t believe everything she read online, but she was also distrustful of mainstream fact-checkers and reported news. It sometimes felt to her like real facts had become indiscernible \u2014 that the truth was often somewhere in between. What she trusted most was her own ability to think critically and discern the truth, and increasingly her instincts aligned with the online community where she spent most of her time. It had been months since she\u2019d gone to a movie. It had been almost a year since she\u2019d made the hour-long trip to Las Vegas. Her number of likes and shares on Facebook increased each year until she was sometimes awakening to check her news feed in the middle of the night, liking and commenting on dozens of posts each day. She felt as if she was being let in on a series of dark revelations about the United States, and it was her responsibility to see and to share them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a conspiracy-theory-type person, but . . .\u201d she wrote, before sharing a link to an unsourced story suggesting that Democratic donor George Soros had been a committed Nazi, or that a Parkland shooting survivor was actually a paid actor.\n\nNow another post arrived in her news feed, from a page called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which Chapian had been following for more than a year. It showed a picture of Trump standing at a White House ceremony. Circled in the background were two women, one black and one white.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump extended an olive branch and invited Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton,\u201d the post read. \u201cThey thanked him by giving him \u2018the finger\u2019 during the national anthem.\u201d\n\nChapian looked at the photo and nothing about it surprised her. Of course Trump had invited Clinton and Obama to the White House in a generous act of patriotism. Of course the Democrats \u2014 or \u201cDemonrats,\u201d as Chapian sometimes called them \u2014 had acted badly and disrespected America. It was the exact same narrative she saw playing out on her screen hundreds of times each day, and this time she decided to click \u2018like\u2019 and leave a comment.\n\n\u201cWell, they never did have any class,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n\nChapian\u2019s newsfeed awaits her return. She says she doesn\u2019t believe everything she reads online, but she also is distrustful of mainstream fact-checkers and reported news. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n***\n\nBlair had invented thousands of stories in the past two years, always trafficking in the same stereotypes to fool the same people, but he never tired of watching a post take off: Eight shares in the first minute, 160 within 15 minutes, more than 1,000 by the end of the hour.\n\n\u201cAaaaand, we\u2019re viral,\u201d he wrote, in a message to his liberal supporters on his private Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where I can no longer control the absolute absurdity of the things I post. No matter how ridiculous, how obviously fake, or how many times you tell the same taters . . . they will still click that \u2018like\u2019 and hit that share button.\u201d\n\nBy the standards of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, the item about Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton was only a moderate success. It included no advertisements, so it wouldn\u2019t earn Blair any money. It wasn\u2019t even the most popular of the 11 items he\u2019d published that day. But, just an hour earlier, Blair had come up with an idea at his computer in Maine, and now hundreds or maybe thousands of people across the country believed Obama and Clinton had flipped off the president.\n\n\u201cGross. Those women have no respect for themselves,\u201d wrote a woman in Fort Washakie, Wyo.\n\n\u201cThey deserve to be publicly shunned,\u201d said a man in Gainesville, Fla.\n\n\u201cNot surprising behavior from such ill bred trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cJail them now!!!\u201d\n\nBlair had fooled them. Now came his favorite part, the gotcha, when he could let his victims in on the joke.\n\n\u201cOK, taters. Here\u2019s your reality check,\u201d he wrote on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, placing his comment prominently alongside the original post. \u201cThat is Omarosa and Hope Hicks, not Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton. They wouldn\u2019t be caught dead posing for this pseudo-patriotic nationalistic garbage . . . Congratulations, stupid.\u201d\n\nBeyond the money he earned, this was what Blair had conceived of as the purpose for his website: to engage directly with people who spread false or extremist stories and prove those stories were wrong. Maybe, after people had been publicly embarrassed, they would think more critically about what they shared online. Maybe they would begin to question the root of some of their ideas.\n\nBlair didn\u2019t have time to personally confront each of the several hundred thousand conservatives who followed his Facebook page, so he\u2019d built a community of more than 100 liberals to police the page with him. Together they patrolled the comments, venting their own political anger, shaming conservatives who had been fooled, taunting them, baiting them into making racist comments that could then be reported to Facebook. Blair said he and his followers had gotten hundreds of people banned from Facebook and several others fired or demoted in their jobs for offensive behavior online. He had also forced Facebook to shut down 22 fake news sites for plagiarizing his content, many of which were Macedonian sites that reran his stories without labeling them as satire.\n\nWhat Blair wasn\u2019t sure he had ever done was change a single person\u2019s mind. The people he fooled often came back to the page, and he continued to feed them the kind of viral content that boosted his readership and his bank account: invented stories about Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players, imams, Black Lives Matter protesters, immigrants, George Soros, the Clinton Foundation, Michelle and Malia Obama. He had begun to include more obvious disclaimers at the top of every post and to intentionally misspell several words in order to highlight the idiocy of his work, but still traffic continued to climb. Sometimes he wondered: Rather than of awakening people to reality, was he pushing them further from it?\n\n\u201cWell, they never did have any class,\u201d commented Shirley Chapian, from Pahrump, Nev., and Blair watched his liberal followers respond.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of an ironic comment coming from pure trailer trash, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a gullible moron who just fell for a fake story on a Liberal satire page.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou my dear . . . are as smart as a potato.\u201d\n\n\n\nChapian has sometimes liked and shared fake stories by Blair on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nBlair has built a community of more than 100 liberals to police his page with him. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n***\n\n\u201cWhat a waste of flesh and time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to the internet. Critical thinking required.\u201d\n\nChapian saw the comments after her post and wondered as she often did when she was attacked: Who were these people? And what were they talking about? Of course Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton had flipped off the president. It was true to what she knew of their character. That was what mattered.\n\nInstead of responding directly to strangers on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, Chapian wrote on her own Facebook page. \u201cNasty liberals,\u201d she said, and then she went back to her news feed, each day blending into the next.\n\nA Muslim woman with her burqa on fire: like. A policeman using a baton to beat a masked antifa protester: like. Hillary Clinton looking gaunt and pale: like. A military helicopter armed with machine guns and headed toward the caravan of immigrants: like.\n\nShe had spent a few hours scrolling one afternoon when she heard a noise outside her window, and she turned away from the screen to look outside. A neighbor was sweeping his sidewalk, pushing tiny white rocks back into his rock garden. The sky was an uninterrupted blue. A mailman worked his way up the empty street. There were no signs of \u201cSharia Law.\u201d The migrant caravan was still hundreds of miles away in Mexico. Antifa protesters had yet to descend on Pahrump. Chapian squinted against the sun, closed the shades and went back to her screen.\n\nA picture of undocumented immigrants laughing inside a voting booth: like.\n\n\u201cDeep State Alive and Well\u201d: like.\n\nShe scrolled upon another post from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, reading fast, oblivious to the satire labels and not noticing Blair\u2019s trademark awkward phrasings and misspellings. It showed a group of children kneeling on prayer mats in a classroom. \u201cCalifornia School children forced to Sharia in Class,\u201d it read. \u201cAll of them have stopped eating bacon. Two began speaking in Allah. Stop making children pray to imaginary Gods!!\u201d\n\nChapian recoiled from the screen. \u201cPlease!\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had a kid in a school system like that, I\u2019d yank them out so fast.\u201d\n\nShe had seen hundreds of stories on Facebook about the threat of sharia, and this confirmed much of what she already believed. It was probably true, she thought. It was true enough.\n\n\u201cDo people understand that things like this are happening in this country?\u201d she said. She clicked the post and the traffic registered back to a computer in Maine, where Blair watched another story go viral and wondered when his audience would get his joke."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Migrants get cool reception in Mexican border town", "description": "Many of the nearly 3,000 migrants who have reached the border with California say they do not feel welcome in the Mexican city of Tijuana", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/migrants-get-cool-reception-in-mexican-border-town/2018/11/17/5bc782fe-eae0-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T03:16:37Z", "content": "TIJUANA, Mexico Many of the nearly 3,000 Central American migrants who have reached the Mexican border with California via caravan said Saturday they do not feel welcome in the city of Tijuana, where hundreds more migrants are headed after more than a month o\u2026 [+6887 chars]", "fulltext": "Residents stand on a hill before barriers, wrapped in concertina wire, separating Mexico and the United States, where the border meets the Pacific Ocean, in Tijuana, Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018.

The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants\u2019 plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at the migrants.\n\nIt\u2019s a stark contrast to the many Mexican communities that welcomed the caravan with signs, music and donations of clothing after it entered Mexico nearly a month ago. Countless residents of rural areas pressed fruit and bags of water into the migrants\u2019 hands as they passed through southern Mexico, wishing them safe journeys.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, visited the outdoor sports complex Saturday. Rivera expects the migrants will need to be sheltered for eight months or more, and said he is working with Mexico to get more funds to feed and care for them. He expects the migrant numbers in Tijuana to reach 3,400 over the weekend, with another 1,200 migrants having made it to Mexicali, another border city a few hours to the east of Tijuana. An additional 1,500 migrants plan to reach the U.S. border region next week.\n\nRivera said 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision.\n\n\u201cWe want them to return to Honduras,\u201d Rivera said, adding that each migrant must weigh whether to go home, appeal for asylum in Mexico or wait in line to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe Mexican Interior Ministry said Friday that 2,697 Central American migrants have requested asylum in Mexico under a program that the country launched on Oct. 26 to more quickly get them credentials needed to live, work and study in southern Mexico.\n\nIvis Mu\u00f1oz, 26, has considered returning to Honduras. The coffee farmer called his father in Atima, Honduras, on Saturday to consult on his next move a few days after being attacked on a beach by locals in Tijuana. His father told him to stick it out.\n\nMunoz has a bullet in his leg. A gang member shot him a year ago in Honduras and threatened to kill him if he sees him again. Munoz said he found out later his girlfriend had been cheating on him with the gang member.\n\nHe\u2019s afraid to go home, but he feels unwelcome in Tijuana.\n\nMunoz was asleep on a beach in Tijuana with about two dozen other migrants when rocks came raining down on them around 2 a.m. Wednesday. He heard a man shout in the darkness: \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here! Go back to your country!\u201d Munoz and the others got up and ran for cover, heading toward the residential streets nearby. As the sun rose, they hitched a ride on a passing truck to Tijuana\u2019s downtown. Now he is staying at the sports complex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Munoz. He fears the U.S. won\u2019t grant him asylum, and that he\u2019ll get deported if he tries to cross into the country without authorization.\n\nCarlos Padilla, 57, a migrant from Progreso, Honduras, said a Tijuana resident shouted \u201cmigrants are pigs\u201d as he passed on the street recently. He did not respond. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to cause problems, we came here with love and with the intention to ask for asylum,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cBut they treat us like animals here.\u201d\n\nPadilla said he will likely return to Honduras if the U.S. rejects his asylum request.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana officials said they converted the municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city\u2019s privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000; as of Friday night there were 2,397 migrants there.\n\nSome business owners near the shelter complained on Saturday of migrants panhandling and stealing.\n\nFrancisco Lopez, 50, owns a furniture store nearby. He said a group of migrants took food from a small grocery a few doors down, and he worries that crime in the area will rise the longer the migrants stay at the shelter.\n\nOther neighbors expressed empathy.\n\n\u201cThese poor people have left their country and they\u2019re in an unfamiliar place,\u201d said Maria de Jesus Izarraga, 68, who lives two blocks from complex.\n\nAs Izarraga spoke from her home\u2019s front door, a man interrupted to ask for money to buy a plate of beans. He said he came with the caravan and had blisters on his feet. She gave him some pesos, and continued speaking: \u201cI hope this all works out in the best possible way.\u201d\n\nOutside the complex, lines of migrants snaked along the street to receive donations of clothes and coolers full of bottled water being dropped off by charity groups and others looking to help the migrants.\n\nFelipe Garza, 55, acknowledged that many in his hometown don\u2019t want to help as he and other volunteers from his church handed migrants coffee and rolls at the impromptu municipal shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to receive such a big multitude of people, but it\u2019s a reality that we have to deal with,\u201d he said.\n\nGarza surmised that if the Central Americans behave, Tijuana will embrace them just as it did thousands of Haitians in 2016. Those Haitians have since opened restaurants, hair salons and enrolled in local universities.\n\nPolice officer Victor Coronel agrees but wonders how much more the city can take. \u201cThe only thing we can do is hope that President (Donald) Trump opens his heart a little,\u201d said Coronel.\n\nTrump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week\u2019s elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim new criticism at the migrants.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country \u2014 yet they are proudly waving ... their country\u2019s flag. Can this be possible? Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it,\u201d Trump said in a pair of tweets.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Maybe the College Football Playoff selection committee could behold that \u201c3\u201d in its volumes of data, then just shade the numeral and delete it.\n\nSurely it will have the urge, because the 36-3 quashing Notre Dame put on a Syracuse team averaging 44 points actually deserved a flat-out shutout in terms of its look and feel and effect. That the No. 3 Fighting Irish could subject a team ranked No. 12 and specializing in offense to such a negation became yet another argument on their pile of arguments toward the playoff.\n\nThat path reached 11-0 with one task left \u2014 at reeling Southern California next week \u2014 as Syracuse\u2019s third-year coach, Dino Babers, wound up marveling: \u201cI will tell you this: Notre Dame is better than what people think they are. That\u2019s a really, really good football team.\u201d\n\nHe had just seen his 8-2 team land at 8-3 as its 11 opening possessions, which stretched deep into the third quarter, squeezed out 122 yards and eight first downs beneath a 29-0 scoreboard, numbers that left the closing totals of 234 and 16 as inappropriate as that \u201c3.\u201d For three quarters, the Orange, accustomed to venturing to all portions of the gridirons against lesser defenses, never found itself closer than 42 yards from the end zone, notable even when considering that Eric Dungey, the 69th-rated passer coming in, left early with an apparent back injury and the score 13-0.\n\nEven Syracuse\u2019s thrills proved distinctly fleeting. In the second quarter with the score still 13-0, fill-in Tommy DeVito, a New Jerseyan who can throw it, rang one deep over the middle to Taj Harris, whereupon free safety Alohi Gilman rammed into Harris to squeeze out the football, which landed conveniently in Gilman\u2019s hands.\n\nFifty-one yards downfield, Gilman had Notre Dame at the Syracuse 9-yard line, where the ensuing hole for running back Jafar Armstrong really did seem big enough for the D train to zoom through. All seemed academic from there if it hadn\u2019t already.\n\nThe afternoon did have its memorable accoutrements, with subway trains going by outside the right field seats just beyond the Notre Dame tubas in the stands, and the foul poles off to the sides, and the odd Notre Dame home updates from the Indiana State Police and about its women\u2019s basketball team. Ian Book, the hotshot Notre Dame quarterback who began the year as a backup and returned Saturday after a one-week injury absence, imagined that just entering the stadium would be unforgettable.\n\nAt one point fairly late, the stadium speakers played Jay-Z and Alicia Keys\u2019s eternal \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d but by then the New York edict of \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do\u201d seemed a bit overstated. For example, you could not move against Notre Dame\u2019s defense, No. 9 in the country in yards per play allowed and looking stouter than that.\n\n\u201cI could tell you this, that I really liked our plan going in,\u201d said Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly, whose defensive coordinator, Clark Lea, is luring attention. \u201cI liked the structure of it. . . . I liked the focus of our defense. They really trusted what we were doing.\u201d\n\nKelly didn\u2019t know whether such confidence ever incorporates planning to \u201cpin a shutout\u201d \u2014 or an aching near-shutout \u2014 \u201con a team averaging 44,\u201d but he did say this: \u201cThey caught us in some pass-rush situations when they ran the football, when we were short on numbers, but that was all it was going to be.\u201d\n\nFor Syracuse\u2019s effective running-game counters, Notre Dame deployed running-game-defense stunts.\n\nWhatever those stunts were, those were good stunts.\n\nThen, the passing: \u201cI looked up, and I think I saw at one point they had like 30 passing yards next to us, had a lot of passing yards,\u201d Notre Dame cornerback Julian Love said. In a matter-of-fact, non-bawdy voice, he followed with, \u201cThat\u2019s just us being dominant.\u201d\n\nHe said he sensed that dominance coming all week. \u201cWhen you look at teams like them, that scheme is what gets people confused,\u201d Love said. \u201cTo eliminate and negate that, just attack them.\u201d\n\nStudy film, he said, and: \u201cNobody\u2019s attacking these guys. They\u2019re waiting and then catching up.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s defense probably could pull off both the attacking and the waiting if needed, and Babers said of it, \u201cThey turned the game from chess to checkers, and now guys have to make plays.\u201d He would look out, and, \u201cEverybody\u2019s covered.\u201d He said, \u201cThere were a lot of times when Tommy\u2019s just throwing the ball away.\u201d\n\nSyracuse\u2019s resurgence ran into something it had not seen \u2014 a program that, like Syracuse, went 4-8 just two seasons ago.\n\nNow Notre Dame is back in a heyday. It has Book, the fine-throwing, mobile quarterback Babers described as both an \u201ceel\u201d and a \u201cjack rabbit,\u201d in an elevated state of gratefulness. Book said: \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s just moving really fast.\u201d And: \u201cYou snap your finger and you\u2019ve got one more game in the regular season, and it\u2019s crazy.\u201d And: \u201cTo see it unfold is special.\u201d And: \u201cI just feel fortunate to be in this position and just to be able to play football, which is a game I love.\u201d\n\nIt has Kelly saying, \u201cYou know, 36 points in November against the number 12 team in the country \u2014 you know, you are who you are at this point in the season, and [Syracuse is] a good football team.\u201d And: \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in being compared [to No. 1 Alabama or No. 2 Clemson]. All we want to do is play our best football when we get to November, and we\u2019re playing really good football, \u00adespecially on defense.\u201d\n\nAnd college football has Notre Dame, two years from 4-8, about a century from the Knute Rockne and George Gipp who appeared on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard at one point, and one win from another fresh height, with the committee probably ready to go ahead and delete that little \u201c3.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Cyclone kills 33 in India with thousands in relief camps", "description": "The death toll from a cyclone that hit the coast of southern India has risen to 33", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/cyclone-kills-33-in-india-with-thousands-in-relief-camps/2018/11/17/c07a6d64-eacd-11e8-aff1-eec29b6f92ca_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:03:26Z", "content": "NEW DELHI A powerful cyclone in southern India has killed at least 33 people, caused massive damage to homes and roads and drove tens of thousands of people into relief camps, officials said.

(Heritage Image Partnership Ltd./Alamy Stock Photo)\n\nZhores Medvedev, a scientist and one of the most prominent political dissidents in the former Soviet Union, whose writings exposed quackery and fraud in Soviet scientific programs and led to his arrest and eventual exile from his homeland, died Nov. 15 in London. He died one day after his 93rd birthday.\n\nHis death was confirmed to Radio Free Europe by a friend, writer Semyon Reznik. Dr. Medvedev\u2019s twin brother and fellow dissident, historian Roy Medvedev, told Russian news agencies that his brother had a heart attack.\n\nDr. Medvedev worked at leading Soviet laboratories early in his career and published nearly 100 research papers before his political activism derailed his scientific career. With expertise in microbiology, biochemistry and genetics, he grew particularly alarmed at the ideas propagated since the 1930s by Trofim D. Lysenko, a scientific charlatan who captivated the imagination of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.\n\nLysenko, who denied the existence of genes, believed that plants and animals could be magically transformed or \u201ceducated\u201d by force of will and exposure to Soviet ideals. Among other things, he said wheat plants could be changed to rye and that seeds soaked in freezing water could adapt to cold climates. Orange trees, he predicted, would one day grow in Siberia.\n\nWhen these notions were put into practice, they inevitably led to disaster: rotting crops, soil depleted of nutrients and, ultimately, widespread famine. Nevertheless, Lysenko held sway over Soviet agricultural practices for years, and his influence could still be felt until Nikita Khrushchev was ousted as the country\u2019s leader in 1964.\n\nBy then, Dr. Medvedev had been at work for three years in writing a history of Lysenko and his harmful doctrines. He worked with other scientists, including physicist Andrei D. Sakharov \u2014 who later received the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 to expose Lysenko as a fraud.\n\n[Valery Chalidze, Soviet dissident who founded human rights group with Andrei Sakharov, dies at 79]\n\nDr. Medvedev\u2019s study of Lysenko was not approved for official publication in the Soviet Union, but samizdat, or clandestine, copies circulated among the intelligentsia. In 1969, the book was translated into English and published as \u201cThe Rise and Fall of T.D. Lysenko.\u201d\n\nDr. Medvedev was fired from his job at an agricultural research laboratory, and within a few months was summoned to a meeting with a psychiatrist, on the pretext of discussing the behavior of his teenage son. Instead, Dr. Medvedev was taken to a holding cell, where he managed to pick the lock and walk away.\n\nSoon afterward, on May 29, 1970, as Dr. Medvedev recounted in his book \u201cA Question of Madness,\u201d he was confronted at his home by two psychiatrists accompanied by several police officers.\n\n\u201c \u2018If you refuse to talk to us,\u2019 one of the psychiatrists told Dr. Medvedev, \u2018then we will be obliged to draw the appropriate conclusions . . .

He was driven to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe preliminary diagnosis was \u201csevere mental illness dangerous to the public,\u201d and Dr. Medvedev was repeatedly warned to stop his \u201cpublicist activities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, his brother, Sakharov and other activists for greater openness in the Soviet system sent telegrams and published open letters calling for Dr. Medvedev\u2019s release. One of his friends, the novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn, then still living in the Soviet Union, condemned Dr. Medvedev\u2019s detention with a bold and blistering statement.\n\n\u201cThe incarceration of freethinking healthy people in madhouses is spiritual murder,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a fiendish and prolonged torture . . . These crimes will never be forgotten, and all those who take part in them will be condemned endlessly, while they live and after they\u2019re dead.\n\n\u201cIt is shortsighted to think that you can live constantly relying on force alone, constantly scorning the objections of conscience.\u201d\n\nSolzhenitsyn received the Nobel Prize for Literature later that year.\n\nDr. Medvedev was released after 19 days. In the meantime, he and his brother wrote an account of the ordeal, \u201cA Question of Madness,\u201d which was smuggled out of the Soviet Union and published in the United States in 1971.\n\nOfficers promptly went to Roy Medvedev\u2019s apartment in Moscow and seized his papers. He was fired from his job at a research institute. Dr. Medvedev, in the meantime, was assigned to a laboratory to study gerontology researcher.\n\nWhen he tried to present a paper in 1972 at a scientific conference in Kiev, Ukraine \u2014 then part of the Soviet Union \u2014 plainclothes officers seized him, fearing what he might say in public, and sent him back to Moscow.\n\nIn December 1972, Dr. Medvedev received a rare visa to travel to Great Britain, where he was scheduled to spend a year working in a medical research laboratory. He moved there with his wife and one of their two sons; the other son was detained in a Soviet jail.\n\nWhile living in England, Dr. Medvedev published a book about Solzhenitsyn and his battles against Soviet authorities, which seemed to be the final straw. When he sought permission to travel to a conference in California, he went to the Soviet embassy. Instead, his passport was seized, and his citizenship was revoked.\n\nDr. Medvedev stayed in London, where he became a medical researcher and wrote widely on science and Soviet history. In a 1979 book, \u201cNuclear Disaster in the Urals,\u201d he revealed that a 1957 nuclear explosion in the Soviet Union claimed hundreds of lives. He also revealed that a 1960 rocket explosion killed dozens of members of the Soviet space program.\n\nIn 1989, government officials finally admitted that the 1957 nuclear explosion Dr. Medvedev had described years earlier actually took place.\n\n\u201cI feel better they finally have recognized that all this secrecy has made them suffer,\u201d he said, \u201cand that it\u2019s better people know about this.\u201d\n\nHe also published a history of Soviet agriculture and a biography of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader who steered the country toward closer relations with the West.\n\nZhores Aleksandrovich Medvedev and his brother were born Nov. 14, 1925, in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the former Soviet Union.\n\nTheir mother was a cellist, and their father was a professor of philosophy in Leningrad, where the brothers grew up. During the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, their father was arrested and was never seen again.\n\nThe brothers vowed to uphold his legacy of free thinking and inquiry. Roy Medvedev was among the first historians in the Soviet Union to cast a critical eye on Stalin and his regime. The brothers jointly wrote a biography of Stalin that was published in English in 2004.\n\nIn 1989, as the Communist Party was losing its grip, Dr. Medvedev was allowed to visit Moscow \u2014 and to see his brother \u2014 for the first time in 16 years. He later had his citizenship restored but continued to live in London.\n\nHe was married in 1951 to Margarita Busina, and they had two sons and several grandchildren.

Nancy Pelosi\u2019s biggest legislative achievements. Film director Rob Reiner called her \u201cthe smartest, toughest strategic thinker in our party.\u201d And tennis champ Martina Navratilova wondered aloud why Pelosi\u2019s job was at risk but her Senate counterpart\u2019s position was in no such trouble.\n\n\u201cGo figure,\u201d Navratilova tweeted. \u201cA man loses and keeps his place, a woman wins and gets booted?!?\u201d\n\nWhile congressional leadership fights have historically revolved around insular matters such as committee assignments and rules changes, the battle over who will lead the newly empowered House Democrats has exploded into a national political campaign.\n\nAt stake is not merely the House speakership, a job second in line to the presidency, but who will emerge as the country\u2019s most high-profile counterpoint to President Trump \u2014 who will set the strategy for investigating him, who will lead the opposition to his agenda, and who will be the face of the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 campaign.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest unions, arguing that Pelosi is the best equipped to take on Trump, have lobbied Democrats to back her. Top donors have placed calls to lean on undecided members. Celebrities have weighed in as well, and prominent liberal activists have openly discussed fomenting primary challenges in the next campaign against the leaders of the anti-Pelosi opposition.\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn around identity, race and gender \u2014 issues that dominated this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nSome in the pro-Pelosi camp have presented her speakership bid as the next logical step in the #MeToo movement, particularly after an election in which a record number of women ran for and won seats in Congress, and with many activists still angry over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who denied allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cThere is some residual anger being worked out in the speakership race as a result,\u201d said Shannon Coulter, who co-founded a large boycott of Trump-related businesses known as the Grab Your Wallet campaign, and has been advocating for Pelosi.\n\nA potential challenge to Pelosi from an African American lawmaker, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), threatens to further divide Democrats along racial lines as Pelosi has moved quickly to solidify her support among prominent members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nAlready the first woman to serve as speaker, Pelosi has said emphatically she will make history again and become the first lawmaker to reclaim the gavel since 1955 when the full House votes Jan. 3.\n\n\u201cI have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House,\u201d she asserted this past week as Democrats rolled up more wins to add to their majority.\n\nThe 78-year-old California congresswoman has rejected calls for a new generation of leaders after her furious campaigning, more than $130 million in fundraising and focused message of protecting the health-care law that she helped pass in 2010 delivered a Democratic majority.\n\nTrump, who during the campaign described a Democratic-led House in apocalyptic terms, said Saturday that Pelosi earned the right to be speaker and offered help in persuading Republicans to back her.\n\n\u201cIf she needs any votes, if she asks me, I will give her the votes to put her over the top,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nIt is unlikely many Republicans would vote for the one Democrat that they have portrayed as a scary liberal in thousands of campaign ads over the years \u2014 and open themselves to a primary challenge. But in a tweet Saturday, Trump referenced Rep. Tom Reed (N.Y.), a Republican who helps lead the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Reed has suggested he could vote for Pelosi as he works with moderate Democrats on ambitious rules changes.\n\nAbsolutely unnecessary, Pelosi has said, telling reporters this past week that she would \u201cnever, never, never\u201d need GOP votes. Her spokesman, Drew Hammill, said Saturday, \u201cLeader Pelosi will win the speakership with Democratic votes.\u201d\n\nAs opponents vowed to defeat her on the House floor, Pelosi pushed ahead with an intense operation to secure the votes, marshaling support from across the left that highlighted her skills and contributions to the party\u2019s midterm victories.\n\nBut even as backing Pelosi became a cause celebre for prominent Democrats, the contest seemed to deepen divisions within the party\u2019s ranks that threatened to split Democrats after their resounding win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than exasperated. I\u2019m totally furious,\u201d longtime Pelosi ally Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said of the opposition. \u201cTo have a small rump group that is determined only, so far that I can see, to deprive the majority choice of the caucus, Nancy Pelosi, to be speaker is simply outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe first test for Pelosi is Nov. 28, when Democrats choose their candidates. She is expected to win easily in the simple majority vote. After that, the math is tight. Twenty current and incoming Democrats say they will not support her for speaker, exceeding about 15 votes she can lose when the full House votes. By week\u2019s end, a few opponents seemed to be wavering after one-on-one sessions with Pelosi.\n\nHer Democratic critics say it\u2019s time to choose a new leader after 16 years with Pelosi, citing the need for fresh faces and her unpopularity in more-conservative districts that Democrats must win to keep their majority.\n\nBut the anti-Pelosi faction has drawn criticism for not yet identifying all its members, failing to produce an alternative and even suggesting many women could do the extraordinarily difficult job.\n\n\u201cThere may be a floor fight\u201d in January, said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a leader of the opposition. \u201cA lot of names are going to get tossed around.\u201d\n\nRyan raised hackles by telling reporters this past week that there are \u201cplenty of really competent females\u201d that could replace Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIf she were a man I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019d be talking about, \u2018Is a woman going to be competent to do this?\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), a Pelosi supporter. \u201cThat frosts me a bit here.\u201d\n\nPelosi has said that if Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump, she would have stepped aside, knowing a woman would be at the table for negotiations with top congressional leaders, and a Democratic president would protect the Affordable Care Act. In an echo of Clinton\u2019s experience in 2016, Pelosi has had to work to win over the younger generation of women, as many of the newly elected female lawmakers did not immediately back the trailblazer.\n\nThough support had gradually emerged for her bid, the pro-Pelosi juggernaut did not reveal itself in full force until this past week. In the course of a few days, Pelosi received support from more than two dozen groups across the left, including labor unions, women\u2019s organizations, the LGBT community and grass-roots activists.\n\nThe campaign eventually took on a life of its own among well-known names, such as Streisand, Reiner and Navratilova.\n\nSupporters have cited the need for a speaker who can immediately stand up to Trump, spell out the Democrats\u2019 agenda and score legislative wins for the party before the next campaign.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody who\u2019s really experienced, who\u2019s not going to back down, who\u2019s not going to have a learning curve,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who is likely to co-chair the House Progressive Caucus. \u201cWe have very little time. . . . It\u2019s a six-month cycle to really get something done and then everything moves to 2020.\u201d\n\nBut opponents dismissed the notion that Pelosi is the only House Democrat who has the strength and experience to take on Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty insulting to the rest of the Democratic members who have been elected by their communities,\u201d said Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.). \u201cThere are plenty of people who could hold their own at that table.\u201d\n\nSome allies of Pelosi have dismissed opponents such as Ryan and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) with the hashtag #FiveWhite\u00adGuys.\n\nRyan declined to comment on the slogan on Friday and said that Fudge remains his choice for speaker. Fudge met with Pelosi on Friday and said she will make a decision on a speaker\u2019s bid after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would be interested in blocking the first African American woman to be speaker,\u201d Ryan told reporters.\n\nBut this opposition to the leading candidate is already generating talk of primary challenges in 2020. Amy Siskind, a liberal activist and author who promotes candidates to her 326,000 Twitter followers, vowed to raise money and recruit women to oppose anti-Pelosi agitators. She said she has told candidates she supported in 2018 that they should back Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIf you want our support in 2020, if you want help from beyond your district, if you want national attention on your race, this is not the hill to die on,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s position appeared to have grown stronger by Friday night.\n\nAdvisers to Pelosi and Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who is running for majority leader, privately voiced greater concern earlier in the week to their allies in lobbying shops and special interest groups, according to two sources familiar with the leadership offices.\n\nBut by late Thursday, they felt much more confident, saying they had identified the field of potential dissidents \u2014 about 20 or so Democrats \u2014 and were drawing up a battle plan to sway each one, the people said.\n\nIf a potential \u201cno\u201d vote worked on climate policy, for example, Pelosi\u2019s advisers had environmental activists, or even former vice president Al Gore, reaching out to seek support for Pelosi, they said. The inside game also included several dozen one-on-one meetings in Pelosi\u2019s leadership office Thursday and Friday, particularly with incoming freshmen, according to advisers.\n\nWhen Pelosi convened a meeting of her whips Thursday, 43 Democrats were on hand to get marching orders about which votes needed to be flipped. The House minority leader carries a detailed whip list in her pocket and is constantly updating it, said one Democratic aide.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "'We the People Rally' in Philadelphia draws few supporters but hundreds of counterprotesters - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post 'We the People Rally' in Philadelphia draws few supporters but hundreds of counterprotesters Washington Post PHILADELPHIA \u2013 A conservative rally in the heart of Philadelphia's tourist area on Saturday drew about 30 people \u2013 and about 10 times \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/18/we-people-rally-philadelphia-draws-few-supporters-hundreds-counter-protesters/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EGTxuM0E2tEBVa4ykt-6zPsj9lM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CV2R52XKVMI6RL7R53BJW34SZI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:10:29Z", "content": "PHILADELPHIA A conservative rally in the heart of Philadelphias tourist area on Saturday drew about 30 people and about 10 times as many counterprotesters but remained largely nonviolent despite fears that the two sides would clash.

(AP Photo/Jacqueline Larma)\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 A conservative rally in the heart of Philadelphia\u2019s tourist area on Saturday drew about 30 people \u2014 and about 10 times as many counterprotesters \u2014 but remained largely nonviolent despite fears that the two sides would clash.\n\nPolice arrested four people, mainly counterprotesters for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. One person was arrested after allegedly hitting a man and leaving the area.\n\nThe protesters were separated from the \u201cWe the People Rally\u201d by a four-lane street, lines of Jersey barriers and hundreds of Philadelphia police officers, many with plastic handcuffs dangling from their uniforms.\n\nThe demonstration was advertised as a gathering for \u201cpatriots\u201d and others who were \u201cpro good cop, pro ICE, pro law and order, pro life, pro American value, pro gun and anti illegal immigration,\u201d according to a Facebook page for the event. But the turnout was small, leading some of the counterprotesters to question if the rally had been a practical joke.\n\n\u201cI kind of wonder if they were just screwing with us, that they made some event to get other people to waste their day,\u201d mused Michael Bartolone, 45, who drove from New York City to join the protesters. \u201cWas this all a ruse on their part or were they scared off?\u201d\n\nThe low turnout also disappointed rallygoers like Ted Chmielnicki, who came from North Carolina. He wondered if social media buzz hinting at violence turned some away.\n\n\u201cWe heard a lot of rhetoric coming in here that we were going to come in here and take over the city and destroy the place and be all violent and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only message we\u2019re trying to get out is unity. If we can\u2019t unite underneath the Constitution and the flag, we\u2019re already lost.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople attend the \"We the People\" rally as police keep a group of counter-protesters separated on Independence Mall on Saturday. Concerns had grown that the rally, which organizers have described as an event to celebrate the American Constitution, could attract white supremacists or members of other hate groups.\n\nThe event was promoted online by conservative group Sports Beer and Politics. The rally called for \u201call Patriots, Militia, 3%, Constitution-loving Americans\u201d to attend, though it also was expected to attract neo-Nazis and similar groups as such rallies have in the past.\n\nAs rally participants gave speeches \u2014 and protesters tried to drown them out with chants \u2014 tourists passed en route to the Liberty Bell or Independence Hall, where the U.S. Constitution was signed. Rally organizers said showing respect for that founding document was the reason behind the event.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling us Nazis. But I ask you: Which side looks more like a Nuremberg rally?\u201d asked Bill Helder, 55, of Washington\u2019s Crossing, Pa., noting the abundance of flags, chants and drums among the counterprotesters. \u201cAll I heard over here was, \u2018God bless the Constitution. Let\u2019s get along.\u2019 And the other side wants to tear our heads off.\u201d\n\nOrganizer had expected about 200 people to gather in the park next to Independence Visitors Center, a popular rally location. A small fraction actually attended. The promoter\u2019s Facebook page stressed they \u201cdo not condone the use of violence by any party at this event. This event is to allow the people to make their voices heard. Any violence, racism, or display of hate by any group or individual is extremely prohibited.\u201d\n\nStill, city officials took no chances. Before the event, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told philly.com that the gathering would have \u201ccoverage\u201d and that the city would meet violence or vandalism with arrest and detention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only seen one guy get punched so far today,\u201d said Boston resident Gregg Housh, 41, a counterprotester who has attended at least 30 similar events in the last two years. \u201cThat\u2019s because one of the alt-right guys got out of their pen and walked around to the other side, walked right into the middle and starting yelling Trump stuff at them.\u201d"}]
