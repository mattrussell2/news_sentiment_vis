(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA transoceanic personnel crisis that engulfed the National Security Council this week is partly rooted in a bureaucratic dispute over the seating arrangements aboard first lady Melania Trump\u2019s plane to Africa last month during her maiden solo trip abroad.\n\nAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath.\n\nPolicy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said of Ricardel in the statement.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable day of limbo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Wednesday evening that Ricardel was leaving the White House.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAn NSC spokesman declined to elaborate.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s decision to publicly advocate for the ouster of a senior member of her husband\u2019s staff shows a new willingness on her part to weigh in on White House operations and marks a change from earlier in the Trump administration, when she repeatedly played down her role as an adviser to the president.\n\nIt also comes as the president is mulling personnel changes, including possibly ousting Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and firing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nAnita McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, says Melania Trump\u2019s move was a dramatic show of power.\n\n\u201cIf anyone had questions about her willingness to exert her influence, they got their answer,\u201d she said.\n\nRicardel\u2019s dismissal also serves as a rebuke of Bolton, known for his sharp elbows and ability to navigate internal tensions, who refused for weeks to fire his handpicked deputy and worked in the past day to protect her.\n\nSoon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused.\n\nBolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\n\nThe White House was trying to find a soft landing place for Ricardel, but agencies including the Commerce Department, where she worked in the first year of the Trump administration, are hesitant to take her on because of her reputation, two senior administration officials said.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s statement came after months of tension in the White House over Ricardel\u2019s abrasive interactions with staffers in both the East Wing and the West Wing, according to several current and former staffers.\n\nMelania Trump and Ricardel have never met, according to people familiar with each of them. But the first lady viewed the conservative operative, who was among the most senior women in the West Wing, as a toxic influence in the White House, to the point that she spoke to Trump about Ricardel after the Africa trip and authorized others to spread the word that Ricardel had overstepped the mark, several people familiar with recent events said.\n\nA senior White House official said the first lady believed Ricardel was spreading false rumors about her office, including a misleading story that aides had arranged a $10,000 hotel stay in Egypt. Other White House aides said Ricardel belittled underlings, shouted at professional staff and was the most disliked aide in the West Wing.\n\nLast weekend, according to administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office again asked Bolton to oust Ricardel. Others, including Kelly, have wanted her gone for months, administration officials said, with little success in overcoming Bolton\u2019s objections.\n\nBolton declined again \u2014 and went to Asia.\n\nWhile the first lady\u2019s public statement came as a surprise to many, including in the White House, Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the Trumps\u2019, said the move isn\u2019t out of character for the first lady. \u201cOur first lady is very strong, and she has the right to choose who she\u2019s working with,\u201d he said.\n\nIn past administrations, first ladies exerted similar or greater influence, but always behind the scenes. The most famous modern example is Nancy Reagan\u2019s engineering the ouster of chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who had made the dire mistake of hanging up on her. While Nancy Reagan\u2019s fingerprints were all over the firing, there were no statements from her office to that effect.\n\n\u201cYou never hang up on the first lady. She can be your strongest ally. She can help you more than anybody realizes,\u201d said Kenneth Duberstein, who fared better as chief of staff to Reagan.\n\nMartha Washington, historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, once wrote that she felt like a \u201cstate prisoner\u201d because of protocol rules and a schedule set in part by her husband\u2019s chief adviser, Tobias Lear. And there was no love lost between Mary Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s chief counselors, John Hay and John Nicolay, who referred to her as \u201cthe hellcat\u201d behind her back.\n\nPat Nixon, Anthony says, chafed at top White House aides H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and John Erlichman for perceived offenses that included not giving her enough notice before travel and for not taking her ambitious agenda seriously, Anthony said.\n\n\u201cIt goes back so far that what we\u2019re really talking about is human nature and the problem of the boss\u2019s wife,\u201d he said.\n\nMelania Trump has taken on a more public role recently, launching her anti-bullying campaign earlier this year and traveling to Africa in October.\n\nShe has made symbolic gestures that suggest she feels free to make her views plain and to disagree with her husband.\n\nIn a rare sit-down interview with ABC News last month, the first lady was asked whether it was true that she had more control over her notoriously volatile husband than anyone else. \u201cOh, I wish,\u201d she said. \u201cI give him my honest advice and honest opinions. And then he does what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe first lady has privately complained about other current and former White House officials to her husband \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, chief among them \u2014 but has never before issued such a public statement.\n\nThe East Wing often does not clear its statements with the White House. Senior White House aides, including Kelly and Bolton, were not aware that the statement was coming before it was issued Tuesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders had not seen the final statement, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Kelly, who wanted Ricardel gone, told others he thought that the situation was handled poorly and that the White House looked bad.\n\nThe controversy has added to the turmoil surrounding the White House after last week\u2019s midterm elections, in which Republicans lost control of the House and maintained a slim Senate majority. Last week, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions before heading to Paris over the weekend for the commemoration of the end of World War I, a period during which he struck out at French President Emmanuel Macron via Twitter and Macron indirectly criticized Trump\u2019s embrace of \u201cnationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shows it\u2019s still a broken and dysfunctional White House. Maybe John Kelly has made a few trains run on time, but it\u2019s clearly still broken,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a 2017 book, \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d about White House chiefs of staff and West Wing operations.\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Thomas Floyd", "title": "As a new parent, comedian Natasha Leggero has hit the mother lode of jokes", "description": "The \"Another Period\" star once thought having a baby was an avoidable mistake.

Prior to motherhood, Leggero tackled subjects such as classism and gender politics through a comic persona of faux refinement; she made a name for herself as the co-creator and star of the Comedy Central sitcom \u201cAnother Period,\u201d a panelist on the network\u2019s popular \u201cRoast\u201d series, and a regular on the late-night TV circuit.

How is parenthood treating you?\n\nEveryone says how fast it goes, but it does seem like it\u2019s going very slowly. Definitely it\u2019s fun, and we\u2019re glad we did it, but what I didn\u2019t anticipate was how now 70 percent of my mental energy goes toward worrying about her, which is pretty taxing.\n\nYou joked extensively about your then-impending motherhood in \u201cThe Honeymoon Stand Up Special,\u201d which you filmed with your husband and released in April on Netflix. How have your expectations lined up with reality?\n\nNothing really can prepare you. One thing I wasn\u2019t quite clear on is that as a woman, it really does take a lot to have the baby. I had to pump myself full of fertility drugs, then I had to carry the baby, then I had to give birth to the baby, then I had to have the baby suck on my t--s for six months, and now I\u2019ve got this body from having a baby that I\u2019ve got to get rid of. It takes a man a whole three days to recover.\n\nYour stand-up often tackles sensitive subjects. In that Netflix special, for example, you spoke to audience members about their experiences dealing with sexual misconduct. How do you go about approaching that kind of material?\n\nI think that you just have to be sensitive, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky right now because I\u2019m a woman and a lot of the stuff I want to talk about is anti-men. That is actually accepted right now, so that\u2019s kind of cool. That is encouraged, almost. But a man who wants to be anti-woman, I think he\u2019s going to have a hard time out there.\n\nHaving been a stand-up for a decade-plus, how do you feel your comedic voice has evolved over the years?\n\nFor a long time, my main point of view was that I hated children and I would never have one. Then I decided when I met Moshe that I would have one baby with him \u2014 I made him promise we would only have one \u2014 and then you have that, and that changes you, and you just have to evolve and grow.\n\nHow does that growth come through in your comedy?\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll be doing stand-up and I\u2019ll have seven minutes of jokes about being a new mom, and I realize the crowd is too young and no one has a kid. So I\u2019m just sort of feeling it out. Please, if you have kids, come see me.

In a fundraising email, his campaign highlighted Trump\u2019s move last week to strip Acosta\u2019s White House pass and declared that the president \u201cwill NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest assault on the press corps comes amid his mounting domestic political problems as Democrats prepare to take over the House in January. Yet in his bid to assert greater control over the media at home, Trump threatens to undermine his administration\u2019s efforts to curtail human rights abuses abroad.\n\nIn Singapore on Wednesday, Vice President Pence told Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to release two Reuters journalists jailed for covering brutal ethnic violence against the minority Rohingya Muslims. At the State Department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert called on Chinese leaders to respect \u201cfundamental freedoms\u201d amid a crackdown on political activism in Hong Kong.\n\nForeign-policy analysts say Trump\u2019s persistent attacks on news outlets, combined with his embrace of authoritarian leaders such as Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, have emboldened repressive governments to ignore U.S. pressure.\n\n\u201cObviously, we want to see more efforts by the U.S. to stand up for our values, but it\u2019s hard to see the impact on a significant scale when we\u2019re seen as hypocritical or when what we say is not supported by the actions of our president,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, who served as a foreign policy aide in the Obama White House.\n\nIn 2013, Prescott accompanied Vice President Biden on a trip to Beijing during a period when China was denying visas to U.S. journalists over critical coverage of party leaders\u2019 personal finances. Biden met with a group of reporters and raised their cases directly with President Xi Jinping.\n\nPrescott pointed to surveys showing sharp drops in global confidence in U.S. leadership under Trump and said the president has unwisely discarded a tool of American influence.\n\n\u201cThe disconnect between the rhetoric coming out of the White House and what other officials are saying around the world does make the statements land with less force,\u201d Prescott said.\n\nPence is attending three Asia summits this week that Trump elected to skip, leaving a vacuum for Xi to promote China\u2019s trade and security agenda. Beijing has made clear that it has no intention of lecturing other countries on human rights, and the Chinese government has undertaken a massive roundup of Uighur Muslims, with an estimated 1 million detained at \u201creeducation camps.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s blunt words to Suu Kyi represent the strongest statement from the Trump administration against the atrocities that have driven more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from their homeland.\n\nBut Trump has not spoken publicly about Myanmar since taking office. And experts said Pence\u2019s efforts to draw a line \u2014 and win the release of the two Reuters reporters sentenced to seven years in prison \u2014 will be diluted by Trump\u2019s targeting of U.S. journalists, who he routinely calls the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hypocritical,\u201d said Erin Murphy, a consultant on Myanmar who accompanied Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on a trip to the country in 2012. \u201cWhat happened to the Reuters journalists is terrible. Jim Acosta is not in jail \u2014 is that where the difference is?\u201d\n\nSuu Kyi and other top Myanmar officials have referred to stories about the violence, which the U.N. last year labeled \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d as \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIf I were the Myanmar government or Aung San Suu Kyi,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cI would throw it back in Pence\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials have countered criticism that Trump does not promote human rights by pointing to cases of individuals who have been freed under his watch, including three Americans detained in North Korea.\n\nBut the president\u2019s reaction to the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month led to widespread recriminations. Trump initially cast doubt on evidence that The Washington Post columnist had been killed in a Saudi government-led assassination plot, becoming more critical only in the face of political blowback.\n\nTrump has been more animated when he\u2019s battling White House reporters. On Wednesday, he focused his animus on a lawsuit from CNN claiming that the White House\u2019s treatment of Acosta was a violation of his constitutional rights. Several other media organizations, including The Post, agreed to support the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIs it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won\u2019t sit down?\u201d Trump said in an interview with the Daily Caller. \u201cHe\u2019s just an average guy . . . who\u2019s got the guts to stand up and shout.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, thousands stood up and shouted during protests in July against the Communist Party\u2019s growing influence over the island, 21 years after the British relinquished control.

A British zoo reportedly offered to give Yupik a home in a more suitable climate.\n\nThe activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said that \u201cYupik languished alone for more than 25 years in a barren enclosure at a rundown roadside zoo.\u201d\n\nThe bear, which was referred to as \u201cYupi\u201d by some organizations, had a water pool, but temperatures were too high and she had little stimulation in the concrete structure. While the zoo had improved conditions somewhat in recent years, activists say it had been done only under pressure.\n\nThe Canadian-based group Zoocheck said the Morelia zoo had reneged on a deal to transfer the bear, apparently citing heart problems. Zoocheck said its team hadn\u2019t found any signs of heart disease when it examined the bear in 2017, and called for further investigation.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Worse, many in his party go right along with his baseless charges of fraud.\n\nWe are in for a difficult two years. Surviving them will require that Republican senators take seriously the pledge they made in their oath of office to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d What we have seen so far is not encouraging.\n\nFlorida brings out the worst in Republicans. They find it hard to break bad habits developed during the 2000 presidential election, during which they were willing to use any means necessary (including a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision rooted far more in partisanship than law) to prevent Democrat Al Gore from getting a recount. The contest was ultimately settled by 537 votes.\n\nWith a margin that close, a recount would have been routine in a race for agriculture commissioner. But not for the country\u2019s most important office. The GOP stopped the recounts, and George W. Bush became president.\n\nTo its credit, Florida now requires automatic recounts when races are decided by narrow margins. And this year, Republicans shouldn\u2019t have much to worry about. In the U.S. Senate contest, as of Wednesday morning, Republican Gov. Rick Scott enjoyed a 12,562-vote lead over Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. In the governor\u2019s race, Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democrat Andrew Gillum by 33,684 votes. Unless something is badly amiss \u2014 in which case a recount is imperative \u2014 such margins would typically survive close scrutiny.\n\nBut Trump would have none of it. \u201cThe Florida election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible \u2014 ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nWell. For starters, as The Post\u2019s Fact Checker noted, overseas and military ballots postmarked by Election Day are accepted as long as 10 days after the voting. So Trump, the day after Veterans Day, was suggesting that many of the ballots sent in by our service members not be counted at all. The Post also found no evidence for Trump\u2019s \u201cmissing or forged\u201d charge. And what, pray, is an \u201cinfected\u201d ballot?\n\nThen there was Trump\u2019s tweet last Friday suggesting that \u201ca new Election\u201d might be required in Arizona as Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema passed Republican Rep. Martha McSally in the vote count of their U.S. Senate race. With her golden retriever Boomer at her side, McSally ignored Trump and graciously conceded to Sinema in a video on Monday. McSally is clearly thinking beyond the Trumpian present.\n\nAll this is about more than Trump\u2019s obvious meltdown since an election that was bad for him and his party \u2014 and gets worse as more votes are tallied. It is about whether Republicans are willing to contain and, when necessary, oppose a man who repeatedly demonstrates hostility to the rules, norms and constraints of constitutional democracy.\n\nIt was, thus, good news this week when 14 conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a new organization called Checks and Balances. Its ranks include George T. Conway III , who happens to be the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, and former homeland security secretary and Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge.\n\nTheir organizing statement declared the group\u2019s dedication to \u201cthe rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights, and the necessity of civil discourse.\u201d\n\nTellingly, they insisted that their commitment to these principles applied \u201cregardless of the party or persons in power\u201d and reflected their faith in \u201cfree speech, a free press, separation of powers and limited government.\u201d\n\nUp to now, conservatives opposed to Trump have had little impact on their party. Too many, especially among elected officials, have pulled their punches in the crunch and fallen silent under pressure.\n\nThe test will be whether four or five GOP senators prove willing to break with Trump\u2019s apologists in their party\u2019s leadership when it matters \u2014 and when it\u2019s hard. Defending the Florida recount as legitimate and necessary would be a good start. So would supporting a bill protecting special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation and insisting that his findings be made public. Lovely words about the truth and the rule of law are powerless against a president who respects neither.\n\nRead more from E.J.

The trial that recently ended in Boston \u2014 the judge\u2019s ruling might be months away and reach the Supreme Court \u2014 concerns whether Harvard\u2019s admissions policy regarding Asian Americans is unjust and whether the government should respond.\n\nPractically, the case pertains only to the few highly selective institutions that admit small portions of their applicants. But everyone, and especially conservatives, should think twice \u2014 or at least once \u2014 before hoping that government will minutely supervise how private institutions shape their student bodies.\n\nThe clearest thing about the relevant law is the absence of clear guidance. Since 1978, the Supreme Court has said that \u201ca diverse student body\u201d is a \u201cconstitutionally permissible goal\u201d and a \u201ccompelling\u201d educational interest that can be pursued using racial classifications if they are \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to achieve a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of this or that minority without \u201cquotas\u201d and if they do \u201cnot unduly harm members of any racial group\u201d and are no more than a \u201c \u2018plus\u2019 factor\u201d in a \u201cholistic\u201d assessment of applicants. \u201cDistinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious\u201d and \u201c outright racial balancing . . . is patently unconstitutional.\u201d (Emphases added.) Such open-textured language, deployed in the pursuit of \u201cdiversity\u201d (of cultures, perspectives, experiences, etc.), leaves vast scope for practices to engineer various student bodies.\n\nSchools should go beyond \u201cobjective\u201d metrics \u2014 secondary school transcripts and SAT scores \u2014 because they measure only what can be quantified, which is not all that matters about individuals. Then, however, schools adopt \u201cholistic\u201d assessments of individual applicants. It probably is impossible for schools or government to devise rules-based assessments that tightly limit the discretion that admissions offices exercise, given the unavoidable imprecision of the open-textured legal language quoted above, and given the needs of schools\u2019 subgroups \u2014 the orchestra, the athletic teams, the classics department, etc.\n\nHarvard\u2019s practices, say the plaintiffs, who include some aggrieved Asian Americans, constitute racial discrimination that has the intended effect of suppressing admissions of people such as them: Asian American applicants are rejected in spite of objective academic attainments that would result in admissions for African Americans, Hispanics or whites. So, when Harvard\u2019s president is \u201cunequivocal\u201d that his institution \u201cdoes not discriminate against anybody\u201d in admissions, this looks like hypocrisy, understood as the tribute that vice pays to virtue.\n\nExcept that progressives and their institutions long since stopped believing that colorblind policies are virtuous. And regarding admissions, they might have a point.\n\nStuart Taylor Jr., a legal analyst as temperate as he is accomplished, argues (in the Weekly Standard) that racial preferences can ratify stereotypes when \u201cholistic\u201d evaluations emphasize personality traits that are supposed group attributes. There really are, however, attributes that are disproportionately prevalent among various groups at various times. Families are the primary transmitters of social capital \u2014 the habits and mores conducive to flourishing \u2014 and family cultures that produce applicants with stellar objective academic attainments should be encouraged. However, relying exclusively on objective academic metrics (Taylor notes that only Caltech does this; its student body is more than 40 percent Asian) would substantially reduce the number of blacks and Hispanics admitted. Harvard\u2019s own conclusion, in a document presented in the trial, is that admissions based solely on academic metrics would result in a student body that is 43 percent Asian American and less than 1 percent African American.\n\nEight decades ago, Harvard put itself and the nation on the path toward one understanding of meritocracy by emphasizing in admissions the Scholastic Aptitude Test. This was done partly to reduce discrimination against Jewish applicants from family cultures that stressed academic attainments, and partly to dilute favoritism toward the inherited privileges of wealthy families funneling boys through prestigious prep schools.\n\nHarvard\u2019s problem today is a version of America\u2019s, the tension between two problematic approaches to providing opportunities \u2014 \u201cmeritocracy\u201d that is clearly but too simply quantified, and a less tidy but more nuanced measurement of the mixture of merits that serves a university\u2019s, and society\u2019s, several purposes. The optimum result of the court case might already be occurring in voluntary, prudential adjustments of elite university practices to forestall government interventions that would serve shifting agendas of various constituencies. The adjustments would include admissions policies more welcoming to academic excellence regardless of other attributes of those who manifest it, and more sensitivity regarding the felt injustices that inevitably accompany admission disparities produced by preferences, however benignly intended.\n\nRead more from George F.

Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Wednesday that he texted Bell before the reporting deadline and that the tailback didn\u2019t respond.\n\n[What Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s decision to sit out the season means for him and for the Steelers]\n\n\u201cI texted him, saying I hoped he was going to show up and if he decided not to, I wished him nothing but the best,\u201d Roethlisberger said via ESPN. \u201cHe was a great teammate and football player.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo each their own on what they want to walk away from,\u201d Roethlisberger added.\n\nCoach Mike Tomlin told ESPN earlier this month the team needed \u201cvolunteers not hostages\u201d while praising replacement running back James Conner.\n\nThe second-year pro is averaging 85.7 rushing yards and a touchdown per game. Those numbers put Conner on track to exceed Bell\u2019s output from last season. Now he\u2019ll get the rest of the season to prove himself a worthy starter. And maybe he can add some gear from Bell\u2019s locker.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAs California copes with devastating wildfires, high school teams try to play on\n\nMedal of Freedom honoree Alan Page will put aside his feelings about Trump\n\nNFL moves Rams-Chiefs Mexico City game to L.A., citing poor field conditions"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/matt.schudel", "title": "Katherine MacGregor, the scheming Mrs. Oleson of 'Little House,' dies at 93 - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Katherine MacGregor, the scheming Mrs. Oleson of 'Little House,' dies at 93 Washington Post Katherine MacGregor, an actress who brought a touch of vinegar and villainy to the period drama \u201cThe Little House on the Prairie\u201d and whose snobbish ch\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/katherine-macgregor-the-scheming-mrs-oleson-of-little-house-dies-at-93/2018/11/14/7b2a6146-e826-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lsdg221PRpa72MShyb-gZBe6BCk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PX5I5IHIGAI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:31:33Z", "content": "Katherine MacGregor, an actress who brought a touch of vinegar and villainy to the period drama Little House on the Prairie and whose snobbish character, Harriet Oleson, was often the comic foil of the long-running TV series, died Nov. 13 at the Motion Pictur\u2026 [+4682 chars]", "fulltext": "Katherine MacGregor as Harriet Oleson in \u201cLittle House on the Prairie.\u201d (NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nKatherine MacGregor, an actress who brought a touch of vinegar and villainy to the period drama \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d and whose snobbish character, Harriet Oleson, was often the comic foil of the long-running TV series, died Nov. 13 at the Motion Picture and Television Fund\u2019s retirement home in Woodland Hills, Calif.

She held her nose in the air with a firm belief in her own superiority and had an equally spoiled daughter, Nellie, played by Alison Arngrim.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe campaigns of Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams on Wednesday accused each other of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election as the Georgia governor\u2019s race remained unsettled, with both sides awaiting court decisions on thousands of uncounted ballots.\n\nKemp, a Republican whose lead has shrunk a bit each day since the Nov. 6 election, continued to demand that Democratic candidate Abrams concede, arguing that there are not enough outstanding votes for her to force a runoff.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams and her radical backers will stop at nothing to undermine democracy and attempt to steal this election to be Georgia's next governor,\u201d Kemp spokesman Cody Hall said in a news release.\n\nLauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, accused Kemp, the former secretary of state, of using that office \u201cas a taxpayer-funded arm of his campaign. \u2026 That is such an egregious breach of public trust and an egregious breach of power and straight-up corruption.\u201d\n\nAbrams, the former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, has declined to concede. On Wednesday, the campaign said Abrams needed more than 17,700 additional votes to force a runoff or more than 15,400 to force a recount. The secretary of state could certify the results Friday.\n\nLate Wednesday, the Abrams campaign won a partial victory in federal court, when U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones ruled that the state\u2019s 159 counties must accept absentee ballots with minor discrepancies. It was immediately unclear how many votes would be affected by the ruling.\n\nJones denied a request in the lawsuit filed Monday by the campaign and the Democratic Party of Georgia that would have required counties to accept provisional ballots cast by voters in counties where they did not live. The Abrams campaign argued that thousands of voters who showed up at the polls on election day were forced to use provisional ballots because elections officials had not updated their voter files.\n\nHall, in his statement, accused Abrams of pursuing \u201cdangerous lawsuits that attempt to rewrite election law, count illegal votes and create new ones.\u201d\n\nGroh-Wargo joined several lawmakers at the state Capitol on Wednesday for a news conference, during which speakers called on the new secretary of state, Robyn A. Crittenden, to make sure that every vote is counted. She said if Kemp was \u201csecure \u2026 in his determination that he is the winner,\u201d then he would not object to efforts to make sure that votes cast are counted.\n\n[Georgia senator protesting over voter counts said she was arrested because she\u2019s black]\n\nAbrams, who called Kemp the \u201carchitect of voter suppression,\u201d blasted him for refusing to resign as the state\u2019s top elections official while he ran for governor. Kemp was harshly criticized by voting rights advocates for restrictive laws and policies that rejected tens of thousands of voter registrations and purged more than a million from the voting rolls. Several of those laws and policies were stopped by the courts because they were found to be in violation of the federal Voting Rights Acts.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win in Georgia, they stole it,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said during the National Action Network\u2019s legislative and policy conference Wednesday in Washington.\n\nKemp\u2019s lead has gone from about 75,000 votes on Election Day to just under 55,000, out of more than 3.9 million ballots cast. He currently has 50.23 percent of the vote to 48.83 percent for Abrams. Libertarian candidate Ted Metz has 0.95 percent of the vote.\n\nKemp declared victory last Thursday and has since issued frequent vote tallies, culled from the secretary of state\u2019s website, to show that he remains ahead. In one such calculation, he said that even if Abrams were to get all of the outstanding provisional votes, he would still end up with the required 50.1 percent to win.\n\nThe Abrams campaign has disputed the office\u2019s report that 21,190 provisional ballots were issued. Groh-Wargo has said that more than 26,000 ballots were issued, based on information the campaign has collected from individual counties.\n\nNearly 1.5 million more voters cast ballots in last week\u2019s gubernatorial race than in 2014. Voters in large precincts in the Atlanta suburbs faced hours-long waits caused by too few or malfunctioning voting machines. Voters also reported their names not being on voting rolls and poll workers giving inaccurate information about whether they could use provisional ballots.\n\nTuesday was the official deadline for Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to certify their results, and the secretary of state\u2019s office had planned to certify the results on Wednesday.\n\nBut on Monday, a federal judge barred the secretary of state from certifying until Friday, siding with advocates who said voters were not given enough time and information on how to address problems with their provisional ballots. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Gwinnett County to review rejected absentee ballots on which the voters' birth years were missing or incorrect.\n\nGwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta, is of particular interest in the race for the 7th Congressional District, where Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux trailed Republican Rob Woodall by 533 votes as of Wednesday afternoon."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Seung Min Kim", "title": "Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill", "description": "The new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u2018three-strike\u2019 penalty from life behind bars to 25 years.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-endorses-bipartisan-criminal-justice-reform-bill/2018/11/14/9be8f926-e84c-11e8-bd89-eecf3b178206_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/61kG7lbo7FYLxf_ncmspP04ADvw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKKGDJXIJII6ROG4M3GKICOBQA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:07:28Z", "content": "President Trump on Wednesday threw his support behind legislation that would loosen some mandatory minimum sentencing laws a measure backed by powerful Senate Republicans and Democrats but that could run into opposition from some tough-on-crime conservatives.\u2026 [+3203 chars]", "fulltext": "President Trump threw his support Wednesday behind legislation that would loosen some mandatory minimum sentencing laws \u2014 a measure backed by powerful Senate Republicans and Democrats, but which could run into opposition from some tough-on-crime conservatives.\n\nAt an afternoon event at the White House, Trump officially endorsed the First Step Act, which he said included \u201creasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets.\u201d He urged lawmakers to send him a bill, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with a pen.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows that true bipartisanship is possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a big breakthrough for a lot of people. . . . They\u2019ve been talking about this for many, many years.\u201d\n\nThe compromise criminal justice measure, which was hammered out in principle over the summer by a bipartisan group of senators, adds four provisions to a House-passed bill that focused on reducing prisoner recidivism.\n\nThe new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree strikes\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nIn addition, the agreement lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more cases.\n\nTrump was privately briefed on the legislation\u2019s contents at a meeting Tuesday. There, he signaled that he favors the bill, but did not explicitly commit one way or the other and indicated that he would like more law enforcement groups to endorse the measure.\n\n[First Step Act\u2019: Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill]\n\nThe influential Fraternal Order of Police, the world\u2019s largest group of sworn law enforcement officials, gave the bill significant momentum by endorsing the latest compromise.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform has been on the agenda for the last two administrations, but it seems like President Trump is going to be able to get it done,\u201d said Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the FOP, who was standing beside Trump when he announced his support of the bill.\n\nAlso standing with Trump was Paul M. Cell, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who have worked jointly on the bill for years, said Wednesday that \u201cby ensuring that punishments fit the crimes, we can better balance the scales of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the White House\u2019s ongoing engagement to make these long-overdue reforms a reality,\u201d Grassley and Durbin said in a statement. \u201cWith the President\u2019s support and [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell\u2019s pledge to hold a vote on the broadly popular package, we can quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nYet McConnell (R-Ky.) has so far taken a hands-off approach to the bill, whose earlier versions had driven deep rifts through the GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe need an actual proposal, then we would take a whip count, see where we stand and then weigh it at that point against the other things that absolutely have to be accomplished\u201d such as the farm bill and spending bills for government agencies, McConnell said Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a whole lot of time left.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate in favor of the compromise, although advocates are optimistic that with Trump\u2019s endorsement giving cover to Republicans, they can reach that threshold. People working to pass the bill believe that Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) are out of reach, but that every other Senate Republican either supports the bill or could be persuaded in favor of it.\n\nAnother obstacle for the bill\u2019s supporters was removed when former attorney general Jeff Sessions, an avowed opponent of any measure that would relax sentencing laws, resigned at Trump\u2019s request from his post last week. Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has worked closely on the criminal justice issue for months.\n\nStill, \u201cI think it\u2019s more coincidental\u201d that the new push is coming after Sessions left the administration, a White House official said Wednesday. \u201cThere was no correlation between those two.\u201d\n\n[Jared Kushner ramps up push for criminal justice reform]\n\nSenators have also added language that would bar prisoners who had been convicted of certain fentanyl offenses \u2014 primarily those that involved five- and 10-year mandatory minimums \u2014 from being able to receive credit for time served.\n\nCanterbury said a sticking point for the FOP was language in the original bill that would have allowed dealers of illicit fentanyl to receive reduced sentences.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be well-defined that violent felons wouldn\u2019t get reduced sentences,\u201d said Canterbury, who said his organization endorsed the legislation when that change and others were made.\n\nMany sentencing-reform advocates applauded Trump\u2019s endorsement. They include Families Against Mandatory Minimums, one of the leading organizations that have pushed for criminal justice changes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s endorsement of federal criminal justice reform legislation by President Trump is a modern-day \u2018Nixon goes to China\u2019 moment,\u201d said Kevin Ring, the group\u2019s president.\n\nDurbin, the chief Democratic negotiator on the bill, will work on rounding up votes on his side, but could struggle with the more liberal members of his caucus who dislike the concessions made to Republicans.\n\nIndeed, the Sentencing Project, another advocacy group, expressed reservations about the legislation for not going far enough, but said Trump\u2019s endorsement of the bill is \u201cprogress.\u201d\n\nEven if the bill gets through the Senate, it has to pass the House again because it revises a bill the House cleared earlier this year.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has been forthright about what he believes are the root causes of mass shootings. A few months ago, he blamed gun violence on children\u2019s access to smartphones, video games and psychotropic drugs.\n\nMost recently, he blamed society\u2019s obsession with a specific genre of violent entertainment.\n\n\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s the most important topic that seems to be in every cable television network for example? Television shows are all about what? Zombies,\u201d he said in an interview Tuesday with conservative Kentucky radio host Leland Conway.\n\nMass shootings point to deep cultural problems, Bevin said, particularly in a society that consumes daily doses of violence through the media. He acknowledged tying zombie shows to gun violence might be perceived as \u201ctrite and simplistic.\u201d But, he argued, American culture is \u201cinundated by the worst things that celebrate death,\u201d including the forms of entertainment young people consume.\n\n\u201cThese are drips, drips, drips on the stones of the psyches of young generations that are growing up in a society that increasingly said this is normal and okay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd eventually, some of those young minds are not going to be able to handle it.\u201d\n\n[\u2018It can\u2019t be any worse\u2019: Thousand Oaks grieves after massacre as questions remain about gunman]\n\nBevin talked about what he believes causes mass shootings during a portion of the interview about the future of gun rights with Democrats controlling the House. Democrats, some of whom ran on a promise to push for gun control, are taking over the House on the heels of another mass shooting in which 12 people were killed inside a California bar. Some who escaped the rampage are survivors of an earlier mass shooting that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas last year.\n\nLast month, a gunman stormed inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 congregants \u2014 the deadliest attack on Jews in the history of the country.\n\nBevin did not mention these recent shootings during the interview, though he said there have been incidents in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had things that are fueled by both people that are insane, people that are hateful and people that are just bent on wreaking havoc and perpetuating evil,\u201d he said.\n\n[The lives lost in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]\n\nLast June, Bevin participated in a roundtable discussion about gun violence, the root cause of which, he said, are the ways society poisons the minds of children.\n\nHe said violent television shows and video games have desensitized young people, and their access to cellphones have made them prone to self-harm and depression.

Unwelcome in many restaurants, hotels and other public establishments, they even faced death in \u201csundown\u201d towns, where they were warned to get out before evening, or else. In response, a postal employee named Victor Hugo Green created a guide designed to \u201cgive the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trips more enjoyable.\u201d The Green Book was published for more than 30 years, finally ceasing publication in the late 1960s.\n\nThe pain, peril and murderous racism that made the Green Book a necessity of black life seems like unlikely fodder for a crowd-pleaser that plays like gangbusters. But \u201cGreen Book,\u201d a spirited amalgam of buddy comedy, road movie, fish-out-of-water fable and accessible social history, is just that cinematic unicorn. As an inspiring and thoroughly entertaining chapter drawn from all-too-real life, it mixes authenticity and Hollywood schmaltz with ease that feels both relaxed and judiciously calibrated. Most winningly, \u201cGreen Book\u201d puts two of the finest screen actors working today in a sexy turquoise Cadillac, letting them loose on a funny, swiftly-moving chamber piece bursting with heart, art and soul.\n\nThe actors in question are Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who prove to be a superbly balanced team. Mortensen plays Tony \u201cLip\u201d Vallelonga, a Bronx bouncer who in 1962 is making his living at a New York nightclub and trying to avoid working as muscle for the local mob. When he loses his job, he makes ends meet by putting his prodigious appetite to use in a hot dog-eating contest, which even he, being slightly dimwitted, realizes isn\u2019t a sustainable model. Eventually, he answers a call from a Manhattan musician looking for a driver and shows up at his would-be employer\u2019s Carnegie Hall address ready to take anything that pays.\n\nWhat he finds is a man named Don Shirley (Ali), a supremely elegant pianist and composer who greets Tony draped in regal robes, then conducts the interview from what looks like an ancient Egyptian throne. Shirley, a favorite of Park Avenue and other well-heeled precincts, has booked some dates throughout the South in a tour that will end around Christmas. Although his distinctive brand of bespoke, classically infused jazz is popular with white audiences, he\u2019s not taking any chances: He hires Tony to act both as chauffeur and protector should any difficulties, embarrassments or less-than-enjoyable circumstances arise.\n\nThe ensuing journey unfolds much as the audience might expect: The slovenly, tough-talkin\u2019 Tony and the quiet, impeccably mannered \u201cDr. Shirley\u201d almost immediately begin to bicker about everything from the music Tony listens to in the car to the cigarettes he smokes between his incessant chatter. But \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which was co-written by Vallelonga\u2019s son Nick, turns out to be much more than \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d meets \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d Surely Nick\u2019s own intimate knowledge of the real-life lead players helps lend \u201cGreen Book\u201d its sense of groundedness, not to mention the distinctive characters of two larger-than-life men. What\u2019s more, it makes sure to give the audience permission to laugh, even as the stakes of Shirley\u2019s trip become dangerously high.\n\nAs might be expected, Tony and Dr. Shirley meet their fair share of physical danger in \u201cGreen Book,\u201d but it\u2019s the psychic blows that wound the most: Although at first the uncouth Tony may not understand Dr. Shirley\u2019s genius at the piano \u2014 as well as his sophisticated sense of etiquette and comportment \u2014 even he can recognize the hypocrisy of applauding someone\u2019s talent one minute, then relegating him to an outdoor lavatory the next. But it\u2019s not as if Dr. Shirley is any more at home among the mostly black servers, bartenders and domestic staff that he encounters in a world where a man like him \u2014 black, brilliantly educated and, one scene suggests, gay \u2014 can find little if any purchase.\n\nIt will surprise no one to learn that both Tony and Dr. Shirley undergo powerful transformations in \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which begins with a scene of Tony throwing out two water glasses used by black workmen hired by his wife, Dolores (Linda Cardellini), and which also includes a scene of Tony encouraging his ever-so-proper employer to eat a piece of fried chicken with his hands. If that image sounds horribly cringeworthy, it\u2019s a tribute to director Peter Farrelly and to Mortensen and Ali that what could be a fatally misbegotten exercise winds up being unexpectedly warm and amusing.\n\nFarrelly, best known for directing such comedies as \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary\u201d with his brother Bobby, has never been known as subtle, or for caring much about what his movies looked like. But \u201cGreen Book\u201d is an exceptionally pleasant experience, both visually and aurally, photographed in rich period hues by Sean Porter and drenched in gorgeous music by both Shirley and composer Kris Bowers. It was Bowers, reportedly, who coached Ali in the finger movements that look so convincing in the film, especially during a fabulously boisterous interlude set at a hopping juke joint.\n\nBut all the technical prowess in the world wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome iffy casting in a film that lives or dies by its two central performances. In that regard, Mortensen and Ali take ownership of \u201cGreen Book\u201d early on and make it entirely theirs. Mortensen has always been an appealing, versatile actor, but here he discovers untold layers of humor (and belly fat) to lean in to Tony\u2019s alternately grating and hilarious naivete. Playing off Mortensen\u2019s expansive lack of self-consciousness, Ali is all controlled interior, communicating as much in a glance or a raised finger as with a pages-long monologue.\n\nThe cumulative result of so many things going for it is that \u201cGreen Book\u201d fires on all cylinders, creating the kind of satisfying mainstream moviegoing experience that many observers thought Hollywood had forgotten how to make. There was a time when \u201cGreen Book\u201d might have been the tale of a racist-with-a-heart-of-gold being redeemed by a too-good-to-be-true African American shaman or self-sacrificing paragon. No one is redeemed here, just given space to develop mutual respect and affection. The great success of \u201cGreen Book\u201d lies in its modesty, and the straightforward way it recognizes seismic change in the incremental turning of a human heart."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ian Livingston", "title": "PM Update: Quiet through this evening, with wintry mix arriving for the morning commute", "description": "It won't get ugly until near sunrise.

They\u2019ve been talking about this for many, many years.\u201d\n\nThe compromise criminal justice measure, which was hammered out in principle over the summer by a bipartisan group of senators, adds four provisions to a House-passed bill that focused on reducing prisoner recidivism.\n\nThe new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree strikes\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nIn addition, the agreement lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more cases.\n\nTrump was privately briefed on the legislation\u2019s contents at a meeting Tuesday. There, he signaled that he favors the bill, but did not explicitly commit one way or the other and indicated that he would like more law enforcement groups to endorse the measure.\n\n[First Step Act\u2019: Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill]\n\nThe influential Fraternal Order of Police, the world\u2019s largest group of sworn law enforcement officials, gave the bill significant momentum by endorsing the latest compromise.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform has been on the agenda for the last two administrations, but it seems like President Trump is going to be able to get it done,\u201d said Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the FOP, who was standing beside Trump when he announced his support of the bill.\n\nAlso standing with Trump was Paul M. Cell, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who have worked jointly on the bill for years, said Wednesday that \u201cby ensuring that punishments fit the crimes, we can better balance the scales of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the White House\u2019s ongoing engagement to make these long-overdue reforms a reality,\u201d Grassley and Durbin said in a statement. \u201cWith the President\u2019s support and [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell\u2019s pledge to hold a vote on the broadly popular package, we can quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nYet McConnell (R-Ky.) has so far taken a hands-off approach to the bill, whose earlier versions had driven deep rifts through the GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe need an actual proposal, then we would take a whip count, see where we stand and then weigh it at that point against the other things that absolutely have to be accomplished\u201d such as the farm bill and spending bills for government agencies, McConnell said Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a whole lot of time left.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate in favor of the compromise, although advocates are optimistic that with Trump\u2019s endorsement giving cover to Republicans, they can reach that threshold. People working to pass the bill believe that Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) are out of reach, but that every other Senate Republican either supports the bill or could be persuaded in favor of it.\n\nAnother obstacle for the bill\u2019s supporters was removed when former attorney general Jeff Sessions, an avowed opponent of any measure that would relax sentencing laws, resigned at Trump\u2019s request from his post last week. Senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has worked closely on the criminal justice issue for months.\n\nStill, \u201cI think it\u2019s more coincidental\u201d that the new push is coming after Sessions left the administration, a White House official said Wednesday. \u201cThere was no correlation between those two.\u201d\n\n[Jared Kushner ramps up push for criminal justice reform]\n\nSenators have also added language that would bar prisoners who had been convicted of certain fentanyl offenses \u2014 primarily those that involved five- and 10-year mandatory minimums \u2014 from being able to receive credit for time served.\n\nCanterbury said a sticking point for the FOP was language in the original bill that would have allowed dealers of illicit fentanyl to receive reduced sentences.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be well-defined that violent felons wouldn\u2019t get reduced sentences,\u201d said Canterbury, who said his organization endorsed the legislation when that change and others were made.\n\nMany sentencing-reform advocates applauded Trump\u2019s endorsement. They include Families Against Mandatory Minimums, one of the leading organizations that have pushed for criminal justice changes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s endorsement of federal criminal justice reform legislation by President Trump is a modern-day \u2018Nixon goes to China\u2019 moment,\u201d said Kevin Ring, the group\u2019s president.\n\nDurbin, the chief Democratic negotiator on the bill, will work on rounding up votes on his side, but could struggle with the more liberal members of his caucus who dislike the concessions made to Republicans.\n\nIndeed, the Sentencing Project, another advocacy group, expressed reservations about the legislation for not going far enough, but said Trump\u2019s endorsement of the bill is \u201cprogress.\u201d\n\nEven if the bill gets through the Senate, it has to pass the House again because it revises a bill the House cleared earlier this year. Supporters will now begin rounding up votes in favor of the compromise.\n\nThe White House official said the administration has been in touch with key House leaders and lawmakers as the Senate crafted changes.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that the House will be very constructive,\u201d the official said. The revisions \u201care ones that we think will be able to go down in the House as well, so we\u2019re not as worried about that.\u201d\n\nSari Horwitz contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Key points in the draft EU-UK Brexit deal", "description": "The draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union consists of more than 580 pages of dense legal text", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/key-points-in-the-draft-eu-uk-brexit-deal/2018/11/14/bc2d0ec4-e857-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:53:36Z", "content": "LONDON The draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union has two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which runs more than 580 pages, and a looser political declaration on future relations.

The president\u2019s support could give political cover to Republicans wary of appearing to reduce some hard-line sentencing rules for drug and other offenses. With his endorsement, they believe they could assemble a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats in time to move legislation before the year\u2019s end \u2014 and before the new, divided Congress is seated.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seems unenthusiastic about it, so who knows?

However, let\u2019s not overlook some very healthy signs \u2014 not the least of which is a record turnout in the midterm elections.\n\nFirst, votes are being counted in Florida, regardless of President Trump\u2019s hugely inappropriate tweets trying to undermine that process. Both sides have access from the courts. There will be a final vote. Likewise, a final election result was determined in Arizona, and both sides \u2014 despite irresponsible comments from the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 accepted the legitimacy of the vote count. We\u2019re about to see a peaceful transfer of power in the House of Representatives. Even as some races are still being counted, both parties have accepted the results, even in very close races.\n\nSecond, we are seeing pushback from the right against the president\u2019s lawless conduct. Fox News signed on to CNN\u2019s lawsuit against the president over the revocation of Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass. \u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential,\u201d Fox News President Jay Wallace said. \u201cWe intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\u201d Wallace continued, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\u201d (The Post also joined about a dozen outlets in support of the suit and in vowing to submit amicus briefs.)\n\nLikewise, in the legal arena, a new conservative legal group is picking up the slack in light of the Federalist Society\u2019s near-total subservience to the White House, apparently in exchange for an outsized role in picking judges.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a group of conservative lawyers led by George T. Conway III have organized themselves to \u2014 gasp! \u2014 defend conservative legal principles that the president routinely shreds:\n\n\u201cConservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president,\u201d said John B. Bellinger III, a top State Department and White House lawyer under President George W. Bush. The group, called Checks and Balances, was organized by George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of President Trump\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway. In recent opinion articles, Mr. Conway has criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on birthright citizenship and argued that his appointment of Matthew G. Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general violated the Constitution.\n\nIn a simple statement of its principles, Checks and Balances declares: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights, and the necessity of civil discourse.\u201d In a Trumpized GOP, those are fighting words. Maybe they\u2019ll even embarrass the Federalist Society, in which these lawyers participate, into adhering to its legal philosophy rather than, by its silence, becoming enablers of a raft of attacks on the rule of law.\n\nAnd finally, a bipartisan group has put out a meaningful list of proposals to reform and bolster democracy.\n\nThe National Task Force on Rule of Law & Democracy, led by such figures as former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara, former Republican New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman and former Delaware senator Mike Castle (also a Republican), has put out a batch of ideas ranging from disclosure of presidents\u2019 and vice presidents\u2019 tax returns to legislative enforcement of the emoluments clause to reform of the Office of Government Ethics (giving it power to investigate and punish ethics violations). The task force also recommends extending certain ethics requirements to the president and vice president, empowering inspectors general, protecting special counsels and declaring self-pardons to be illegitimate.\n\nAmong its most important recommendations are new guidelines to restrict White House political appointees from politicizing the Justice Department: \u201c\u2026 legislation should require each administration to identify specific officials, in both the White House and the relevant enforcement agencies, who are authorized to communicate about individual law enforcement matters. This will send a strong message that Congress believes limitations on White House influence are critical to impartial law enforcement. . . . Require law enforcement agencies to maintain a log of contacts with the White House pertaining to specific civil or criminal enforcement matters undertaken by the Justice Department or other federal agencies with enforcement authority.\u201d\n\nWe would hope that Republicans and Democrats \u2014 maybe Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the Senate (the latter of whom worked on the Honest Ads Act with the late Republican senator John McCain) \u2014 would take up these recommendations and pursue them in a bipartisan fashion.\n\nDemocracy is being stressed tested but has not buckled, at least not yet. We should welcome apolitical vote-counting, new interest by the right in enforcement of constitutional norms, and bipartisan efforts to shore up our democracy. Let\u2019s hope others see the merit in and positive attention of such efforts."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Steven Goff", "title": "As Wayne Rooney takes bow with England, Christian Pulisic takes mantle of USMNT", "description": "When England and the United States clash at Wembley Stadium, the soft-spoken, veteran English striker and the young, reticent U.S. attacker will cross paths at a divergent and meaningful moment.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/soccer/as-wayne-rooney-takes-bow-with-england-christian-pulisic-takes-mantle-of-usmnt/2018/11/14/44497866-1e2c-421c-ab7f-fd858f155ab1_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:26:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 14: Christian Pulisic (second left) of the USA attends a training session ahead of the International Friendly between England and the USA at Wembley Stadium on November 14, 2018 in London, England. (Photo by Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Wayne Rooney and Christian Pulisic are 13 years apart, a European in his golden years playing soccer in America and an American in his wonder years excelling in Europe. They do not know one another. They have never stepped onto a pitch at the same time.\n\nBut on Thursday, when England and the United States clash at Wembley Stadium, the soft-spoken English striker and the reticent U.S. attacker will cross paths at a divergent and meaningful moment.\n\nRooney, D.C. United\u2019s summer savior, will take a bow at the fabled theater in a ceremonial farewell to international competition, one year after retiring from the national team. He will enter the friendly sometime in the second half.\n\nPulisic, a sensation from Hershey, Pa., and rising star for German titan Borussia Dortmund, will appear in just his second game for the United States this year. With the U.S. program turning to a wave of young players after failing to qualify for this summer\u2019s World Cup in Russia, Pulisic is inheriting a mantle, relatively speaking, that Rooney had when he burst onto the global scene as a teenager.\n\nOther U.S. players are stepping into prominent roles as well, but with Pulisic\u2019s experiences and abilities, this is his team now.\n\nThe era of Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard has passed. The veterans who remain in the mix are not going to change the course of American soccer. Pulisic could.\n\nAlthough he turned 20 this fall \u2014 the age of a college junior \u2014 the program\u2019s hopes and dreams for the next World Cup cycle and beyond will rest largely with him.\n\n\u201cI definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the team and myself. It\u2019s going to be fun moving forward with these guys.\u201d\n\nPulisic is among several young U.S. players thriving in Europe and MLS. Weston McKennie, featuring regularly with Schalke in the Bundesliga, is another.\n\n\u201cWeston and I are both 20,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re experienced, old guys. We\u2019re in the same boat as a lot of other players.\u201d\n\nBut because Pulisic has accomplished so much so fast \u2014 and been the subject of transfer rumors to big clubs in England and Spain for tens of millions of dollars \u2014 the expectancy to drive the national team, fairly or unfairly, has swelled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put too many expectations on Christian,\u201d U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan said. \u201cTo think that by having him now, all of a sudden, we become a magical group is unfair.\u201d\n\nThe parallels with Rooney, though, are striking. The Englishman debuted with England at age 17 and went on to become the country\u2019s career scoring leader (and Manchester United\u2019s goal king). The burden of expectation on both him and the national team, however, was often too much to bear.\n\n\n\nSoccer Football - England Training - St. George's Park, Burton upon Trent, Britain - November 14, 2018 England's Wayne Rooney during training Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\n\nRooney admitted as much this week.\n\n\u201cThere was huge pressure on me and the team to perform,\u201d he said at England training camp. \u201cSometimes that makes you try too hard and be anxious. Sometimes you put too much on yourself and it affects performances. That\u2019s the story of my England career,\u201d in which he never led the Three Lions to a major trophy.\n\nAsking the same of Pulisic, U.S. veteran goalkeeper Brad Guzan said, is asking a lot.\n\n\u201cWayne Rooney, for what he has done for England and his clubs, has been fantastic,\u201d said Guzan, who has played with Pulisic for two years and faced Rooney\u2019s rockets for several in the Premier League. \u201cChristian is still young. He has got a lot of great years ahead of him. Do I think he has the potential to do fantastic things in soccer? Absolutely. But you can\u2019t put that kind of comparison on Christian\u2019s shoulders.\u201d\n\nPulisic said he has admired Rooney for a long time, although, \u201cwhen he was younger, it was hard to follow for me because I was really young. But a guy like that with a successful career is something I can look at. I want to be just like that. I want to have a long career.\n\n\u201cHe was a very passionate guy and I loved watching that. He worked so hard. My dad [who was an influential figure in Pulisic\u2019s formative years] always told me he was a good guy to look up to.\u201d\n\nDespite his peaceful disposition, Rooney captained both England and Manchester United. He now wears the armband for D.C. United.\n\nPulisic\u2019s leadership ability will come more by example than rousing speeches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough because I am not a very vocal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to show these guys how it\u2019s done at a professional level. I want to go in and be focused every day in training. If guys see that, they will want to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nPulisic will lead in his own way, Guzan said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t force something upon someone. They either take it or they don\u2019t, or they go about it in their own way. I think he is one of those guys who takes responsibility upon himself, but at the same time, he is not going to change his personality just because there are a bunch of young players coming through.\u201d\n\nU.S. notes: Antonee Robinson, the English-born defender, will miss about four weeks with a sprained ankle suffered at U.S. training Tuesday. . . .

Bush or Al Gore would be the next president.\n\nThis year, they are studying how voters loop their Hs.\n\nA federal judge in Tallahassee heard arguments Wednesday about whether election officials may toss 4,000 ballots with signatures that don\u2019t match existing voter records. The suit was brought by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is hoping to overtake Republican Gov. Rick Scott in a statewide recount. It is one of many lawsuits flying in state and federal court in the closely watched Senate race, which remains unresolved more than a week after Election Day.\n\nVoter signatures have taken on outsize importance because they are typically required on absentee and mail-in ballots, which more and more Americans are using to vote. As Republicans and Democrats spar over which ballots should count in unresolved elections in Florida and Georgia, many of their disputes have centered on whether to accept ballots where the signature doesn\u2019t match.\n\nThe issue is acute in close races where absentee ballots could sway the outcome \u2014 and in states where voting by mail has exploded without a standardized system for checking the validity of a signature, the most common way to verify that a mail-in ballot is legal.\n\n\n\nPatrick Murphy, a former Democratic congressman from Florida, had his most recent vote-by-mail ballot rejected for a signature discrepancy. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of it has created an uproar among voting-rights advocates, who say that untrained election workers are tossing eligible ballots, often with no chance for the voter to object or fix the ballot.\n\n\u201cI had zero recourse here,\u201d said Patrick Murphy, a former Democratic congressman from Palm Beach who learned after the election that his absentee ballot had been rejected because of a mismatched signature \u2014 too late for him to do anything about it.\n\nMurphy, 35, said he\u2019s had the same signature since he got his driver\u2019s license at 16, so he thinks it\u2019s ridiculous that his ballot was tossed. \u201cIn elections, especially in Florida, that are within .5 percent or .25 percent, to have nonexperts be deciding this, seems a little silly to me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is increasingly the subject of litigation elsewhere, too. In a Georgia case similar to the one heard Wednesday in Florida, a federal judge ordered officials to stop summarily tossing absentee ballots without giving voters a chance to fix them. Georgia election officials are still counting provisional and absentee ballots in a contentious governor\u2019s race in which Democrat Stacey Abrams is hoping to force a runoff against Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nOpinions on the issue are divided starkly along partisan lines, with Democrats arguing for more recourse for voters and Republicans defending strict laws to guard against voter fraud.\n\n\n\nIn 2000, a Broward County Canvassing Board member, Broward County Circuit Court Judge Robert Rosenberg, uses a magnifying glass to examine a disputed ballot during the recount for the presidential election. (Alan Diaz/AP)\n\n\u201cThe signature requirement is a good requirement,\u201d said Republican Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez, mayor of Miami-Dade, Florida\u2019s largest jurisdiction with about 1.4 million registered voters. He said people known as \u201cballot runners\u201d have improperly filled out ballots belonging to the elderly with their own choice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very useful law,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats noted that most rejected ballots come from communities of color, which tend to vote Democratic. They say that is why Republicans favor strict signature laws despite no widespread evidence of voter fraud. Kemp, for instance, fought the court decision in Georgia.\n\n\u201cThey are not effective anti-fraud measures,\u201d said Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is leading some of the litigation in Florida this week. \u201cThey are disenfranchisement measures. There is nothing in the Constitution that qualifies the right to vote with a consistent signature.\u201d\n\nIn Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County, attorney Bill Abramson described a painstaking process in which election officials, known as the canvassing board, sit at a table, surrounded by lawyers and party representatives, and study each ballot one at a time, trying to reach consensus about whether each one is valid.\n\n\u201cIf you do this for a while, it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d said Abramson, who was there to monitor vote-counting in Palm Beach County on behalf of his friend, Democrat Jim Bonfiglio, whose race for the Florida State House is the closest in the state, with a margin of just 37 votes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an expert to say \u2018that one\u2019s not even close.\u2019 You look for consistencies, the way people hook their H on the left side, that sort of thing. And you compare them.\u201d\n\nAbramson lauded the board\u2019s work and said he objected to only four decisions out of 1,800 ballots. One rejected provisional ballot he thought should have gone through was from an 87-year-old woman who had tried to vote in person.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have her picture ID, so they asked for her signature, and the signature she had on file was God knows how old, so they said it didn\u2019t match,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cI thought they looked really close. I mean, look, she\u2019s 87, her writing is going to change. My signature has been on file since 1992, and it looks nothing like that today.\u201d\n\n'It's a balancing act'\n\nThirty-six states mandate signature matching on absentee or mail-in ballots, according to Gerry Langeler of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization that advocates for mail-in voting and encourages standardized systems to assess ballot signatures.\n\nMost states have had these requirements for years. The attention on the issue this year is less a function of new laws than the explosion in mail-in voting, notably among older and disabled voters who struggle to vote in person.\n\nIn 2010, 20 percent of all ballots were mailed, Langeler said, and the figure has been growing steadily since; this year, the figure will be at least 28 percent.\n\nNowhere in U.S. society are signatures subject to the scrutiny they receive in elections. Signatures are essential on checks, mortgage documents and credit card receipts \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t really matter how they look.\n\nThey often look pretty bad. No one objects when shoppers leave an illegible squiggle on an electronic keypad to pick up groceries or a prescription. And penmanship has become markedly worse among younger Americans, who spend far more time texting than writing in cursive. Some schools don\u2019t even teach it anymore.\n\nPeople\u2019s signatures also evolve over time, and disabilities can make it difficult for voters to write at all.\n\nDepending on the state, voter signatures are compared to records from ballot applications, registration forms and even sometimes to a years-old driver\u2019s license \u2014 a signature often absent-mindedly scrawled onto an electronic keypad.\n\nThat creates the risk that legal votes will be disqualified, advocates say.\n\n\u201cElection officials need to be very careful when they decide to reject absentee ballots for such small issues,\u201d said John Powers, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which helped litigate the signature suit in Georgia. \u201cAnd if they do, they should make some effort to contact the voter and verify the voter\u2019s identity to see if the issue can be resolved before the election.\u201d\n\nElection officials say signature matching is essential to verify the identity of a voter who sends in a ballot by mail. Done right, it can result in minimal rejections, Langeler said. Colorado, for instance, requires all voters to vote by mail \u2014 and requires a two-person, bipartisan team of trained judges to examine every signature rejected by an initial computer scan. They also use several signatures from various records to compare with the ballot.\n\n\u201cYour goal is trying to make sure it\u2019s not a fraudulent ballot, like from somebody in the household of an elderly or disabled person,\u201d said Janine Eveler, director of elections in Cobb County, Ga., where officials had to scour signatures on more than 25,000 mail-in ballots this year. \u201cBut if it\u2019s truly their vote, you want to count that. It\u2019s a balancing act.\u201d\n\nIn Cobb, Eveler has trained her staff to look for similarities in the handwriting on the voter\u2019s registration application as well as the signature stored in the state\u2019s computer system. She believes in giving the benefit of the doubt to the voter, she said \u2014 but that\u2019s her judgment, not a statewide standard. Ultimately, just 23 ballots were rejected because of a mismatched signature in Cobb, not enough to sway the outcome of any election this year.\n\nIt was a different story in neighboring and only slightly larger Gwinnett County, Ga., which rejected hundreds of applications for absentee ballots, which also require a matching signature. That makes the law unfair, advocates said, because voters are treated differently depending on where they live. Judges have agreed in cases in Georgia and New Hampshire.\n\nThere is also the risk of intentional voter suppression, advocates said. Gwinnett has a large minority population, and the majority of absentee-ballot applications rejected in Georgia came from voters of color. Some advocates expressed concern that the computer record that local election officials use to match the ballot signature with the registration also shows a voter\u2019s race \u2014 leaving open the possibility of discrimination.\n\nA Gwinnett County spokesman declined to comment on the issue, citing pending litigation. \u201cBut what I will tell you is that we have been following the law, and when we have received direction from the courts, we have followed that,\u201d said spokesman Joe Sorenson. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we will continue to do.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, Maureen Heard says she knows exactly why her ballot was rejected \u2014 because she had quickly scrawled her signature on her ballot application, and then more carefully signed the ballot itself.\n\nShe was frustrated that she never got a chance to fix the problem and gladly signed onto a lawsuit from the ACLU.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find out until months later,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen the ACLU called me, that my ballot had been invalidated because the signature that I had on the envelope was kind of different than the one that I had tossed off when I was asking for the ballot.\u201d\n\nLori Rozsa in Riviera Beach, Fla., Sean Sullivan in Tallahassee and Beth Reinhard in Lauderhill, Fla., contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Food safety officials stress safe handling of raw turkey - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Food safety officials stress safe handling of raw turkey Washington Post MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Food safety officials are stressing the importance of proper handling and cooking practices amid a nationwide outbreak of drug-resistant Salmonella found in\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/food-safety-officials-stress-safe-handling-of-raw-turkey/2018/11/14/ab9dda94-e851-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:12:59Z", "content": "MINNEAPOLIS Food safety officials are stressing the importance of proper handling and cooking practices amid a nationwide outbreak of drug-resistant Salmonella found in raw turkey, with Thanksgiving approaching.

(WeatherBell.com)\n\nThe calendar might say November, but the weather map thinks its winter.\n\nThanks in part to temperatures 15 to 30 degrees below normal across much of the eastern United States, National Weather Service (NWS) offices have issued winter weather advisories and warnings from Mississippi to Maine as a major storm system continues to take shape.\n\nSnow in the Deep South is rare at any time of year, and especially in November. Yet places including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana have seen some flakes and even accumulation over the past day as this storm system really begins to gather strength. In some of these places, Houston among them, this snow is the earliest on record. This is on the heels of snow across the Rockies and into the Southern Plains that was largely a result of the same slow-moving system.\n\nA primary cause of this snow unusually far south is the big upper-level low pressure system and its deep pool of cold air. In addition to the snow it has created on its own, the system will eventually spur the development of a new area of low pressure near the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday that will spread heavy rain, ice and snow through the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThese two low-pressure zones will ultimately mesh off the coast of New Jersey into Friday, plastering the Northeast with wintry precipitation.\n\nFor now, the first low is continuing to develop across parts of the South and Midwest. A winter storm warning is up in St. Louis and its surroundings, where a half-foot or more of snow is expected to fall.\n\n\u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2c The WINTER STORM WARNING now includes the St. Louis metro area beginning at 6pm this evening until 6pm Thur.

Only an inch or so of snow is forecast for Columbus and Cleveland on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the East Coast low will start riding up the coast in tandem with the parent upper-level low to its west. While the early-season nor\u2019easter is set to deliver more wet than white to the coastal areas, a wintry mix is anticipated in cities from Washington to Boston.\n\n[D.C. area forecast: Season\u2019s first winter storm Thursday will bring slop of sleet, snow and rain. Some slick travel possible.]\n\nHere are snow and sleet accumulation forecasts for these cities, before the expected changeover to plain rain:\n\nWashington: A coating\n\nPhiladelphia: Coating to 1 inch\n\nNew York City: Coating to 1 inch\n\nBoston: 1 to 3 inches\n\nFor those of you commenting that at least there won't be any icing, ahem, there will also be some icing. pic.twitter.com/2bOxyqpFDz \u2014 Gary Szatkowski (@GarySzatkowski) November 14, 2018\n\nHeavier amounts are predicted west of the big cities. At least a few inches of snow is expected along the spine of the mountains from the Virginias northward. The high country of interior Pennsylvania through New York and into New England could see as much as 8 to 12 inches from this winter storm.\n\nWhile this storm is certainly on the early side overall, a city such as Binghamton in the Southern Tier of New York \u2014 where a winter storm watch is in effect \u2014 is no stranger to November snow. As recently as 2016, it picked up 27.6 inches during the month.\n\nTo the south and east of the region of mostly snow, a belt of mixed precipitation is likely near the Interstate 81 corridor, including places such as Winchester, Va., Hagerstown, Md., and Scranton, Pa. In addition to a few inches of snow, ice accumulation of up to 0.25 inch is possible in spots, which may lead to hazardous roads and power outages.\n\n\n\nPrecipitation and snowfall forecasts from the NWS. (National Weather Service)\n\nOn the coast, most of the precipitation will fall as rain. Some spots right on the water may top two inches when all is said and done. More broadly, a large area of significant totals is anticipated up and down the East Coast.

There\u2019s no evidence at all that they are, despite years of looking and years of rhetoric like Trump\u2019s. There\u2019s no evidence of rampant voter fraud in Florida in the wake of last week\u2019s midterm elections, either, despite Trump\u2019s tweets and commentary.\n\nBut there are particularly bad arguments for the existence of voter fraud, two of which Trump offered in an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday afternoon. The outlet\u2019s Benny Johnson and Saagar Enjeti interviewed Trump in the Oval Office, and the conversation turned to the recount in that state.\n\nHere\u2019s the first claim Trump made, hoping to bolster his assertion that fraud is rampant: \u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the second claim he made, hoping to bolster the idea that photo ID should be required at polling places: \u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2014 you have a voter ID. They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with that second claim, because it\u2019s funnier.\n\nAmazingly, Trump has made this very odd assertion about needing an ID to buy groceries before. He said something similar in August and, at the time, the media assessed the validity of the claim. It is, uh, not valid. Maybe if you\u2019re paying with a check, if people still do that? But if you want to go into a grocery store and buy some Cheerios using cash or a debit card, go nuts. This is a good example of Trump\u2019s imperviousness to being corrected.\n\nThe latter half of the comment is also true. Voter ID laws disproportionately make it more difficult for people of color to vote. The laws are usually passed by Republican legislatures in part because they tamp down a voting base assumed to support Democrats. In the past, courts have explicitly called voter ID laws in Texas and North Carolina discriminatory.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, voter ID is not generally an important thing because incidents of in-person voter fraud, the type of fraud that such laws are meant to prevent, are so rare. If you click this button, a fraudulent ballot will be found at the same rate as they were determined to appear in actual voting. One will pop up for you, on average, once every 29 hours.\n\nSTART COUNTING BALLOTS\n\nThere have been a lot of efforts to sniff out fraudulent votes, including by Trump. None have found any significant, organized voter fraud.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump\u2019s first claim, about people voting, leaving the polling place, changing hats and coming back in.\n\nIf you have ever voted, you know how ridiculous this is. While you don\u2019t always need a photo ID to vote, you do need to be registered (in nearly every state) and somehow verify your identity, often by matching your signature against one on file.\n\nUnless you live in a small community in which two people are identified solely by their hat colors, and unless you convince the person at the polling place to ignore your face and just focus on your hat color and unless there are for some reason no other checks to validate your registration, your hat-switching or shirt-changing strategy isn\u2019t going to work.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of amazing that the president of the United States doesn\u2019t know this or pretends he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nClip from \"Access Hollywood\" in 2004. (Access Hollywood) (Philip Bump/New York)\n\nTrump should certainly know how hard it is to vote because he famously had to travel to multiple polling places in 2004 when trying to cast his presidential vote, camera crew in tow. (It was for a show hosted by Billy Bush, who has a habit of starring in videos that don\u2019t cast Trump in the greatest light.) Trump wasn\u2019t on any of the voter registration lists and ultimately had to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nTo be fair, he didn\u2019t try changing his shirt.\n\nThe broader question is why Trump is pushing this obviously untrue assertion about voter fraud. When he made similar claims after the 2016 election, it appeared to be a face-saving move. If millions of people cast votes illegally, the thinking seemed to go, then maybe Trump actually won the popular vote. Here, the goal is different: Trump seems to hope either to curtail the recount in Florida, preserving the narrow leads enjoyed by Republican candidates for the Senate and governor\u2019s seats, or he wants to prepare the ground for objecting to any potential Democratic victories in those races.\n\nOr, maybe, Trump thinks these things are true. They aren\u2019t, but, as mentioned above, he\u2019s impervious to fact-checking. One can picture Trump being told that changing hats won\u2019t fool a poll worker and him waving dismissively. You can probably hear his voice in your head: \u201cEh, it happens, believe me.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t. Vote fraud almost never happens. You don\u2019t need an ID to buy cereal. You can\u2019t swap hats and magically become another legal voter.\n\nBut here we are talking about it yet again."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "C'mon, liberals.

These were often for long interviews, and never less than 10 minutes. He\u2019s very good at interviews, running over questions he does not care to answer and through journalists who try to steer a conversation artlessly.\n\nTrump won. Clinton and Kerry did not. No, that\u2019s not a correlation of winning the presidency with appearing on my show. Now-senator-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and soon-to-be-retired House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u2014 the 2012 GOP presidential-vice presidential nominees \u2014 were frequent guests in 2012, and they didn\u2019t win. But it is a suggestion to would-be Democratic presidential candidates in 2020 that they all start early to seek out frequent interviews with interlocutors from across the political spectrum in settings that allow for more than a minute\u2019s response.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be on my show, though every single one of the two or three dozen serious Democratic would-be nominees is welcome to join me early and often. There are so many serious (and fun) interviews to be had, with straight-down-the-middle journalists such as The Post\u2019s Robert Costa, center-right podcasters including Jamie Weinstein, brilliant young conservatives like Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson, or long-standing stalwarts of the talk radio world who would no more insult a guest than they would their family members at Thanksgiving such as Dennis Prager and myself.\n\nOf course, making the rounds of the Sunday shows will be part of the traditional formula, and sitting down for an amiable chat with a late-night host will stroke some of the base\u2019s erogenous zones, but the real gains are to be made in the no man\u2019s land of serious interviews about difficult subjects, sometimes with interviewers who are not likely to be supporters. Some have already realized this: On my program, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) \u2014 who has expressed interest in running \u2014 is already an occasional guest. Though neither are yet declared candidates, Sens. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) and Angus King (Maine) have also joined me (the latter formally an independent, but so is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont). Both Coons and King would bring quite a lot to the Democratic race, including this willingness to engage.\n\nPolitical conversation in the United States has entered a zone of toxicity I haven\u2019t seen in a broadcast career that began in 1990 and that has always included radio and often television, for every network, and twice as a host for a total of a dozen years on the small screen and nearly 30 over the radio airways. It will be tempting in the rush to lock down a slice of the robustly engaged left to only go live on air in conversation with friends, if not members of the resistance. But not only do independents get to vote in New Hampshire, they also will do so in many other primary contests and of course in November 2020.\n\nSo go hunting for the chance to answer some tough questions about expanding Medicare or fending off China\u2019s aggression or not withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nGo in harm\u2019s way, and win votes, and maybe volunteers and contributors. I wrote last week that President Trump has become extremely deft at the role of \u201ccombatant in chief.\u201d Prepping for him, as for any boxer looking to win a belt, requires a lot of practice sparring. Come early and often, not just to me but anywhere you will be allowed to make a case for change, not unchallenged but always with respect and fair opportunity to answer. There are scores of such places.\n\nYour consultants will say no. Take charge of your own campaign and do so with confidence.

(Peter Barreras/Invision/AP)\n\nGroups with ties to technology titan Mark Zuckerberg are getting even more involved in the political arena, throwing their weight behind a new initiative that would automatically clear the criminal records of eligible offenders without them having to go through a lengthy legal process.\n\nIt\u2019s another step toward engaging with Washington for Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and is being done in coordination with the Seminar Network, the powerful political arm of the Koch brothers, and the progressive Center for American Progress.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, and fwd.us, a lobbying group formed by tech industry executives including Zuckerberg, are among several groups with ties to Silicon Valley that are pushing the effort.\n\nThe move comes as President Trump announced his support Wednesday for a separate bipartisan package aimed at overhauling U.S. sentencing laws. He said the \u201cFirst Step Act\u201d would give inmates a \u201csecond chance at life\u201d after serving time.\n\n[Trump endorses bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill]\n\nThe groups plan to unveil the \u201cClean Slate\u201d initiative at an event Thursday in Washington, where Koch Industries General Counsel Mark Holden will appear with David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Obama who now serves as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s president of policy and advocacy.\n\nThe effort aims to pass both state and federal legislation that would create digital systems to automatically clear records \u2014 eliminating a time-intensive and costly petition process for those who are eligible.\n\nAlthough separate criminal justice reform may soon be considered in Congress, it\u2019s not clear this new effort will be embraced by House members and senators in the near future.\n\nHolden said this is not the first time the group has worked across party lines on criminal justice reform. He indicated this is one of many areas surrounding the issue, including bail practices, where the Koch network may team up with Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThe tech world is going to be essential to reforms in the future,\u201d Holden said in an interview.\n\nClean Slate has already been signed into law in Pennsylvania, and the group is now making a push to ensure other states follow suit.\n\nThe progress in Pennsylvania also caught the eye of Plouffe and his team at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big technological challenge here,\u201d Plouffe said.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative helped the development of technology for the effort by providing financial assistance to Code for America, a group that builds technology services for government.\n\nBetween 70 million and 100 million Americans \u2014 as many as one in three \u2014 have some kind of criminal record, according to the Center for American Progress. Many Americans run into trouble with employers, landlords or educational institutions that do background checks in which their criminal records are a major component.\n\nRebecca Vallas, who leads CAP\u2019s work on the issue, said tens of millions of Americans who have committed crimes \u2014 from minor infractions to those that took place long ago \u2014 are eligible to have their records cleared or expunged.\n\nYet to have their records cleared \u2014 and no longer turn up in a background check \u2014 they must undergo an expensive process of petitioning the courts, which frequently requires hiring a lawyer. Many people with criminal records also may not know they are eligible to have their records cleared, she said.\n\nFurthermore, criminal records cross many different digital systems at various levels of government.\n\nVallas teamed up with Sharon Dietrich, a leading employment lawyer in Philadelphia, to push the first Clean Slate law through the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Dietrich said in her work as litigation director and managing attorney at Community Legal Services, requests from eligible people for record clearances were on the rise, especially in the digital age. Those requests only increased as technology makes it faster and easier to perform background checks.\n\n\u201cI had a client who told me it was easier to get a job when he came out of jail in the 1970s than it is to get one now,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cThe rat race has gotten faster and faster.\u201d\n\nDietrich and her team used to try to clear records manually but soon realized the only way to effectively address the problem was to automatically clear them. After a bipartisan push in Harrisburg, Pa., legislators created a law to do just that.\n\nMichigan, Colorado and South Carolina are among states seeking to follow Pennsylvania\u2019s lead, Vallas said.\n\nIn Michigan, more than 95 percent of records eligible to be cleared have not been successfully expunged or sealed, according to analysis from University of Michigan researchers Sonja Starr and J.J. Prescott.\n\nMuch of the Clean Slate campaign\u2019s momentum is focused on the state level, but a federal effort to create similar legislation for federal criminal records was introduced in August by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) and Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), who lost his reelection effort.\n\nThat bill would automatically clear records for eligible marijuana charges and other nonviolent offenses. Rochester is seeking another Republican co-sponsor for the legislation because Blum lost his bid for reelection. She said it will be a difficult push at the federal level.\n\n\u201cAt the federal level, the task is large,\u201d Rochester said in an email. \u201cThe court systems and the Department of Justice do not have a standard protocol for easily communicating across different jurisdictions, but the challenge makes our task even that much more important.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPostjk"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Mattis calls deployment to border 'great training' as he visits troops in Texas", "description": "Defense secretary presents mission as \"nothing new under the sun\" and tells soldiers to ignore media coverage.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mattis-calls-deployment-to-the-border-great-training-as-he-visits-troops-in-texas/2018/11/14/b2e27070-e83e-11e8-bd89-eecf3b178206_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KzNqHANh7caJhD0ytnCoMFLUIB0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HLANGSHIJUI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:45:46Z", "content": "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described the deployment to the border as great training and told active-duty soldiers in Texas not to pay attention to the news coverage of the operation because they would go nuts.

There\u2019s nothing new under the sun.\u201d\n\nThe National Guard deployed to the border during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama to aid the Border Patrol, but active-duty forces haven\u2019t deployed there since counternarcotics missions decades ago.\n\nAfter arriving at Base Camp Donna, Mattis met with soldiers who have been setting up barbed-wire fences to \u201charden\u201d points of entry in anticipation of migrants arriving from caravans headed northward.\n\nThe defense secretary suggested the soldiers should disregard the controversy surrounding the mission that has surfaced in the news media.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of stuff in the news, and that sort of thing,\u201d Mattis told a group of soldiers. \u201cYou just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander, tells you. Because if you read all that stuff, you know, you\u2019ll go nuts.\u201d\n\nMattis also sought to present the border deployment as good training for U.S. forces, arguing that the mission would improve their readiness and counteracting criticism that Trump was wasting the time and money of the armed forces for political effect.\n\n\u201cWhat a great training,\u201d Mattis told one of the soldiers in Texas as he walked through the installation with Nielsen. \u201cWe could not have had a better training event.\u201d\n\nTrump announced ahead of the midterms that he would deploy as many as 10,000 to 15,000 troops in anticipation of the caravan\u2019s arrival, actively publicizing a muscular military deployment that played well with his base.\n\nOn Wednesday, some two weeks later, a spokeswoman for U.S. Northern Command said about 5,900 troops were deployed there and significant increases weren\u2019t expected.\n\nNorthern Command previously had said more than 7,000 active-duty troops would be supporting CBP in California, Arizona and Texas. The spokeswoman for the command said Wednesday that estimate had included troops who were in \u201cpreparation for deployment\u201d status. The active-duty forces joined more than 2,000 National Guardsmen who have been deployed to the border since April.\n\nThe Pentagon initially dubbed the active-duty operation \u201cFaithful Patriot.\u201d Mattis later ordered the military to scrap the name and describe the mission as border support.\n\n\u201cWhen the name of the mission first came in, I had given instructions, \u2018I do not want to put this mission in some arcane military terms. If what we\u2019re doing is laying wire, don\u2019t talk about implementing a barrier plan,\u2019\u201d Mattis said.\n\nHe said he wanted the American public to understand what the military is doing and not doing on the border because \u201cthis is a highly politically visible issue.\u201d\n\nMattis said there was still no cost estimate for the mission.\n\nThe military deployment to the border, including the cost of National Guard forces that have been there since April, could climb well above $200 million by the end of 2018 and grow significantly if the deployments continue into next year, according to analysts\u2019 estimates and Pentagon figures. The cost of the National Guard deployment from April 10 through Sept. 30 amounted to $103 million, according to Pentagon figures.\n\nThe total figure for the military operations on the border this year could be lower if the Pentagon keeps the number of active-duty troops hovering around 5,000, rather than the 10,000 or 15,000 Trump had suggested.\n\nThe active-duty border mission is tentatively scheduled to continue until mid-December. Several hundred members of a Central American migrant caravan with about 6,000 people have arrived at the border in Tijuana, Mexico. The rest are expected to arrive over the next several days. Most of the caravan members are Hondurans who say they are fleeing violence and poverty.\n\nTrump, who regularly mentioned the caravan in the days ahead of the midterm elections and warned without evidence that the crowd included \u201csome bad people\u201d and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d has largely stopped bringing it up in recent days.\n\nThe troops deployed at the border, meanwhile, have been stringing Slinky-style barbed wire at locations where migrants might arrive in Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nIn Brownsville, Tex., soldiers told The Washington Post on Sunday that such concertina wire is easy to put in place but difficult to remove once its barbed coils are expanded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big Slinky,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Juan Mendoza, a member of the 887th Engineer Support Company, referring to the toy. \u201cOnce you stretch that Slinky out so much and put a small twist in it, it never goes back the same way.\u201d\n\nOne of the soldiers who spoke with Mattis on Wednesday brought up the matter and asked whether the \u201cwire obstacles\u201d his unit was installing would need to be removed later on. Mattis said right now the task was to put in the wire.\n\nWith regard to removing it, Mattis said, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nDan Lamothe contributed to this report from Brownsville, Tex."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "After intense wrangling, UK backs a Brexit deal.

(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Like white smoke from the Vatican announcing a new pope, the signal from Britain\u2019s Cabinet table says: We have a decision.\n\nAfter a year and a half of negotiating with the European Union \u2014 and fighting with itself \u2014 the U.K. government on Wednesday backed a deal to allow Britain\u2019s orderly exit from the bloc, and paint the outlines of future relations.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s fractious Conservative government agreed on a deal that solves the key outstanding issue \u2014 how to ensure a frictionless border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. The \u201cbackstop\u201d plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out.\n\nIt\u2019s a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day \u2014 just over four months away on March 29 \u2014 remains rocky.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what is likely to happen next:\n\nBEELINE TO BRUSSELS\n\nMay is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed, while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBarnier declared there has been \u201cdecisive progress\u201d toward a deal \u2014 the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25.\n\nThe deal consists of two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement \u2014 which includes the border backstop \u2014 and a looser framework for future relations. The two sides have given themselves a transition period until the end of 2020 to work out the details of future trade ties.\n\nPERIL IN PARLIAMENT\n\nOnce the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments\n\nMay hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans \u2014 cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production \u2014 if there isn\u2019t clarity by then about the terms of Brexit.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle. May\u2019s Conservative Party doesn\u2019t hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons, and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP says it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union, and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also says it will oppose any deal that doesn\u2019t offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union.\n\nMay is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d exit \u2014 complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods \u2014 most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal.\n\nUNCHARTED TERRITORY\n\nIf Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory.\n\nLawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there\u2019s no simple mechanism to make that happen. They could defeat the government in a no-confidence vote in an attempt to trigger a national election.\n\nLawmakers could even vote for a new referendum on EU membership, though it seems unlikely there would be time to hold one before the U.K.\u2019s scheduled departure date. The U.K. will cease to be an EU member on March 29 \u2014 deal or no deal.\n\nIain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute, said rejection of a deal would trigger a major political crisis because Britain\u2019s patchwork constitution offers no \u201cprescribed way out of that dilemma.\u201d\n\nHe said in that case, \u201cwe really are into a period of great uncertainty about what happens next. I think nobody can know how it would unfold.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Stephanie Keith/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nReported hate crimes in America rose 17 percent last year, the third consecutive year that such crimes increased, according to newly released FBI data that showed an even larger increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Law enforcement agencies reported that 7,175 hate crimes occurred in 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. That increase was fueled in part by more police departments reporting hate crime data to the FBI, but overall there is still a large number of departments that report no hate crimes to the federal database. The sharp increase in hate crimes in 2017 came even as overall violent crime in America fell slightly, by 0.2 percent, after increases in 2015 and 2016. . . . Of the more than 7,000 incidents reported last year, 2,013 targeted black Americans, while 938 targeted Jewish Americans. Incidents targeting people for their sexual orientation accounted for 1,130 hate crimes, according to the FBI. . . . Anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 37 percent in 2017. Anti-Islamic hate crimes declined 11 percent last year, with 273 such incidents, the data show.\n\nHowever, it is also the case that not all hate crimes are reported to the FBI. (\u201cSome of last year\u2019s most widely reported hate crime charges \u2014 the confessed assailant who said \u2018get out of my country\u2019 before killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla; the death of Heather Heyer, allegedly by a white supremacist who ran her over in Charlottesville; and the Portland MAX train stabbings, during which the accused attacker was overheard yelling racist slurs \u2014 are not recorded in the FBI report.\u201d) The failure to develop a consistent and reliable reporting system must be rectified.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, we witnessed the most deadly anti-Semitic hate crime in American history,\u201d said Anti-Defamation League CEO and National Director Jonathan A. Greenblatt. \u201cToday, we have another FBI study showing a big jump in hate crimes against Americans because of their race, religion, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. This report provides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America. That begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.\u201d\n\nGreenblatt admonished authorities to fix the spotty reporting system: \u201cIt is incumbent on police departments, mayors, governors, and county officials across the country to tally hate crimes data and report it to the FBI. The FBI can only report what the data they receive. We must do more to make sure that cities report credible data.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s apologists deny any connection whatsoever between Trump\u2019s harangues against the so-called caravan and the Pittsburgh slaughter of 11 Jews, whom the alleged murderer said were trying to bring invaders into the country. However, few Americans who are not die-hard Trump cultists would deny that Trump has normalized racist speech, excused white nationalists, \u2014 some \u201cfine\u201d people marched in Charlottesville, he insisted \u2014 equated immigrants with criminals, identified as a \u201cnationalist\u201d himself and fanned the white grievance syndrome.\n\nHowever, it is not only Trump who is responsible. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to pass a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s Charlottesville remarks and has refused to kick Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) out of the caucus even though he met with and embraced the views of Austrian neo-Nazis. Holocaust denier Arthur Jones ran under the GOP banner in Illinois\u2019s 3rd Congressional District (he lost, but received 56,000 votes), as did avowed white-supremacist Russell Walker in a race for the North Carolina state House of Representatives. (Walker also lost.) Corey Stewart ran on a race-baiting, anti-immigrant platform in Virginia for the U.S. Senate (again, he lost) and received praise from Trump.\n\nIn becoming a nativist party and catering to a segment of the electorate that thinks whites have been persecuted, Republicans have encouraged hate-mongers, anti-Semites and white nationalists to come out in the open. Other factors, including social media, contribute to the problem, but nothing so emboldens racists to express their views in non-peaceful ways than to hear political leaders sound dog whistles \u2014 and sometimes bullhorns. The House should hold hearings on the problem, solicit expert advice and \u2014 we would hope in conjunction with the Senate \u2014 take a zero-tolerance position in their own parties when it comes to noxious bigotry. Republicans\u2019 silence makes them complicit; their unwavering support for Trump makes them morally responsible for the surge in hate crimes.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat\u2019s a defeated or retired Republican to do?\n\nA frightful portrait of a president out of control\n\nCorey Stewart and his race-baiting friends\n\nI\u2019m a black woman.

Five more clubs would be invited to play in what would effectively be a replacement for the Champions League, which shares more than $2 billion each season among 32 clubs but is controlled by UEFA.\n\nThe plan seemed to betray ECA leader Agnelli\u2019s repeated promise of no changes being made to the Champions League before 2024.\n\n\u201cAll parties underlined their commitment to working together toward the development of club competitions under the leadership of UEFA,\u201d the European soccer body said in a statement about Wednesday\u2019s meeting, which did not mention the breakaway project.\n\nEuropean media reports have also detailed how some clubs \u2014 including Manchester City and PSG, backed by owners from royal families in Qatar and Abu Dhabi \u2014 evaded UEFA rules on sponsor deals and spending on transfers and wages.\n\nPSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who arrived at UEFA to attend the second half of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, did not stop to talk with reporters.\n\nA proposal to add a third-tier European club competition, while cutting the Europa League group stage from 48 teams to 32, was also analyzed. It should be approved at a Dec. 3 meeting of UEFA\u2019s executive committee in Dublin.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLUGANO, Switzerland \u2014 Qatar stunned eighth-ranked Switzerland 1-0 in an international friendly on Wednesday as Akram Afif\u2019s late goal gave the 2022 World Cup host a surprising victory.\n\nAfif scored on a breakaway with four minutes remaining to send an early message that 96th-ranked Qatar may be catching up to the more established soccer powers four years before it plays in its first World Cup.\n\nAfter Qatar won possession near the halfway line, Afif ran onto a throughball and rounded goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo before shooting into an empty net.\n\n\u201cWe hope this game gives our players the confidence that we can play against top teams and to keep working hard,\u201d Qatar coach Felix Sanchez said. \u201cI\u2019m sure in Qatar people are very proud of our players today and they\u2019re going to give us more hope to prepare the Asian Cup.\u201d\n\nQatar has another friendly on Monday against Iceland before the Asian Cup in January. It will also play in next year\u2019s Copa America in Brazil as one of the invited guests.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re coaching a team like Qatar and you\u2019re facing a top team like we faced today we need to do more things that we are not used to do but that\u2019s the way to compete because at the moment Switzerland is No. 8 in the world, we\u2019re No. 96. This for a reason,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nSwitzerland, which reached the last 16 in this year\u2019s World Cup in Russia and had kept nine clean sheets in its past 10 home matches, had wasted a number of chances to put the game away earlier and hit the post twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really awful defeat, it\u2019s a match almost to forget. We played really badly,\u201d Switzerland midfielder Remo Freuler said. \u201cWe have to analyze what we did badly and I don\u2019t think we did anything well. ... I don\u2019t think we undervalued them but we never got into the match today.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss came into the game as massive favorites after putting six goals past Panama and Iceland this year, as well as scoring five against Hungary in 2017.\n\nThe last time Qatar played a European team it lost 2-1 at home against minnow Liechtenstein last December. Its last win against a European team was a 1-0 victory against Andorra last August. The tiny desert nation was awarded the 2022 World Cup in a disputed FIFA vote in 2010 despite never having qualified for the tournament before.\n\nAfif also drew a save from Mvogo in the 23rd minute, while Switzerland went closest in the 36th when Micahel Lang headed a corner off the inside of the right post.\n\nAfif thought he had given Qatar the lead at the end of the first half but he was offside when Ali flicked the ball on.\n\nSwitzerland made wholesale changes at halftime but even the introduction of Liverpool midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri didn\u2019t help \u2014 although his pass set up Christian Fassnacht for a shot that hit the crossbar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) first won election to the House of Representatives two years ago and since has distinguished himself largely on two metrics: number of appearances on Fox News and \u2014 overlapping a bit \u2014 loyalty to President Trump.\n\nIn that latter vein, Gaetz has embraced the president\u2019s rhetoric about the still-undecided Senate and gubernatorial races in Florida, charging repeatedly on television and on Twitter that Democrats in the state are using illegal ballots to try to steal the election.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart on Tuesday, he ran through those allegations, framing them in a new context. Gov. Rick Scott (R), who leads incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D), and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who leads Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D), may be \u201coutside the margin of fraud,\u201d but, he claimed, the Democrats are perpetuating fraud anyway so that they know what works to steal the next election. He called it \u201cstress-testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don\u2019t work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren\u2019t, then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI really think that\u2019s what this is about. The resistance movement has changed from, you know, yelling at town halls to yelling in restaurants and now it\u2019s actually trying to steal elections they can\u2019t win at the ballot box.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats justify anything they do against Trump as being righteous even if it\u2019s morally wrong or even if it\u2019s illegal,\u201d he claimed at another point, \u201cbecause they\u2019re so driven to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nRepublican insistence on following the rules, Gaetz claimed, put them at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cIf we allow Democrats to continue this behavior, like, they\u2019re not going to get better,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to treat us better. They\u2019re not going to follow the rules more. So we\u2019ve got to take the gloves off and fight like they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new conservative movement has to take on Trump\u2019s sense of boldness,\u201d he said.\n\nNow let\u2019s pick all of this apart.\n\nGaetz is certainly a standard-bearer for embracing Trump\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d in the broader context that can include \u201cwillingness to say untrue things that advance your partisan goals.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cboldness\u201d often manifests as throwing punches at the opposition which, Gaetz correctly says at one point, is what much of the Republican base wants to see. But Trump\u2019s punches are often rooted in false or misleading information.\n\nAs are Gaetz\u2019s comments about the vote in Florida. He claims that Broward County added 80,000 ballots from nowhere between Election Day and the final vote count \u2014 a number that the Daytona Beach News-Journal interpreted as a reference to provisional ballots that are a common feature of Florida elections. (Asked about this on Fox News, Gaetz didn\u2019t clarify.) He claimed that \u201cmystery boxes\u201d of ballots had turned up, perhaps a reference to the discovery of a box labeled \u201cprovisional ballots\u201d at a school in Broward County \u2014 and which was found to contain no actual ballots. He claimed that Broward County had \u201cmore registered voters than she\u2019s got eligible registered voters,\u201d perhaps a reference to a prominent \u2014 and false \u2014 online meme alleging that more votes were cast in the county than there are voters. There weren\u2019t.\n\nGaetz claimed that, in Palm Beach County, illegal ballots had been mixed in with legal ballots and would be counted. That appears to be a mistaken reference to a decision made in Broward County to include some 200 provisional ballots in the total count despite the fact that at least 20 had been deemed ineligible. The signatures on the ballots didn\u2019t match signatures on file but were cast by registered voters, according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nGaetz made another remarkable claim, too.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthey already flipped an agriculture commissioner race. Right? I mean, the Republican won that Agriculture Commission race, and the Democrat is up now.\u201d\n\nThat Republican, state representative Matt Caldwell, didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d the race. It was called for him by some outlets, but, as more votes were counted, his Democratic opponent took the lead \u2014 as early as last Wednesday. Caldwell is suing Broward County in an effort to regain the lead, but at no point was it won in his favor.\n\nThis mirrors Trump\u2019s rhetoric, too. Whoever had the lead when the initial vote tally was done on Election Day is the winner, and any votes counted after that point, it seems, are somehow invalid or suspect. As the New York Times\u2019s David Leonhardt noted on Twitter, though, that only seems to be applicable in cases where the Republican led on the night of the election.\n\nIn Utah\u2019s 4th House district, the Democrat \u2014 Ben McAdams \u2014 led after the initial vote count. The Republican \u2014 Mia Love \u2014 has closed the gap since Election night. The outcome remains unclear.\n\n\n\nFunny, you don\u2019t hear much whining or conspiracy theorizing about that vote count. \u2014 David Leonhardt (@DLeonhardt) November 14, 2018\n\nUnmentioned by Gaetz: Why fraudsters would commit fraud, but not enough fraud to actually win the races.\n\nAlso unmentioned by Gaetz: There\u2019s been no evidence of actual fraud. There was an alleged issue with altered forms purportedly sent out by the Democratic Party, but beyond vague allegations, there\u2019s been nothing to suggest the vote in Florida was tainted in any significant way. Despite people looking.\n\nGaetz made the case to keep swinging away regardless.\n\n\u201cThe biggest threat to the Trump movement is that Republicans in office demoralize our base because the only way we win now is by driving turnout among our voters,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cAnd if our voters just think we\u2019re weak, we don\u2019t fight, we don\u2019t do the things we say when we get elected? Then there is no future for us.\u201d\n\nHe appears to have taken that idea to heart."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Pro-Trump diplomat to become Brazil's foreign minister - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Pro-Trump diplomat to become Brazil's foreign minister Washington Post SAO PAULO \u2014 Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has chosen an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump as his future foreign minister.

He is anti-left and a self-proclaimed nationalist, and he campaigned for Bolsonaro, who was elected Oct.28.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian foreign policy must be a part of the moment of recovery that Brazil lives today,\u201d the president-elect said about his appointee.\n\nAraujo has praised Trump\u2019s approach to foreign relations, saying the U.S. leader proposes a view of the West that is based on the recovery of its symbolic past. The Brazilian diplomat also believes globalism is an anti-Christian ideology.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain and longtime congressman, has on several occasions compared himself to Trump, although many analysts say his tough anti-crime and pro-gun positions resemble more those of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nSome diplomats were surprised with Araujo\u2019s appointment because he has never been in charge of an embassy during his 29-year diplomatic service.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s aggressive rhetoric has already caused tensions with Egypt and Cuba, issues that Araujo will deal with once in office.\n\nThe Arab nation cancelled a trip of Brazilian lawmakers this year after the president-elect promised to move the Brazilian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Bolsonaro later said the decision was not taken.\n\nCuba announced earlier Wednesday that it was ending a program that sent almost 9,000 medics to Brazil, acting after Bolsonaro said the program could continue only under new conditions. Among other things, he said the doctors must receive their salaries directly from Brazil and not through the Cuban government and be allowed to bring their families with them during their assignments.\n\nBolsonaro will also be starting his administration with some friction with China, which has invested billions of dollars in energy, infrastructure and oil projects in Brazil. During the campaign, he complained: \u201cThe Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil itself.\u201d\n\nIn a recent editorial in the China Daily newspaper, the Chinese government warned Bolsonaro against aggressive statements aimed at China, saying they could cause troubles for Brazil. Soon afterward Bolsonaro was visited by China\u2019s ambassador to Brasilia.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Officers from two departments, including Midlothian\u2019s, arrived to find Roberson armed and trying to subdue a suspect in a parking lot.\n\nThe officer who killed Roberson \u201cgave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground\u201d before he fired, according to a preliminary report by the Illinois State Police that cited witnesses. Officers provided medical aid to multiple victims, including Roberson, the report found.\n\nBut the report did not say how long the officer waited before he fired or whether he identified himself as a police officer.

He probably saved lives,\u201d Kulis said.\n\nPeople close to Roberson said he had hoped to become a police officer. \u201cAnd lo and behold, a police officer comes in and kills him,\u201d Kulis said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\n\nThe incident closely tracks with theoretical situations that advocates have suggested would curtail violence \u2014 a weapon is drawn, shots are fired, and then a \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d steps in to help before the police can respond.\n\nThat ideal doesn\u2019t account for the chaotic unknowns when police arrive and can\u2019t tell a \u201cgood guy\u201d with a gun from a \u201cbad guy\u201d with a gun.\n\nThe incident may become a touchstone in a persistent debate about how places such as schools, nightclubs and houses of worship should steel themselves against gunmen.\n\n[Two Oklahoma citizens killed an active shooter, and it's not as simple as it sounds]\n\nThat debate has gained urgency during the past year, as President Trump and others have repeatedly said security guards \u2014 specifically armed ones \u2014 could have prevented the nation\u2019s mass shootings; this year, Trump tweeted his support for the controversial idea of arming teachers.\n\nThe Sunday incident has already provoked concerns that black men \u2014 even when legally carrying firearms or employed in positions that allows their use \u2014 can still become targets for police fire.\n\nRoberson\u2019s friends said he had talked all his life of becoming a police officer.\n\n\u201cNow you have to question the police and what they\u2019re actually doing,\u201d said Christian Torres, 21. \u201cThis is someone who was on their side.\u201d\n\nRoberson had a valid gun owner\u2019s license but did not have a concealed-carry permit, WGN reported. In Minnesota in 2016, Philando Castile was killed by an officer during a traffic stop seconds after he told an officer there was a weapon in the car.\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Robbins Police Department, neither of which responded to requests for comment, are investigating the shooting that first drew the police to the scene, Delaney said.\n\nIllinois State Police will investigate Roberson\u2019s killing by the Midlothian officer.\n\nRoberson is one of at least 840 people who have been shot and killed by police so far in 2018 and one of at least 19 in Illinois, according to a Washington Post database.\n\nAt least 181 of those shot and killed by police this year \u2014 22 percent \u2014 were black. The U.S. population is about 13 percent black.\n\n[\u2018We are armed now\u2019: In Kentucky, shootings leave a black church and the white community around it shaken]\n\nMore than half of those killed \u2014 459 people, including Roberson \u2014 were said to be armed when police killed them.\n\nThe oldest of four children, Roberson grew up in Wicker Park, a neighborhood in the North Side of Chicago about 27 miles from Robbins. His family said he was in law school and was a role model for his peers, inspiring young men to become involved with the church.\n\n\u201cHe was dedicated to the Wicker community in a real positive way.\u201d said Malik Harris, 20, a cousin of Roberson\u2019s.\n\nThe Rev. Marvin Hunter told the Associated Press that Roberson played organ at his church and others in the area.

Bezos tours the facility at the grand opening of the Amazon Spheres in Seattle in January. (Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAmazon\u2019s handling of its HQ2 decision reminds me of nothing so much as LeBron James\u2019s ill-fated television special, \u201cThe Decision.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you remember that 2010 episode, during which the greatest basketball player on the planet teamed up with ESPN and broadcaster Jim Gray to announce live his free-agency choice in front of not only millions watching at home but also a live studio audience made up of members of a Boys and Girls Club. Members who audibly gasped when James said he was abandoning him hometown team to join up with Dwyane Wade and Pat Riley of the Miami Heat \u2014 that he was \u201cgoing to take his talents to South Beach,\u201d as he infamously put it.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the show raised money for charity or that there was legitimate public interest in his choice: The whole spectacle was grotesque, a celebration of a millionaire devastating an already-devastated town by announcing he was abandoning it to pursue his dreams elsewhere.\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision-making process with regard to the placement of its second headquarters has taken place in a similarly public way, with the online giant soliciting bids from cities across the country, narrowing down the list of potential winners as time progressed, and finally, in a shocking twist worthy of reality TV, choosing two sites rather than one. (Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe two chosen cities, it should be noted, are already considered winners in the global economy, two sites that need the influx of traffic and the increase in home prices less than anywhere outside of San Francisco, two sites filled with people ready to vent their annoyance about the imposition on their hometowns and the depletion of public coffers to bring jobs to their respective regions.\n\nThe promise of the HQ2 search all along had been the idea that Amazon might settle down in a city that hadn\u2019t quite kept pace with the Acela Corridor and Silicon Valley during our latest e-boom. Columbus, Indianapolis, Nashville, Dallas, even Newark or Denver: These were cities that could have used an influx of high-paying jobs. The idea was bold and grand, a promise to spread the wealth in a country staring down increases in inequality tied as much to geography as anything else.\n\nThe promise went unfulfilled, of course, and the decision to split the headquarters in twain \u2014 with both halves going to the haves rather than one going to a have and another a have-not \u2014 was, simply, a PR disaster. Someone somewhere overestimated how much the public would enjoy seeing a megacorporation extract financial concessions from localities in an effort to boost the bottom line, all while dashing the hopes of smaller cities that never truly stood a chance at landing the offices.\n\nNo blunder lasts forever, of course. Following the debacle that was \u201cThe Decision,\u201d James redoubled his charitable efforts. The LeBron James Family Foundation has positively intervened in the lives of hundreds of students. In 2015, James teamed up with the University of Akron to start a program that would pay for four-year rides for as many as 2,300 students, a financial commitment that could clock in at nine figures. James also ended up returning to Cleveland, delivering a championship to the city that had been title-less for more than half a century before the Cavaliers managed to win a title in 2016. Winning covers up for many mistakes.\n\nSimilarly, people will forget about Amazon\u2019s missteps here. It\u2019s hard to hold a grudge when the prices are so good, the shipping is so quick, and the shopping is so convenient. But the corporation could learn a lesson or two from James\u2019s good works: Perhaps Whole Foods stores in finalist cities that weren\u2019t chosen could double as food banks for the needy, or opportunity centers could be established to retrain workers struggling to survive in a rapidly changing economy.\n\nOr maybe Amazon could use its lobbying powers to ensure that nothing like HQ2 ever happens again: There\u2019s a growing consensus on the left and right alike that such corporate handouts are little more than cronyism designed to turn our cities against each other in a fight for business scraps. While lobbying in favor of a federal law designed to ban such practices would undoubtedly come in for criticism as self-serving \u2014 Amazon got theirs, now they want to stop everyone else from benefiting \u2014 it would equally undoubtedly be a massive public good. Imagine how much goodwill the company could generate by championing legislation that would end sports teams holding cities hostage for new stadiums, laws that would stop corporate behemoths from extracting billions in concessions from struggling local economies.\n\nLike \u201cThe Decision,\u201d the HQ2 mess will leave a bad taste in the public\u2019s collective mouth for some time. How long that aftertaste remains is entirely up to the retailer."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Michael O'Sullivan", "title": "The Coen brothers made a western for Netflix.

A gunslinger, a bank robber, a prospector, a trapper, a gal in search of a good man all commingle with so many other saddle-worn tropes of the oater genre \u2014 the hangin\u2019 tree, the saloon, the wagon train, the stagecoach and the ubiquitous, \u201cWestworld\u201d-style town that populates our collective imagination of the American West \u2014 that the film at first feels like a cartoon.\n\nIn fact, its first chapter, the shortest of the film\u2019s half-dozen vignettes, and the one that lends \u201cBallad\u201d its title, is a kind of cowboy comic book. Starring Tim Blake Nelson as the titular Buster, a traveling singer and gunslinger who dispatches those who cross him in spectacularly exaggerated style, this short take on the genre is both funny and morbid as heck, signaling the Coens\u2019 intention to chew on the theme of human mortality like a cowpoke nurses his chawin\u2019 tobacky.\n\nThat single-minded focus continues in the next installment, in which James Franco plays a bank robber who has been sentenced to death by hanging. Depending on how you look at things, he\u2019s either the luckiest or unluckiest man in the world, as his execution goes (darkly) comically awry.\n\nBut by the time Chapter Two has gotten underway, it\u2019s clear that the Coens\u2019 aim is something more than laughter.\n\n\n\nGrainger Hines as the Sam Elliottesque Mr. Arthur.

It is here, in this O. Henryesque tale, that the Coens find their true voice or, rather, the true voice of this anthology, which is ultimately much more dark, and satisfying, than comedy.\n\nIf that\u2019s your definition of entertainment \u2014 and blissfully it is mine \u2014 \u201cBallad\u201d paints a deliciously dismal portrait of the human condition.\n\nOther chapters focus on familiar western themes: love, loyalty, justice, greed, good vs. evil. Among the many, many standout performances by actors whose names you will recognize are those of Zoe Kazan as a woman traveling West in search of romance; Brendan Gleeson as a laconic bounty hunter; and Tom Waits as a grizzled gold prospector in \u201cAll Gold Canyon\u201d (based on a Jack London story), a vignette that encapsulates, in miniature, some of the epic themes of the great John Huston film \u201cThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\u201d\n\nOther less familiar faces who shine include Grainger Hines \u2014 a spiritual cousin to Sam Elliott \u2014 opposite Kazan, and Jonjo O\u2019Neill as Gleeson\u2019s bounty-hunting partner.\n\n\n\nJonjo O'Neill, left, as \u201cThe Englishman\u201d and Brendan Gleeson as \u201cThe Irishman\u201d in \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\u201d (Netflix)\n\nIt is O\u2019Neill who pretty much steals the show, or at least wraps it up nicely with a ghoulish little bow, in the film\u2019s final chapter, \u201cThe Mortal Remains.\u201d The longest and best of the film\u2019s segments, \u201cRemains\u201d situates O\u2019Neill\u2019s dapper Englishman in a stagecoach filled with four other strangers, all under a roof that is also carrying the corpse of an outlaw. As the coach hurtles through the advancing darkness, he regales his fellow travelers with a creepy tale, one that functions as a sort of ghost story (or one that lands with something approaching the force of a shivery campfire yarn).\n\n\u201cThe Mortal Remains\u201d brings all these tales together beautifully, by which I mean in a coda that is somber and hauntingly unsettled, like the last note of a dirge.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIf President Trump has one signature issue, it\u2019s immigration. Or, more specifically, the fear of immigrants. While previous presidents from both parties have, at times, struggled to arrive at the best immigration policy, to one degree or another they all acknowledged that the immigrant story is the American story \u2014 one of risk-taking, struggle, work, hope and creating a better life for the next generation. Trump, however, sees immigrants only as a source of crime, economic threats and cultural displacement. And, critically, this is both what he sincerely believes and what he thinks is the most effective political tool available to him.\n\nSo it was no surprise that, as the midterm elections approached, he would attempt to make them about immigration and the threat it supposedly poses. Now that the final votes are being tallied, it is becoming clear that not only did he fail, he made his party\u2019s situation far worse than it might have been. His strategy backfired.\n\nMost obviously, Trump\u2019s campaigning on immigration didn\u2019t stop Democrats from taking back control of the House, flipping seven governorships from Republican to Democrat, taking control of state legislatures, and passing progressive initiatives on issues such as Medicaid expansion, voting rights and the minimum wage. In Congress, where Trump focused most of his attention, Democrats faced a brutal map in the Senate but lost a net of only two seats (one, if Sen. Bill Nelson pulls ahead in a Florida recount). In the House, it looks as though they\u2019ll pick up 38 seats, their biggest gain since the post-Watergate election in 1974.\n\nIf that were all we knew, Trump might be able to argue that focusing on immigration was still a good tactic and, without it, things could have been even worse for Republicans. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Instead, his relentless fearmongering seems to have produced a backlash.\n\nTake, for instance, this poll conducted for the progressive group Immigration Hub:\n\nAccording to Nick Gourevitch, Partner at Global Strategy Group, \u201cNew polling we conducted in the immediate aftermath of the election shows that Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant focus backfired with voters in Pennsylvania and Colorado. Voters found that Republican candidate alignment with Trump on immigration was more of a reason to vote against those candidates than to vote for them, including with politically important groups like Independents in Colorado and voters in Pennsylvania who voted for Trump in 2016 and shifted to Bob Casey in 2018.\u201d\n\nEvery race is different, of course, but we saw in many districts and states that Republican candidates either embraced Trump\u2019s xenophobic arguments and lost, or awkwardly tried to distance themselves from the president. Meanwhile, they got hammered on the party\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and remove protections for people with preexisting conditions \u2014 a threat that voters obviously saw as far more urgent than a bunch of families trudging across Mexico to request asylum. Some Republicans were warning before Election Day that Trump\u2019s demagoguery would cost them seats; they turned out to be right.\n\nThis failure happened despite the fact that Trump got exactly what he wanted from the news media. When he began saying that we were under dire threat from an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants walking toward the United States, despite the fact that their caravan was 1,000 miles away from the border, the news media immediately pushed the issue as though it were an immediate crisis. It was all-caravan-all-the-time on Fox News leading up to Election Day, but other networks focused on it as well, as did newspapers, repeatedly running stories about the caravan on their front pages.\n\nMany critics are now describing this as an abysmal failure of the media, particularly now that everyone has simply stopped talking about the caravan, as we knew they would once the election was over. It is a difficult question: How much do you allow the president to determine your coverage? After all, he\u2019s the president, and what he does is inherently newsworthy. They don\u2019t call it the bully pulpit for nothing. But if you simply repeat everything he says, you\u2019ve become a tool of his propaganda. This problem is far more acute when the president is a lying demagogue, so the answer most new organizations arrive at is that we\u2019ll cover the issue, but we\u2019ll do it with enough thoroughness and skepticism to counter whatever dishonesty with which it\u2019s being served up.\n\nThe trouble with that, however, is that there are times when even the most skeptical coverage can still serve the demagogue\u2019s goals. Just having stories and photos of the caravan on the front page every day could well have been all the president wanted, even if in the text of the story one could read about how it was actually weeks away, smaller than Trump claimed, and not actually full of gang members and terrorists. Half the battle in public debate is determining what gets defined as a problem that requires action to address, even if you still have to convince everyone that your solution is the better one.\n\nBut if you think the media failed in its handling of the issue, it\u2019s even more notable that, despite getting the coverage he wanted, Trump got the result he didn\u2019t. His voters didn\u2019t flock to the polls in numbers sufficient to beat back the blue wave. Suburban voters, likely turned off by him, handed Democrats one victory after another.\n\nThere are many reasons the immigration issue didn\u2019t work to Trump\u2019s advantage this year the way it did in 2016. But we\u2019ll get another test in 2020. When he runs for reelection, Trump will try once again to use hate and fear of immigrants to pull himself to victory. We can say that with confidence because, despite his party\u2019s midterm losses, there\u2019s no reason to think he has changed his views about what his base wants and what works for him \u2014 not to mention what he truly believes is best for the country.\n\nIf Trump has any bit of political genius, it\u2019s his ability to locate the worst in people \u2014 their fear, their envy, their resentments, their hatred \u2014 and stimulate it with a poisonous kind of adrenaline. This time, though, most voters recoiled in disgust at what he was doing. We\u2019ll see whether it happens again in two years.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe White House is in meltdown\n\nDan Crenshaw: SNL mocked my appearance.

From 2007 through 2016, it was about 56 feet per year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve basically been watching that coastline erode and collapse for a little more than a decade now,\u201d said Benjamin Jones of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, who has been studying the Drew Point site since 2007. Jones is lead author of a new study, aided by 25 colleagues from a host of institutions in the United States and Germany, documenting a decade\u2019s worth of changes at this site located between Utqia\u0121vik (previously Barrow), the northernmost U.S. city, and Prudhoe Bay.\n\nThe study at Drew Point, where shallow waters offshore are fronted by 16-foot bluffs, is showing especially fast rates of erosion and may hint that much of the coastline encircling the Arctic could be undergoing similar, if not quite as rapid, changes \u2014 even if they are unknown and unrecorded.\n\nJones provided The Washington Post with daily camera images showing a typical spring-to-summer progression at the site, from late April through early September of this year. In the images, you can watch as the landscape thaws, the sea ice clears, and then the bluffs start collapsing into the sea \u2014 in this case, dragging along with them a data logger and buoy that the scientists had installed to take readings.\n\n\u201cThat small buoy, when it did fall into the ocean, it was able to maintain float, and I was able to retrieve it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first such time-lapse video taken at Drew Point, a site that makes such a presentation almost irresistible \u2014 but it comes as the new research affirmed a speedup of losses over the past decade.\n\nJones and his colleagues, in their new study in Environmental Research Letters, calculate that the coast, on average, is retreating inland by 56 feet per year, or just less than 20 yards. That\u2019s 2.5 times the prior measured rates.\n\nIn the most extreme year, 2016, the coast retreated by an average of 72 feet. Most strikingly, all of this is occurring during a relatively narrow window of roughly 90 days, or the open-water season, when the coast is beset by waves. The length of the open-water season has also doubled in recent decades.\n\nCalculating the consequences over a 5\u00bd-mile stretch of coastline, Jones said means that about 30 football fields are being lost annually and that about 300 were lost in total between 2007 and 2016.\n\nFew other stretches of Arctic coastline are being watched in the same way. Jones estimates that only 1 to 2 percent of Arctic coastlines have been surveyed to study how much they are eroding, and few to the extent that Drew Point has been.\n\nYet vulnerable permafrost \u2014 the reason for what\u2019s happening at Drew Point \u2014 is present across the Arctic.\n\nThe bluffs at Drew Point are composed of a mixture of frozen soil and thick wedges of ice. They are very sensitive to temperature \u2014 and both the air and the sea alike in this location have been getting warmer.\n\nPerhaps more important, though, is that with the retreat of Arctic sea ice, the period of open water offshore, when waves can break free from winter ice, is getting longer. This allows waves to slam into the coast, the most immediate trigger of the loss of land.\n\n\u201cBringing the level of the sea up to the base of the bluff eats away at the base of the ice-rich permafrost, eroding it both thermally and mechanically,\u201d Jones said.\n\nNobody lives at Drew Point, but the loss of sea ice, and the resulting increase in waves, has been a threat to a number of Arctic communities. That includes tiny Kivalina, on the coast of the Chukchi Sea, which is seeking to relocate because waves threaten the barrier island where the community sits.\n\nThe Drew Point site presents an interesting contrast with another place in the United States that is also losing land rapidly \u2014 but for very different reasons. That\u2019s the Louisiana Gulf Coast, where wetland loss rates of late have amounted to a football field every 100 minutes.\n\nBut there are massive differences, notes Torbjorn Tornqvist, a coastal geologist at Tulane University who studies the region.\n\nThe Louisiana coast has been studied for more than half a century, Tornqvist explained, and the causes of change include sea-level rise, land subsidence, dams and other obstructions that sap sediment from the Mississippi River, destruction of wetlands for canals, oil and gas projects, and more.\n\nIn contrast, much of the Alaska coastline has no infrastructure, and rising seas are not really the big issue \u2014 it\u2019s all about warming and the retreat of ice, followed by the punishing waves.\n\n\u201cA system like this is potentially even more sensitive to climate change, compared to lower-latitude coasts like Louisiana,\u201d Tornqvist said. \u201cIt strikes me that just temperature change alone can be a huge factor here due to the destabilizing effect of thawing permafrost. Put differently, even without sea-level rise, coastlines like these might exhibit accelerated rates of retreat.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ann Hornaday", "title": "The Gary Hart movie is here, revisiting a political scandal that now seems quaint", "description": "\u201cThe Front Runner\u201d chronicles the three weeks in 1987 that turned a presidential candidate into tabloid roadkill.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-gary-hart-movie-is-here-revisiting-a-political-scandal-that-now-seems-quaint/2018/11/14/b3906fa6-e2c9-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/duFivur2ZfyG522PG9dC5Fw3nYc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SPLB7XDW4I6RN2ZHWEKLTU6DE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:44:34Z", "content": "Rating: The Front Runner chronicles 21 tumultuous days in 1987 when the worlds of politics, journalism and entertainment tilted on their respective axes, a seismic shift in priorities and protocol that converged on one man.

Gary Hart, a former U.S. senator from Colorado, who had narrowly missed running for president in 1984, was preparing another campaign in the spring of 1987, this time with the wind at his back and the polls in his favor.\n\nAs a title card says at the beginning of this perceptive, carefully calibrated drama, a lot can happen in three weeks. Adapted by Jason Reitman from Matt Bai\u2019s book \u201cAll the Truth Is Out,\u201d \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d plunges viewers headlong into the bewildering jumble of entitlement, idealism, unintended consequences and still-unresolved issues that transformed Hart from a high-minded statesman to tabloid roadkill with dizzying speed.\n\nThis is a movie that intends to raise far more troubling questions than it answers, encouraging the audience to emerge from the story, not with a reassuring sense of certainty but rather the disquieting notion that even solid moral reasoning can incur a grievous cost. Most confoundingly, it sheds no light on Hart himself: a man who steadfastly insisted on maintaining his privacy, whose impressive intellect was couched within an aloof, withholding persona, remains a cipher, the missing core of a movie that\u2019s nominally about him, but can\u2019t seem to get a bead on its own protagonist.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\nThat makes \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d less of an emotional than a mental exercise, albeit an engaging and provocative one. Adopting a style reminiscent of Robert Altman, as well as Michael Ritchie\u2019s \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d Reitman has designed his movie to be an intensely subjective swirl of voices, points of view and densely layered perspectives. Reitman isn\u2019t as interested in Hart \u2014 played in an awkward, subdued performance by Hugh Jackman \u2014 as the vortex of activity around him: the cadre of young advisers and volunteers marshaled by campaign manager Bill Dixon (J.K. Simmons), the gaggle of reporters Hart leads to Red Rocks to announce his \u201ccampaign of ideas,\u201d the serene cabin in Troublesome Gulch where he lives with his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga), and their kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if the marriage has always been ideal: The Harts have been separated before, and when the candidate makes a last-minute decision to cancel a trip to the Kentucky Derby to join a swampy Southern fixer named Billy Broadhurst for some R & R in Florida, no alarm bells go off. But when reporters at the Miami Herald receive a tip that Hart embarked on an affair on a trip to Bimini, then stake out the candidate\u2019s Washington townhouse for proof, a high-speed disaster ensues. Hart \u2014 equal parts arrogant and naive \u2014 tries to brazen it out thinking that the old rules will apply. Meanwhile, a new form of TV infotainment feasts on a telegenic scandal, white-shoe newspapers find themselves playing catch-up in unsavory games of innuendo, the Hart campaign implodes and the name Donna Rice becomes inextricably tied to her era\u2019s biggest \u201czipper story.\u201d\n\n[Politician\u2019s sex lives used to be off limits. One scandal changed everything.]\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman stars as Gary Hart in \u201cThe Front Runner.\u201d (Sony Pictures Entertainment)\n\nReitman visits each of these strands of the story in a breathless relay, one minute eavesdropping on Hart\u2019s press corps as they weigh whether to pursue the womanizing rumors, then following the fictionalized Washington Post reporter A.J. Parker (Mamoudou Athie) back to meet with his editors to debate whether such salacious gossip is worthy of the paper that broke Watergate. Back in Colorado, a young campaign aide named Joe Trippi (Oliver Cooper) tries to help Lee and the Harts\u2019 daughter fend off the camera crews camped in their front yard, while a female counterpart in Washington, played in a sympathetic performance by Molly Ephraim, is assigned to \u201cmanage\u201d Rice, who despite her intelligence has been reduced to being a bimbo quickly discarded by Hart and his handlers.\n\nPlayed by Sara Paxton through dramatic cascades of mascara tears, Rice emerges as a smart, capable, genuinely wounded party in \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d which clearly sees her as the victim of both a ruthless male-centric campaign and a hypocritical media culture that has since metastasized to grotesque levels. (Reitman is particularly adroit in staging the moment when Hart meets Rice on the fatally named boat, Monkey Business: We don\u2019t hear what is said; the camera simply observes as Hart\u2019s face lights up while deafening music plays, then cuts to a long shot of the boat bobbing quietly on the water, reinforcing the episode\u2019s essential unknowability.)\n\nTrue to its multifaceted form, \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d is careful to give everyone, especially women, their say about male politicians being held accountable after decades of good-ol\u2019-boy courtesy and cozying up. But Reitman and Bai leave plenty of room for doubt, including the infamous back door through which Hart insisted Rice leave on the night the Herald spied on him. Although \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d was finished long before recent accusations came to light that Broadhurst set Hart up with Rice at the behest of George H.W. Bush campaign consultant Lee Atwater, the openwork of the narrative easily accommodates that possibility.\n\nMost profoundly, the filmmakers put Hart\u2019s story squarely in the context of the present, when the norms and traditions that were evolving in 1987 now seem like the quaint artifacts of an era supplanted by a vicious double helix of personal destruction and shamelessness. At one point, Hart bitterly predicted that if media and politics continued apace, the American people would eventually get the leaders we deserve. One can conclude many things from \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d: that Hart was his own worst enemy, that he was haughty and hubristic and fatally out of touch with the times. But, at least in that particular instance of foresight, it\u2019s impossible to say he was wrong."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CleveWootson", "title": "Raccoons drunk on crab apples cause false rabies scare in West Virginia - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Raccoons drunk on crab apples cause false rabies scare in West Virginia Washington Post Rabid animals are, of course, no laughing matter.

The rabies virus can infect the central nervous system, resulting in disease and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that happens after a host of increasingly scary symptoms: partial paralysis, agitation, hallucinations, hydrophobia. A British man and two children died in Morocco after they were bitten by a rabid cat.\n\nSo it was not surprising that when people in the city of Milton, W.Va., saw raccoons behaving weirdly, they involved the local police.\n\nOfficers staked out the area where the suspect animals were hanging out, looking for any signs of the masked perpetrators.\n\nBut when they caught two of them, they realized they were dealing with a different kind of issue.\n\nThe raccoons weren\u2019t rabid.

The end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. (Eraldo Peres, File/Associated Press)\n\nHAVANA \u2014 Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.\n\nThe end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state\u2019s \u201cinternational missions.\u201d Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\u201cMas Medicos\u201d started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \u201cMas Medicos\u201d was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cCubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\u201d Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuch humane acts should be respected and defended.\u201d\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island\u2019s public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba\u2019s most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is slave labor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be accomplices.\u201d\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro\u2019s conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\u201d the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can\u2019t keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Jeff Flake said Wednesday that he would not vote for any more of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees until the Senate votes on a bill to prevent special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from being fired \u2014 a pledge that could complicate Republicans\u2019 hope to confirm dozens of conservative judges before the end of the year.\n\nFlake\u2019s warning will likely force Republicans \u2014 who hold 51 seats in the Senate \u2014 to rely on Vice President Pence to confirm any of the 32 judicial nominees pending before the full Senate, as Democrats have little incentive to support those who Flake has committed to oppose. It also means that Republicans will likely have to go around the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Flake is a member and the GOP has only a one-seat majority, to advance any of the 21 nominees waiting for that panel\u2019s endorsement. That also will require Pence\u2019s tie-breaking vote.\n\nFlake issued his threat after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked Flake and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) from holding a vote on the bill, which would give any fired special counsel the ability to swiftly challenge their termination before a panel of three federal judges. Most Republicans \u2014 including co-authors Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 have argued that the bill is unnecessary because Trump would never dare fire Mueller, whose ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election has sought to learn whether anyone in Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with those efforts.\n\nFlake challenged that rationale, given Trump\u2019s recent decision to appoint Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general and give him oversight of the Mueller probe.\n\nWhitaker has made past statements that are critical of the investigation. Flake said he believes Whitaker should recuse himself from the Russia probe, letting deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein reassume authority over it.\n\n\u201cThe president now has this investigation in his sights and we all know it,\u201d Flake said on the Senate floor Wednesday, emphatically asking his colleagues why they were content to allow a potential constitutional crisis to unfold.\n\n\u201cWhy? Why do we do this? To protect a man seemingly who is so incurious about what Russia did during the 2016 elections?\u201d Flake said, referring to Trump. \u201cWhy do we do that? Do we have no more institutional pride here?\u201d\n\nFlake, who is retiring at the end of the year, has become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics in Congress. His pledge to vote against Trump\u2019s judicial nominees unless the special counsel bill is voted on is the most concrete step he has yet taken to try to deny Trump something tangible, instead of just decry his actions on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cYou use what leverage you have,\u201d Flake told reporters, explaining why he made his threat. \u201cThis is a priority now.\u201d\n\n[Justice Dept. releases legal memo defending Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general]\n\nBy himself, Flake cannot completely foul up GOP leaders\u2019 plans to confirm more conservative judges this year. But he and Coons said they hope to convince other Republicans to join their effort. If one more Republican does, they and the Democrats would be able to prevent Trump from getting any additional judicial nominees confirmed in 2018 \u2014 a move that Flake guessed would at least send a strong message about the importance of the special counsel bill.\n\n\u201cWe are confident [the bill] would get 60 votes if given a vote,\u201d Coons told reporters. \u201cIt is time for us to move from speech to action.\u201d\n\nOne senator that Coons and Flake may target in the days ahead is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). Last week, she said that she thought the Senate should vote on the bill.\n\n\u201cSenate debate and passage of this bill would send a powerful message that Mr. Mueller must be able to complete his work unimpeded,\u201d Collins said in a statement, in which she also said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Whitaker\u2019s views on Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nEven if senators succeed in passing the bill, its fate in the House is uncertain. Though House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has defended Mueller\u2019s right to conduct his probe unimpeded, he has also determined that a bill to protect him is not necessary. Still more Republicans have charged that the legislation is unconstitutional, as it allows the courts to review the president\u2019s hiring and firing decisions, which are considered his purview.\n\nGiven those circumstances, the best chance of passing the bill this year is if senators manage to convince leaders to include it in must-pass legislation, such as the spending bill lawmakers need to approve early next month.\n\nIn the meantime, it is unclear whether Whitaker will indulge his previously stated desire to constrain Mueller\u2019s probe, or permit it to continue unrestricted.\n\nThis week, the state of Maryland filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Some legal experts have suggested that Whitaker, who was former attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, is ineligible for the top Justice Department job, even on an acting basis, because he was not confirmed by the Senate.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Justice Department issued a memo defending the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nThis is not the first time Flake has broken from his party to team up with Coons. Last month, the duo joined forces to push the Senate to demand an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations made against Brett M. Kavanaugh before voting on his nomination to the Supreme Court. In that instance, they succeeded.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Avi Selk", "title": "A BBC reporter replaced his Brexit analysis with exasperated noises and now he\u2019s a hero", "description": "\"To be quite honest, looking at things right now, I haven\u2019t got the foggiest idea what is going to happen in the coming weeks.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/14/bbc-reporter-replaced-his-brexit-analysis-with-exasperated-noises-now-hes-hero/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lebg5Eey7nYc2KeFpvXrqsea31A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V4YSWACNTBFJPGFYIUL6V2FMSM.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:11:15Z", "content": "Morning swept across the globe Monday, and as reliable as the sunrise itself, out came all the talking heads with all their predictions on all the worlds problems.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nThe Capital, a Maryland community newspaper where five employees were killed in June in a mass shooting, is pushing to unionize under the auspices of the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. The initiative, say staffers, is driven by low pay and a sense of alienation that comes with working as part of such a large corporation; the newspaper is a unit of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which is in turn part of Tribune Publishing.\n\n\u201cWashington-Baltimore News Guild will request voluntary recognition sometime this afternoon from Tribune,\u201d says Bruce Jett, the organizing consultant for the News Guild.\n\nThe Capital\u2019s unionization effort is part of a bigger campaign spanning three newsrooms and including the following titles: the Capital (Annapolis and Anne Arundel County); the Towson Times; the Catonsville Times; the Carroll County Times; the Aegis (Harford County); the Howard County Times; the Bowie-Blade News; the Crofton-West County Gazette; and the Maryland Gazette. According to Capital reporter Phil Davis, there are roughly 50 employees who would be represented by the Chesapeake News Guild. Thirty-six of them have stated their support to form a union, according to organizers. In September, the company voluntarily recognized the Tidewater Media Guild union, representing employees at the Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press.\n\nDanielle Ohl, a Capital reporter covering the city of Annapolis as well as the Naval Academy, says journalists are seeking a pipeline to people who make the decisions. \u201cThe issue is not necessarily working for The Capital. We all love the work we do. We all love our direct editors. \u2026 The issue is that sometimes they just don\u2019t have a say in what happens to us.\u201d A year ago, Ohl started at the Capital with a salary of $33,000 per year.\n\nUnion-organizing activity at the newspapers predated by several months the horrific June 28 attack allegedly committed by Jarrod Ramos, an area man who held a grudge against the Capital. Four journalists \u2014 Rob Hiaasen, 59; Wendi Winters, 65; Gerald Fischman, 61; and John McNamara, 56 \u2014 and sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34, died in the attack. When the gunman burst into the newspaper\u2019s Annapolis offices, Davis was in the newsroom and sought cover under a desk. He tweeted from the scene and later told the Baltimore Sun: \u201cI\u2019m a police reporter. I write about this stuff \u2014 not necessarily to this extent, but shootings and death \u2014 all the time. But as much as I\u2019m going to try to articulate how traumatizing it is to be hiding under your desk, you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re there and you feel helpless.\u201d\n\nThe journalism world rallied around the survivors and the families of the fallen. The Michael and Jackie Ferro Foundation \u2014 named in part after the former chairman of Tronc, the ill-advised and short-lived alt-name of Tribune Publishing \u2014 contributed $1 million to the Capital Gazette Families Fund. Ohl credits the company\u2019s brass for their compassion and leadership.\n\nThough the trauma delayed the surviving staffers\u2019 union drive, it didn\u2019t change the workplace fundamentals. \u201cWhat you saw after the shooting was that no one wanted it to stop,\u201d says Davis, referring to the union drive. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we\u2019d wake up the next day and they would be paying us more money,\u201d he continues, acknowledging that that\u2019s a \u201cmorbid way of putting it.\u201d\n\nMorbid, yet accurate. Davis earns $35,000, in a major metropolitan area with high housing costs, and can\u2019t be sure when or if a raise is in the pipeline. There are no step increases in the current system, just merit and seniority raises, he says. Salaries as high as $40,000 are rare at the newspaper, says the 23-year-old Ohl, noting that it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to have put in 15 to 20 years while still drawing pay in the $30,000 ballpark. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother concern is hierarchy. Directives from Tribune Publishing, say employees, routinely come in for emergency landings on the desks of the community reporters. Just last week, for instance, the Virginian-Pilot reported that Tribune Publishing would be offering buyouts to certain non-union employees. The rationale for the move stunned staffers at the Capital: \u201cDuring its third-quarter conference call, the company said it recorded a net loss of $4.2 million in the three months ending Sept. 30, all of it attributable to newsprint tariff costs that have since been rescinded and costs following the June 28 fatal shooting of five members of the company\u2019s The Capital newsroom in Annapolis,\u201d reported the Virginian-Pilot. A press release on the company\u2019s financials contained this line: \u201cAdjusted EBITDA for third quarter 2018 was $16.6 million, versus $20.1 million in the third quarter 2017. The decline is primarily due to higher newsprint pricing related to the recently rescinded tariffs, as well as the financial impact from the Capital Gazette tragedy.\u201d Justin Dearborn, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is quoted in the release saying, \u201cDespite the industry headwinds and the after-effects of the Capital Gazette tragedy, we performed well in the quarter and continue to establish the infrastructure for long-term success.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a lot of people, the Tribune was saying, \u2018Oh, we had this unavoidable tragedy, so we couldn\u2019t make any money,'\u201d says Cody Boteler, 23, a reporter for the Catonsville Times and the Arbutus Times. Says Ohl: \u201cIt was very emotional for us, finding that out and reading that report.\u201d\n\nAccording to Libby Solomon, a 24-year-old reporter at the Towson Times, she and her colleagues on the community beat tend to be under 26, so they can get health insurance under their parents\u2019 plans. There are four news reporter positions in Solomon\u2019s newsroom, and she has seen those positions turn over seven times in less than two years. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the communities we cover deserve to be a stop on the road to better things,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nWhen community reporters come on board at the company, says Solomon, there\u2019s an \u201cimplication\u201d that the post may be a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to bigger things, considering that Tribune Publishing houses titles such as the Baltimore Sun, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune and others. Yet mentorships don\u2019t happen, say employees. The company has an unwritten rule barring significant professional consultation between community news reporters and Baltimore Sun editorial types. \u201cThere have been people who have said, \u2018I want to be mentored by someone,\u2019 and they\u2019ve said no,\u201d says Solomon.\n\nA possible rationale for the barrier: The Washington-Baltimore News Guild has a unit of 109 employees at the Baltimore Sun; if the distinctions between Baltimore Sun journalists and the community journalists were to disappear, the union might well be justified in seeking to expand the bargaining unit. \u201cThat\u2019s just our assumption,\u201d says Scott Dance, chair of the Baltimore Sun\u2019s bargaining unit. \u201cIt\u2019s not our rule, it\u2019s their rule. They don\u2019t want the nonunion staff intermingling with us. \u2026 We\u2019ve always thought it didn\u2019t make sense how they kept it so separate, and these reporters are doing the duties that our suburban unionized bureaus once did.\u201d\n\nThe setup is sufficiently Byzantine that if the Baltimore Sun needs a quote or another reportorial nugget from a community reporter, she has to channel it through her editor, who then contacts an editor at the community newspaper, who then passes it along to the community reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s very inefficient. It has led to inaccuracies, for sure,\u201d says Dance. For example: If Dance is working on a big story about a crippling blizzard, he can take feeds from Baltimore Sun reporters and seek clarifications and amplifications directly from those colleagues. If the feed, however, comes from a community reporter, he faces bureaucracy. \u201cWe have to go through this whole process,\u201d he says.\n\nAs reported by the Chicago Tribune, the company is evaluating at least three bids to buy the publishing giant. Newspaper chain McClatchy is among the suitors. Whoever ends up with the assets will have a team of motivated community reporters. \u201cI want this company to succeed and I want the news that we put out to succeed,\u201d says Solomon in explaining why she has sunk her spare time in to the organizing effort.\n\nRead more:\n\nAn attack on journalism itself\n\nThis attack is just the latest blow against local journalism\n\nThe Capital Gazette is the Annapolis community"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Felicia Sonmez", "title": "House Republicans elect Rep.

Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) ascended to the top job in House Republican leadership Wednesday, while Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) followed in her father\u2019s footsteps by taking the party\u2019s No. 3 spot.\n\nMcCarthy prevailed over Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), 159 to 43, according to the House press gallery, while Cheney was elected by voice vote.\n\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is stepping down at the end of his term in January. That opened up the top leadership spot, which \u2014 after the party lost its House majority in last week\u2019s midterm election \u2014 will be minority leader.\n\n\u201cWe took a beating inside the suburban areas. We\u2019re going to have to work harder,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference following Wednesday\u2019s vote, acknowledging Republican losses.\n\nHe also partially blamed the GOP defeat on former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who spent more than $110 million in support of Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy and Jordan, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, had announced their bids for the minority leader position. McCarthy, who currently serves in the No. 2 spot as House majority leader, made a bid for speaker in 2015 but stepped aside amid pressure from conservatives. With Ryan\u2019s backing \u2014 as well as a close relationship with President Trump \u2014 McCarthy triumphed over Jordan.\n\nThe California Republican has leveraged his alliance with Trump to his advantage on Capitol Hill, where the president looms large over the House GOP conference. Trump has referred to McCarthy as \u201cmy Kevin\u201d since before his inauguration, and McCarthy has at times gone to great lengths to curry favor with Trump, both through legislation \u2014 such as by introducing a bill that would appropriate more than $23 billion to Trump\u2019s plans for a U.S.-Mexico border wall \u2014 and other means, such as sending the president his favorite candies.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s news conference, McCarthy accused Democrats of having an agenda focused principally on investigating \u2014 and potentially impeaching \u2014 Trump. House Democrats have signaled in recent days that they plan to aggressively probe the actions of the executive branch, although they have resisted calls by activists to immediately impeach the president.\n\nMcCarthy also claimed that Bloomberg, who is mulling a 2020 presidential bid, had specifically targeted female Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cHe focused on women who were Republican, and unfortunately, a lot of races became close. . . . I think that is wrong that someone picked upon gender,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHe later clarified his remarks, saying that Bloomberg \u201cpicked against Republicans, but he spent a great deal amount of money against Republican women.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy had come under fire last month for a tweet in which he contended that Bloomberg, environmentalist Tom Steyer and philanthropist George Soros were trying to \u201cBUY the election!\u201d McCarthy later deleted the tweet, which came around the same time that prominent Democrats, including Steyer and Soros, were being targeted by mail bombs.\n\nThe No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed Wednesday by Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. Scalise had considered challenging McCarthy but announced last week that he was pursuing the minority whip spot instead.\n\nCheney, who first won election in 2016 and is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney, won the No. 3 spot of House Republican Conference chair. She made her bid for the spot on Nov. 7 with a letter to colleagues in which she criticized Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), who has held the position for three terms. McMorris Rodgers announced the next day that she was stepping aside from her leadership role and seeking to climb the ranks of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe elder Cheney, who served as GOP conference chair from 1987 to 1989, was present for Wednesday\u2019s vote for his daughter.\n\n\u201cHe told me not to screw it up,\u201d Liz Cheney told reporters with a laugh Wednesday afternoon when asked what advice she received from her father.\n\nJohn Wagner contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The Latest: Pro-Brexit Conservatives mull challenging May - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Latest: Pro-Brexit Conservatives mull challenging May Washington Post LONDON \u2014 The Latest on Brexit negotiations (all times local):. 6:50 p.m..

The required number currently stands at 48 lawmakers, and only Graham Brady, the keeper of the letters, knows for sure how many have been submitted.\n\nSome lawmakers who previously said they wanted May to change course now suggest they want a new leader.

Pro-Brexit politicians are already attacking it, saying it will bind Britain to EU rules and regulations long after it leaves the bloc in March.\n\nMay said the Cabinet would decide what to do \u201cin the national interest.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:30 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is set to face her divided Cabinet in a bid to win support for a draft Brexit deal with the European Union.\n\nNegotiators from the two sides have reached agreement on divorce terms, including a plan to resolve the key issue of the Irish border.\n\nBut pro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s divided Conservative Party are angry, saying the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs in March. Failure to secure Cabinet backing will leave May\u2019s leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos.\n\nIf Cabinet supports the deal Wednesday, it needs approval from the EU at a summit in the next few weeks. Then May will need to win backing from Parliament, where pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\n. \u2014 Pfc. Jordan Wilson and Alexis Espinoza Padilla stood 500 miles apart in separate worlds, and yet undeniably were linked by practical and geopolitical forces.\n\nWilson, 25, and his fellow U.S. soldiers worked in the shadow of the Brownsville and Matamoros International Bridge crossing into Mexico, stretching out 50-foot rolls of barbed concertina wire with a metallic jangle near the banks of the Rio Grande on Sunday afternoon. His green camouflage uniform, helmet, body armor, protective glasses and thick gloves were required by commanders, even if he was working stateside. Just a block away, civilians walked to a Dollar General discount store.\n\nA few hours earlier, Espinoza Padilla, 23, fiddled with a cord connecting his cellphone to a solar-powered battery pack on the outskirts of Santiago de Queretaro in central Mexico. He wore a sweater and had pulled his cap down low to protect him from the sun while waiting for a ride in a truck heading north.\n\nThe two 20-somethings are at the center of an issue that could percolate for weeks: the potential arrival of a caravan of thousands of migrants at the U.S. border at a single location and the military\u2019s possible role in dealing with it.\n\nThe Trump administration has dispatched more than 5,900 active-duty troops to the border to buttress U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents processing asylum claims. Federal law and Pentagon policy limit the scope of what the troops can do, although the military has said they could be asked to fly CBP officers in helicopters to less-secure parts of the border if the caravan attempts to enter the country there.\n\nThe first group of migrants, meanwhile, decided last week to turn west toward Tijuana and began arriving there Tuesday. They numbered a few hundred on Wednesday. They could disperse into smaller groups, but other caravan groups are still farther away in Mexico and it is unclear where they will go.\n\nOn the border, U.S. service members are expected to cede all law enforcement missions to the Department of Homeland Security, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act and Pentagon regulations.\n\nBut some sort of significant encounter remains a possibility, even as Wilson and some of his fellow soldiers struggle with how to characterize their mission.\n\n\u201cThis will kind of be like my deployment here, if you call it that,\u201d said Wilson, who has been in the Army less than two yearsand has not yet been overseas.\n\nAsked what he would call it, he said he wasn\u2019t sure, but would do his job to the best of his ability.\n\n\u201cI shrug,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nWire, the mission's motif\n\nIn Texas, images of soldiers stringing concertina wire emerged just before the midterm elections and have become the main motif of the mission. More than 150 miles are available, military officials have said. The Pentagon initially called the operation Faithful Patriot, but disclosed just after the election that it had stripped it of that name amid complaints that it had partisan overtones. The military now simply refers to operations as \u201cborder support,\u201d and plans to send the troops home by Dec. 15.\n\n\n\nA group of Salvadorans jump over the fence on the border between Guatemala and Mexico in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, on Nov. 2, 2018. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)\n\nWilson, of the 887th Engineer Support Company of Fort Campbell, Ky., and his fellow soldiers arrived in Brownsville last week to string the wire between the Matamoros bridge and the Gateway International Bridge, less than a mile northeast. CBP officials said they once found a hole cut in the chain-link fence near the Dollar General, Wilson said, presumably allowing someone to slip into Brownsville.\n\nIn response, the Army delivered scores of wooden pallets stacked with concertina. Halfway through the one-mile task, more than 40 of the 50-foot rolls were stacked on each pallet. Wilson looked on as soldiers put about a dozen pallets at a time on a 10-wheel flatbed truck and drove it from a CBP parking lot down a hill that was covered in scrub brush and dying castor bean plants. They parked it on a sandy bank near the Rio Grande.\n\nThere, the troops pulled the pallets off the truck on skids, broke them down and got to work.\n\n\u201cI bet you five bucks we have to take all this down in a few weeks,\u201d one soldier said to a friend while they tied wire. The fellow soldier scoffed at him.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, the CBP said the issue is not yet settled.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited soldiers at the border in Texas on Wednesday. When one asked whether the Army would have to remove the wire, Mattis said: \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nSelling smokes to buy a phone\n\n\n\nSoldiers put up concertina wire on a border fence near the Brownsville and Matamoros Express International Bridge.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe issue was a long way from Espinoza Padilla\u2019s reality in Mexico.\n\nHe and his father left their home in Honduras in fear of the malevolent reach of the MS-13 street gang, which had killed his cousin. Two sisters in Texas, both undocumented, told him he could go back to Honduras but that it was worth trying to reach the United States, he said.\n\nStanding near a highway toll booth Sunday, he prepared to shift west, toward the city of Irapuato, and eventually California. His father, in a red baseball cap, a tan jacket and jeans, wore a yellow wristband from Mexico City, where officials had tried to count a group that seemed uncountable, as nobody one stayed still for long.\n\nEspinoza Padilla said he left home without a phone, but bought one on the road using money he and his father made by selling cigarettes for a peso each \u2014 more when people were stressed out. He used the phone to talk to his mother in Honduras and his sisters, at least when he found enough power to do so.\n\nEspinoza Padilla had tried to travel to the United States before, but was deported by Mexican immigration agents, he said. He was trying again now, hoping to reach an official port of entry to apply for asylum and make his case why he should be allowed to stay. He had heard that the border was now lined with armed police, but said he had faith that God would protect him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re peaceful, so we want to see whether they give us refugee status,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it depends on what the judge says \u2014 or at least that\u2019s what they told us here in Mexico.\u201d\n\nWatching the watchers\n\n\n\nSoldiers play cards in their tent at the military base camp Donna along the Mexican border in Donna, Texas on Nov. 10, 2018.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nBack in Brownsville, Staff Sgt. Javone Somersall scanned the surrounding area for potential threats. Somersall, a military policeman from the 287th Military Police Company at Fort Riley in Kansas, carried a holstered 9mm M9 pistol. It was light weaponry as military work goes \u2014 only the MPs were armed, and none had a rifle.\n\nSomersall had deployed three times to Iraq during a career that started as the United States invaded there more than 15 years ago. Now he was watching the muddy Rio Grande for any crossings from the Mexico side. None had occurred in the last week, but soldiers reported to law enforcement an instance of being watched from the other side of the river, he said.\n\nMigrants on the bridge also glanced over the edge at the troops below, while a few Border Patrol agents posted on the bridge watched the migrants.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while we make eye contact and let them know we\u2019re coming through,\u201d Somersall said of the Border Patrol.\n\n\n\nIn Mexico, Veronica Georgina Trochez Castellano and her 14-year-old son prepared to stay the night at the government center in Irapuato. She said she left Santa Cruz, Honduras, last month after her son was nearly recruited by a gang to be a \u201cbanderin,\u201d a neighborhood lookout.\n\nTraveling with nine others seemed like the best way for Trochez Castellano and her son to stay safe, she reasoned. The mother-son pair have lost track of the others for days at a time, only to find them again.\n\nTrochez Castellano was worried about her son, but also imagined a better life for herself in the United States in which she would be able to buy some land of her own.\n\n\u201cAt 43, there\u2019s no way I can find work, and the government in Honduras is miserable,\u201d she said.\n\nTrochez Castellano had laid out her cot alongside a fence outside the government center, wedged between a 31-year-old fish farmer and an elderly man, who peeked out of his makeshift tent only to peel an orange.\n\nIn the afternoon, Trochez Castellano tied the edges of a blanket to a fence and huddled underneath to avoid the sun. As night fell, the blanket would protect her from the cold. It was not as good as the tents that other people carried. But it would have to suffice.\n\n\n\nSoldiers nap in a tent at the military base camp Donna along the Mexican border in Donna, Tex., on Nov. 10, 2018.

(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Back with the United States for only the second time in an injury-troubled year, Christian Pulisic has watched the Americans rebuild from afar after their failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\u201d the 20-year-old midfielder said ahead of Thursday\u2019s friendly against England. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because I\u2019m not a very vocal guy, not super outgoing. But I think the biggest thing I can do is lead by example. I want to show these guys how it\u2019s done on a professional level.\u201d\n\nPulisic is talking like a veteran and yet only debuted in March 2016. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, native has 21 appearances and nine goals, the last in the 2-1 loss at Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ended the American\u2019s streak of seven straight World Cups. Pulisic\u2019s only appearance since has been in a friendly against Bolivia in May.\n\nHis focus has been getting playing time at Borussia Dortmund, a task frustrated by injuries. Pulisic didn\u2019t even make the bench Saturday when Dortmund beat Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich 3-2 to stay atop the standings. Pulisic confirmed he was \u201c100 percent\u201d fit last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I had some injuries going on and off, and I got some games that I missed out,\u201d Pulisic he said Wednesday. \u201cWe have a great team this year. I want to be on the field just like everyone else does.\u201d\n\nPulisic inherited Landon Donovan\u2019s No. 10 jersey and his importance to the U.S. team.\n\nThe burden of pressure, too, at a young age, much like Wayne Rooney experienced with England. Now 33 and finishing his career in Major League Soccer, the D.C. United striker is making a one-off England return after a two-year absence and will make his 120th appearances.\n\n\u201cI can definitely look up to a guy like that,\u201d Pulisic said of Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion with Manchester United.\n\nRooney was part of an England \u201cgolden generation\u201d that failed to live up to the hype. With a more low-key approach and most players unscarred by past setbacks, England in July unexpectedly reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration for us,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe definitely feel that with the young side that we can we can also do something like that. That\u2019s the goal for us.\u201d\n\nPulisic has spoken with new U.S. team general manager Earnie Stewart, who says he will hire the next U.S. coach later this year, putting the new regime in place ahead of next year\u2019s CONCACAF Gold Cup. After that will be qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Pulisic figures to be in the prime of his career when the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe American midfield of the future could be on the field together for the first time at Wembley: Pulisic, 19-year-old Tyler Adams and 20-year-old Weston McKennie, perhaps joined by Tim Weah, the 18-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year \u2014 and current Liberia president \u2014 George Weah.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of brave young players and guys who aren\u2019t afraid to come in and show us what they know about the game,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cGuys can\u2019t come in to be shy and expect us to kind of show them the ropes. They\u2019ve got to come in and they\u2019ve got to show what they can do it and be competent with it.\u201d\n\nPulisic is friends with McKennie, also based in Germany. Adams is expected to move there, too, this winter, leaving MLS\u2019s New York Red Bulls for sister club RB Leipzig.\n\n\u201cWe want to help out the young guys ... as much as we can,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe also still have a lot to learn.\u201d\n\nPlaying in Germany helps.\n\n\u201cThe Bundesliga has been a great platform,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cThey trust their young players, and Dortmund has been an unbelievable start to my career.\u201d\n\nInevitably when visiting England, talk will turn to whether Pulisic envisages a move to the Premier League.

(Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Back with the United States for only the second time in an injury-troubled year, Christian Pulisic has watched the Americans rebuild from afar after their failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\u201d the 20-year-old midfielder said ahead of Thursday\u2019s friendly against England. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because I\u2019m not a very vocal guy, not super outgoing. But I think the biggest thing I can do is lead by example. I want to show these guys how it\u2019s done on a professional level.\u201d\n\nPulisic is talking like a veteran and yet only debuted in March 2016. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, native has 21 appearances and nine goals, the last in the 2-1 loss at Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ended the American\u2019s streak of seven straight World Cups. Pulisic\u2019s only appearance since has been in a friendly against Bolivia in May.\n\nHis focus has been getting playing time at Borussia Dortmund, a task frustrated by injuries. Pulisic didn\u2019t even make the bench Saturday when Dortmund beat Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich 3-2 to stay atop the standings. Pulisic confirmed he was \u201c100 percent\u201d fit last weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I had some injuries going on and off, and I got some games that I missed out,\u201d Pulisic he said Wednesday. \u201cWe have a great team this year. I want to be on the field just like everyone else does.\u201d\n\nPulisic inherited Landon Donovan\u2019s No. 10 jersey and his importance to the U.S. team.\n\nThe burden of pressure, too, at a young age, much like Wayne Rooney experienced with England. Now 33 and finishing his career in Major League Soccer, the D.C. United striker is making a one-off England return after a two-year absence and will make his 120th appearances.\n\n\u201cI can definitely look up to a guy like that,\u201d Pulisic said of Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion with Manchester United.\n\nRooney was part of an England \u201cgolden generation\u201d that failed to live up to the hype. With a more low-key approach and most players unscarred by past setbacks, England in July unexpectedly reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inspiration for us,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe definitely feel that with the young side that we can we can also do something like that. That\u2019s the goal for us.\u201d\n\nPulisic has spoken with new U.S. team general manager Earnie Stewart, who says he will hire the next U.S. coach later this year, putting the new regime in place ahead of next year\u2019s CONCACAF Gold Cup. After that will be qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Pulisic figures to be in the prime of his career when the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe American midfield of the future could be on the field together for the first time at Wembley: Pulisic, 19-year-old Tyler Adams and 20-year-old Weston McKennie, perhaps joined by Tim Weah, the 18-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year \u2014 and current Liberia president \u2014 George Weah.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of brave young players and guys who aren\u2019t afraid to come in and show us what they know about the game,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cGuys can\u2019t come in to be shy and expect us to kind of show them the ropes. They\u2019ve got to come in and they\u2019ve got to show what they can do it and be competent with it.\u201d\n\nPulisic is friends with McKennie, also based in Germany. Adams is expected to move there, too, this winter, leaving MLS\u2019s New York Red Bulls for sister club RB Leipzig.\n\n\u201cWe want to help out the young guys ... as much as we can,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cWe also still have a lot to learn.\u201d\n\nPlaying in Germany helps.\n\n\u201cThe Bundesliga has been a great platform,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cThey trust their young players, and Dortmund has been an unbelievable start to my career.\u201d\n\nInevitably when visiting England, talk will turn to whether Pulisic envisages a move to the Premier League. His Dortmund contract ends in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still enjoying every moment of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the time comes, that\u2019s when I have my talks my Dortmund and see what I want to do moving forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Officials in Palm Beach County faced problems with the counting machines themselves and have said they can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll be done Thursday.\n\nRepresentatives of both parties attended a \u201cwalk-through\u201d at the Broward elections office to prepare for the manual recount expected to follow in the very tight Senate race, in which Sen. Bill Nelson (D) trails Gov. Rick Scott (R) by fewer than 13,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast.\n\n[Read: How voter signatures took out outsized importance this year]\n\nA state judge in Hillsborough County ruled in Scott\u2019s favor to allow his campaign\u2019s monitors into the room where the recount is taking place. And Nelson\u2019s campaign, along with state Democrats, filed a new lawsuit requesting to inspect records in Bay County, where the election supervisor has said that in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he let voters submit ballots electronically, an apparent violation of state law.\n\nBoth campaigns were awaiting a court decision on Nelson\u2019s request to count absentee and provisional ballots that were not tallied because voters\u2019 signatures did not match their voter registration records. A five-hour hearing wrapped up Wednesday without an immediate decision.\n\nAnd more courtroom drama was coming Thursday: Hearings were scheduled in state court in Broward County in two lawsuits that Republicans filed against Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes, one of them over 25 ballots that were counted after the first unofficial returns were reported to the state.\n\nRepublicans ramped up their accusations of voter fraud against Democrats after the Department of State, which oversees elections in Florida, asked state law enforcement officials and federal prosecutors to investigate allegations that state Democrats sent incorrect voting instructions to mail-in voters in four counties.\n\nThe complaint includes examples of four voters who mailed in absentee ballots that lacked sufficient information and were sent follow-up affidavits. Instructions for completing the affidavits said the deadline was last Thursday, two days after the election; the actual deadline was last Monday, the day before the election.\n\nAt least three of the four voters affected were Democrats, according to their local election offices, so it\u2019s unclear why someone at the state Democratic Party would give them the wrong deadline or who altered the form.\n\nIt is also unclear how many voters received incorrect instructions or how many ballots went uncounted as a result. The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to a request for comment. But Republicans pounced, alleging that Democrats had intentionally encouraged voters to cast or fix ballots after Election Day in the hopes of persuading judges to count those votes.\n\n\u201cAfter all, an influx of Democratic voters trying to cast their ballots after the deadline could make it easier for Democrats and liberal groups to play games with the legal process and ultimately fight to change the law \u2014 just like they are doing right now,\u201d read an email distributed by the Scott campaign Wednesday.\n\nThe request appears to be the first time the department has flagged allegations of voting irregularities this year. The department has declined to call for an investigation in Bay County, a predominantly Republican part of Florida; Scott has also declined to weigh in on the situation.\n\nThe Senate race will determine the size of the GOP\u2019s majority in 2019 and shape the power structure in the nation\u2019s largest swing state. Together, the two sides have racked up at least 10 lawsuits trying to gain a legal advantage in the recount.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Walker presided over a tense hearing Wednesday in a Tallahassee courthouse but recessed without announcing a decision. Reporters and campaign officials packed three rows of seats inside the courtroom, while cameras were staked out in the rain.\n\nWalker seemed open to the possibility of allowing a new and limited window for voters to \u201ccure\u201d their rejected ballots. He reminded lawyers of how important even a limited number of votes could be.\n\n\u201cDo we just dismiss 500 votes? Because last time I checked, 500 votes determined the leader of the free world,\u201d Walker said, making a reference to the Florida recount in 2000 that led to the election of George W. Bush.\n\nRepublican attorneys argued that ruling in a way that would allow the counting of some ballots that were disqualified over signature mismatch would amount to a major disruption to a vote-tallying operation that has already been stretched to its limits.\n\nThere are nearly 3,700 vote-by-mail ballots that were set aside because of signature mismatch across 45 counties, according to a partial tally from state officials presented by one of the GOP attorneys. The count does not include 22 counties.\n\nBoth candidates, meanwhile, were in Washington on Wednesday. At a photo opportunity for new Republican senators, Scott declined to answer questions about whether he still thinks the vote count in Florida has been tainted by fraud.\n\nScott recused himself from a state commission that certifies the election results, as he did in 2014, when he ran for reelection. But the move is unlikely to satisfy Democrats, who have demanded that he remove himself from any decision-making in the state\u2019s administration of elections.\n\nAlthough Scott has been a vocal critic of Democrats during the recount, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis has been much quieter. DeSantis, a close ally of President Trump, has a more comfortable margin over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). Democrats and Republicans are not anticipating a hand recount in the governor\u2019s race. Votes also are being recounted in the race for state agriculture commissioner.\n\nReinhard reported from Lauderhill, Fla., and Gardner reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles from the border, but was moving hundreds of miles per day. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it\u2019s analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \u201cnot anywhere near right.\u201d He added that he believes, \u201cvery quickly we\u2019ll know the real cost. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\u201d\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa\u2019s troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\u201d he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \u201cback up\u201d Customs and Border Protection. \u201cRight now that\u2019s our role and that\u2019s all our role is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\u201d Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \u201cnon-traditional\u201d mission. \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\u201d he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \u201csomewhat to be determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in something like this,\u201d Mattis said, \u201cit\u2019s dynamic, it\u2019s unpredictable. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \u201cvery good training\u201d because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\u201cIn terms of readiness, it\u2019s actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ian Livingston/The Washington Post)\n\nWinter is fast approaching. And if you\u2019ve been following the forecast, you know wintry weather is approaching even faster.\n\nAs fall gives in to winter, and we see bouts of chillier and chillier weather in the weeks ahead, we\u2019ll be hearing more of the big wintertime buzzwords. Chief among them: snow, sleet and freezing rain.\n\nBut what\u2019s the difference between these wintry precipitation types? It all comes down to processes happening high up in the sky.\n\nSnow\n\nThe simplest form of wintry precipitation is snow, and it\u2019s the coolest. Snowflakes form when water vapor crystalizes on something like dust or pollen that makes its way into the atmosphere. From there, a six-sided ice crystal develops.\n\n\n\nMagnified snowflakes. (NOAA)\n\nYou can probably guess what the temperature profile is like \u2014 cold all the way down! No melting, no refreezing. Instead, a snowflake just has to delicately waft its way from the clouds to the ground.\n\nIt may surprise you, however, to know that it doesn\u2019t have to be freezing at ground level for it to snow. Flurries have been observed at temperatures as warm as 49 degrees. It can snow when it\u2019s above freezing when the warm layer near the ground is shallow and the air aloft is cold, and the flakes don\u2019t have a chance to melt.\n\nSleet\n\nSleet is a bit more of a wild card for forecasters.\n\n\n\nA typical sleet setup. (University of Illinois)\n\nStarting off as snow, sleet forms when this snow passes through a relatively shallow warm layer and partially melts. It then passes back into a deep layer of frozen air. In contrast, freezing rain, discussed below, doesn\u2019t have enough time to refreeze before hitting the surface, as sleet does.\n\nBecause of its melting and refreezing, sleet doesn\u2019t boast nearly as much of a \u201cfluff factor\u201d as snow. An inch\u2019s worth of rain might only stack up to three inches or so of sleet. For comparison, the same liquid equivalent might fall as eight to 12 inches of snow on average, with higher or lower ratios largely depending on the temperature.\n\nMost of the time when sleet falls, the surface temperature is very close to freezing. Sometimes the ground is just above that crucial threshold. Even then, thanks to the density of sleet, it might cause headaches as it takes time to melt. Sleet pellets and crushed-up granules can also deposit an icy film over the road, making it very easy to skid.\n\nBefore moving on, we must briefly address how sleet is not hail, since they are often confused.\n\nHail is formed in convective updrafts. That\u2019s when the rising air in a thunderstorm lofts water droplets high enough into the atmosphere to reach freezing temperatures \u2014 even in the steamy dog-days of summer. It\u2019s this vigorous upward motion that sustains the hailstone and allows it to grow bigger and bigger until it outweighs the force of the updraft. Although they are both balls of ice, sleet and hail are formed through considerably different processes.\n\nFreezing rain\n\nFreezing rain is perhaps the species of wintry precipitation most hated by forecasters and the public. It\u2019s challenging to predict, it is extremely dangerous, and it is quite finicky.\n\n\n\nSmall differences aloft can lead to many different precipitation types. (National Weather Service)\n\nFreezing rain is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 rain that freezes on contact. It typically begins as snow, then falls through a large enough warm layer to fully melt the snow. Unlike the air that creates sleet, the cold air nearest the ground is not thick enough to fully refreeze it. The rain instead becomes supercooled so it can more easily freeze on contact.\n\nFreezing rain is especially hazardous following cold-air outbreaks, when days of repeated freezing conditions permeate the soil and lower the ground temperature below 32 degrees. It then takes only small amounts to turn sidewalks and streets into treacherous sheets of ice.\n\nIce storms caused by freezing rain can be far more destructive than snowstorms because of the full weight of ice accumulating on all surfaces. Although it takes only a trace of ice to be a big problem, the worst freezing rain events can bring two to three inches or more of ice accretion. They can shut down entire communities for days and take down virtually every power line.\n\nGraupel\n\nGraupel is an oddball.\n\nIt looks a bit like sleet, but it\u2019s generally softer, larger and cloudier. Sometimes called snow grains or snow pellets, graupel starts as snow. In a process somewhat similar to hail formation, graupel develops as the snowflakes get \u201crimed\u201d and grow larger as additional ice builds on them as they are picked up by updrafts in a shower. Riming transforms your typical snowflake into something of a ball.\n\nLike sleet, graupel is relatively common in above-freezing conditions at the surface. It occurs when there is significant instability for the cool season, and it does tend to come in showery-type precipitation, or squalls along a front.\n\nKeep an eye to the sky\n\nNow you\u2019re better equipped to know what\u2019s falling from the sky and why. If you want to take the next step and become a citizen scientist, one thing you can do is grab the mPing app and start reporting when and where you see these wintry precipitation types falling.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Wes Junker contributed to this article."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sarah.kaplan.31", "title": "Signs of a 'super Earth' discovered around a nearby star - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Signs of a 'super Earth' discovered around a nearby star Washington Post Residents of the northern hemisphere, look up: In the faint light of the closest star in the night sky, astronomers have discovered evidence of an alien world.

The only stars closer are the triplet stars of the Alpha Centauri system, which is mainly visible in the southern sky.

It\u2019s just six light-years from our sun, and possibly twice as old. One of the main architects of exoplanet research, the astronomer Peter van de Kamp, proposed more than 50 years ago that this star could host a planet. In the 1970s, British astronomers studied the possibility of sending an uncrewed starship to probe the alien system \u2014 even though there wasn\u2019t any evidence a planet existed to be explored.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the first exoplanet discovery was confirmed in 1995 that the search for a world around Barnard\u2019s Star began in earnest.\n\nThis red dwarf is a 10th the mass of our sun and too faint to be seen with the naked eye. But its low mass makes it ideal for analysis using the radial velocity technique of exoplanet detection, which exploits the way a planet\u2019s gravitational pull makes a star wobble as it orbits around it.\n\nA slew of telescopes on three continents have set their sights on Barnard\u2019s Star, allowing researchers to accumulate some 800 observations over the course of 20 years. The study authors also drew on data collected by amateur astronomers.\n\nIt took the combined efforts of more than 50 researchers at some two dozen institutions, but \u201cslowly a signal in our data came out of all the noise,\u201d said astronomer Ignasi Ribas, who is director of the Institute of Space Studies in Catalonia, Spain, and the lead author of the Nature paper.\n\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s impression of the view from the surface of a planet orbiting Barnard's Star. (M. Kornmesser/European Southern Observatory)\n\nBarnard\u2019s Star\u2019s periodic wobble suggests it is circled by a large planet once every 233 days. Very few exoplanets have been found so far from their stars (planets with short orbital periods generate more frequent signals, making them easier to detect).\n\nBecause Barnard\u2019s Star is so dim, the planet\u2019s long orbital period puts it at the \u201csnow line,\u201d where sunlight is so faint that its surface is perpetually frozen. Its average surface temperature is possibly a brisk -150 degrees Celsius (-238 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThis puts the planet outside the traditional \u201chabitable zone,\u201d where conditions are thought to be ripe for life. But Teske pointed out that microbes are resilient creatures; if there is water on the planet and if other necessary ingredients are present, it\u2019s feasible that organisms might lurk in an ocean beneath the ice.\n\nYet much about the planet around Barnard\u2019s Star remains uncertain. Astronomers aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s rocky like Earth or built of gas and ice, like Neptune. They know it must be at least three times as massive as Earth, but it could be even larger.\n\nThey aren\u2019t even 100 percent certain the planet is there, Ribas noted. The research pushed the limits of the radial velocity detection technique, which becomes more difficult the farther a planet is from its star. Mathematical models suggest there is still a 0.8 percent chance that Barnard\u2019s Star\u2019s apparent wobble is caused by some other factor, like sunspots. For that reason, the exoplanet is deemed a \u201ccandidate,\u201d rather than a confirmed discovery.\n\n\u201cDifficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups,\u201d Rodrigo Diaz, an astronomer at the University of Buenos Aires who was not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary for Nature. But if it\u2019s confirmed, the \u201cremarkable planet\u201d would give \u201ca key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs NASA\u2019s prized telescopes falter, astronomers fear losing their eyes in space\n\nSo long, Kepler, and thanks for all the planets\n\nScientists think they\u2019ve found the first moon outside our solar system"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "California hasn\u2019t been this blue since the Civil War", "description": "Four states have more densely Democratic House delegations than at any point in at least 40 years.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/14/california-hasnt-been-this-blue-since-civil-war/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4kq2tArTB_CYoRDYBRWVz2juU7Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FN77TTXEQYI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:02:22Z", "content": "It is perhaps more apt to describe the results of the 2018 midterm elections not as a wave in favor of the Democrats but as a tsunami.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nThis article was updated on Nov. 15.\n\nIt is perhaps more apt to describe the results of the 2018 midterm elections not as a wave in favor of the Democrats but as a tsunami. Not because of scale, though the Democratic gains in the House were substantial, but because tsunamis build slowly and steadily, water pushing inland slowly covering ever more territory. A wave hits and crashes. A tsunami just keeps coming.\n\nThere are, as of writing, two House contests in California that have not yet been resolved. In both cases, the Republicans are in a tough position. Katie Porter (D) leads incumbent Rep. Mimi Walters (R) by a narrow margin. Young Kim (R) leads Gil Cisneros (D) \u2014 but the margins as votes are counted have favored Cisneros. Both Porter and Cisneros are favored to win by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIf or when they do, it will cap a remarkable stretch since polls closed Tuesday last week. Contested House races in California have been toppling in the Democrats' direction ever since. Even if Kim pulls out a victory in the 39th District, the Democrats will hold 44 of the state\u2019s 53 seats \u2014 83 percent of the total.\n\nThe last time Democrats held as high a percentage of California\u2019s House seats, the Civil War was raging. In fact, Democrats then held all of California\u2019s seats \u2014 or, put another way, both of them.\n\nUsing data compiled by MIT Election Data and Science Lab, we evaluated how much of each state\u2019s House delegation either party has held since 1976. The density of each party\u2019s control of seats after each election is shown from left to right. (Uncalled 2018 races are attributed to the currently leading party.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere are some interesting patterns in the graph above. You can see, for example, the trend in most Southern states away from the Democratic Party over the past 40 years. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s tenure as Vermont\u2019s sole representative stands out distinctly. Massachusetts\u2019s long record of electing solidly Democratic House delegations stands out, as well.\n\nOn Thursday, Maine\u2019s 2nd District was called for Democrat Jared Golden. That means that there are no longer any Republicans serving in the House in New England -- and only one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) -- serving in Congress from the region at all.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat\u2019s obscured a bit in the annual data above but revealed in that second map are how many states\u2019 House delegations are now as densely partisan as they\u2019ve been at any point in the past 40 years. In the most recent elections, 28 states elected representatives from each party who match the highest density of one party or the other since 1976. Four states \u2014 including California \u2014 set new highs in the dominance of the Democratic Party in their congressional representation.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHere, too, there are interesting patterns. This map mirrors, to a large extent, the safest presidential states in any given year for each party. One exception is Iowa, which is redder than this would suggest. (After the 1964 elections, Iowa was more solidly Democratic than it is now, with nearly twice as many representatives.) New York is bluer, but it had a higher peak of Democratic density a decade ago.\n\nThat only 19 states aren\u2019t at peak partisanship seems remarkable and apparently a natural reflection of the political moment. That four states are more partisan than at any point in the last 40 years itself seems remarkable.\n\nBut, then, this was a Democratic tsunami year, and Republican strongholds are still getting washed away."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Eugene Scott", "title": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s defense of Kavanaugh did not help the GOP with women voters", "description": "There was a blue wave during the midterms, and much of it can be attributed to the GOP\u2019s problem with women in the suburbs.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-fix/lindsey-grahams-defense-of-kavanaugh-did-not-help-the-gop-with-women-voters/2018/11/14/48b95625-2eac-494f-a502-9f36dcf9f218_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:51:51Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Women were expected to turn out in large numbers this midterm elections \u2014 and they did.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nA handful of prominent conservative and libertarian attorneys are banding together to form Checks and Balances, a group that grew from their need to publicly reaffirm the importance of the rule of law, which they feel is being threatened by the Trump administration.\n\nThe group, organized by George T. Conway III, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, rallies behind the notion that it is important for lawyers who see President Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional to speak up.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep-seated concern and uneasiness in conservative legal circles with the president\u2019s attacks on our institutions, including the press and the Department of Justice, and a belief that conservative lawyers are not speaking up enough,\u201d John B. Bellinger, top legal adviser for the State Department and National Security Council under President George W. Bush, told The Post.\n\nThis effort was intended to stimulate discussion among conservative lawyers around the country, particularly as the Federalist Society gathers for its annual conference in Washington on Thursday.\n\nHaving three functioning branches of government is the healthiest way for a democracy to work, said Marisa Maleck, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly attempted to consolidate the power of those branches himself, she said.\n\n\u201cThe worst part about it is that he normalizes it. Most people don\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing poses a threat to a constitutional democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a mission statement released Tuesday, the group wrote: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse. We believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power. We believe in \u2018a government of laws, not of men.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Checks and Balances roster also includes, among others, Tom Ridge, a former Pennsylvania governor and George W. Bush administration secretary of homeland security; professors Orinn Kerr and Jonathan Adler; Peter D. Keisler, acting attorney general in the Bush administration; and attorney Lori S. Meyer, who is married to Federalist Society President Eugene B. Meyer.\n\nMost, if not all, are active members of the Federalist Society and believe in limited judicial function, Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute and a former official in George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, told The Post.\n\nRosenzweig said the moment that triggered each person to join was different.\n\nFor him, it was Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s undermining of the free press. \u201cThe idea of bombs being sent to CNN and embracing a political representative who has actually assaulted the press doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d he said, referencing Trump\u2019s praise of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who assaulted a journalist last year. \u201cAll of us believe in conservative legal principles and in the need to stand up for them no matter who is the president.\u201d\n\nAdler cited his growing concern about how partisan lines are drawn. \u201cIn the current hyperpartisan environment, people are finding it challenging to criticize those seen as on their side,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members have pointed to Trump\u2019s ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nConway, the group organizer, said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any one thing; it\u2019s a long series of events that made me think that a group like this could do some good.\u201d\n\nConway has authored a series of articles attacking Trump\u2019s politics, most recently an opinion piece in the New York Times that called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d Conway wrote. He similarly called the president\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional.\n\nLawyer Alan Charles Raul, a top legal official in the Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations, said that what makes America great are constitutional values and rule-of-law norms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just count on that remaining strong and a shared value for all Americans if we don\u2019t speak up for them and show concern when we see them being challenged,\u201d he said.\n\nGroup members envision Checks and Balances taking on several concerns with the Trump administration. They include respect for the rule of law, constitutional principles that support freedom of expression, due process, and not politicizing any particular criminal prosecution.\n\nThey are unified in hoping that the group will provoke discussion among lawyers to ensure that attacks on American institutions do not become normal across the country.\n\nMaleck said that this is not the way American democracy should be functioning.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote, \u2018The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBefore Trump does lasting damage, someone needs to say that enough is enough.

For many years they\u2019ve vilified her as the personification of a liberal agenda. But Pelosi doesn\u2019t garner rave ratings from Democrats either.\n\nJust under 3 in 10 Democrats approve of Pelosi\u2019s job performance as the party\u2019s minority leader in the House, 29 percent, higher than the 16 percent who disapprove but dwarfed by a 55 percent majority who say they have no opinion of her efforts. Republicans are more decisive in their feelings about her, with 72 percent disapproving, 5 percent approving and 23 percent with no opinion.\n\nWhile Pelosi seems likely to be elected speaker by her peers, it won\u2019t be without considerable pushback within the Democratic caucus. Of all the 53 newly elected Democrats, just seven have said they will definitely vote for her, according to an analysis by The Fix.\n\nWhile Republicans sought to make Pelosi\u2019s potential return to the helm a liability for Democrats running for Congress this year, a Washington Post-Schar School Election Day poll of battleground congressional districts found she barely registered on the list of top issues for voters in battleground states. A scant 7 percent of voters said Pelosi was one of the top two issues in their vote for Congress, trailing well behind Trump and health care as well as several other issues.\n\nThe new Monmouth poll, conducted Nov. 9 to 12 among a random national sample of 802 adults and carrying an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 points, finds substantial support for Congress \u201ckeeping President Trump in check.\u201d Just about half of Americans overall say this should be a \u201cmajor priority,\u201d 52 percent, while another 20 percent say it should be a minor priority and 25 percent say it should not be a priority.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nA handful of prominent conservative and libertarian attorneys are banding together to form Checks and Balances, a group that grew from their need to publicly reaffirm the importance of the rule of law, which they feel is being threatened by the Trump administration.\n\nThe group, organized by George T. Conway III, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, rallies behind the notion that it is important for lawyers who see President Trump\u2019s actions as unconstitutional to speak up.\n\n\u201cThere is a deep-seated concern and uneasiness in conservative legal circles with the president\u2019s attacks on our institutions, including the press and the Department of Justice, and a belief that conservative lawyers are not speaking up enough,\u201d John B. Bellinger, top legal adviser for the State Department and National Security Council under President George W. Bush, told The Post.\n\nThis effort was intended to stimulate discussion among conservative lawyers around the country, particularly as the Federalist Society gathers for its annual conference in Washington on Thursday.\n\nHaving three functioning branches of government is the healthiest way for a democracy to work, said Marisa Maleck, a former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Since Trump took office, he has repeatedly attempted to consolidate the power of those branches himself, she said.\n\n\u201cThe worst part about it is that he normalizes it. Most people don\u2019t realize what he\u2019s doing poses a threat to a constitutional democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a mission statement released Tuesday, the group wrote: \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse. We believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power. We believe in \u2018a government of laws, not of men.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Checks and Balances roster also includes, among others, Tom Ridge, a former Pennsylvania governor and George W. Bush administration secretary of homeland security; professors Orinn Kerr and Jonathan Adler; Peter D. Keisler, acting attorney general in the Bush administration; and attorney Lori S. Meyer, who is married to Federalist Society President Eugene B. Meyer.\n\nMost, if not all, are active members of the Federalist Society and believe in limited judicial function, Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute and a former official in George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Homeland Security, told The Post.\n\nRosenzweig said the moment that triggered each person to join was different.\n\nFor him, it was Charlottesville and Trump\u2019s undermining of the free press. \u201cThe idea of bombs being sent to CNN and embracing a political representative who has actually assaulted the press doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d he said, referencing Trump\u2019s praise of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), who assaulted a journalist last year. \u201cAll of us believe in conservative legal principles and in the need to stand up for them no matter who is the president.\u201d\n\nAdler cited his growing concern about how partisan lines are drawn. \u201cIn the current hyperpartisan environment, people are finding it challenging to criticize those seen as on their side,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members have pointed to Trump\u2019s ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nConway, the group organizer, said, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any one thing; it\u2019s a long series of events that made me think that a group like this could do some good.\u201d\n\nConway has authored a series of articles attacking Trump\u2019s politics, most recently an opinion piece in the New York Times that called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid,\u201d Conway wrote. He similarly called the president\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional.\n\nLawyer Alan Charles Raul, a top legal official in the Ronald Reagan and both Bush administrations, said that what makes America great are constitutional values and rule-of-law norms.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just count on that remaining strong and a shared value for all Americans if we don\u2019t speak up for them and show concern when we see them being challenged,\u201d he said.\n\nGroup members envision Checks and Balances taking on several concerns with the Trump administration. They include respect for the rule of law, constitutional principles that support freedom of expression, due process, and not politicizing any particular criminal prosecution.\n\nThey are unified in hoping that the group will provoke discussion among lawyers to ensure that attacks on American institutions do not become normal across the country.\n\nMaleck said that this is not the way American democracy should be functioning.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote, \u2018The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBefore Trump does lasting damage, someone needs to say that enough is enough. It\u2019s important that it comes from people in his own party.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFive days of fury: Inside Trump\u2019s Paris temper, election woes and staff upheaval\n\nThe House Democratic majority risks the same dysfunction as the Republicans.

A federal judge has barred the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office from certifying election results to allow more time for voters to determine whether their provisional ballots had been counted. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered election officials to create a system that would allow voters to find out if their votes had been counted and, if not, to be told why.\n\n[Federal judge delays certification of Georgia election results, citing concerns over provisional ballots]\n\nVoters are given provisional ballots if their registrations do not show up in voter rolls at their precincts or if they do not have proper identification.\n\nThe ruling has added more tension in the governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams, who ran to be Georgia\u2019s first black governor, and Republican Brian Kemp, who faced criticisms for staying in office as secretary of state \u2014 Georgia\u2019s top election official \u2014 while he\u2019s running.\n\nVoting rights advocates have accused Kemp and other election officials of disenfranchising thousands of voters on Election Day.

It was hailed as a historic moment in the history of the conflicted Horn of Africa.\n\nThe sanctions were put in place in 2009 after U.N. experts said Eritrea was arming and training al-Shabab and other militants seeking to undermine the government in Somalia. The Eritrean government denied the allegation and primarily attributed the sanctions to U.S. opposition.\n\nIt has been several years since the United Nations has offered any evidence to support the claim against Eritrea.

A group of surgeons, many of them gun owners, have new gun-safety recommendations based on their experience treating the wounded. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe decades-old battle over the role medical professionals should play in reducing gun violence erupted onto social media in the past week after the National Rifle Association admonished doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d rather than share thoughts about gun safety. Members of the medical profession took to Twitter with a viral \u2014 and often graphic \u2014 campaign detailing the damage guns do to the human body, and the frequent efforts doctors must take to save the lives of those who have been shot, under the hashtag #Thisisourlane.\n\nNow, a work group from the American College of Surgeons has chimed in with the release Wednesday of a new set of gun-safety recommendations that aims to bridge the political divide. The recommendations, which include robust background checks, enhanced gun-safety training, mandatory reporting requirements for people considered a threat to themselves or others, and the use of innovative technologies to prevent accidental firearms discharge, are striking not so much for their content as their authorship.\n\n[\u2018Being silenced is not acceptable\u2019: Doctors express outrage after NRA tells them \u2018to stay in their lane\u2019]\n\nEighteen of the 22 surgeon-authors are passionate firearms owners, including hunters, self-defense proponents and doctors with previous military experience.\n\nThe paper is \u201ca brilliant application of well-established social science,\u201d said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Faust was not involved in creating the report. \u201cPeople tend to change or moderate their position on a closely held belief when the prevailing argument comes from a trusted insider.\u201d\n\n[Surviving Parkland: A teen\u2019s road to recovery after a mass shooting]\n\nThe American College of Surgeons\u2019 Firearm Strategy Team represents two key kinds of insiders, Faust said: \u201cAs surgeons, they know firsthand the havoc that guns can impart. As gun owners, they understand the issues that non-gun owners might not fully appreciate.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s recommendations come at a time when the long-standing divides over firearms have become increasingly polarized amid a steady torrent of deadly mass shootings in places many had long deemed safe: at school, in church, in synagogue, at a concert. The nation has suffered through a succession of mass shootings this year, most recently the Oct. 27 killing of 11 in a Pittsburgh synagogue and the Nov. 7 carnage in a country music bar that left 12 dead in Thousand Oaks, Calif.\n\n[Pittsburgh trauma center stayed calm as victims kept arriving]\n\nMany medical professionals believe gun violence should be addressed in the same way as car or food safety, but the NRA has long argued for blocking research of guns as a public health issue. The gun-safety and sporting group evolved into a powerful pro-firearms lobby and encouraged Congress to pass the Dickey Amendment in 1996, effectively cutting funding for gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the report was released at noon on Wednesday.\n\nTwo weeks ago, on Oct. 30, the American College of Physicians published a position paper recommending \u201ca public health approach\u201d to firearms-related violence and saying that the medical profession has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to speak out. The NRA retaliated, first with an editorial and then with a Nov. 7 tweet, mocking \u201cself-important\u201d doctors who dared enter the debate.\n\n[After the Las Vegas shooting massacre, survival can be excruciating]\n\nDoctors, nurses and other members of the medical community responded, posting gruesome photographs of blood-drenched operating room floors and accounts of maimed bodies and shattered psyches related to the aftermath of gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is entirely in my lane,\u201d said Gary Timmerman, a trauma surgeon and gun owner from Sioux Falls S.D., who helped compile the recommendations. \u201cThose trauma victims come to us.\u201d\n\nJames Ficke, a Johns Hopkins surgeon who served for 30 years in the Army and described himself as a life member of the NRA, expressed concern that the #thisisourlane campaign could backfire by alienating responsible gun owners and making the debate even more divisive.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that we have different \u2018lanes,\u2019 but we absolutely need to interchange and align,\u201d said Ficke, who was an author of the new report.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of \u201cpreserving the right to own and use a firearm\u201d and embracing the viewpoints of gun owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way we would deal with bicycle safety,\u201d said Ronald M.

Cruz, who faces a possible death sentence if convicted on those charges, now faces new charges of assaulting an officer, battery on an officer and using a device akin to a stun gun on an officer.\n\n[The 17 lives lost in the Parkland school shooting]\n\nAccording to the arrest paperwork, Sgt. Raymond Beltran was assigned to guard Cruz while the inmate walked around a day room area in the jail. When Beltran told Cruz not to drag his sandals, the inmate responded by showing Beltran his middle finger. Beltran began to stand up and then the inmate \u201crushed him and struck him in the face,\u201d the report stated.\n\nSurveillance video showed Cruz rushing Beltran, hitting him with his left fist and taking him to the ground, where he used his other fist to hit Beltran \u201cmultiple times on the top of the head,\u201d according to the complaint affidavit.\n\nThe deputy could be seen trying to get on top of Cruz, who then grabbed an electrical weapon \u2014 likely what is known as a Taser device \u2014 off Beltran\u2019s belt, the report states. Cruz briefly had this weapon in his possession, and the two began struggling for control of it, during which time the weapon could be seen discharging.\n\n[Red flags. Warnings. Cries for help.

Cruz then went to a seat in the room, and the deputy took him into custody.\n\nThe police report identified the device only as a \u201cconductive electronic weapon,\u201d and a spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to a request for more information about the weapon or its manufacturer.\n\nLast month, Broward Sheriff Scott Israel announced that deputies had to begin carrying \u201cat least one less-lethal weapon\u201d on duty and included among the possibilities the electrical weapons known as Tasers. These devices can typically deliver a shock to someone in two ways: through barbs fired from a distance, which can incapacitate someone; or when pressed against their body, which is called a \u201cdrive stun\u201d and causes pain but does not incapacitate them. It is unclear from the report whether the device\u2019s barbs were fired or whether the device went off in drive-stun mode.\n\n[Florida social services investigated alleged school shooter Nikolas Cruz before rampage, knew he wanted to buy gun]\n\nAn attorney for Cruz said they had not heard anything beyond the news that he was accused of attacking a deputy and faces new charges. The attorney also said Cruz was likely to appear in court on the new charges on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nCruz was apprehended on Feb. 14, the day of the massacre, and police said he confessed to carrying out the attack. A transcript of his police interview after the attack depicted him claiming that he had heard a \u201cdemon\u201d in his head urging him to hurt people. After some attacks, people who know the suspects say they were surprised by what happened, while after the Parkland massacre it emerged that authorities had ignored or missed repeated red flags, including multiple warnings to police and the FBI that he posed a threat to a school.\n\nHis lawyers have also acknowledged his guilt.

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nFederal employee salaries on average lag behind those of the private sector by almost 31 percent, an advisory council said Tuesday, while splitting between union and non-union members on whether to recommend potential changes in the way it arrives at that figure.\n\nThe average salary difference of 30.91 percent reported by the Federal Salary Council is somewhat smaller than the 31.86 percent it reported at a special meeting it held April. The figures of prior years were in the 34 to 35 percent range.\n\nThose figures, based on two Labor Department surveys covering some 250 occupations, stand in contrast to assessments of some conservative and libertarian organizations that have concluded that the advantage is about the same or even greater in favor of federal employees.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office last year essentially split the difference. It found an average advantage for federal workers of 3 percent, although within that average it said there is a wide range by educational level: from a 34 percent advantage for federal workers with a high school education or less to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a professional degree or doctorate.\n\nUnder a federal pay law, the \u201cpay gap\u201d as measured by the Salary Council is to be used in setting annual raises varying by locality for federal employees under the General Schedule, the pay system covering most white-collar employees below the executive levels. However, that law never has been followed due to the potential cost of paying such large raises and disagreements over how the figure is calculated.\n\nIn an August message to Congress, President Trump said that following the law\u2019s formula would result in locality-based raises in January 2019 averaging 25.7 percent plus an across-the-board raise of 2.1 percent, at a cost of $25 billion. \u201cFederal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,\u201d Trump\u2019s said in backing a pay freeze that he originally proposed in a budget plan early this year.\n\nA House-Senate conference underway on a spending bill will decide between a freeze and a Senate provision to pay an average 1.9 percent raise. Unless Congress passes, and Trump signs, a bill specifying a raise, salaries will be frozen by default. If the raise is enacted, it would vary slightly among 44 city areas and what is called the \u201crest of the U.S.\u201d locality everywhere else; employees working in the Washington-Baltimore area would stand to receive one of the larger raises, probably around 2.3 percent.\n\nThe long-running controversy over comparing salaries flared at Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the Salary Council, a group of federal employee unions and compensation experts whose decisions typically are unanimous.\n\nA \u201cworking group\u201d document produced since the April meeting laid out a series of potential changes for consideration by a higher-level body called the President\u2019s Pay Agent. Those options included adding more detailed data on salaries by occupation and level of work, taking into account other data such as attrition rates, switching to a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d approach taking benefits into account, and conducting a very detailed review only once every four or five years \u2014 the latter two of which would require a change in law.\n\nCouncil chairman Ron Sanders, a longtime career federal personnel official who is now a clinical professor at the University of South Florida School of Public Affairs, argued in favor of exploring those options. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious to all of us that the current methodology is problematic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat methodology does not tell the whole story,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to say there\u2019s a 30 percent gap. If OMB [the Office of Management and Budget] doesn\u2019t believe it, the White House doesn\u2019t believe it, the Congress doesn\u2019t believe it, what good does it do?\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of officials of federal agencies from several urban and rural areas not now receiving higher city-based locality pay, who told of their difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees despite using special hiring authorities and incentive payments. However, the current process doesn\u2019t support specific salary rates for them, he said.\n\nTwo other members supported exploring the options: Katja Bullock, associate director of presidential personnel, and Jill Nelson, who leads an advisory committee on pay for blue-collar federal employees.\n\nHowever, members from federal unions argued against changing the calculations and questioned whether the group even has the authority to raise new options for consideration. \u201cI don\u2019t think the methodology is broken,\u201d said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is the Congress and the president over time not funding the pay system\u201d as the law intended, said Randy L. Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. Anthony M. Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, expressed concern that including the value of federal benefits \u201cwill be used as a justification to reduce those benefits.\u201d\n\nThe council adjourned without voting on whether to recommend that the Pay Agent consider different approaches. Afterward, Sanders said that in the annual report to that higher-level body to be made by year\u2019s end, individual members of the Salary Council could express their own opinions."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Geoffrey Fowler", "title": "Your smartphone photos are totally fake \u2014and you love it", "description": "Night Sight on Google\u2019s Pixel, which shoots pictures in the dark, shows how phone cameras have become faketastic.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/14/your-smartphone-photos-are-totally-fake-you-love-it/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U2Qs0N0Mqm-AkpHXf9YRMQmY8-Y=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BOI3C5KKUBGG3DMNWCWA4KNX5A.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:55:45Z", "content": "The little camera on this phone has a superpower: it can see things our eyes cannot.

Friends in a candlelit bar look like they brought a lighting crew. Dark streets are flush with reds and greens. A midnight cityscape lights up as though it were late afternoon. It goes way beyond an Instagram filter into you-gotta-see-this territory.\n\nNight Sight is a super step forward for smartphone photography \u2014 and an example of how our photos are becoming, well, super fake.\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 you don\u2019t look like your photos. Photography has never been just about capturing reality, but the latest phones are increasingly taking photos into uncharted territory.\n\nFor now, Night Sight is only a mode that pops up in dark shots on Google\u2019s Pixel phones. But it\u2019s hardly alone: All sorts of phonemakers brag about how awesome their photos look, not how realistic they are. The iPhone\u2019s \u201cportrait mode\u201d applies made-up blur to backgrounds and identifies facial features to reduce red-eye. Selfies on phones popular in Asia automatically slim heads, brighten eyes and smooth skin. And most recent phones use a technique called HDR that merges multiple shots to produce a hyper-toned version of reality.\n\nWhen I recently took the same sunset photo with an iPhone 6 from 2014 and this year\u2019s iPhone XR, I was gobsmacked at the difference \u2014 the newer iPhone shot looked as though it had been painted with watercolors.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? Smartphones democratized photography for 2.5 billion people \u2014 taking a great photo used to require special hardware and a user manual.\n\nNow artificial intelligence and other software advances are democratizing creating beauty. Yes, beauty. Editing photos no longer requires Photoshop skills. Now when presented with a scenic vista or smiling face, phone cameras tap into algorithms trained on what humans like to see and churn out tuned images.\n\nYour phone has really high-tech beer goggles. Think of your camera less as a reflection of reality and more an AI trying to make you happy. It\u2019s faketastic.\n\nSoftware is king\n\nSnapping a photo on a phone has become so much more than passing light through a lens onto a sensor. Of course, that hardware still matters and has improved over the past decade.\n\nBut increasingly, it\u2019s software \u2014 not hardware \u2014 that\u2019s making our photos better. \u201cIt is hyperbole, but true,\u201d says Marc Levoy, a retired Stanford computer-science professor who once taught Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and now works for them on camera projects including Night Sight.\n\nLevoy\u2019s work is rooted in the inherent size limitations of a smartphone. Phones can\u2019t fit big lenses (and the sensors underneath them) like traditional cameras, so makers had to find creative ways to compensate. Enter techniques that replace optics with software, such as digitally combining multiple shots into one.\n\nNew phones from Apple, Samsung and Huawei use it, too, but \u201cwe bet the ranch on software and AI,\u201d Levoy says. This liberated Google to explore making images in new ways.\n\n\n\nTwo portraits taken during San Francisco's Day of the Dead parade. The one shot with Google's Night Sight is sharper and more colorful than the one shot with the iPhone XS. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post) (Geoffrey Fowler/San Francisco)\n\n\u201cGoogle in terms of software has got an edge,\u201d says Nicolas Touchard, the vice president of marketing at DxOMark Image Labs, which produces independent benchmark ratings for cameras. (Whether any of this is enough to help the Pixel win converts from Apple and Samsung is a separate question.)\n\nWith Night Sight, Google\u2019s software is at its most extreme, capturing up to 15 low-light shots and blending them to brighten up faces, provide sharp details and saturate colors in a way that draws in the eye. No flashes go off \u2014 it artificially enhances the light that\u2019s already there.\n\nAnyone who has attempted a low-light shot on a traditional camera knows how hard it is not to take blurry photos. With Night Sight, before you even press the button, the phone measures the shake of your hand and the motion in the scene to determine how many shots to take and how long to leave the shutter open. When you press the shutter, it warns \u201chold still\u201d and shoots for up to six seconds.\n\nOver the course of the next second or two, Night Sight divides all its shots into a bunch of tiny tiles, aligning and merging the best bits to make a complete image. Finally, AI and other software analyze the image to pick the colors and tones.\n\nNight Sight had some difficulty with focus and in scenes with almost no light. And you \u2014 and your subject \u2014 really do have to hold that pose. But in most of my test shots, the product was fantastical. Portraits smoothed out skin while keeping eyes looking sharp. Night landscapes illuminated hidden details and colored them like Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory.\n\nThe problem is: How does a computer choose the tones and colors of things we experience in the dark? Should it render a starlit sky like dusk?\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t see it, we don\u2019t know what it looks like,\u201d Levoy says. \u201cThere are a lot of aesthetic decisions. We made them one way, you could make them a different way. Maybe eventually these phones will need a \u2018What I see\u2019 versus \u2018What is really there\u2019 button.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere's what the camera can produce vs. what it actually sees. This same shot was taken with a Google Pixel 3 using Night Sight in the camera app and then again using the \"raw\" shooting mode in the Adobe Lightroom app. (Geoffrey A. Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nFaketastic\n\nSo if our phones are making up colors and lighting to please us, does it really count as photography? Or is it computer-generated artwork?\n\nSome purists argue the latter. \u201cThis is always what happens with disruptive technology,\u201d Levoy says.\n\nWhat does \u201cfake\u201d even mean? he asks. Pro photographers have long made adjustments in Photoshop or a darkroom. And before that, makers of film tweaked colors for a certain look. It might be an academic concern if we weren\u2019t talking about the hobby \u2014 not to mention the memories \u2014 of a third of humanity.\n\nHow far will phones remove our photos from reality? What might software train us to think looks normal? What parts of images are we letting computers edit out? In a photo I took of the White House (without Night Sight), I noticed the algorithms in the Pixel 3 trained to smooth out imperfections actually removed architectural details that were still visible in a shot on the iPhone XS.\n\nAt DxOMark, the camera measurement firm, the question is how to even judge images when they\u2019re being interpreted by software for features such as face beauty.\n\n\u201cSometimes manufacturers are pushing too far,\u201d Touchard says. \u201cUsually we say it is okay if they have not destroyed information \u2014 if you want to be objective, you have to consider the camera a device that captures information.\u201d\n\nFor another perspective, I called Kenan Aktulun, the founder of the annual iPhone Photography Awards. Over the past decade, he has examined over a million photos taken with iPhones, which entrants are discouraged from heavily editing.\n\nThe line between digital art and photography \u201cgets really blurry at some point,\u201d Aktulun says. Yet he ultimately welcomes technological improvements that make the photo-creating process and tools invisible.

Sandys/The Washington Post) (Toni Sandys/Washingon, D.C.)\n\nJosh Norman isn\u2019t the first player to voice his displeasure with some fans booing the Redskins at FedEx Field, and this year\u2019s Redskins team isn\u2019t the first winning squad in franchise history to be jeered by the home crowd.\n\n\u201cWe come back to our home and it seems like guys don\u2019t really care,\u201d Norman said after Sunday\u2019s win in Tampa Bay. \u201cThey just boo everything and aren\u2019t really behind us. We don\u2019t really feel that [support]. And I\u2019m tired of it, really.\"\n\nWelcome to the club, Mr. Norman. Norm Snead felt your pain once. President Nixon, Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien and rookie linebacker Robert Henson, too. Here\u2019s a look back at the history of Redskins fans booing their favorite team at home, which, as is true with most fan bases, dates back to the earliest years of the franchise.\n\n1940: The NFL Championship Game\n\nThe public address announcer at sold-out Griffith Stadium failed to read the room. With the Redskins trailing the Chicago Bears 48-0 late in the third quarter of an eventual 73-0 loss, he announced that season tickets for the 1941 season were on sale. The boos that followed, The Post\u2019s Shirley Povich wrote, \u201cwere probably the champion in Griffith Stadium history . . . To the ill-timed announcement, which was the worst bit of showmanship ever to hit the stadium, the fans gave full-throated sarcasm.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Redskins fans to get over the humiliating and record-breaking defeat. There wasn\u2019t a season ticket unsold in 1941.\n\n1956: A change comes over Redskins fans\n\nRedskins fans apparently weren\u2019t big booers during the franchise\u2019s first two decades in D.C.\n\n\u201cUnlike pro football crowds in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, to cite two notable examples, Washington fans don\u2019t boo the Redskins when things go wrong, they just get awfully quiet,\u201d The Post\u2019s Jack Walsh wrote in October 1956.\n\nEvery fan base has its breaking point, and after the Redskins suffered a 23-0 loss to the Steelers in their home finale, Post columnist Bob Addie expressed his disappointment with the boo-birds at Griffith Stadium.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the unkindest cut of all was the scornful remark made my many of the spectators who labeled the Redskins \u2018a bunch of bums,\u2019\u201d Addie wrote. \u201cHow fickle, indeed, is affection. The Redskins went a long way with little talent but a tremendous fighting spirit. Even the teams they beat, didn\u2019t think of the Redskins as championship caliber. Just because the Redskins couldn\u2019t go all the way is no reason to sour on them. Our fans certainly didn\u2019t distinguish themselves last Sunday.\u201d\n\n1970: \u201cMaybe they should ban booze\u201d\n\nFickle fans booed quarterback Sonny Jurgensen in the first quarter of Washington\u2019s Week 6 game against the Bengals at RFK Stadium. The Redskins were leading 10-0 at the time and improved to 3-3 with a 20-0 win, their first shutout since 1964.\n\n\u201cThey buy tickets and they have the right to do whatever they like to,\u201d Redskins Coach Bill Austin said of the boos.\n\n\u201cShort of coming on the field,\u201d Charley Taylor added.\n\nThe home fans were less civil after a 45-21 loss to the Cowboys in November dropped the Redskins to 4-6. There were several fights in the stands, and Jurgensen was hit in the head with a stone after the game.\n\n\u201cI think it is all right for our fans to voice their dissatisfaction with their mouths, but not physically,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe they should ban booze in the stands . . . I thought Jurgensen did pretty well. I don\u2019t know whether the boos were directed at him or the whole group of players.\"\n\n1971: President Nixon empathizes with the Redskins\n\nDuring a Week 10 loss to the Cowboys, Redskins fans booed when starting quarterback Billy Kilmer, not Jurgensen, took the field at the start of the second half with Washington trailing 7-0. Coach George Allen pulled Kilmer in favor of Jurgensen late in the third quarter, but the Redskins lost anyway, 13-0.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t help any when you\u2019re playing at home where you\u2019re supposed to have the favor of the crowd,\u201d running back Charley Harraway said. \u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t make you feel welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was terrible,\u201d offensive lineman Jim Snowden said. \u201cEverybody should be behind us. I\u2019m very disappointed at the fans' reaction.\"\n\n\u201cWhen I came here I thought they were the greatest fans in the world,\u201d offensive lineman George Burman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was any reason for this today. Bill called a good game, he executed well. But the fans have the right. They pay their seven bucks. We\u2019ve got to get untracked. We\u2019ve got to deserve the cheers.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Nixon visited Redskins Park in 1971. (AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTwo days after the loss, President Nixon made a surprise visit to Redskins practice and delivered an impromptu pep talk.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, you\u2019ve already been great for the city,\u201d Nixon told the team during his 45-minute visit. \u201cThe whole city is proud of you . . . I\u2019ve heard plenty of boos myself in my lifetime. Don\u2019t let it bother you. A great majority of people in this town back the team.\u201d\n\nNixon predicted the 6-3-1 Redskins would win their next game against the Eagles and make the playoffs, but he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say they\u2019d overtake the Cowboys and win the division.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any votes in Washington, but there are in Texas.\u201d quipped Nixon, who followed Allen\u2019s coaching career because Allen previously coached at his alma mater, Whittier.\n\nThe Post\u2019s editorial board even weighed in on the boos:\n\n\"Think Sonny\u201d they were shouting, when they might have been thinking of how the Redskins have gotten where they are without Sonny and Charley Taylor, and with [Larry] Brown and Harraway in and out with injuries, and with Jerry Smith sidelined. Yet there they were after the half last Sunday, 6-2-1, a half game out front, still not beaten and not disgracing themselves either, and getting booed. It was almost enough to lead us into acknowledgment of some part of the argument made elsewhere on this page today by Colman McCarthy -- that football is in fact a dehumanizing experience. Almost, but not quite. It is said that the crowd pays for the privilege of booing, and that is so; but that doesn\u2019t make it any the less an act of faithlessness, or any the less dispiriting for the Over-the-Hill Gang and the walking wounded and the rest when they are already 13 points down. It is also said that the boos were for George Allen -- but for what? For bringing Washington its best record since World War II? The Washington Post\n\nThe Redskins would beat the Eagles and rally to clinch a postseason berth that season.\n\n1987: \u201cWhat if we\u2019d lost?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the Scabs! We want the Scabs!\u201d Redskins fans chanted during the first game after the 1987 NFL players\u2019 strike ended. Washington\u2019s regulars overcame a 16-7 deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the Jets.\n\n\u201cI think all the guys got ticked offed about that,\u201d lineman Mark May said. \u201cYou\u2019re playing in front of your home crowd and they want to bring back the scabs. I mean, it\u2019s not too fulfilling.\u201d\n\n[Redskins players remain proud they stuck together during 1987 strike]\n\n\u201cBooing was something I heard quite a bit in Atlanta, but no one expected it happening here,\u201d guard R.C. Thielemann said. \u201cI guess we probably deserve it. We had the odor of a cesspool for the first three quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, they didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d linebacker Monte Coleman said.\n\n\"What if we\u2019d lost? center Jeff Bostic said.\n\n1988: Booing a Super Bowl MVP, Part I\n\nRedskins fans were booing the defending Super Bowl champions long before the Eagles finally gave their fan base the opportunity to do so this year.\n\n\u201cThis booing of Doug Williams stinks,\u201d The Post\u2019s Tony Kornheiser wrote in November 1988 after Williams, who won Super Bowl MVP honors the previous season, struggled in a loss that dropped Washington to 6-5. \u201cStop it. Was Jan. 31 so long ago that none of you can remember back that far? . . . Sports fans have a right to ask, What have you done for me lately? But not, What have you done for me in the last two minutes? Curiously, you haven\u2019t booed Joe Jacoby when his man is on top of Williams quicker than instant oatmeal. You haven\u2019t booed Gary Clark for dropping passes. You haven\u2019t booed Darrell Green when he gets beat. Even all-pros make mistakes, but you cut them some slack and load up on Williams. It\u2019s a tradition in this city. From Jurgensen, to Kilmer, to Theismann, to Schroeder, to Williams. Boo the starting quarterback. Get the other guy onto the field.\"\n\n1992: Booing a Super Bowl MVP, Part II\n\nThe tradition of booing the starting quarterback continued in 1992, when Redskins fans jeered Mark Rypien in the home opener, eight months after he won Super Bowl MVP honors. Rypien, who became the NFL\u2019s second-highest paid player after holding out during training camp, wasn\u2019t happy with the reception, and fired back at the fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here seven years,\u201d Rypien said after leading the Redskins to a win over the Falcons. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my tail off to try to do the best job I can. So I have no control over that [booing]. They might need a little work in getting crowd noise. If that\u2019s their best effort, then Dallas has some great fans. That\u2019s my shot back at 'em.\"\n\n\u201cTo boo this guy after the season he had shows the people who inhabit RFK aren\u2019t as smart as they\u2019re portrayed,\u201d The Post\u2019s Michael Wilbon wrote. \u201cStop it.\u201d\n\nRypien apologized to fans during an appearance on Channel 4 the next day, but was booed again during the Redskins' 13-10 win over the Lions the following week.\n\n1994-96: The Heath Shuler years\n\nShuler, who signed the largest rookie deal in NFL history after the Redskins drafted him third overall, was booed in his home preseason debut while completing 9 of 22 passes for 61 yards. The former University of Tennessee star said it was the first time he\u2019d been booed in his life.\n\n\u201cI thought it was pretty funny,\u201d Shuler said. \u201cI went to a great high school with great fans. In college we had the best fans in America. I assumed coming here we would have the same thing. But they were just disappointed. We\u2019ll find out about the real fans when we start winning.\u201d\n\n[Narrator\u2019s voice:] The Redskins didn\u2019t start winning.\n\nShuler was backing up Gus Frerotte in 1996 when Frerotte had the wind knocked out of him during a home game against the 49ers. Fans booed Shuler as he ran onto the field for his first snap of the season, which resulted in a 14-yard loss by Leslie Shepherd on a botched reverse.\n\n\u201cIt was not a lot of class, it just doesn\u2019t show a lot,\u201d Shuler said of the fans' reaction. \u201cThey\u2019re probably not going to love me any more by me saying that. I got a chance to play, and I was glad I had a chance to play. I\u2019d have liked the play to have worked out better, but that\u2019s over with. I always thought you should cheer the guy who\u2019s coming in. I tried not to pay attention to the boos. Personally, I was listening for the applause, and I heard the people who did applaud, and that\u2019s what you want to hear. That\u2019s how you know who the true fans are . . . It was a sad thing, but I guess they boo everybody. It\u2019s a part of being a fan.\u201d\n\n2001: It costs a lot more to boo these days than it used to\n\nTackle Jon Jansen noticed the boos after the Redskins fell to 0-3 with a 45-13 loss to the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cThey pay their $65; they\u2019re entitled to their opinion,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cThe only time it bothers me is when I get a chance to go out to dinner with my wife and people come up and do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nRedskins rookies Kevin Barnes, left, and Robert Henson were tied to the goal post during training camp in 2009. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\n2009: Robert Henson\u2019s folly\n\nThe Redskins were booed during an uninspired 9-7 win over the Rams in their 2009 home opener.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a shame, to be honest with you,\u201d tight end Chris Cooley said in the locker room. \u201cI think Washington prides themselves on being the best fans, and I think that they should try to be the best fans. We won. I understand they wanted us to beat the Rams by 40, but we still won, and we if we continue to win games, that\u2019s great. Booing\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nRookie linebacker Robert Henson, a sixth-round pick out of TCU, agreed, and he let it be known on social media.\n\n\u201cAll you fake half hearted Skins fan can . . . I won\u2019t go there, but I dislike you very strongly, don\u2019t come to Fed Ex to boo dim wits!!\u201d Henson tweeted.\n\nRather than stop there, Henson engaged with fans who didn\u2019t take too kindly to his criticism.\n\n\u201cNo I didn\u2019t play but I still made more than you in a year and you\u2019d [gladly] switch spots with me in a second,\u201d he replied to one fan. \u201cI was talking to the fans [who] said the crazy stuff, I\u2019m use [to heckling] but I\u2019ve never been booed in my own stadium. Again that was for the half hearted but if everyone wants to jump in come on. The question is who are you to say you know what\u2019s best for the team and you work 9 to 5 at Mcdonalds [sic].\u201d\n\nHenson tweeted 52 times that night. Some of his comments were featured on Comcast SportsNet\u2019s postgame show, during which former Redskin Brian Mitchell asked, \u201cWho the hell is Robert Henson?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sincerely apologize to all the fans,\u201d Henson said the following day. \u201cI hope to have a long, prosperous career here, and I don\u2019t want anybody booing me or being negative towards me.\u201d\n\nHenson spent the 2010 season on injured reserve and was released in 2011.\n\n\n\n(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\n2014: That boo-worthy Bucs game\n\nThe nadir of the Redskins\u2019 miserable 2014 season was a 27-7 loss to the Buccaneers in Week 11. There were so many boos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be frustrated, too,\u201d Redskins linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said afterward. \u201cI never condone booing. Why boo your own team? But I can\u2019t argue with it. We\u2019re playing terribly, and they pay a lot of money for their tickets. They want to see their team win, and when we\u2019re not doing that, I get it.\u201d\n\n2018: Boos at the home opener\n\nThe Redskins opened the season with a resounding win in Arizona, but laid an egg the following week in a 21-9 loss to the Colts at FedEx Field. Some in the less-than-capacity crowd booed.\n\n\u201cMe, I noticed it,\u201d Chris Thompson said of the thousands of empty seats. \u201cI also noticed the boos we got as well, and that\u2019s not something that I\u2019m a real big fan of. If you\u2019re a fan of a team, you shouldn\u2019t be booing them, whether we\u2019re doing good or bad. We understand as players that we\u2019re not performing how we should. You don\u2019t have to boo us to let us know \u2014 we\u2019re out there on the field.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nRedskins players have every reason to be frustrated.

(Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nNot much has changed as we watch this system develop late this evening. It still appears that precipitation should be moving into the area in the hours around sunrise. This means a messy commute is a given.\n\nThe focus of any icy troubles is likely to be in the 7 to 11 a.m. period, when some snow and mixed precipitation spreads across the area. Accumulation odds continue to be best north and west of Interstate-95, and increasing as one heads north and west from there. There is also some chance that precipitation could come down heavily right away, at least for a time. If this occurs, conditions could go downhill quick. Do plan to start early, check in with us, and take it slow if you are headed out.\n\n4:05 p.m. - Winter weather advisory issued for D.C. area; winter storm warning toward Interstate 81\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for the District and surrounding area from 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday. It is forecasting up to an inch of sleet and snow and the possibility of a light (0.1 inches) glaze of ice.\n\nThis advisory extends until 4 p.m. in our far north and west suburbs, including northwest Montgomery, northern Fauquier, and Loudoun counties, where frozen precipitation is likely to last longer due to colder temperatures. In these areas, there is higher potential for an icy glaze (up to 0.2 inches) on top of the snow and sleet. In Frederick County, Md. and to its east across northern Maryland, the Weather Service forecasts one to two inches of snow and sleet accumulation.\n\n\n\nAdvisories and warnings in effect on Thursday. (National Weather Service)\n\nEven farther west, along the Interstate 81 corridor from Harrisonburg, Va. to Hagerstown, Md. and to the west, a winter storm warning is in effect from 4 a.m. Thursday to 4 a.m. Friday for up to 2 to 5 inches of snow and sleet and an icy glaze up to 0.25 inches thick.\n\nAdvisories are not in effect in Southern Maryland, where mostly rain is predicted.\n\nFrom earlier...\n\nAn unusually cold November storm brought snow and sleet as far south as Houston on Tuesday and West Monroe, La., on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm will arrive in the Washington region, probably offering a smorgasbord of precipitation types: snow, sleet, rain and freezing rain. Some of this precipitation will fall heavily.\n\nThe period of greatest concern is between about 7 a.m. and 11 a.m., coinciding with the morning commute, when temperatures will be lowest and the chance of frozen precipitation highest. This is your typical Washington winter weather event in which conditions will tend to deteriorate as you head into the colder areas north and west of the Beltway, where the chance of snow and sleet accumulation and slick spots is greatest.\n\nPrecipitation may begin briefly as light rain in the predawn hours before changing to snow and/or sleet by dawn. Any snow is likely to be short-lived, as temperatures at high altitudes will be increasing, but sleet and pockets of freezing rain may continue through the morning. However, in locations south and east of the Beltway, any frozen precipitation should change to plain rain as the morning wears on.\n\nDuring the late morning and afternoon, precipitation from the Beltway and to the northwest should gradually transition to plain rain. Frozen precipitation will last longest in our far northern and western areas, perhaps well into the afternoon west and north of Warrenton, Leesburg and Frederick. Some of these areas are under a winter storm watch because of the potential for accumulating snow and sleet, as well as a glaze of freezing rain on top.\n\n\n\nForecast radar from NAM model early Thursday through Friday morning.\n\nInside the Beltway and to the south and east, air and road temperatures should be high enough so that frozen precipitation that falls, mostly in the morning, melts. However, a few slick spots cannot be ruled out during any heavier bursts of frozen precipitation \u2014 which are possible during the morning commute Thursday.\n\nFarther to the north and west, the possibility that sleet and snow coats roads increases, especially those that are untreated, as well as bridges, ramps and overpasses.\n\nPrecipitation will be heaviest across the region between about 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., but areas of light rain and drizzle (possibly freezing rain and drizzle in our coldest locations) will linger through Thursday night (rain may mix with or change to wet snow briefly before ending in our northern areas). The equivalent of at least one inch of precipitation (from melted snow and ice, and rain) should fall in most areas. If Washington receives this much precipitation, it will move into the fourth spot among the wettest calendar years on record.\n\nThis is an event where just a few degrees will make a big difference in how much snow and wintry mix occurs and where, so surprises are possible if not likely. The setup makes it \u201ctricky to tell how long the below freezing surface temperatures will hold across the area north and west of the Beltway,\u201d said Wes Junker, the Capital Weather Gang\u2019s winter weather expert.\n\nThis type of winter weather in Washington so early in the season is uncommon. If accumulating snow or sleet manages to materialize in Washington, it will mark the first time in November since 1996.\n\n[It could snow in Washington on Thursday. How often does that happen in November?]\n\nForecasts by zone\n\nAs conditions will vary widely over the region, from mostly rain in Southern Maryland to substantial amounts of frozen precipitation toward the Interstate 81 corridor, we\u2019ve divided the region into four zones, shown on the map below.\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nHere is how we see the event evolving, zone by zone, and the expected impact.\n\nZone 1: Northern Maryland, eastern panhandle of West Virginia and northwest Virginia\n\n(Includes Winchester, Hagerstown, Frederick and Westminster)\n\nModerate accumulations of snow and sleet (one to three inches) and a glaze of freezing rain are possible in this region, as temperatures will be lowest here, and precipitation is likely to remain in a frozen form for a good portion of the event.\n\nPrecipitation should begin as snow and sleet early Thursday morning, and then transition to more sleet and freezing rain as the morning wears on. Some areas could change to plain rain during the afternoon, but pockets of freezing rain may linger even into the evening in some of the colder valleys in the western parts of this zone.\n\n\n\nForecast temperatures between Thursday morning and Thursday night from high-resolution NAM model.\n\n\u201cThe high-resolution models suggest that the temperatures at the surface could stay below freezing for an extended period of time in our typical colder locations north and west of the city,\u201d Junker said.\n\nA winter storm watch is in effect in the western part of this zone, along and west of the Interstate 81 corridor, where temperatures will be lowest. Because of freezing rain, a glaze of up to 0.25 inches could build up on trees and power lines, leading to outages. Untreated roads, driveways, parking lots and sidewalks could turn hazardous.\n\n\n\nIce accumulation forecast on Thursday. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe expected conditions rate as a Level 2 out of 5, or \u201cdisruptive\u201d winter weather event on our winter storm impact scale. The effects will be magnified by the fact that the wintry mix will coincide with the morning commute and that this is the first winter storm of the season \u2014 meaning people have less recent experience dealing with such conditions.\n\nZone 2: Washington\u2019s and Baltimore\u2019s north and west suburbs\n\n(Includes Warrenton, Leesburg, Rockville, Columbia and Towson)\n\nMixed precipitation should begin just before dawn and snow and/or sleet is likely to put down a coating to an inch through midmorning or so. More sleet than snow is likely to fall. Road surfaces, especially those that are untreated, could turn slick.\n\nSome areas may change to plain rain by late morning, and most areas should do so during the afternoon, but there may be a few colder spots (sheltered valleys) where temperatures hardly budge \u2014 which would allow for a slick glaze of freezing rain to develop.\n\nThe freezing rain risk may be mitigated by the fact that precipitation will fall heavily at times and make it hard for ice to adhere to surfaces such as trees and power lines. Also, temperatures in this zone may hover right around freezing (between 30 and 34 degrees) \u2014 and would need to be lower for a more serious ice buildup.\n\nOn our winter storm impact scale, this event is Level 1 \u2014 a nuisance winter storm (note that in our assessment this was close to Level 2, so it is a high-end nuisance event). Although widespread hazardous conditions are unlikely, pockets of slick travel are a good bet, and some school delays and cancellations cannot be ruled out.\n\nZone 3: The immediate Washington area and city of Baltimore\n\n(Includes Gainesville, Manassas, Fairfax, Bethesda, Laurel and Annapolis)\n\nPrecipitation may begin as light rain predawn but transition to a wintry mix of sleet and snow around sunrise through the midmorning hours. Then the wintry mix may transition to rain. However, it\u2019s possible that pockets of sleet and freezing rain linger into the early afternoon in some of the colder areas.\n\nTemperatures in this zone will be near if not above freezing, generally limiting accumulation. However, slick spots could form during any heavy bursts of frozen precipitation.\n\nEven if icy travel does not materialize, roads will be wet, and visibility will be reduced because of the messy mix of falling precipitation \u2014 so allow extra time to reach your destination.\n\nStorm conditions do not merit a rating on our impact scale in this zone. We generally do not expect delays and cancellations in this zone, unless conditions turn out to be worse than expected.\n\n\u201cFor snow lovers, the combination of being November and the upper-level storm track being a tad north of where you want it pretty much killed our chances for any meaningful snow around the city,\u201d Junker said.\n\nZone 4: Far southern suburbs and Southern Maryland\n\n(Includes Fredericksburg and La Plata)\n\nExpect mostly a cold rain in this zone. A little sleet or wet snowflakes could mix with the rain during the early morning, but roads should mostly remain just wet."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Long Island City faces Amazon dilemma: How to reap rewards amid changing landscape - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Long Island City faces Amazon dilemma: How to reap rewards amid changing landscape Washington Post LONG ISLAND CITY, NEW YORK \u2014 Lorraine Romano has owned her two-family house here for 42 years, raising her children and, more recently, hosting \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/14/long-island-city-faces-amazon-dilemma-how-reap-rewards-amid-changing-landscape/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:42:48Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nLong Island City is one of two cities chosen by Amazon for its much-touted HQ2 expansion. Over the past decade, the neighborhood has been gentrified and now has a mix of original and new businesses. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY, NEW YORK \u2014 Lorraine Romano has owned her two-family house here for 42 years, raising her children and, more recently, hosting visiting grandchildren.\n\nBut Romano, a manager at a neighborhood Italian restaurant, found herself in an unusual position Tuesday: The house she had had on the market for months was suddenly besieged by buyers.\n\n\u201cOur broker called us and described the offers, which people made right after the Amazon news,\u201d Romano noted as she worked phones and oversaw the kitchen at the restaurant, Manducatis, on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s time to get out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSince word came Monday that the online giant would make this slowly gentrifying Queens neighborhood across the water from midtown Manhattan the site of one of its new headquarters, it has sparked enthusiasm from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and anger from many local politicians.\n\n\u201cWe are witness to a cynical game in which Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth,\u201d Michael Gianaris and James Van Bramer, Long Island City\u2019s state senator and city council member, noted in a joint statement about the deal, which could ultimately bring as many as 25,000 high-wage jobs but comes with as much as $1.53 billion in government tax incentives.\n\nBut the reaction in this neighborhood of 20,000 has been more complicated. Some longtime residents, contrary to the conventional wisdom about local resistance, welcomed the opportunity to cash out or add to their consumer base.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, not all newcomers, who over the past decade have essentially presaged the Amazon move, are excited about the deal.\n\nOne thing everyone agrees on, though: Amazon did not start this fire.\n\n\u201cThis neighborhood is already changed,\u201d Romano said. \u201cThis just will make it change even more.\u201d\n\n[Amazon's fast expansion invites growing political scrutiny]\n\nIf New York City is a microcosm of the country\u2019s real estate boom of the past decade, Long Island City is a microcosm of New York.\n\nGentrification was promised long ago to this land of faded warehouses, factories and pockets of rough-eared one- and two-family homes. The Citicorp building \u2014 a 50-story glass office tower \u2014 opened in 1990 a half-mile east of the new Amazon site. The first luxury condominiums on the neighborhood\u2019s waterfront opened in the late 1990s.\n\nThe area remained largely forgotten for years. Other places, including Hoboken, N.J., to the west and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to the south, leaped above it on the upscaling curve.\n\nIt was not until the housing crisis a decade ago, when the market moved from owning to renting, that change took hold. The area is catnip to developers of luxury rentals: It sits several minutes by subway from Grand Central Terminal, contains striking views across the East River and has a smaller-town feel than many New York neighborhoods. Rents could be set high \u2014 if not quite Manhattan-high, then certainly enough to be awash in profits. Tenants could pay as much as $3,500 for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nDevelopers built high-end luxury apartment towers, many of them teasing New York City skyline views.\n\nIn fact, since 2010 Long Island City has seen the most new rental apartments of anywhere in the country, nearly double that of the next-highest neighborhood, downtown Los Angeles. Locally these buildings are known as \u201cthe high-rises\u201d and are the vertical equivalent of living in a swanky estate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the day of Amazon\u2019s announcement, the effects of this shift were on display, as Pilates studios, high-end bakeries and craft breweries could be seen on and near the main street of Vernon Boulevard. Even a barber shop was artisanal.\n\nThe popularity has had some unintended effects. Arthur Mull, who three years ago opened the boutique pharmacy Nature\u2019s Prescriptions, said the initial promise has given way to the threat of corporate incursion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult. CVS just opened across the street,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon is part of the same trend.\u201d (The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Washington won its piece of Amazon's HQ2. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nOne woman pushing a baby stroller who lives in the high-rises but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s sensitivity said she was not in favor of Long Island City\u2019s newest occupant, even though she was part of the same wave that swept it in.\n\nShe was worried, she said, about what Amazon\u2019s arrival would mean for the subway, whose aging infrastructure has already been buckling under massive ridership increases in recent years. (The 7 train that serves the area is routinely ranked as one of New York City\u2019s best, a status that could be jeopardized with an influx of commuters.)\n\nSchools are already struggling to stay under capacity, she said, could face greater challenges with the flood of 25,000 new employees \u2014 highlighting the core paradox of gentrification, in which the very perks that attracted new blood are also eroded by those residents\u2019 arrival.\n\nStretching behind a green construction wall, the parcel of land the company would take over is a mix of private and public land that had been marked for rezoning. (The private land is owned by Plaxall, a plastics company.) Sitting on an area known as the Anable Basin, it features prime waterfront space and dazzling views of the east side of Manhattan across the river.\n\nThere was little evidence Tuesday of the changes to come. Near the planned site sat an ungainly taxi garage, a bunkerlike building housing the New York Blood Center and a smattering of drab government offices. The Queensboro Bridge loomed in the background, not as the softly lit vista seen from Manhattan in untold romantic comedies but as a cantilevered hulk of steel, as though one was viewing a duck confit from its bony underside.\n\nYet at the southern end of the site, both the river and the last in the chain of current high-rises were on view, hinting at the gleaming tech future Amazon promises. It is a tableaux that could stretch all the way toward the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public-housing development in the Western Hemisphere that sits about a half-mile north and is one of the region\u2019s most blighted areas.\n\nIf cities are to be revamped for the future, some Long Island City residents said, it means accepting the changes and displacement that come with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the old to move out and new lives to come in,\u201d said 89-year-old Vincenzo Cerbone, who has owned Manducatis restaurant for nearly a half-century and lives right near the Anable Basin.\n\nSome other business owners were less optimistic.\n\nMichael Dhoman, who has run the Silver Star Auto Express repair shop a few blocks from the headquarters site, said he wanted badly to compete in an Amazonian future but has given hope that he can. \u201cMy landlord has said he will raise the rent from $9,000 to $15,000 a month when my lease is up next year,\u201d said Dhoman as he stood in his garage. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 12 years. I can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n\nSome described a Catch-22 created by the new corporate import from Seattle.\n\n\u201cMore upper-middle class people means more customers,\u201d said Mull, the pharmacist. \u201cBut it also means higher rents and the need to raise prices. And we can\u2019t raise prices, because then everyone will buy everything on Amazon.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Amanda Erickson", "title": "A pregnant woman was shot in the stomach by a crossbow.

(Laurent Cipriani/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the disappearance and subsequent detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife\u2019s claim that she got a threatening call in Chinese after he was picked up.\n\nGrace Meng, the wife of Meng Hongwei, detailed the threatening call in an Associated Press interview in October. She said the caller told her to only listen but not to speak and threatened: \u201cWe\u2019ve come in two work teams, two work teams just for you.\u201d\n\nAn official close to the French investigation said Wednesday that police in the city of Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, closed their probe into the call and Meng\u2019s detention having found no evidence that a crime was committed in France. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMeng Hongwei \u2014 who was China\u2019s vice minister of public security while also leading Interpol \u2014 was detained while on a trip to China in September. A long-time Communist Party insider with decades of experience in China\u2019s sprawling security apparatus, the 64-year-old is the latest high-ranking official to fall victim to a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials under President Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarian administration.\n\nChinese authorities have said Meng is being lawfully investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. His wife says the bribery accusation is just an excuse for a lengthy detention and that he is being persecuted for political reasons. On Sept. 25, he sent a text message to her from China of an emoji of a knife \u2014 suggesting to her he was in danger.\n\nGrace Meng said the man whose nighttime call frightened her in early October gave just one clue about his identity: that he used to work for Meng, suggesting the man was part of China\u2019s security apparatus. He also said he knew where she was.\n\nFrench police subsequently investigated the call but determined there was no evidence of a threat or that a crime was committed, the official close to the probe said.\n\nReached Wednesday by telephone, Grace Meng told the AP that she wasn\u2019t aware of the investigation\u2019s closure. She said the French police detail assigned to protect her and her two boys hasn\u2019t been withdrawn.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

While the focus now is on Democrats' desire to dig in on investigations of the Trump administration, campaign and businesses, there are also legislative promises they made on issues such as health care and gun control that they want to force votes on ahead of 2020.\n\nBut deflections and discord within the caucus over how to proceed threaten to put House Democrats in the same situation House Republicans faced for the past eight years, when the most conservative lawmakers balked at their leadership\u2019s every move.

Of the more than 30 seats Democrats flipped, most of the winning candidates were endorsed by the moderate New Democrat Coalition caucus.\n\nA handful of Democrats who are involved with the \u201cProblem Solvers Caucus,\u201d a bipartisan group that meets to discuss compromise but has yet to see its ideas rise beyond paper, wrote Pelosi a letter Tuesday threatening to withdraw their support for her if they didn\u2019t receive a \u201cwritten, public commitment\u201d to push for changes to House rules to help the chamber \u201cgovern again.\u201d\n\nAs a whole, the House Democratic majority next year will only have an advantage of, at most, 16 seats, so any fissures in the party could stall Democrats' agenda at a time when they are desperate to put up a unified front against President Trump and Republicans. While the focus now is on Democrats' desire to dig in on investigations of the Trump administration, campaign and businesses, there are also legislative promises they made on issues such as health care and gun control that they want to force votes on ahead of 2020.\n\nBut deflections and discord within the caucus over how to proceed threaten to put House Democrats in the same situation House Republicans faced for the past eight years, when the most conservative lawmakers balked at their leadership\u2019s every move. The rightward turn of the party, and its embrace of Trump, caused many \u201ccentrist\u201d Republicans who faced difficult reelections this year to throw up their hands and quit the game. Former congressman Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) used to call them the \u201cgoverning wing\u201d of the party.\n\n\"I\u2019ll ask everybody to take a look at the so-called Freedom Caucus and see where they got the Republican Party,\u201d the assistant Democratic leader, James E. Clyburn (S.C.), said Tuesday in an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis. \u201cI think they\u2019re the ones that got them into the shape they\u2019re in now.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Lawyers seek 'Apprentice' tapes in Trump immigration suit - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Lawyers seek 'Apprentice' tapes in Trump immigration suit Washington Post BOSTON \u2014 Lawyers suing President Donald Trump over his decision to end special protections shielding certain immigrants from deportation are seeking unaired footage from\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/lawyers-seek-apprentice-tapes-in-trump-immigration-suit/2018/11/14/cb287164-e827-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:14:50Z", "content": "BOSTON Lawyers suing President Donald Trump over his decision to end special protections shielding certain immigrants from deportation are seeking unaired footage from his reality TV show The Apprentice to try to bolster their case alleging the move was racia\u2026 [+3453 chars]", "fulltext": "FILE - In this Nov. 13, 2018, file photo, President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, in Washington.

Temporary protected status provides safe havens for people from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters and other challenges.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights says in the lawsuit that Trump\u2019s move to rescind the program was rooted in animus against immigrants of color, citing comments he made on the campaign trial and in office.\n\n\u201cAccess to these videotapes will help further demonstrate that Defendant Trump holds racially biased views that impact his policy and decision making,\u201d attorney Oren Nimni said in a written statement. The subpoenas also seek any relevant outtakes, audio clips and transcripts made during production of the show.\n\nEmails seeking comment were sent to an MGM lawyer, a Trump Production official and White House officials.\n\nA federal judge in July denied Trump\u2019s request to throw out the lawsuit and rejected the administration\u2019s bid to remove Trump as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn a different case in California, another federal judge last month issued a temporary injunction that bars the Trump administration from ending the protections, saying there is evidence that president \u201charbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his ... decision to end the TPS designation.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing that ruling.\n\nPressure on producers of the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to release unaired footage of the show intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post published a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Trump boasting about aggressively groping women.\n\nMGM, which owns \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said at the time that it couldn\u2019t unilaterally release any unaired, archived material because of contractual obligations. The show\u2019s producer, Mark Burnett, also said he didn\u2019t have the ability or right to release footage.\n\nA former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who has accused Trump of unwanted groping and kissing has also sought footage through a lawsuit against the president, but it\u2019s unclear whether she has received any.\n\nThe subpoena issued by Summer Zervos\u2019 attorney in May sought any \u201cApprentice\u201d material that features Zervos, or Trump talking about her or discussing other female contestants in a sexual or inappropriate way.\n\n____\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/aedurkinricher .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She and four others from that small group now say the sense of intimacy, artistry and discovery that defined early Instagram and led to its success has given way to a celebrity-driven marketplace that is engineered to sap users\u2019 time and attention at the cost of their well-being.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, you felt your post was seen by people who cared about you and that you cared about,\u201d said Richardson, who left Instagram in 2014 and later founded a start-up. \u201cThat feeling is completely gone for me now.\u201d\n\n[From Silicon Valley elite to social media hate: The radicalization that led to Gab]\n\nThe catalyst for Richardson\u2019s decision to quit Instagram came when its co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, unexpectedly announced that they were leaving the company. With their exit, Richardson and other former Instagram employees worried Facebook would squash whatever independent identity the company had managed to retain.\n\nShe sent her goodbye to Instagram the next day.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s common to hear start-up workers become frustrated with management after an acquisition, the disillusionment of the early Instagram employees is striking: People seldom swear off or criticize the product they built, particularly when it has enjoyed such remarkable success. Instagram reached 1 billion users this year.\n\nThe people who worked at social networks long saw the connection and free expression they facilitated as a powerful force for good and evidence of the contribution they were making to society. For them, the public questioning of the role social networks play in democracy and in individual lives, sparked by concerns over privacy and health, is deeply personal.\n\nThree of the early Instagram employees, including Richardson, have deleted it \u2014 permanently or periodically, comparing it to a drug that produces a diminishing high. One of the people said he felt a little embarrassed to tell people that he worked there. Two of the other early employees said they used it far less than before.\n\nThis shift is part of an existential crisis for Facebook, which has seen a slew of top executives resign this year, including the leaders of its major acquisitions: Oculus, WhatsApp and Instagram. Some people are also abandoning Facebook: It lost 4 million users in Europe in the last six months and growth has plateaued in the United States.\n\nThe Instagram employees, including Richardson, said they hoped their concerns would not be dismissed as nostalgia and would be seen as a call to future entrepreneurs to recognize these pitfalls and build something better.\n\n\u201cThere was so much pressure to do things that \u2018scaled,\u2019 to use the Silicon Valley buzzword,\u201d said Josh Riedel, the third employee after Systrom and Krieger. \u201cBut when you have over a billion users, something gets lost along the way.\u201d\n\nIan Spalter, Instagram\u2019s head of design, said in an interview that experiences on Instagram are subjective \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration may be another person\u2019s pleasure \u2014 and that the app was not designed to be a time-suck. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the game to have you leave Instagram feeling worse off than when you went in,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the departed founders of a company Facebook acquired, WhatsApp\u2019s Brian Acton, has actively encouraged people to delete Facebook, though he is still a proponent and a user of WhatsApp. (He is also funding a rival messaging app.) Other former Facebook executives have expressed regrets about the products they built. Instagram\u2019s Systrom continues to champion the service but recently said of his departure: \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a job because everything is awesome, right?\u201d\n\nII.\n\nWhen Richardson joined Instagram in February 2012, at age 26, the former art history major was drawn to what was then a fast-growing indie platform for photographers, hipsters and artistic-types who wanted to share interesting or beautiful things they discovered about the world. At that time, Instagram was \u201ca camera that looked out into the world,\" said one of the company\u2019s first engineers, \"versus a camera that was all about myself, my friends, who I\u2019m with.\u201d\n\nRichardson ran the start-up\u2019s blog as well as the official @instagram account from the company\u2019s offices in San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood. Before there were software algorithms suggesting accounts to follow, Richardson selected featured Instagrammers by hand. For the most devoted users, she organized in-person \u201cInsta-meets\u201d in places as far-flung as Moscow and North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe felt like stewards of that passion,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\n\nRichardson moved to New York after leaving Instagram. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the first people she featured prominently was an early Instagrammer in Spain. The exposure Richardson gave @IsabelitaVirtual, an amateur photographer whose real name is Isabel Martinez, helped Martinez become one of the most popular Instagram users in the country and led to a career in high-end fashion photography.\n\nBoth say that type of random connection that resulted in their friendship is hardly possible in the current iteration of Instagram. Too many people to follow, too much showmanship, too many posts flickering by, they say. \u201cI don\u2019t even see her posts anymore,\u201d Richardson said. Martinez told The Post that while she wouldn\u2019t quit Instagram for professional reasons, the app has in recent years become more anxiety-producing than pleasurable for her.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s former security chief warns of tech\u2019s \u2018negative impacts\u2019 \u2014 and has a plan to help solve them]\n\nEven in the early days, Richardson was aware that the app had a dark side. She was one of the first content moderators and spent many days and weekends culling through pornographic and other undesirable images that sprung up as the app grew.\n\nIII.\n\nA few months after Richardson started her job at Instagram, Systrom announced to the dozen employees that the company had been acquired by Facebook \u2014 taking everyone by surprise. The entire team got in a bus and drove about 30 miles south to Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, where Facebook employees broke into applause as they entered the building. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took them into his office, where he welcomed them excitedly and assured them that they would maintain their own unique identity.\n\nRichardson said she was excited but apprehensive. The details of the acquisition were still murky. Ultimately only Systrom and Krieger walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars; Facebook offered other early employees small signing bonuses and limited Facebook stock grants for staying on. And Facebook had a reputation for alienating users with its privacy scandals, including charges it had settled with the Federal Trade Commission the previous year for sharing people\u2019s personal details that they thought were private with app developers and the public.\n\nA few months later, the team was officially installed in Menlo Park, where Instagram was given a separate area on campus to work.\n\nIts employees were seen as the cool kids on campus. They had figured out how to make a smartphone-only product go viral, something Facebook was still struggling to accomplish ahead of its impending public offering.\n\nBut there were things Facebook wanted to improve about Instagram. Facebook\u2019s growth team \u2014 an influential unit whose goal was to identify and implement measures to acquire users and keep them engaged \u2014 came in and picked apart every feature of the app, three of the former employees said.\n\nNo detail was too small. The team helped fix Instagram\u2019s clunky sign-in process, which was leaking users. It borrowed techniques that had worked on Facebook, like sending users an email alert about their friends\u2019 activities when they hadn\u2019t used the app in a while. They rolled out photo-tagging, much to the frustration of Instagram employees, who felt these features were too associated with Facebook and would fall flat with Instagram\u2019s user base, said four of the employees.\n\nThe photo-tagging feature triggered \u201cemotional anxiety,\u201d said the early engineer. \u201cIt introduced a whole new dynamic.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s team of about six employees, which was focused on managing Instagram\u2019s most passionate power users, was also targeted for change. Facebook told them that in order for the product to scale to a large audience, software tools would need to replace manual processes, Richardson and two former employees said.\n\nRichardson said she was taken aback, \u201cnot because of the boldness of it or because of how crappy it made me and my contribution feel, but because of the misunderstanding of what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nShe began making plans to leave and resigned in 2014, along with most of the employees The Post spoke with. By then, the app had more than 200 million users, compared with roughly 30 million at the time of the acquisition. Three of the original 13 employees are still at Instagram or Facebook, according to Facebook.\n\nInstagram moved to an algorithmic feed in 2016 \u2014 prior to that posts were in chronological order \u2014 and software is now doing much of the discovery on behalf of users, feeding them tailored content. The Stories feature, added the same year, introduced a flickering element to Instagram\u2019s design by automatically reloading new stories in a carousel. The result of these changes and others prior to it was increased follower counts, produced larger social networks with weaker ties, and more time spent in the app.\n\nRichardson, who is a big fan of hedgehogs, found herself looking at many more of them on Instagram. \u201cI clicked on one, but then I get dozens, which is more than my brain can possibly manage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes all the agency out of it.\u201d\n\n[A content moderator says she got PTSD while reviewing images posted on Facebook]\n\nSpalter, the Instagram design chief, pointed out that Instagram\u2019s rapid growth has required the company to build tools that will assist people in finding posts and users. \u201cWe have a billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we have content from every weird niche interest, and we have made it easier for you to find things. That\u2019s also the beauty of having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nInstagram is aware that its software was offering up too much celebrity content and content from people with large followings at the expense of posts from people who users know personally, according to Spalter, who joined Instagram in 2015. The company has rejiggered the software to adjust the balance, he said.\n\n\u201cManaging that balance is critical to Instagram\u2019s future. ... If you feed gets overrun with celebrities, you won\u2019t feel comfortable sharing content with your friends anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI get how, in the early days, when you\u2019re connecting with everyone, that\u2019s very special. We\u2019re at a different phase of development at this point, and it\u2019s a different world in that way. But it\u2019s still a place where people connect.\u201d\n\nHe added that Instagram released tools in August to help people manage the time they spend on the app.\n\nRichardson says that content on Instagram is now \u201ctoo eager for your attention.\u201d Before, \u201cyou had to make an effort to find someone, and that meant something to you and to the people you found. Today I\u2019m amazed by how little honor each piece of content is given.\u201d\n\n\n\nBailey Richardson's final Instagram story. (Courtesy of Bailey Richardson )\n\nAfter leaving Instagram, Richardson traveled around the world, meeting Instagram users whom she had connected with online. She eventually settled in New York City, where she founded a start-up called People & Company, where she helps nonprofits and businesses, including Nike, find ways to connect with their audiences online.\n\nShe says she wasn\u2019t thinking actively about Instagram until late September, when news broke that its founders were resigning \u2014 once again taking most of their employees by surprise.\n\nRichardson was flooded with memories. She remembered first meeting Martinez, and all that had changed since. She called up a friend from her Instagram days, and they concluded that Instagram no longer had value in their lives. Together, they decided to quit. She composed her last post while sitting in her car.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all addicted to a drug that doesn\u2019t get us high anymore,\u201d she said of the decision. \u201cSo I wanted to make space for something that really does.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ann Hornaday", "title": "\u2018Widows\u2019 isn\u2019t a feel-good feminist heist movie \u2014 and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so great", "description": "Every scene carries with it a sharp-eyed commentary on American life.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/widows-isnt-a-feel-good-feminist-heist-movie--and-thats-why-its-so-great/2018/11/14/36e15586-e2d0-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/17L68JmIBN9v2-Ll4ykOBi93QYg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJU6NRGXDMI6RLVX3XFNJIFFJY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:12:00Z", "content": "Rating: From its first moments, Widows signals that audiences arent in for just another heist movie.

We commence with a tender, deeply sensuous moment between Veronica Rawlins (Viola Davis) and her husband, Harry (Liam Neeson), drawing viewers into their vicarious pleasure and obvious love for each other. A smash cut later, we\u2019re in the midst of a chaotic crime scene, where a group of men in a van do desperate, bloody battle with the police who are chasing them, a confrontation that concludes with a shocking moment of explosive violence.\n\nDirector Steve McQueen toggles with cool, muscular confidence between these two diametrically opposed scenarios, assuring spectators that they\u2019re in exactly the right hands for the twisty, often graphically brutalizing journey to come. It turns out that Harry \u2014 a career criminal who lives in sleek splendor in a Mies van der Rohe building in Chicago \u2014 has been killed in that opening conflagration, which also vaporized the $5 million he and his accomplices stole. When Veronica \u2014 a union official \u2014 learns that Harry owed a portion of the loot to a local gangster turned politician, she flies into task-oriented action, recruiting the wives of Harry\u2019s henchmen to make one last big score.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\nAdapted by McQueen and novelist Gillian Flynn from a British television series, \u201cWidows\u201d faithfully obeys the most visceral beats of a classic caper flick, with none of the genre\u2019s playfulness or light-footed deviltry. Davis\u2019s Veronica is a somber, supremely focused manager who assembles a grimly efficient team of women who have been blindsided by the harsh truths their men left behind: Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) is on the verge of having her dress shop repossessed because of her late husband\u2019s gambling debts; Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) has been counseled \u2014 by her own mother \u2014 to exploit her statuesque beauty by joining a website matching wealthy men to attractive gold diggers.\n\nAs Veronica begins to suss out the myriad mysteries behind what Harry did for a living, and as she and the team plan and rehearse the Big Job, it becomes clear that McQueen doesn\u2019t intend for \u201cWidows\u201d to be merely a hard-edge version of \u201cOcean\u2019s 8.\u201d Instead, he pulls the lens back to contextualize the heist within the larger, labyrinthine, pervasively corrupt world of Chicago itself, where the women\u2019s enterprise brings them in contact not just with Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), a crime boss now running for alderman, but with Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), whose father, Tom (Robert Duvall), long ago secured that seat for the family and has no intention of seeing it ceded to immigrants or \u201cpeople who can\u2019t stop having babies.\u201d\n\nMillennial-adjacent and hip to 21st-century optics, Jack makes sure to inoculate himself as a white man by concocting a self-serving (and self-enriching) publicity stunt involving a minority-women-owned work initiative. Exposing the cynical use of women of color as props is just one canny way that \u201cWidows\u201d threads real-world issues of race, class and gender throughout a narrative in which the protagonists are constantly tethered to a world where child care is an issue even for would-be criminal masterminds, where the question of where to buy a Glock is answered with a matter-of-fact \u201cThis is America\u201d and where, as a preacher intones at one point, \u201cignorance is the new excellence.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a world of hairdressers, receptionists and other female spaces that might be invisible to male eyes, but house vast stores of subversive power. When Belle (Cynthia Erivo) joins Veronica\u2019s no-nonsense sisterhood as a driver, she\u2019s fitting it in with other gigs as a stylist and babysitter, leaving her own kids at home while she runs any hustle she can to get by. Every scene of \u201cWidows\u201d carries with it a sharp-eyed commentary on American life, from its cultural love of violence to its vastly unequal economic system, from its nominal embrace of pluralism to its Darwinian politics. The movie is punctuated by moments of pitiless, horrifying savagery, and one genuinely breathtaking plot twist. But its most memorable quality is the clear-eyed, compassionate honesty with which it depicts the wearying workaday world of navigating structures and interpersonal dynamics inimical to one\u2019s health, safety and very being.\n\nWorking with his longtime cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, McQueen photographs \u201cWidows\u201d with handsome austerity, favoring clean, hard surfaces that literally and figuratively reflect the film\u2019s brittle tone. And he has cast his movie brilliantly, most notably with Davis, Debicki, Rodriguez and Erivo, whose businesslike chemistry belies the sentimentalized brand of sisterhood that Hollywood likes to sell as feel-good feminism. In an equally outstanding supporting cast, Henry, Farrell and Duvall are joined by Lukas Haas, Jacki Weaver and Daniel Kaluuya in the most chilling turn of his career.\n\nWhen it comes to the climactic sequence, \u201cWidows\u201d succumbs to one or two lapses in logic; or maybe it moves so swiftly that viewers may not catch every nuance. Still, it proves how smarts and style can elevate even the pulpiest material into something shrewd, socially attuned and bracingly observant. Rarely has a movie been so illuminated by a single character simply breaking into a smile, and rarely has a smile been so unequivocally earned."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CindyBoren", "title": "The Cowboys may be 'dysfunctional,' but Troy Aikman still thinks they could win the NFC East - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The Cowboys may be 'dysfunctional,' but Troy Aikman still thinks they could win the NFC East Washington Post Let's climb into the ol' wayback machine and set it for one week ago.

(Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)\n\nLet\u2019s climb into the ol\u2019 wayback machine and set it for one week ago. That\u2019s when Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboys' Hall of Famer and Fox Sports analyst, dropped a bombshell by calling for a \u201ccomplete overhaul\u201d of the \u201cdysfunctional\u201d organization.\n\nFast forward a week, and now Aikman thinks the 4-5 Cowboys could actually win the NFC East this season. Really. No lie. He said it on the radio and everything.\n\n\u201cI would probably put it on Dallas, in all honesty,\u201d Aikman replied when asked which team he\u2019d put a dollar on to win the division.\n\n\u201cI think that win at Philadelphia certainly positioned them very well,\u201d Aikman said during his weekly KTCK-FM 96.7 The Ticket radio appearance (via the Dallas Morning News). \u201cWashington was able to win; Tampa Bay had over 500 yards of offense against them and they still win, that\u2019s unheard of. The next week or so will be interesting to see what happens and whether or not Washington is able to extend their lead with Dallas going to Atlanta. I think that\u2019s going to be a really tough ballgame with Atlanta coming off a difficult loss, but they are capable of scoring points.\u201d\n\nYes, these are the same Cowboys who lost Nov. 5 to the Tennessee Titans in a performance that triggered Aikman\u2019s brutal assessment. The Redskins, 6-3 after their ugly victory over Tampa Bay, face the Houston Texans on Sunday, then play the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. Which means that, perhaps, the division is there for the taking after all.\n\n\u201cThe Thanksgiving game is huge. If Dallas can keep it within two games going into Thanksgiving and win that game, I think they\u2019re positioned pretty well,\u201d Aikman said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve got Philadelphia now at home bodes well for the Cowboys as well. Right now if I had to pick someone, I\u2019d pick Dallas.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins defense has been solid most of the season, but it gave up those 501 yards \u2014 but just three points \u2014 to the Buccaneers. Aikman pointed out that Washington has been decimated by injuries, especially to the offensive line.\n\n[What Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s decision to sit out the season means for him and for the Steelers]\n\n\u201cI think the defense for Dallas is going to have to continue to have the type of game like they had the other night,\u201d Aikman said, referring to Sunday\u2019s Eagles game. \u201cBut I just think Washington is so beat up. How they\u2019re doing it is pretty remarkable. I think Jay Gruden has done a really good job considering what all they have lost.\"\n\nAikman didn\u2019t spare owner Jerry Jones when it came to his criticism last week, and he still differs with Jones on how to handle the future of quarterback Dak Prescott. Unlike Jones, Aikman would bide his time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Dak Prescott fan, was really happy for him to come out and respond the way he did [against the Eagles],\u201d Aikman said. \u201cIf you do invest that money in him, you know what you\u2019re going to get. With Dak, I know he\u2019ll be even more committed to being great and helping the team win a championship. . . . I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pay him, but [the] longer you can hold off to be certain of evaluations, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that either.\n\nThat, too, could depend on how the rest of the season shakes out. Here\u2019s how the post-Thanksgiving stretch run looks for both the Cowboys and Redskins:\n\nCowboys: Saints at Dallas on Nov. 29, Eagles at Dallas on Dec. 9, Dallas at Colts on Dec. 16, Buccaneers at Dallas on Dec. 23, Dallas at Giants on Dec. 30.\n\nRedskins: Washington at Eagles on Dec. 3, Giants at Washington on Dec. 9, Washington at Jaguars on Dec. 16, Washington at Titans on Dec. 22 and Eagles at Washington on Dec. 30.\n\nWith apologies to Aikman, we\u2019ll note that the Eagles are 4-5, too. Here\u2019s how the rest of the season shapes up for them:\n\nEagles: Philadelphia at Saints on Sunday, Giants at Philadelphia on Nov. 25, Redskins at Philadelphia on Dec. 3, Philadelphia at Cowboys on Dec. 9, Philadelphia at Rams on Dec. 16, Texans at Philadelphia on Dec. 23 and Philadelphia at Redskins on Dec. 30.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nMarco Rubio roasted for \u20183 pt kick\u2019 tweet about Florida election\n\nBoswell: Josh Norman doesn\u2019t know Redskins history\n\nNFL moves Rams-Chiefs game from Mexico City to Los Angeles, citing poor field conditions\n\nFour years after leaving Texans, D.J.

It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supplying weapons to Somalia\u2019s Islamic extremist al-Shabab rebels, who are opposed to the Somali government, and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nEritrea\u2019s Charge d\u2019Affaires Amanuel Giorgio called the sanctions \u201cunwarranted punitive measures\u201d and told the council after the vote that \u201cthe long overdue call for justice is finally answered.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the people of Eritrea \u201con this historic day,\u201d and stressed that \u201cEritreans are extremely joyous and full of pride to have witnessed the recent positive regional developments ...

The government announced the cybersecurity initiative in the summer.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of cyberattacks resulting in major economic losses is growing,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a meeting in Abe\u2019s office in July.\n\nSakurada has been in charge of Olympic preparations since early October, but he has faced extraordinary grilling over his position in recent weeks and has fumbled while responding to simple questions, including about how much the event would cost and whether North Korean officials would be allowed to attend.\n\nThe politician has a long-standing reputation for making ill-advised comments \u2014 most notably in 2016, when he described the \u201ccomfort women\u201d forced into providing sexual services to the troops of Imperial Japan in occupied territories as \u201cprofessional prostitutes.\u201d\n\nThe comment sparked an angry response from Seoul, and Sakurada later apologized.\n\nThe Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the Japanese government had been considering having a different cabinet minister handle the revision of the cybersecurity laws, amid concerns about Sakurada\u2019s handling of the matter during questioning in parliament.\n\nSakurada\u2019s lack of tech savvy is not necessarily unusual in Japan\u2019s aging society, where those older than 65 are estimated to make up 28 percent of the population. A government survey from 2015 found that over two-thirds of people older than 60 had little or no access to the Internet.\n\nSome other high-profile figures around the world also lack familiarity with technology: President Trump is reported as not using a computer, though he frequently tweets from his phone.\n\nRead more:\n\nJapan sets a new record number for people over 100 years old \u2014 and almost all are women\n\nA Japanese medical school does an about-face after lowering women\u2019s test scores to help men\n\nJapan kills endangered whales for \u2018science\u2019 and sells the meat.

(Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News)\n\nIt has been, by any objective standard, a tough week for President Trump.\n\nA week ago Monday, he was crisscrossing the Eastern United States, rallying in support of Republican candidates in the hopes of offsetting a Democratic surge on Election Day. Three times in one day he stood behind a lectern and riffed on politics, enjoying the energetic agreement of his supporters in the room. And then, on Nov. 6, the rallies came to an end along with the idea that the midterm election may not be the sort of rebuke that he\u2019d feared. His party held the Senate, sure, but it was expected to. It lost the House by a margin that grows wider every day as votes keep coming in.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report that this was only one component of Trump\u2019s frustrating week. A planned trip to Paris \u2014 something of a consolation prize for his desired military parade being tabled \u2014 meant days surrounded by U.S. allies, people he often finds annoying. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Eli Stokols catalogued Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the world over the past seven days, including canceling a trip to Colombia, skipping a ceremony at a cemetery for Americans outside Paris and not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day.\n\n\u201cTrump needs adulation, so heading into the midterms, holding these rallies, he was cheered, and it became narcissistic fuel to his engine,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told Dawsey and Rucker. \u201cAfter the midterm, it\u2019s the sober dawn of the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment, according to multiple administration sources,\u201d Stokols writes.\n\nWe can actually visualize the shift in energy in the White House. His daily schedule \u2014 which doesn\u2019t necessarily include every activity on his plate \u2014 shows the frenetic pace of the days before the election. Trips to rallies stacked atop one another, a presidential event or meeting occasionally slotted in.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nNotice the week of Oct. 22: In addition to three rallies, Trump also held meetings and events, a sort of typical baseline of activity for the president. There was still plenty of time to tweet and watch Fox News Channel, but he also signed legislation, gave speeches, addressed policy issues and received his daily intelligence briefing.\n\nExclude the trip to France over the weekend (and that aborted excursion to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery), and Trump\u2019s schedule since that frenetic pre-election Monday has included:\n\nTwo intelligence briefings\n\nTwo meetings (both with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo)\n\nOne ceremony (celebrating Diwali)\n\nOne news conference\n\nOne event (the investiture of Brett M. Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court)\n\nOver the course of eight days.\n\nThose last two events, one could argue, were ones that allowed Trump some sliver of that pre-election joy. Kavanaugh was a political success for the president, both in terms of the confirmation vote in the Senate and in terms of motivating his base. The news conference gave Trump an opportunity to spin the results of the election, however unsuccessfully.\n\nAs of writing on Wednesday morning, Trump hasn\u2019t even tweeted in nearly 18 hours. That\u2019s not a record, but there are few better signs of Trump having withdrawn from the world \u2014 at least temporarily."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Passengers reach China after 3-day layover in Siberia - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Passengers reach China after 3-day layover in Siberia Washington Post MOSCOW \u2014 More than 250 airline passengers who endured an unexpected three-day layover in Russia's Siberia region have finally made it to their destination in China.

A certain amount of controlled chaos is inevitable. But there\u2019s ordinary White House chaos, and then there\u2019s Trump White House chaos.\n\nNew reporting paints a picture of the administration descending into a thunderdome of backstabbing and resentment as staffers jockey for position or wonder whether they should get the heck out, all presided over by an erratic, unhappy president. This might sound like a familiar story, but if it isn\u2019t already worse than it has been before, it soon will be, especially now that the midterm elections have cast a cloud over the remaining two years of President Trump\u2019s term.\n\nLet\u2019s run down a few of the highlights:\n\nTrump\u2019s trip to France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I was a disaster, marked by a brooding and petulant president mocked and condemned wherever he went. Angry about his party\u2019s midterm losses, Trump has spent his time in the past week insulting reporters in terms that are unusually personal even for him, spinning out desperate conspiracy theories about stolen elections on Twitter and lashing out at Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAfter deciding not to attend a ceremony honoring those killed in the war because rain apparently made it inconvenient to get there, Trump grew enraged at his staff \u201cfor not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\u201d Somehow he was not able to figure out for himself that doing so might not go over well.\n\nTrump \u201ctold advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump is considering replacing Kelly with Nick Ayers, Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, \u201caides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus.\u201d\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump\u2019s staff issued an extraordinary statement saying a top national security aide, Mira R. Ricardel, \u201cno longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d making public a bureaucratic feud that stretches between the White House and the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cWith the certainty that the incoming Democratic House majority will go after his tax returns and investigate his actions, and the likelihood of additional indictments by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Trump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s firing of Jeff Sessions and appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, a move meant to protect him from the Mueller investigation, is turning out to be a mini-scandal in its own right, to the point where the president vacillates between singing Whitaker\u2019s praises and claiming he doesn\u2019t know him.\n\nThe root of all this is the midterm elections, and it\u2019s hard to overstate what an impact they\u2019ll have on the administration. Nobody likes losing, of course, but nobody hates it more than Trump, particularly after he worked so hard in the weeks leading up to the election, telling his supporters that \u201cI\u2019m not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me.\u201d It was indeed, and he was pretty emphatically rejected.\n\nNothing is more upsetting to Trump than being considered a loser, even temporarily. But I suspect that the prospect of having his tax returns made public has him even more frightened. We don\u2019t know what they will reveal, but suffice to say that no sane person believes that all we\u2019ll discover when they\u2019re opened up is that Trump took advantage of some loopholes and did some creative accounting here and there. Everything we know about Trump\u2019s career \u2014 not least the recent revelation that he and his family engaged in a years-long conspiracy to commit tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale \u2014 suggests that those returns will be a Pandora\u2019s box of scandal.\n\nSo that would account for the president\u2019s dark mood. But if you\u2019re one of his staffers, you\u2019re probably gripped by an equally strong sense of foreboding, or at a minimum the feeling that the fun times are over. Not only won\u2019t there be any more conservative legislation to pass, but also Democrats will be launching one investigation after another, probing everything you\u2019ve done for the past two years. If you\u2019re senior enough, you may get hauled before House committees to be grilled mercilessly. You might even need to get yourself a lawyer, which can be a real burden on a government salary.\n\nSo you go to work every day wondering when the hammer is going to fall on you. Is one of your colleagues plotting against you? Are you going to get a congressional subpoena? Is today the day that the president turns his wrath on you in his endless search for others to blame for his problems and his mistakes?\n\nWhen everyone around you feels that way, too, things get a little uneasy. Describing the White House right now, one former Trump aide told Politico, \u201cIt\u2019s like an episode of \u2018Maury,'\u201d referencing the daytime TV show famous for bitter family arguments. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s missing is a paternity test.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no mystery about who the father of this mess is. He\u2019s sitting in the Oval Office, scared and angry that the accountability he has outrun his entire life might actually catch up to him.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s xenophobic fearmongering backfired in 2018.

The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran.\n\nTrump hollered at British Prime Minister Theresa May in a phone call, berated aides and insisted on personnel changes likely to worsen morale in an already besieged White House. It is this ongoing funk that may explain his baseless attacks on the voting recount in Florida and his lashing out at CNN reporter Abby Phillip. (\u201cTrump sent political aides in Washington scrambling to prepare detailed briefings for him on the still-to-be-called races. He aired baseless allegations of voter irregularities on Twitter. . . .

And yet, they continue to mislead the public, and remain silent after leaving, as to the president\u2019s ability to carry out his duties.\n\nTrump apologists, as they habitually do, will deny and disbelieve reporting. But foreign leaders, outside friends, members of Congress and others who observe him on a daily basis now spill their guts to the media, perhaps to distance themselves from the White House\u2019s downward spiral.\n\nThere are several takeaways from all of this.\n\nFirst, Trump will get worse under pressure. If he is this bad now, imagine what he\u2019ll be like if more associates are indicted, the economy goes to seed or the subpoenas start flying. At some point, unless Trump has him fired, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will issue his report. Unless it miraculously exonerates him, the president may have a meltdown that will make his trip to France look like a picnic.\n\nSecond, self-described saviors of the country, such as the anonymous op-ed writer, are deluding themselves if they believe they are preventing the president from harming the country. Daily, he threatens democratic norms, blemishes the United States\u2019 reputation around the world and makes worse and worse personnel decisions in an effort to surround himself with more compliant aides. If Trump fires Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, it is not clear how many more erratic decisions will be made or how serious the ramifications may be.\n\nThird, all of this points to the gross irresponsibility of Republicans who, for two years, refused to exercise any oversight and continue to spin on his behalf. They would rather excuse the conduct of an unbalanced and hysterical commander in chief then move to limit his powers (e.g., reassert that a first strike is an act of war requiring congressional authorization, claw back power to enact tariffs). They likely will continue to rubber-stamp his executive branch picks, no matter how unprepared and temperamentally unfit they may be. Even more reprehensible, they will heartily endorse him for reelection while maligning his challengers. Maybe if they see control of the Senate slipping away, they will finally cut him loose.\n\nAll of this reminds us that Democratic control of the House is only a halfway measure. Unless and until Trump is out of office, the country, our democracy and our security remain at risk.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat\u2019s a defeated or retired Republican to do?\n\nTrump\u2019s era of hate\n\nThe Republican Party has a woman problem\n\nThe world is moving on from Trump.

Whitaker as acting attorney general, rejecting criticism from some lawyers that the move violates the Constitution.\n\nSince the announcement last week, some have charged that Whitaker, who served as the chief of staff to the previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is ineligible to serve as head of the Justice Department because he is not a Senate-confirmed official.\n\n[Read the Justice Department memo about the Whitaker appointment]\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, a Democrat, asked a federal judge to block Whitaker\u2019s appointment, arguing that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein should instead take on the role.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal guidance to the federal government, said in a 20-page memo that past practice, court rulings and legal analysis show the Whitaker appointment is legal. In particular, it says the scenario is expressly authorized by the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nThe memo also notes that before Sessions was forced out of the job, the White House had sought advice from the OLC and was told that Whitaker could be appointed.\n\n\u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the president may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo notes that Trump has now done it six times, while President Barack Obama did it twice and that President George W. Bush did it once.\n\nInterestingly, the legal opinion also concludes that even if Trump had fired Sessions, he could have replaced him with a non-Senate-confirmed government employee for a period of up to seven months, or more if a nomination was pending. By that reasoning, the president has the power to remove Cabinet-level officials at will and put their replacements in charge of major government branches for half a year or more.\n\n[Maryland challenges legality of Whitaker appointment as attorney general]\n\nCritics of the Whitaker selection have argued that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act should not take precedence over other statutes and the Constitution\u2019s formula for replacing senior government officials.\n\nTrump tapped Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general last week after Sessions resigned at the president\u2019s request. Whitaker\u2019s elevation has raised concerns about his qualifications, his past statements as a U.S. Senate candidate and his business practices.\n\nThe OLC\u2019s legal analysis of the practice found 160 such instances \u2014 all of them occurring before 1860 \u2014 in which a non-Senate-confirmed official became the acting head of an agency. In 1866, a non-Senate-confirmed assistant attorney general served as an acting attorney general, according to the memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven A.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nWith last week\u2019s midterms largely in the rearview mirror, leadership elections are the order of the day on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn morning meetings, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) won the votes to keep their posts next year.\n\nHouse Republicans \u2014 who will become the minority party in that chamber in January \u2014 picked Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as their leader. He fended off a conservative challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nHouse Democrats are not picking leaders until later this month but could have the most interesting day of all, as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) seeks to corral the support she would need to become speaker amid speculation that she lacks the votes.\n\n2:05 p.m.: Cheney selected for No. 3 GOP leadership post in House\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) was chosen by her Republican colleagues Wednesday to serve as House Republican conference chair, the No. 3 GOP spot in the House.\n\nCheney, who first won election in 2016, is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney.\n\nShe launched her bid for the post last Wednesday with a letter to colleagues in which she criticized Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who has held the position for three terms. McMorris Rodgers announced the next day that she was stepping aside from her leadership role and instead seeking to climb the ranks of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe elder Cheney, who served as GOP conference chair from 1987 to 1989, was present for Wednesday\u2019s vote for his daughter.\n\n1:55 p.m.: McCarthy elected minority leader; Scalise becomes minority whip\n\nMcCarthy ascended to the top job in House Republican leadership Wednesday, turning back a challenge from Jordan, a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nMcCarthy prevailed 159-43, according to the House press gallery.\n\nWith Republicans losing the House last week, the two were vying to become minority leader to replace the retiring Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nThe No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. Scalise had mulled a bid against McCarthy but announced last week that he was pursuing the minority whip spot instead.\n\nMcCarthy, the current House majority leader, made a bid for speaker in 2015 but stepped aside amid pressure from conservatives. With Ryan\u2019s backing \u2014 as well as a close relationship with President Trump \u2014 McCarthy prevailed over Jordan.\n\nThe California Republican has leveraged his alliance with Trump to his advantage on Capitol Hill, where the president looms large over the House GOP conference.\n\nTrump has referred to McCarthy as \u201cmy Kevin\u201d since before his inauguration, and McCarthy has at times gone to great lengths to curry favor with Trump, both through legislation \u2014 such as by introducing a bill that would appropriate more than $23 billion to Trump\u2019s border wall plan \u2014 and other means, such as sending the president his favorite candies.\n\n1:15 p.m.: Pelosi touts support of NARAL Pro-Choice America\n\nIn her bid to become speaker, Pelosi on Wednesday touted the support of a leading abortion rights group, NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nIn a statement shared by Pelosi\u2019s office, the House minority leader was widely praised by the group\u2019s president, Ilyse Hogue.\n\n\u201cShe is a true champion for women and families and will stand up to Donald Trump and the Republicans\u2019 relentless attacks on our rights and freedoms,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cNow more than ever, we need strong leaders who will fight passionately to defend and proactively expand our rights. That\u2019s Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nAs Pelosi seeks to round up needed votes, she has run into resistance from some of her female colleagues, particularly those newer to the House.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Ryan says it\u2019s time to talk about a replacement for Pelosi\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi for a leadership position two years ago, said Wednesday that opposition to her speakership bid is strong enough for Democrats to start talking about who is going to replace her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent out there. A lot of them don\u2019t want to step forward,\u201d Ryan said, referring to other potential candidates for House speaker. \u201cThis is obviously not an easy thing to do to take on the leadership. But once we get to the point we know we\u2019re going to have new leadership, I think a lot of people will emerge to run.\u201d\n\n12:45 p.m.: House Democrats offer varying rationales on speaker vote\n\nHouse Democrats are offering divergent views about whether Pelosi is best-suited to take over the speaker\u2019s gavel when the party takes control of the chamber in January.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (Calif) argued that denying the job to a woman would be problematic.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we have won the House majority because of women candidates with huge women turnout, to then deny the first woman speaker who led us to that victory the gavel, I think would be a slap in the face of a lot of voters who sent us here,\u201d Khanna said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) said she plans to stick by a promise made to voters in her district not to support Pelosi for speaker.\n\n\u201cI made a commitment to my district that I would not be supporting Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cI think there are some great people that will be coming forward, and I\u2019m excited to see who those people might be. They haven\u2019t identified themselves yet, but we have such a deep bench of talent in the Democratic Party. So I\u2019m excited to see what comes next.\u201d\n\n11:55 a.m.: Pelosi touts growing labor union support\n\nIn her bid to become House speaker, Pelosi on Wednesday highlighted a growing number of endorsements from labor groups, including the Service Employees International Union, which spent heavily to help elect Democrats to Congress this year.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office released a letter from SEIU President Mary Kay Henry saying the minority leader had demonstrated her support for the union\u2019s key issues, including increasing the minimum wage and improving Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nPelosi on Wednesday also won the support of the United Steelworkers, which issued a statement praising \u201cher proven track record of getting things done.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Pelosi released a letter from 11 other unions that are endorsing her speakership bid. Six of those were new endorsements: the Air Line Pilots Association, American Federation of Government Employees, United Auto Workers, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, United Food and Commercial Workers and National Association of Letter Carriers.\n\n11:45 a.m.: Ernst prevails in race for GOP\u2019s No. 5 spot in Senate\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) emerged as the winner Wednesday over Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) in the contest for vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.\n\nThe race for the No. 5 position among Senate Republicans pitted two female lawmakers against one another for a spot in GOP leadership ranks dominated by white men.\n\nMcConnell has said he has been seeking to add women to the leadership team for years.\n\n11:15 a.m.: Fudge says she has not ruled out challenging Pelosi for speaker\n\nRep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) said Wednesday that she is being encouraged to run for speaker if Pelosi does not have the votes.\n\n\u201cI have ruled out nothing,\u201d Fudge told reporters. \u201cBut what I\u2019m saying is I haven\u2019t given it any thought. I am getting encouraged. That is what made me start finally thinking about it.\u201d\n\nFudge said that \u201cit\u2019s clear\u201d she will not support Pelosi for speaker. She said she expects other Democratic candidates to emerge if it becomes likely that Pelosi, the current minority leader, does not have the votes in January.\n\n\u201cLet us just hypothetically say that there are not enough votes for her to win on the floor,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cSomeone will emerge, if no one has emerged before that. We\u2019re not going to allow the Republicans to have a speaker.\u201d\n\n11:05 a.m.: Pelosi: \u201cI will be speaker of the House\u201d\n\nPelosi sought to push back Wednesday on another Democrat\u2019s prediction that she would fall short in her bid to become speaker next year.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a leader of the anti-Pelosi faction, is advancing the idea that Pelosi cannot round up enough support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy person, but I will be the speaker of the House no matter what he said,\u201d Pelosi told reporters in response.\n\n11 a.m.: Leading Pelosi opponent raises possibility that Pelosi could be speaker if other changes are secured\n\nRep. Ed Perl\u00admutter (D-Colo.), a leading opponent of Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speakership, said Wednesday that the now-minority leader could possibly be elected speaker if other changes are made in the ranks of Democratic leadership.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a possibility,\u201d Perl\u00admutter told reporters. \u201cBut there haven\u2019t been any discussions about that, but it\u2019s certainly a possibility.\u201d\n\nPerlmutter did not spell out what changes would be necessary for Pelosi to garner the support of those Democrats opposed to her speakership bid, but there has been talk about asking her to limit her tenure and shaking up the No. 2 and No. 3 Democratic positions in the House.\n\nSome Democrats are also interested in rule changes that would decentralize power in the chamber.\n\n\u201cPeople want to see change, and I think a lot of these candidates ran on change \u2014 and that includes our leadership team, which has been in place for 16 or 17 years now,\u201d Perl\u00admutter said. \u201cPeople ran saying they were coming to Washington for change, and this was a change election. So that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\n10:45 a.m.: Thune elected by Republicans as majority whip\n\nRepublicans, meeting behind closed doors, selected Sen. John Thune (S.D.) as the majority whip, according to his spokesman.\n\nThune succeeds Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) in the No. 2 GOP slot. Cornyn was term-limited.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Democrats reelect full leadership slate\n\nBesides maintaining Schumer as minority leader, Senate Democrats also decided Wednesday to keep the rest of their leadership team in place, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings.\n\nThat includes Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) as minority whip and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as assistant minority leader, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the results and requested anonymity.\n\nOthers retaining leadership positions included Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Mark R. Warner (Va.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.).\n\n10:15 a.m.: Senate Republicans reelect McConnell as their leader\n\nMeeting behind closed doors Wednesday, Senate Republicans decided to keep McConnell as majority leader, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings.\n\nMcConnell was elected by acclamation, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the result and requested anonymity.\n\nMcConnell led the GOP to victory in the midterm Senate elections, albeit by a narrow margin. Republicans have a 51-47 advantage in the chamber, with races in Florida and Mississippi unresolved.\n\n10:05 a.m.: Senate Democrats reelect Schumer as minority leader\n\nSenate Democrats on Wednesday decided to stick with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) as minority leader, according to a person familiar with the proceedings.\n\nSchumer was elected by acclamation during a closed-door meeting of Democrats, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the result and requested anonymity.\n\nAlthough Democrats fell short in claiming the Senate majority in the midterm elections, Schumer held losses to a minimum despite a brutal political map. Ten Democratic incumbents sought reelection in states President Trump won in 2016. Six won, while one race, Florida, remains unresolved.\n\n10 a.m.: Jordan not giving up without a fight for minority leader\n\nThough House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is on track to assume his party\u2019s top leadership post, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is not giving up without a fight.\n\nInside a closed-door meeting of dejected Republicans Tuesday night, Jordan made the case that he \u2014 a combative former champion wrestler who has served on high-profile committees and a fixture on cable news \u2014 would be best equipped to spar with Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world we haven\u2019t really seen,\u201d he said after the meeting, rattling off the names of incoming Democratic leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be intense, and I\u2019ve been in that world now for 12 years . . . So I think it\u2019s going to take an attitude and an intensity about standing up for the truth and fighting.\u201d\n\nWhile Jordan has a base of support on the far right of the Republican conference, McCarthy has developed close relationships across its whole breadth during his 12 years in office \u2014 much of it spent on the road, recruiting Republican candidate and raising tens of millions of dollars to elect them. Inside the meeting Tuesday, McCarthy made the case that he was best equipped not only to stand up to Democrats but to get the House back in GOP hands after the 2020 elections.\n\nMcCarthy declined to comment Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a proven record of working hard for everybody, not just one group or another group,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who survived a tough race last week. \u201cHe can represent the entire party. He\u2019s done it. It\u2019s not just talk.\u201d\n\nStill, many Republicans are calling for some sort of accountability following the party\u2019s massive losses. While the president\u2019s party has lost about 30 House seats on average in their first midterm election, Republicans are on track to lose closer to 40, with nine races still uncalled. At least four of those losses, and potentially as many as six, were in McCarthy\u2019s home state of California.\n\n9:25 a.m.: Gov. Rick Scott won\u2019t say whether he still considers Florida vote fraudulent\n\nAs newly elected Republican senators gathered for photos on Wednesday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) declined to say whether he still believes the vote count in his state is fraudulent.\n\nScott\u2019s race for Senate is under recount. Last week, he floated without evidence the possibility of \u201crampant fraud\u201d in two Democratic-leaning counties in Florida as his lead over Sen. Bill Nelson (D) narrowed.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Pelosi: \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm\u201d\n\nPelosi playfully invited challengers to her bid for speaker to step forward Wednesday.\n\nAsked by a reporter what she says to Democrats who are opposing her and may run against her, Pelosi said, \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase she has used on multiple occasions in recent days as she tries to shore up support.\n\nPelosi spoke ahead of a Democratic caucus meeting that she said would focus on the lame-duck session of Congress. The leadership race is expected to be the focus of another meeting later Wednesday.\n\nSeung Min Kim, Felicia Sonmez, Elise Viebeck and Erica Werner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Antonia Noori Farzan, The Washington Post", "title": "Mitch McConnell wrote an op-ed calling for bipartisanship, and people are not having it - SFGate", "description": "SFGate Mitch McConnell wrote an op-ed calling for bipartisanship, and people are not having it SFGate The date was Oct. 23, 2010 - nearly two years into President Barack Obama's first term and two weeks before the first midterm elections of his presidency.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe date was Oct. 23, 2010 \u2014 nearly two years into President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and two weeks before the first midterm elections of his presidency. Speaking to the National Journal, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a now-infamous statement: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has pointed out, reading the quote in its full context makes it clear that McConnell was saying that it would be impossible for Republicans to achieve their policy goals with Obama in office. But Democrats immediately seized on the remark as proof that Republicans had single-mindedly set out to obstruct Obama\u2019s agenda, putting partisanship ahead of the country\u2019s best interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, McConnell, now the majority leader, published a FoxNews.com op-ed that struck a very different note. \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d the headline asked. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t go over well with liberals, who rushed to point out McConnell\u2019s unparalleled chutzpah and accuse him of blatant hypocrisy.\n\nSuch an ironic Op-Ed title coming from you @senatemajldr - don\u2019t you think? https://t.co/RFJVeRp6z4 \u2014 Amy McGrath (@AmyMcGrathKY) November 14, 2018\n\nMy latest Op-Ed: \u201cOur number one priority should be ensuring that Mitch McConnell is an only-one-more-term Majority Leader.\u201d https://t.co/yiASk0S4ud \u2014 Pat Cunnane (@PatCunnane) November 14, 2018\n\nThe op-ed began with McConnell recounting what Republicans have accomplished over the past two years: passing tax cuts, confirming two Supreme Court nominees and rolling back federal regulations. \u201cAfter this prolific run, I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat can we realistically accomplish?\u201d\n\nThe good news, McConnell answered, is that \u201creports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated.\u201d Legislation targeting the opioid epidemic, increasing defense funding, reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and funding infrastructure improvements passed with support from both parties, he noted. Then, in an abrupt tack, he argued that Democrats, having regained control of the House, should refrain from investigating President Trump:\n\nThe Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation. And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? Last week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, McConnell (or, more likely, a member of his staff) posted a link to the op-ed on Twitter. By midnight, he had received over 29,000 replies. Virtually all of them were from aggrieved liberals, many of whom responded with just one name: Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, whose appointment was blocked by McConnell.\n\nAmong the other responses:\n\n\u201cI hope we work with you the same way you worked with President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that every time Mitch McConnell tries to use the word \u2018partisan\u2019 a pie should hit him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, you are in my lifetime one of the most zero-sum partisans I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics. That\u2019s not something to be proud of. It\u2019s the reason why Congress is so dysfunctional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kept Democrats off all committees and withheld all information, so no. Go eat worms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol seriously?! How often did you work with Dems? How many times did you shut them out of major decisions when you had the majority or rammed things down our throats? Maybe you should have had this epiphany before now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr McConnell, yes, you\u2019re the world\u2019s top expert on putting party above country. No one has ever done so more blatantly than you. But now YOU are calling for bipartisanship? Your hypocrisy is astounding. Obviously, no decent American is going to take you seriously.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the Twitter reaction late Tuesday night. It\u2019s worth noting that his sentiments, however unpopular online, are not entirely out of sync with top Democratic Party leaders. Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pledged that Democrats would \u201cstrive for bipartisanship\u201d and seek common ground with Republicans \u2014 a conciliatory stance that incurred the wrath of some of her constituents.\n\nPelosi, who is vying to become the next House speaker, also avoided making any definitive statements about potential investigations into the Trump administration at a news conference immediately after the midterms. Telling reporters that the House of Representatives has \u201ca constitutional responsibility to have oversight,\u201d she added that she didn\u2019t anticipate \u201cany scattershot freelancing\u201d on that front. Democrats, she said, are \u201ctrying to unify our country.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nShot in the neck at 17, this is the trauma surgeon now leading doctors against gun violence and the NRA\n\n\u2018Bill Clinton should want to apologize\u2019: Monica Lewinsky opens up about scandal in new documentary\n\nCan CNN beat the White House in court?

Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) by connecting him to President Barack Obama while making an \u201cH\u201d in the air to highlight Obama\u2019s middle name \u201cHussein.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning for Republican candidates during the midterms, Trump suggested that a caravan of Central Americans hoping to seek asylum in the United States could be infiltrated by people from the Middle East, something that was not supported by evidence. But the idea seemed meant to communicate to his conservative base that potential terrorists could be trying to enter the United States.\n\nThis year, many of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans seemed to follow him in the practice.\n\nMost recently, Sen.

Over a 90-year period starting in the late 1880s, Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nSome lawmakers called the comments from Hyde-Smith, whose opponent is former U.S. secretary of agriculture and congressman Mike Espy, reprehensible and demanded an apology. Espy is black.\n\nBut in Hyde-Smith\u2019s refusal to apologize, calling her remark an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard,\u201d the senator appeared to model what has become common in this political climate: widespread appeals to some on the fringes of decency at the risk of offending larger populations.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy will face off in a special election runoff Nov. 27.\n\nRepublican Ron DeSantis, who remains in a tight race for Florida\u2019s governor, was called out the day after he won his primary race for comments about his opponent that some deemed racist. The former lawmaker suggested that Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who could be elected Florida\u2019s first black governor, would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d if elected. The statement was followed by a robo-call from an anti-Gillum, self-proclaimed white supremacist group featuring monkeys making monkey sounds. DeSantis, who was not affiliated with the robo-call, called it \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nIn September, the National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad aimed at painting Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), a Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law graduate, as incapable of representing his district because of his past as a hip-hop artist.

Law enforcement agencies disclosed 7,175 hate crimes in America during 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. This is the third consecutive year that reported hate crimes have increased, and it\u2019s the single biggest spike since the surge of incidents targeting Muslims in 2001 after the attacks on Sept. 11.\n\nBut the reporting of these incidents remains uneven and inconsistent, both by victims and law enforcement. The definition of \u201chate crimes\u201d varies by state, as do punishments, and even the federal standard has shifted over time. The FBI, which has pleaded for more cooperation from local law enforcement, notes that about 1,000 more agencies contributed information for this year\u2019s report than last year\u2019s. But those additional numbers don\u2019t explain much of the increase. Massachusetts reports lots of incidents, for example, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there are more hate crimes per capita than in Mississippi, which experts say underreports.\n\n-- \u201cOf the hate crimes that likely occur each year in our country, only about 1 percent are reported in official federal statistics,\u201d estimates Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute.\n\n-- One especially startling figure: The FBI\u2019s new report shows anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 37 percent in 2017. \u201cThe new FBI data comes less than a month after the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history \u2014 a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 and wounded six,\u201d Devlin Barrett notes. \u201cThe suspect in that attack has been charged with dozens of federal hate crimes, and that one incident alone accounted for nearly as many hate crime killings as were recorded all of last year in the United States: 15.\u201d\n\n-- But the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s independent annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents, which the group has been tracking closely since 1979, found an even bigger jump of 57 percent in 2017, compared to 2016.\n\nThe ADL notes that 16,149 law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI\u2019s 2017 crime data collection effort, but only 2,040 of these agencies, about 13 percent, reported one or more hate crimes to the FBI. That means 87 percent of police agencies reported that there were zero hate crimes to the FBI. To prod them to be more forthcoming and/or change the way they classify incidents, the ADL posted a list of 91 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 people that either did not report any data to the FBI about hate crimes or reported that there were zero such crimes in their jurisdiction during 2017.\n\n-- Not knowing just how many hate crimes are truly happening makes it harder to address the problem. \u201cYou can\u2019t move what you can\u2019t measure,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is incumbent on police departments, mayors, governors and county officials across the country to tally hate crimes data and report it to the FBI. The FBI can only report the data they receive. We must do more to make sure that cities report credible data.\u201d\n\n-- A few specific examples: \u201cIn 2017, the city of Miami reported zero hate crimes, while Miami-Dade County reported one,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Jaweed Kaleem reports. \u201cOf the 28 law enforcement agencies the FBI requested numbers from in Mississippi, 27 reported zero hate crimes or did not respond. The one that replied said there was one hate crime during the year. \u2026 Olathe, Kan., the location of last year\u2019s deadly shooting of an Indian-born engineer after a man yelled at him about his immigration status, reported zero hate crimes.\u201d\n\n-- Some observers say that the climate of racial hatred has been stoked by President Trump's incendiary rhetoric, in which he has demeaned illegal immigrants, insulted African American reporters and suggested Jewish businessman George Soros, a prominent liberal donor, might be responsible for funding the migrant caravan headed to the U.S. border.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE:\n\n-- After the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, the DOJ announced an $840,000 grant to study the collection of hate-crimes data. \u201cIn a typical year, the Justice Department charges a few dozen people with hate crimes, and local and state law-enforcement agencies deal with a few thousand of their own cases. But the Justice Department itself \u2014 through its research arm, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which conducts surveys of crime victims \u2014 has found reason to believe that about two hundred and fifty thousand hate crimes were committed in the United States each year between 2004 and 2015,\u201d the New Yorker\u2019s Eric Lach reports.\n\n-- The Brennan Center, part of NYU\u2019s law school, released a report last month suggesting that Congress could pass legislation to standardize what information must be reported and to require that it be more specific.\n\n-- Last night, the city council in Charleston, S.C. \u2014 where nine African Americans were killed by a white supremacist at their church in 2015 \u2014 voted to advance a new \u201chate intimidation\u201d ordinance. The local government decided to act because the state government has failed to do so. \u201cSouth Carolina is one of five states that does not legally recognize hate crimes. That means it is up to the Department of Justice to determine if they\u2019ll seek prosecution,\u201d according to WCSC, the Charleston CBS affiliate. \u201cThe ordinance says people will be punished if they have the intent to intimidate another person because of their perceived race, color, creed, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability or national origin.\u201d In August, a transgender woman was attacked in downtown Charleston. The police chief said the new law could have applied to that assault case if it had been on the books.\n\n-- There are other yawning gaps in the law. The white man accused of fatally shooting two African Americans inside a Kroger grocery store last month is facing murder charges in Kentucky, and authorities say the incident was racially motivated. But the local prosecutor says he cannot charge Gregory Bush with a hate crime because the state\u2019s hate crimes statute does not cover homicides.\n\nIN OUR OWN BACKYARD:\n\n-- Don\u2019t delude yourself: This is not a regional problem. This is a national crisis.\n\n-- The most chilling story you will read today: \u201cA D.C. man who described himself as a white nationalist to law enforcement officers and became a social-media follower of the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting has been arrested on a gun charge,\u201d Spencer Hsu and Peter Hermann report. \u201cJeffrey R. Clark Jr., 30, is charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine and made his initial court appearance Tuesday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u2026 Clark, who lives in the Bloomingdale neighborhood, was arrested \u2026 after two family members alerted police to his increasingly agitated outbursts, including that the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh shooting \u2018deserved it.\u2019 The outbursts occurred in the wake of Clark\u2019s brother\u2019s suicide.\n\n\u201cRelatives told police both brothers had been involved in alt-right movements \u2026 Jeffrey Clark told FBI agents he and his brother became interested in guns in 2016 \u2018because they believed there was going to be a civil war,\u2019 according to an account of his statement filed in court. Court papers assert that after his brother\u2019s death, Jeffrey Clark posted on Gab a photo of the brothers wearing masks and holding a shotgun and a rifle, in front of a flag with a skull and cross bones. \u2026 Of the attack on the synagogue, court papers said Jeffrey Clark posted a picture of the suspected gunman spattered in what appears to be blood and wrote, \u2018This was a dry run for things to come.\u2019\n\n\u201cAuthorities said in the court documents that the brothers \u2018fantasized about killing \u201cJews and blacks\u201d' \u2026 The documents said the brothers had four guns between them \u2026 Court papers said Clark\u2019s relatives told authorities that Clark admired Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh, Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and killer Charles Manson and that relatives said \u2018Jeffrey and Edward Clark believed there would be a race revolution and they wanted to expedite it.\u2019 Clark, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, did not enter a plea and said little at the hearing beyond confirming that he was a high school graduate and needed an appointed attorney.\u201d\n\n-- Also: It got lost last week because the news broke on the afternoon of Election Day, but a D.C. firefighter was charged with a hate crime in Pennsylvania related to a road rage incident. When he was off duty, the 32-year-old allegedly waved a handgun from inside his pickup truck at two African Americans, yelled racial slurs and said he\u2019d hang the male driver from a tree. He denies the charges and is now on leave pending the outcomes of the criminal proceedings.\n\nAura Wharton-Beck, left, an assistant professor at the University of St. Thomas, clasps hands last month with Kevyn Perkins, center, during a moment of silence before a protest in the Anderson Student Center in St. Paul, Minn. (Jean Pieri/Pioneer Press/AP)\n\nARE THE KIDS ALRIGHT?\n\n-- We hear all the time about supposed P.C. culture on campus, but often overlooked are near daily flashes of hate at colleges that are clearly intended to demean racial and religious minorities. The AP\u2019s Collin Binkley reported last week on several such incidents in October alone that drew little national attention:\n\n\u201cKevyn Perkins stopped cold when he saw the letters scrawled on the door to his dorm: \u2018N----- go back\u2019 it said, inked in messy red marker. First he was blinded by confusion. Then rage. And then all he could think about was dropping out, finding a new school, escaping for good. \u2018I thought maybe I don\u2019t belong here. So I called my brother and I said, \u2018pick me up,\u2019\u2019 said Perkins, 19, a freshman at the University of St. Thomas, a private and mostly white school in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u2018He said that\u2019s what they want you to do \u2014 you have to stay there and stay strong.\u2019 \u2026 Since he found the note Oct. 19, Perkins has become more withdrawn, he said, less outgoing. And although he decided to stay at St. Thomas, he\u2019s left to wonder who on campus felt such hatred for him, and why.\n\n\u201cAt the College of the Holy Cross in central Massachusetts, a student was beaten in an assault that officials say was motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation. No one has been arrested in connection with the crime. Students at DePauw University in Indiana reported four separate cases of hate speech in October. In three, racial and homophobic slurs and threats were yelled from cars passing by campus. In another case, a threat with the N-word was found in an elevator on campus. Anti-Semitic posters appeared at the University of California, Davis, blaming Jews for allegations of sexual assault that were made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cAn Indiana woman was arrested last week after leaving a racist letter directed at African-American neighbors, urging them to leave the neighborhood because black people weren\u2019t welcome. As early voting started in North Carolina, a black Republican volunteer was accosted with slurs and had a gun pulled on him at a polling place, leading to one man\u2019s arrest. An Uber passenger in Colorado was arrested after threatening his Middle Eastern driver and chasing him down the street because police said he \u2018hated all brown people.\u2019 Violent clashes broke out in New York City after a speech by the founder of a far-right group, leading to three arrests. In a Texas courtroom, a man was sentenced to 24 years in prison on Oct. 17 for torching a mosque near the U.S.-Mexico border last year because of what authorities said was a \u2018rabid hatred\u2019 of Muslims.\u201d\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy visit Barbara and Phillip Butler and their daughter Natasha in College Park, Md., in May 1982. (Barry Thumma/AP)\n\nWHAT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP CAN DO:\n\n-- Ronald Reagan\u2019s daughter, Patti Davis, recalls a little remembered but symbolically significant moment of her father\u2019s presidency in an op-ed for today\u2019s newspaper:\n\n\u201cOn the morning of May 3, 1982, my father read a story in The Post about a black family in Maryland \u2014 the Butlers \u2014 who\u2019d had a cross burned on their lawn in 1977. William M. Aitcheson, an \u2018exalted cyclops\u2019 of the Ku Klux Klan, was charged with the crime. Now, five years later, a federal judge had ordered him to pay the Butlers a civil judgment of $23,000. Except Aitcheson had apparently disappeared. When my father went down to the Oval Office that morning, he announced that he wanted to go visit the Butlers \u2014 that day.\n\n\u201cMy parents sat with them in their living room and listened to what they had been subjected to as one of only five black families in the area. A car had driven onto their front lawn and taken out their lamppost. Garbage had been dumped onto their property. Then came the cross-burning. The cross was six feet tall and heavy. It was doubtful that Aitcheson had carried out the burning alone, but he had been the only one charged. \u2018This isn\u2019t something that should ever happen in America,\u2019 my father told them.\n\n\u201cThirty-five years later, another president learned of neo-Nazis marching through the streets of Charlottesville, which had led to the death of a young woman who bravely came out to counterprotest. The president\u2019s reaction: \u2018There are very fine people on both sides.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that should ever happen in America. We need to remember this when a campaign ad put out by the current president\u2019s political team is so racist that even Fox News won\u2019t run it. Or when the president proudly calls himself a nationalist and berates black female journalists, calling their questions \u2018stupid\u2019 and them incompetent. We need to remember, when children are ripped from their mothers\u2019 arms and put into cages, that there was a time when such a thing wouldn\u2019t happen in this country. These days, when blatant racism has been allowed to emerge from the shadows and sweep through neighborhoods, so that young black boys are yelled at for mowing a neighbor\u2019s lawn, we need to think about how other presidents \u2014 including my father \u2014 viewed leadership.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nA portion of a once classified CIA report that disclosed the existence of a program dubbed Project Medication.

(Ruth Eglash) El Chapo\u2019s trial began in New York. Defense attorneys for Joaqu\u00edn Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Loera portrayed the alleged drug kingpin as a scapegoat to distract from government corruption, while prosecutors argued Guzm\u00e1n built a narcotics empire by ruthlessly tearing down anyone in his way.

(Geoffroy Van Der HasseltAFP/Getty Images)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump has been lashing out in frustration over the midterm results and his poorly received Europe trip. Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: \u201cAs he jetted to Paris last Friday, [Trump] received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst. Trump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood \u2026 that testy call set the tone for five days of fury \u2014 evident in Trump\u2019s splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside Trump confidants and foreign diplomats...\n\n\u201cDuring his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u2018big victory.\u2019 He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I. The president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran. ... 'He was frustrated with the trip. And he\u2019s itching to make some changes,' said one senior White House official. 'This is a week where things could get really dicey.'\n\n\u201cHe told advisers over the weekend that he \u2026 was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save [DHS Secretary Kirstjen] Nielsen\u2019s job. The senior White House official, who speaks to the president regularly, said Trump has been grousing lately about getting rid of Kelly. \u2018But he\u2019s done this three or four times before,\u2019 the person said. \u2018Nothing is ever real until he sends the tweet.\u2019\n\n\u201cDuring Sunday\u2019s flight to Washington from Paris, aides filed into the president\u2019s private cabin to lobby against the leading contender to replace Kelly, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff. These aides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus. But the president has continued to praise Ayers, who also enjoys the support of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, according to multiple White House officials.\n\n\u201cFirst lady Melania Trump shared her husband\u2019s irritation and impatience with some of the staff. On Tuesday, amid reports that the president had decided to oust deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over tensions between her and other administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office issued an extraordinary statement to reporters calling for her firing. \u2026 In her role as No. 2 to national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel berated colleagues in meetings, yelled at military aides and White House professional staff, argued with Melania Trump regarding her recent trip to Africa and spread rumors about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to three current and two former White House officials. Kelly has sought for months to oust Ricardel, calling her a problematic hire in the West Wing, and Mattis has told advisers that he wants her out as well.\u201d\n\n-- The first lady\u2019s problems with Ricardel appear to stem from her trip last month to Africa. The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman, Helene Cooper and Ron Nixon report: \u201cMs. Ricardel had announced the trip before it was fully planned, according to one [source], and then threatened to pull resources for it after learning that she did not have a seat on Mrs. Trump\u2019s plane. After the trip ended, Ms. Ricardel made accusations of inappropriate behavior by Mrs. Trump\u2019s most trusted staff members, including Lindsay Reynolds, the first lady\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 claims that a person close to the first lady said were false.\u201d\n\n-- NBC News reports that Kelly may soon exit the White House after clashes with the first lady over staffing and travel requests. Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube report: \u201cSome of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, ... seven people familiar with the clashes said. \u2026 Melania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials [said]. \u2026 Trump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \u2018Deal with it.\u2019 \u2026 A White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is considering former acting ICE director Thomas Homan to replace Nielsen. Politico\u2019s Gabby Orr and Ted Hesson report: \u201cTapping Homan to run the Department of Homeland Security would almost certainly energize Trump\u2019s base. The tough-talking lawman once recommended charging so-called sanctuary city politicians \u2018with crimes\u2019 and has pugnaciously defended even Trump\u2019s most controversial immigration moves, including separating children from their parents at the border.\u201d\n\n-- CNN filed a lawsuit against the White House to get reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass restored. Paul Farhi reports: \u201cThe unusual lawsuit, an escalation of Trump\u2019s long-running war of words with CNN, seeks a judge\u2019s intervention after Trump banished Acosta from the White House grounds for an indefinite period after a brief altercation between Acosta and a White House press aide. \u2026 Late Tuesday afternoon, the judge in the case, Timothy J. Kelly, ordered the White House and the other defendants to respond to CNN\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order by 11 a.m. Wednesday. He set a hearing on the restraining order \u2014 which would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s press credential, pending the outcome of a trial \u2014 for 3 p.m. Wednesday. Legal experts say the network\u2019s chances of winning in court are favorable.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has refused to consider arguments against nationalism, which Macron called a \u201cbetrayal of patriotism.\u201d Anne Gearan reports: \u201cInstead, Trump, who once avoided calling himself a nationalist, flaunted his embrace of the term and suggested that Macron do the same while arguing the French president was criticizing him to distract from his poor poll numbers.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed defending Trump\u2019s embrace of nationalism: \u201cTrump is right to embrace the label \u2018nationalist,\u2019 because a true American nationalism isn\u2019t about a national identity based on race, religion or ethnicity. Instead, it is based on our identity as a nation committed to the idea that all people are created equal, with a God-given right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\n-- Trump will nominate retired Army Gen. John Abizaid to become the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Anne Gearan and Dan Lamothe report: \u201c[The vacancy] was spotlighted by the difficult diplomacy between the United States and Riyadh over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The post has been vacant throughout Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have blamed Senate Democrats for holding up nominations, but no one had been nominated for the job until now. Turkey, where [Post columnist] Khashoggi was killed last month, also has no U.S. ambassador. Abizaid, best known from his time overseeing the Iraq War, is now a consultant and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW CONGRESS:\n\n-- House Democrats fear a Freedom Caucus-like insurgency from the liberal wing could derail their plans once they take control of the chamber. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201c[Nancy] Pelosi\u2019s opponents are threatening to withhold their votes on the House floor even after an anticipated party vote nominating her as the next speaker. That is a page straight out of the Freedom Caucus playbook \u2014 used to deny Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) the speakership in 2015. Top Democrats are warning rank-and-file members not to go down that road, underscoring a growing backlash to the anti-Pelosi faction. \u2026 A critical test may come later this week as Democrats consider an internal rule change to raise the threshold vote for nominating a speaker candidate from a simple majority to 218 votes. The change is expected to fail, in a boost for Pelosi.\u201d\n\n-- Pelosi has launched an aggressive charm offensive to try to snag the speakership. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan, Rachael Bade and Kyle Cheney report: \u201cOn Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi held a reception for all Democrats at Osteria Morini, an Italian restaurant by the D.C. waterfront. On Wednesday, the members-elect will be introduced to their colleagues at a Democratic Caucus meeting, a lengthy process that will put them onstage with Pelosi. The California Democrat will follow that up with an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus \u2026 Democratic Party luminaries are calling members-elect on Pelosi's behalf as well. Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania have weighed in, as have former Vice President Al Gore and former Secretary of State and longtime Democratic Sen. John Kerry, according to Democratic aides.\u201d\n\n-- Nine centrist Democrats are demanding a vote on their proposed rules changes to House operations in exchange for their support of Pelosi. From DeBonis: \u201cThe reforms range from making it easier to get amendment votes to ending the ability of a single disgruntled lawmaker to force a vote on ousting a sitting speaker. The centerpieces of the effort are mechanisms that would streamline the process of considering bills with broad bipartisan support on the House floor \u2014 at the price of eroding the power of the majority party\u2019s leadership to control what gets put up for a vote.\u201d\n\n-- House Republicans will hold closed-door elections today, with Kevin McCarthy expected to cruise to the top role of minority leader. The AP\u2019s Lisa Mascaro reports: \u201cBut the Californian has struggled in the past to build support from conservatives. He faces a longshot challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus who has support from outside conservative groups and got a second-look during a nearly two-hour candidate forum Tuesday. \u2026 Most GOP lawmakers, though, prefer McCarthy\u2019s more affable approach, and he remained favored to win Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans vented frustrations about their loss of the majority during a closed-door meeting last night. From Mascaro: \u201cRepublicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting. Some in the meeting said Republicans should have tried harder to fulfill [Trump\u2019s] priorities, like funding for the border wall with Mexico. They also warned that they need a new fundraising mechanism to compete with the small-dollar online donors that powered Democrats to victory.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has urged McCarthy to strike a deal with Jordan. Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney report: \u201cIt remains unclear what exactly the deal would entail. The discussions between the president and McCarthy about Jordan, which took place last week, set off a round of speculation among lawmakers inside the Capitol that Trump may try to push Jordan to become the top Republican lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee \u2026 Jordan wants that position, according to GOP lawmakers and aides. And Trump thinks Jordan would be a ferocious defender.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats are on track to hold about 30 House seats that went for Trump in 2016, which could complicate their legislative agenda. From Paul Kane: \u201cThat\u2019s a large degree of political exposure, given that the size of their House majority will be about half that when the final races are called \u2026 They now must decide how to govern: Go bold, brandishing an aggressive liberal agenda that tells voters what Democrats stand for and what to expect from their eventual presidential standard-bearer in 2020; or play it safe with a disciplined approach that doesn\u2019t scare off independent voters ahead of the battle for the White House.\u201d\n\n-- Mitch McConnell wrote an op-ed advising House Democrats to \u201cwork together [with the Republican Senate] and actually make a difference.\u201d He writes on FoxNews.com: \u201cLast week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle. But however Democrats interpret the latest message from voters, Senate Republicans will continue our commitment to delivering results.\u201d\n\nA worker loads ballots into machines at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office during a recount in Lauderhill, Fla. (Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nFLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA:\n\n-- Sen. Bill Nelson (D) filed a lawsuit to extend the deadline to finish the recount in the close Senate race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Sean Sullivan, Beth Reinhard, Vanessa Williams and Lori Rozsa report: \u201c[Nelson] and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a suit in federal court Tuesday evening seeking to extend the deadline to finish the count in all 67 counties. Separately, Nelson and the state party went to court to try to loosen the rules for a manual recount as both parties braced for the ultra-close Senate race to come down to a hand inspection of ballots. On Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Florida elections officials to take as much time as they need to tally votes, even if they blow past a key deadline. He also demanded that [Scott], who is narrowly ahead of Nelson in the Senate race, recuse himself from the recount. Scott\u2019s campaign swiftly rejected that notion, which is the subject of a suit expected to be heard in federal court this week.\u201d\n\n-- Top officials in both parties privately agree Nelson\u2019s gap will be difficult to overcome.\n\n-- Two Florida election officials at the center of the recount were harassed online. Craig Timberg and Beth Reinhard report: \u201cSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of [Brenda Snipes,] the Broward County, Fla., election supervisor who has been the target of blistering criticism from the president and other Republicans amid highly politicized vote recounts. \u2026 Facebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. It also confirmed a similar incident involving Palm Beach County\u2019s Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher, whose home address and phone number also were posted on a Facebook page.\u201d\n\n-- Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has been offering Trump updates on the Florida recounts as she angles for a position in the administration. Politico\u2019s Annie Karni and Marc Caputo report: \u201c[S]ince the midterms, she has been serving as one of [Trump\u2019s] point people on the ground there, remaining in frequent contact with the president and giving him personal updates, according to a senior White House official and Florida officials. For the longtime close friend of Trump\u2019s, the timing of the Florida recount, which the president has seized on to push unsupported theories about widespread voter fraud, offers a new chance to be front and center in his mind while he is also reorganizing his Cabinet and quickly shedding officials he has grown weary of.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Josh Harder (D-Calif.), second from right, campaigns in Modesto last month. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nMORE RESULTS COMING IN:\n\n-- Another House race was called: Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) lost his reelection bid to Democrat Josh Harder. The Associated Press declared Harder the winner in California\u2019s 10th District, which is in the Central Valley east of San Jose. The former venture capitalist leads by around 4,900 votes. Denham was elected with the tea party wave in 2010.\n\n-- Democrat Katie Porter has taken a 261-vote lead over GOP Rep. Mimi Walters in California\u2019s 45th District. \u201cThat means Democrats now lead in six out of nine uncalled House races,\u201d KTLA\u2019s Erika Martin reports: \u201cDuring her last election in 2016, Walters, a former investment banker, won by 17 percentage points. But that same year, the district went for Hillary Clinton by more than 5 points after previously electing Mitt Romney by 12 points in 2012. \u2026 And in California\u2019s 39th Congressional District, where a seat opened up after long-serving GOP Rep. Ed Royce announced his retirement, Democrat Gil Cisneros is catching up to Republican Young Kim, who had a healthy lead on election night. \u2026 On election night, Kim was ahead by nearly 4,000. But on Tuesday, she led by only 711.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) trails Democrat Ben McAdams by 0.6 points. The Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s Benjamin Wood reports: \u201cMcAdams held his tenuous lead over [Love] on Tuesday after the addition of roughly 40,000 votes to Utah County\u2019s election totals and 17,000 votes in Salt Lake County. McAdams now leads with 50.3 percent of the vote, compared with 49.7 percent for Love, a margin of 1,229 votes. Dave Hansen, Love\u2019s campaign manager, expressed optimism after seeing the new Utah County figures.\u201d\n\nActing attorney general Matt Whitaker and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s move to install loyalist Matt Whitaker at the Justice Department helm is backfiring politically. Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Darren Samuelsohn report: \u201cThe uproar over the appointment, which effectively removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as [special counsel Bob] Mueller\u2019s primary supervisor, has put Whitaker in a difficult spot, trapped between setting off a political firestorm by clipping Mueller\u2019s wings and angering a president intent on having him do just that. Even Trump\u2019s Justice Department is wavering about whether Whitaker will do the deed the president wanted him for.\n\n\u201cDepartment spokeswoman Kerri Kupec issued a statement late Tuesday signaling that Whitaker could still recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation, a shift from the department\u2019s initial position in the immediate aftermath of Sessions\u2019 ouster that Whitaker had no plans to step out of the way on the Russia probe. \u2026 There is also the fact that Mueller\u2019s investigation may be too far along to merely smother it. A Washington-based defense lawyer representing a senior Trump official in the Russia investigation said Whitaker couldn\u2019t make decisions \u2018based on his seat-of-the-pants preferences.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Another bad headline: Public records show that, while in private business, Whitaker abandoned a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa amid ongoing problems. The AP\u2019s Ryan J. Foley and David Pitt report: \u201cThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\u201d\n\n-- John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, called Whitaker\u2019s appointment unconstitutional. He writes in The Atlantic: \u201cTo prevent the president from using appointments to advance his private interests, just as Trump critics today charge, the Constitution prohibits filling the position of attorney general with a series of officials who never received Senate consent. [Rosenstein], Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the several assistant attorneys general, even any of the 93 U.S. attorneys in the nation\u2019s major cities could all temporarily fill in for Sessions, as they received senatorial advice and consent. Whitaker, and any other Justice Department official or employee, cannot.\u201d\n\n-- Mueller is seeking more information about Nigel Farage, a key pro-Brexit campaigner who forged close ties with the 2016 Trump campaign. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine and Stephanie Kirchgaessner report: \u201cJerome Corsi, a conservative author, said prosecutors working for Mueller questioned him about [Farage] two weeks ago in Washington. Corsi said investigators for the special counsel also pressed him for information on Ted Malloch, a London-based American academic with ties to Farage, who informally advised [Trump] and was interviewed by FBI agents earlier this year.\"\n\n-- Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed support for a bill to protect Mueller\u2019s probe and urged McConnell to allow a vote on it. \u201cI would certainly vote for it,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see any movement to get rid of Mueller. But it probably would be good to have this legislation in place just for the future.\u201d McConnell said last week he did not consider the legislation necessary. (Reuters)\n\n-- Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the likely incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, instructed the FBI and Justice to respond to outstanding requests from Democrats before they assume the majority. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cNadler stopped short of issuing a threat, subpoena or otherwise, in demanding that [Whitaker] and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray respond by the end of the year to committee Democrats who have written to ask for documents and other information. But the letter serves as a reminder nonetheless that committee Democrats plan to hit the ground running in January \u2014 and offers a hint of where they will focus their attention.\u201d\n\nMichael Bloomberg speaks at a Moms Demand Action gun safety rally in Nashua, N.H. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Top economists predict the U.S. economy could be grappling with a recession as Trump fights for reelection in 2020. Heather Long wrote the most forward-looking story you'll read today: \u201cMost economists are predicting that the economy will be weaker \u2014 or even in a recession \u2014 by the time voters go to the polls in 2020. For Trump and the GOP, the economy was probably a tail wind in these midterms, but it could turn into a substantial head wind by then.\n\n\u201cPessimism is growing on Wall Street about future prospects for earnings and the economy. More than a third of top economic forecasters now predict a U.S. recession in 2020, according to the latest Blue Chip forecast, and 44 percent of fund managers in the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey expect global growth to slow in the next year, the worst outlook for the world economy since November 2008. The list of head winds is expanding: higher borrowing costs, a strong dollar, a weakening global economy, an escalating tariff war, and fading fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and extra government spending. 'Our forecast has [economic growth] stalling \u2014 that is, zero growth quarter on quarter \u2014 in the first half of 2020,' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. 'Gravity can\u2019t be defied forever.'\n\n\u201cThe president will have to decide: Does he take further action to boost growth, or does he blame others for any slowdown?\u201d\n\n-- Michael Bloomberg pledged to make a decision on a White House run by early next year. The AP\u2019s Steve Peoples reports: \u201c\u2018I think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\u2019 Bloomberg said ... The 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects ... \u2018Thanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that\u2019s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, \u2018Look, do I have a chance?\u2019 I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible,\u2019 Bloomberg [said]. \u2026\n\n\u201cShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. \u2026 Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time. The decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren\u2019t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said. \u2018I will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\u2019 Bloomberg said.\u201d\n\n-- Juli\u00e1n Castro met with donors to discuss a possible 2020 campaign. Politico\u2019s Alex Thompson reports: \u201cCastro and his twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, brought together about 20 of their loyal donors and bundlers in San Antonio to begin to sketch out a national bid, according [two sources]. The session lasted several hours and invited the potential donors to ask questions about a potential presidential campaign.\u201d\n\n-- The midterm results point to Democratic hurdles as they seek to take back the White House in 2020. The New York Times\u2019s Nate Cohn writes: \u201c[Democrats\u2019] triumph was a somewhat narrow one, concentrated in well-educated, affluent communities. Over all, the distribution of Democratic and Republican support was reminiscent of the 2016 election, when Democrats won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. Yes, Democrats can muscle their way through those disadvantages with a big enough win, like their seven-point advantage in the House popular vote. But white voters without a degree are overrepresented in the most important Midwestern battleground states. The most straightforward alternative for Democrats goes through Florida, which probably gave Republicans their most promising results last week.\u201d\n\n-- But the GOP will need to repair its relationship with suburban women to undo some of the midterm losses it sustained. Dan Balz writes: \u201cFor many suburban women \u2014 not all, by any means, but for many \u2014 Trump is toxic. It is not just that they disagree with him. \u2026 It was the president\u2019s style, his behavior, his treatment of other people, the allegations of sexual misconduct, the disrespect he has shown. \u2026 Those in the Republican Party \u2026 who worry about their deficit among suburban women cannot deny the role their president has played in creating the conditions that led to last week\u2019s results. Whether they will act on that is another question. So far it doesn\u2019t look like they are prepared to do so.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump dismissed reports that North Korea has continued its development of ballistic missiles:\n\nThe story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate.

Here\u2019s What Happened,\u201d by Jim Tankersley and Matt Phillips: \u201cEconomists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates. Ten months after the law took effect, that promised \u2018supply-side\u2019 bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.\u201d\n\n-- Vanity Fair, \u201c\u2018Who Gets To Live In Victimville?\u2019: Why I Participated In A New Docuseries On The Clinton Affair,\u201d by Monica Lewinsky: \u201c[S]ociety will no doubt weigh in again on my classification\u2014Victim or Vixen?\u2014when people see a new docuseries I chose to participate in. (It\u2019s titled The Clinton Affair. Bye-bye, Lewinsky scandal . . .

But looking back on it, it didn\u2019t. Jeff Flake\u2019s book couldn\u2019t even convince Jeff Flake.

Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\u201cWhen we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\u201d Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country\u2019s 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\u201cI am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,\u201d said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui\u2019s town. \u201cWhen they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.\u201d\n\nTatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter. He said many young Cameroonians are joining the separatists because their families have been killed by military \u201cso they don\u2019t have somebody to count on again ... I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.\u201d\n\nCol. Badjeck, however, said \u201cMost of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.\u201d\n\nIn November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions.\n\nPoliticians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate.\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the \u201chorrific escalation of violence\u201d in English-speaking regions.\n\nNearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

After months of struggle and delay,\u2026 [+5917 chars]", "fulltext": "After a five-hour meeting with her cabinet, and months of struggle and delay, Prime Minister Theresa May emerged from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday and announced that her ministers had approved her Brexit plan.\n\nThe draft agreement, negotiated by British and European Union officials, is a decisive step toward finalizing Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union in March.\n\nThe agreement, which has been compared to the world\u2019s most complex divorce settlement, lays out the billions of euros that Britain will pay to leave, what rights Europeans living in Britain will have after Brexit, and how a 21-month transition period will work. The agreement also promises a solution to the knotty challenge of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Irish Republic, which will remain in the E.U.\n\nThe plan still requires endorsement by European leaders this month, which should be relatively easy, to be followed by a far more difficult vote in December in the British Parliament, where many members decry the draft deal as a weak capitulation that satisfies no one.\n\nThe cabinet approval of May\u2019s package marked the end of a remarkable 24 hours in British politics \u2014 a true cliffhanger, with social media and the airwaves filled with speculation about whether the deal, and May herself, would survive.\n\nEven as May prepared to speak, British political reporters were tweeting that a challenge to her leadership might be underway.\n\nThe prime minister looked exhausted as she faced the cameras Wednesday evening outside her official residence. Rather than celebrate a hard-won round in her fight for a workable Brexit deal, she sounded somber.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision that will come under intense scrutiny, but the decision was to build a future for our country or to go back to square one and fail on the promise of the referendum,\u201d May said, without elaborating on the details of the deal.\n\nShe described a \u201clong, detailed and impassioned debate\u201d within her cabinet, whose ranks are balanced between those who, like May, voted against Brexit two years ago, and those who campaigned hard for it \u2014 ministers such as Michael Gove and Liam Fox, who are committed Brexiteers.\n\n\n\nBritish Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, left, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox arrive at 10 Downing Street on Nov. 14, 2018, for a special cabinet session to discuss the Brexit deal. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News)\n\nMay said the Brexit withdrawal agreement will protect jobs and preserve the United Kingdom. She did not say that it would make Britain great again.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision that is in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom,\u201d May said.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement was published shortly after she spoke \u2014 585 pages of E.U. legalese. May will discuss it in Parliament on Thursday.\n\nFor the past two years, the greatest debate over Brexit has not been waged between Brussels and London, but within May\u2019s fractious Conservative Party.\n\nHard-line Brexiteers have pushed for a decisive split from European bureaucrats and courts, from E.U. rules and regulations, while others, led by May, have sought a softer Brexit, a compromise package that keeps Britain more closely aligned with Europe to better protect the British economy.\n\nMay got a taste of the disgruntlement of her own backbench on Wednesday, as fellow Conservative Party members heaped derision on a deal that they had not yet seen \u2014 but that they feared gave too much away.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Peter Bone warned May that she was \u201cnot delivering the Brexit people voted for.\u201d He said, \u201cToday you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\u201d\n\nArch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who quit his job as foreign secretary over May\u2019s proposals in July, had urged cabinet members to reject the agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s vassal-state stuff,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor the first time in 1,000 years, this place, this Parliament, will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.\u201d\n\nA Conservative member of Parliament who opposes Brexit, Anna Soubry, said Wednesday that British voters should be offered another chance to cast a ballot on whether to support May\u2019s deal or remain in the European Union.\n\nThe best deal, Soubry told the BBC, \u201cis the deal that we currently have with the European Union.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Nov. 14, 2018. (Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSammy Wilson, a member of Parliament for Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which May needs to prop up her minority government, told TalkRadio that May\u2019s plan \u201cis not so much a deal as a double-cross.\u201d\n\nThe DUP\u2019s chief whip at Westminster, Jeffrey Donaldson, said May\u2019s half-in, half-out plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t give the United Kingdom as a whole the opportunity to do free-trade deals and to take control of its own future.\u201d\n\nMost lawmakers in the opposition Labour Party are expected to vote against the plan if and when it reaches Parliament. Ahead of the release of the document Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cFrom what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.\u201d\n\nOutside Parliament, Nigel Farage, a top Brexit campaigner and a member of the European Parliament, called May\u2019s withdrawal agreement \u201cthe worst deal in history.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, there was relief that May had won approval from her divided cabinet.\n\n\u201cGreen light!\u201d Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen tweeted. \u201cRelieved that the UK government has now approved the deal reached by our negotiators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis agreement is a crucial step in concluding these negotiations,\u201d said the chief E.U. Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in a late-night news conference in the E.U. capital of Brussels, where he triumphantly waved a copy of the agreement, which he said contained 185 articles, three protocols and a series of annexes. \u201cWe\u2019re practically there.\u201d\n\nHe said European leaders had been united after what he described as Britain\u2019s \u201cthunderclap\u201d decision to leave the European Union and took pains not to inflame May\u2019s sticky political situation in London.\n\nBut he confirmed that if negotiators fail to reach a second deal about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. in the coming two years, a fail-safe, politically painful insurance policy would kick in to prevent a border from springing up between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThat insurance plan would keep Britain bound inside the E.U. customs zone, obeying E.U. customs rules and regulations but unable to shape them \u2014 the exact opposite of the stated goal of Brexit advocates. European officials say they, too, find the situation uncomfortable, since Britain would have tariff-free and quota-free access to the vast E.U. market without being subject to the same demands as other E.U. countries.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May comes out to give a statement outside 10 Downing Street on Nov. 14, 2018. (Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn London, May\u2019s approach had few defenders. But among them was former Conservative Party leader William Hague, who asked his colleagues, \u201cDid anybody really think you could leave the E.U. without a lot of compromises?\u201d\n\nHague urged skeptics to consider the \u201cbig picture.\u201d He told the BBC that the deal fulfills the mandate the British voters chose when they voted 52 percent to 48 percent in a June 2016 referendum to leave the European bloc.\n\n\u201cIf what you want is to deliver on leaving the European Union, and have frictionless trade in goods at the border for the next few years until a future free-trade agreement comes into force, and have control of our own immigration policy, and keep the United Kingdom together, all at the same time \u2014 well, then, a deal is going to look pretty much like this one seems to look like. It isn\u2019t going to be dramatically different from that,\u201d Hague said.\n\nQuentin Ari\u00e8s and Michael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s family is in row over Brexit\n\nCould Brexit bring new troubles to Northern Ireland?\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "What\u2019s a defeated or retired Republican to do?", "description": "Leading their party out of the Trump wasteland", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/14/whats-a-defeated-or-retired-republican-to-do/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:15:30Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nPoll volunteer Tom Spain hands an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker to Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) after he voted in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., in the June 2018 primary. (Grace Beahm Alford/The Post And Courier via AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nRep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), a rock-ribbed Republican, lost his primary to a cheerleader for President Trump. A Democrat, Joe Cunningham, then beat the Republican and flipped the seat in a major upset. Sanford writes: \u201cIn fact, there was not a more conservative district in the country to flip to the Democrats. For this reason, I think the race offers a chance for conservative soul-searching, and I say this as a committed conservative, who just happens not to be Trump enough in the age of Trump.\u201d Two of his reasons for the GOP loss, however, seem disconnected from the top election issues \u2014 Republicans\u2019 lack of concern for the environment and for fiscal responsibility. However, the third reason \u2014 Republicans\u2019 incivility \u2014 seems to be more on point. (\u201cI heard it from young soccer moms and longtime Republican voters alike. They don\u2019t want to condone behavior that is counter to what they\u2019ve taught their children.\u201d)\n\nRepublicans have witnessed so many retirements and losses that there is now a community of experienced former legislators who embody what the GOP is not \u2014 civil, thoughtful, oriented to problem-solving, opposed to the nativist turn in the GOP. They are displaced from a party that is neither conservative nor tethered to reality.\n\nSanford would do his party, state and country a service by attempting to rekindle these qualities in the GOP. He can start by primarying Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has decided to embrace Trump with a fervor that stuns colleagues and friends of his former ally, the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). Not only did Graham vote for a budget-busting tax bill, but he\u2019s also become an all-purpose apologist for Trump\u2019s lawlessness (e.g., illegally putting an unfit acting attorney general in charge of the Russia probe, undermining the credibility of elections, smearing the FBI). Sanford has the unique ability to primary him from the right while bashing him for enabling Trump.\n\nIn a similar vein, Republicans dismayed with the direction of the party should look at states where the GOP lost House seats and have a Senate race in 2020 (e.g., Iowa and Texas). It is in these states that they can fight Trump loyalists for the direction of their party. Much attention has been focused on mounting a primary (or third-party challenge) against Trump, but equally if not more important is to challenge those Senate Republicans who have become Trump enablers, refused to do rudimentary oversight, piled on as Trump has savaged democratic norms and values, and chosen to defend Trump\u2019s policy objectives (e.g., tariffs) over the economic and other interests of their home-state constituents.\n\nOne place to start would be the appointment of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker. The about-to-be-out-of-work Republicans would be wise to join with Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who presented a two-part proposal for responding to Whitaker:\n\nFirst, we are demanding that Mr. Whitaker recuse himself from the Russia investigation. On Sunday, I sent a letter along with Leader Pelosi, and top Democrats from both houses and the relevant committees, to the Department of Justice\u2019s Chief Ethics Officer explaining why Mr. Whitaker should be recused and requesting the Chief Ethics Officer notify Congress as to what guidance Whitaker has given. We\u2019ve heard that Mr. Whitaker is meeting with Ethics officials this week, and we expect, we expect, that Congress will be notified about the results of those discussions. Second, if Mr. Whitaker does not recuse himself, we Democrats are going to attempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation in any way.\n\nAnd these jobless, anti-Trump Republicans shouldn\u2019t wait until 2020 to start holding fellow Republican accountable for their votes and rhetoric. Household-name Republicans should join in the fights now to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, respect the sanctity of elections, challenge abuse of the pardon power and otherwise check the authoritarian tendencies of their party. They might succeed in changing the behavior of previously Trump-subservient Republicans. If not, they\u2019ll have softened incumbents up for a possible primary challenge in 2020.\n\nRead more:\n\nDan Crenshaw: SNL mocked my appearance.

But maybe that story has a happy ending. Plenty of 20-somethings who grew up dancing to the unrelenting bwomp-bwomp of EDM now appear to be searching for their roots \u2014 at least, according to Nick Garcia, 27, and Ken Lazee, 43, the duo behind Werk Ethic, a quarterly dance night dedicated to the classic house and techno sounds of the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\n\u201cThat genuine interest from the younger crowd?

In a message to viewers that accompanies the film, Anders explains that he\u2019s hopeful that the movie \u201cdoesn\u2019t pull punches.\u201d Turns out, it\u2019s a little too manipulative to be a truly honest portrayal of family.\n\nIt\u2019s ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion, in fact, that leads the couple to adopt in the first place. Pete Wagner (Wahlberg) initially resists the suggestion by his wife, Ellie (Byrne), that they take in a foster child. But when he starts to read the stories of children who need a parent \u2014 and sees photo after photo of cute waifs \u2014 he melts.\n\nSoon the couple is off to parenting class. Unfortunately, this is where \u201cInstant Family,\u201d untrue to its name, takes a little too long to come together.

Although these scenes offer a few choice lines of dialogue lines from parenting facilitators played by Tig Notaro and Octavia Spencer, they feel like a distraction from the Wagners\u2019 home troubles, as they take in 15-year old Lizzie (Isabela Moner) and her two younger siblings. The kids are, of course, a handful \u2014 from the accident-prone Juan (Gustavo Quiroz) to frequent tantrums thrown by Lita (Julianna Gamiz). Naturally it\u2019s the teenager who\u2019s the biggest headache, and Moner, a singer as well as an actress, turns in the movie\u2019s best performance as a character who must navigate the emotional shift from adolescent toughness to tender vulnerability.\n\nIt also takes some time for the children to warm up to their new parents, but when they eventually do, there\u2019s a predictable song cue \u2014 George Harrison\u2019s exuberant pop classic \u201cWhat is Life?\u201d \u2014 to ring in that plot development. (A more curious choice pops up in a scene featuring a sexual predator: Bauhaus\u2019s edgy 1982 cover of Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cThird Uncle.\u201d)\n\nThe movie relies heavily on metaphor. In its very first shot, the Wagners open the door to a run-down house that they plan to renovate themselves.

(Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 After legendary physicist Albert Einstein fled the German capital, Berlin, in 1922 in fear and haste, he penned a letter that has lost little of its relevance since, even almost 100 years later.\n\n\u201cHere are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I\u2019m happy to be able to get away from everything,\u201d Einstein wrote in the long-forgotten letter that was sold for more than $30,000 at an auction in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Addressed to his sister Maria, Einstein\u2019s 1922 thoughts today serve as a powerful reminder that the Holocaust was preceded by years of mounting anti-Semitic attacks and the demonization of Jews. It didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.\n\nAfter 1922, it took the Nazis another decade to seize power.\n\nBut Einstein\u2019s Jewish background had made him a target of attacks early on. He decided to embark on a spontaneous trip abroad when his Jewish friend, German Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau, was assassinated that year.\n\n\u201cNobody knows where I am, and I\u2019m believed to be missing. ... I\u2019m doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues,\u201d Einstein wrote from an undisclosed location, likely as he was fleeing the country.\n\nEven though Einstein had correctly assessed the rise of anti-Semitism by the early 1920s, the scientist was wrong about the impact on his own life, repeatedly assuring his friends and colleagues that they should not worry about his safety.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I myself don\u2019t worry either,\u201d Einstein wrote in his letter.\n\nThe famous physicist later returned to Germany and won the Nobel Prize. But in 1933, when Einstein happened to be in the United States, Adolf Hitler took power in Germany. Einstein had to admit that he would never be able to return safely and renounced his German citizenship.\n\n\n\nA copy of a 1922 letter Albert Einstein wrote to his younger sister. (Kedem Auction House/AP)\n\nFrom the United States, Einstein continued to share his thoughts in letters that are still being widely shared. In one letter that is due to be auctioned in December, he rejected religion, writing that \u201cfor me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. ... [The] Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people.\u201d\n\nEinstein\u2019s multifaceted approach toward religion and his more xenophobic and misogynistic beliefs revealed in his diaries are still the subject of debate. But his warnings against intolerance and anti-Semitism left little room for misinterpretation.\n\nAlmost a century later, Einstein\u2019s 1922 letter is not only being seen as a historical document but also as a warning that may ring true today. Its sale comes amid concerns that Jewish life is once again under attack by \u201cclassic traditional antisemitism,\u201d according to a report earlier this year by the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at Tel Aviv University. \u201cThe constant rise of the extreme right, a heated anti-Zionist discourse in the left, accompanied by harsh antisemitic expressions, and radical Islamism,\u201d they write, have caused a \u201ccertain corrosion of Jewish life.\"\n\nSince the report\u2019s release in April, anti-Semitic incidents have further increased across Europe, with a 69 percent jump in France so far this year. The spike in attacks against minorities is not limited to Jews, as Muslims have also become more frequent targets.\n\nAmid figures that indicate a shift toward more intolerance, some have searched for historical lessons that may be relevant today. Austria\u2019s national film archive, for instance, this year restored a pre-World War II silent film that sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s for warning against the scapegoating of Jews. Long believed to be lost, \u201cThe City Without Jews\u201d was surprisingly rediscovered in a Paris flea market three years ago. The painstaking restoration took years of work.\n\n\u201cWe received enormous financial support from abroad, including from Americans following the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d said Nikolaus Wostry, managing director of Austria\u2019s national film archive.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s Europe, we can clearly see the exploitation of people\u2019s fears once again. Politicians focus them on target groups \u2014 be it immigrants or followers of religions,\u201d Wostry said.\n\nAs researchers seek explanations for the recent surge in intolerance, the answers for which they are looking may also be found in documents long lost or forgotten.\n\nRead more:\n\nEinstein\u2019s letter belittling God and religion will be auctioned for $1 million or more"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Megan McDonough", "title": "We tried all the meatballs at the Meatball Shop and ranked them", "description": null, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2018/11/14/we-tried-all-meatballs-meatball-shop-ranked-them/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:32:28Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nThe Meatball Shop, a new addition to 14th Street, offers its signature dish on salads, in bowls, in sliders and even as \u201cballer\u201d plates.

Democrats, new and old, will be debating exactly what they should do with their newfound power to address climate change \u2014 and other issues like health care \u2014 at a time when Republicans still control the Senate and the White House\n\nThe task of managing those factions falls to Pelosi, who on Tuesday turned what could have been a tense encounter into an exchange of pleasantries. The experienced Democratic leader welcomed the protesters on Twitter while Ocasio-Cortez thanked her for doing so:\n\nThank you, @NancyPelosi.\n\n\n\nWe have 10 years left to plan and implement a Green New Deal before cataclysmic climate disaster.\n\n\n\nReinstating the Select Committee is exactly what we need to do. https://t.co/Uy5BnrLZcR \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 13, 2018\n\nFor the next two years, House Democrats will do what their GOP counterparts largely had refused to: debate legislation to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and adapt to warming temperatures, rising seas and their other effects.\n\nBut any bill or set of bills probably will wait until Democrats control enough levers in the federal government to actually enact legislation.\n\n\u201cWe're not trying to ramrod legislation through,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the environmental group Sunrise Movement, which organized the protest. \u201cWe understand that obviously with Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling the Senate there's no chance in hell\u201d their wish list becomes law.\n\nIn the meantime, the Democratic House majority will have to decide how best to highlight the climate issue with hearings and probes into the Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era environmental rules meant to address global warming.\n\n\u201cThe main priorities are infrastructure and climate change,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who is slated to lead the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cOn climate change, we're focused on holding the Trump administration accountable for things the that they are doing,\u201d including President Trump's vow to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and undo Obama-era rules on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nPelosi cast action on climate change as an opportunity to create jobs. \"House Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a $1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis, while creating 16 million new good-paying jobs across the country,\" she said in a statement.\n\nBut the party's progressives, while acknowledging the realities of Trump's Washington, are agitating for even more aggressive legislation. Among the Sunrise Movement's demands is the creation of a select committee on climate change to spearhead legislation taking the entire nation to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years while rapidly decarbonizing manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors of the U.S. economy. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThey and other groups brand the plan as a \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cScience mandates that we actually have a massive and rapid wartime economic mobilization\u201d to stop the crisis, Prakash said. She cited a recent report from a panel of international scientists describing how the world has only a dozen years to cut carbon emissions and limit global warming to moderate levels.\n\nThat United Nations report seemed to be animating many of the protesters on Tuesday, some of whom wore T-shirts with the words \"12 years\u201d to Pelosi's office.\n\nPelosi has said she \u201cstrongly\u201d supports reinstating a select climate committee, which House Republicans scrapped after they took power in 2011. But that stance alread puts Pelosi at odds with Pallone, whose committee already has jurisdiction over a wide swath of energy and environmental issues.\n\n\u201cI don't think it's necessary to have a select committee because there are already four committees that have jurisdiction over climate change, and we have climate change champions leading all these committees,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nCommittee chairmen like Pallone \u2014 including former Reps.

The Camp Fire has burned through 130,000 acres since Thursday and more than 8,800 structures, according to the Los Angeles Times.

(Eva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSome conservatives are dismayed at how energetically Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is cracking down on tobacco products, despite his own limited-government views. But Gottlieb isn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cMy former friends in the libertarian community who think this is emblematic of nanny-state government intervention and denying adults access to legal pleasures \u2014 I hope that when they sit and think about the data we\u2019re seeing they\u2019re willing to accept modest speed bumps in terms of the access adults will have to these products to hopefully close off the access of these products to kids,\u201d Gottlieb told me yesterday.\n\nGottlieb is a well-known health policy wonk who left a position at the conservative American Enterprise Institute to head the agency charged with ensuring medicines and devices consumed by Americans are safe. There\u2019s been much buzz lately about how he\u2019s moving to crack down on certain electronic tobacco products that can serve as a gateway for kids to get addicted to nicotine.\n\nThe FDA is expected to announce regulations soon that make it extremely difficult for most flavored cartridge-based cigarettes to be sold in convenience stores and gas stations, as my colleague Laurie McGinley first reported last week. The agency is also mulling a first step toward banning menthol cigarettes, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd Gottlieb signaled to McGinley yesterday that the FDA is planning new regulations on flavored cigars \u2014 which, McGinley notes, could include a ban on most flavored cigars. \u201cI think you can expect us to look at pursuing action on that,\u201d he said at a Washington Post Live event:\n\nThe industry is paying close attention. Juul Labs, the company that controls more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market, announced yesterday it would stop selling most of its flavored e-cigarette pods in convenience stores and vape shops and would halt social media promotion of the products.\n\nThe company is responsible for much of the recent spike in kids using e-cigarettes. \u201cJuul, a sleek e-cigarette introduced in 2015, has taken much of the blame for the rise in use by youths,\u201d McGinley explains. \u201cA technical and design breakthrough, the e-cigarette looks like a USB flash drive and, in a break from past vaping products, delivers high levels of nicotine that are smooth, not harsh. Each of its pods, which come in such flavors as mango and cucumber, provides as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes present a bit of a conundrum to those seeking to help Americans stop smoking. Some advocates view them as a useful tool to help adult smokers quit more dangerous cigarettes.\n\nBut research also indicates many e-cigarette users become addicted to nicotine and eventually switch to regular cigarettes. That\u2019s troubling when you consider preliminary government data showing e-cigarette use rose 77 percent among high school students and nearly 50 percent among middle school students this year. According to that data, which McGinley cited in her piece, 3.5 million kids now engage in vaping.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (Photo by Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post)\n\nThose sobering findings haven\u2019t prevented some on the right from recently criticizing Gottlieb, accusing him of enabling the kind of government \u201coverreach\u201d they would more commonly expect from a Democrat-led administration.\n\n\u201cThe FDA must stop this federal overreach in food and tobacco policy and respect personal freedom, markets and the plain language of laws,\u201d Daren Bakst, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a piece also criticizing the FDA for implementing Obama-era menu labeling requirements.\n\nFreedomWorks, a conservative and libertarian advocacy group, blasted out a statement on Friday calling the FDA\u2019s intention to crack down on e-cigarette sales \u201ca profound disappointment\u201d and a \u201cserious step backwards\u201d from the administration\u2019s deregulating goals.\n\n\u201cCommissioner Gottlieb has tragically done a 180,\u201d said Patrick Hedger, policy director for FreedomWorks. \u201cInstead of working with industry to promote innovative and less harmful products, the FDA has continued to do nothing but smother new products and businesses in bureaucratic red tape and obstruction, emblematic of the culture in Washington that President Trump has tried to change.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Gottlieb to respond to such criticisms, he pointed to the 2009 Tobacco Control Act and the authority it gives the FDA to try to lower smoking rates.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about what role government should play; this is a legal mandate,\u201d Gottlieb told me.\n\nIt's also an issue that involves kids and their potential for becoming addicted to a chemical (nicotine) that could one day take their lives.\n\n\u201cI must have said dozens of times \u2026that allowing e-cigarettes to continue on the market could not come at the expense of addicting a whole generation of kids to these products,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nSally Satel, a lecturer at Yale University and resident at AEI, where she worked with Gottlieb, said she thinks the FDA chief is under tremendous pressure by Congress to do something about the growing use of electronic tobacco products among children \u2014 and thinks he is doing the best he can.\n\n\u201cAdult access should not come at the expense of children, but there has to be a way to negotiate that tradeoff, and he\u2019s trying, I think, under the circumstances,\u201d Satel said.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services building is seen in Washington.

Kudlow said Navarro was \u201cway off base,\u201d \u201cfreelancing,\u201d and \u201cnot representing the president or the administration,\u201d when he warned unnamed financiers to stay away from U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nNavarro, in a fiery Friday speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, accused unnamed people of acting as \u201cunpaid foreign agents,\u201d trying to put \u201cthe imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street\u201d on a deal between the superpowers (see the full address here). Kudlow responded in a CNBC interview Tuesday, saying Navarro was \u201cnot authorized by anybody\u201d to make those remarks and adding they had done \u201ca great disservice\u201d to the president.\n\nThe clash comes as the Trump administration is reengaging with Beijing ahead of a meeting this month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires. That huddle likely provides the last best hope for heading off a dramatic escalation of the trade conflict. Barring a breakthrough, Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on the remaining $267 billion in Chinese imports \u2014 and 10 percent duties that are in place on $200 billion of Chinese goods are set to climb to 25 percent at the start of next year.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked trade by phone on Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He, the Wall Street Journal reported. That conversation followed one this month between Trump and Xi. And Kudlow told reporters yesterday the U.S. and Chinese governments are now \u201ccommunicating at all levels and that\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d Ahead of the G-20 meeting, he said the administration is working on \u201cbackground materials in preparation and we\u2019re waiting for China to come back with some thoughts.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence, meanwhile, tells The Post\u2019s Josh Rogin that Xi will need to pledge massive changes to secure a deal. Per Josh, \u201cIn addition to trade, Pence said China must offer concessions on several issues, including but not limited to its rampant intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, restricted access to Chinese markets, respect for international rules and norms, efforts to limit freedom of navigation in international waters and Chinese Communist Party interference in the politics of Western countries.\u201d\n\nThe big question hanging over the conflict remains what kind of deal Trump will accept. And the Kudlow-Navarro spat appears to offer China watchers some fresh clues.\n\nNavarro\u2019s speech \u201cwas a clear tip-off that a deal is in the works,\u201d says Fred Bergsten, the founding director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a deal, so he\u2019s going public with his complaints about it.\u201d\n\nWhite House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nSome aren\u2019t convinced. Another person close to the process noted Trump has been talking up his nationalist bona fides recently: \u201cHe may be saying to the free traders, \u2018Go bring me a deal, while also saying to the other faction, 'Give me some tariffs. Help me ensure the Chinese pay a price for pillaging and plundering.\u2019 I think they coexist.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and China last arrived at such a potentially decisive moment in May, when Mnuchin negotiated a deal with Liu that Trump ultimately rejected, heeding his hawks, including Navarro and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a similar intersection,\u201d says Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at CSIS. \u201cThe two presidents meeting at the G-20 is the next opportunity for them to find a potential resolution, limited or larger, so there\u2019s been a lot of lobbying inside and outside the administration to suggest even a limited deal, like a freeze of further hostilities, is warranted. We\u2019re seeing the consequences of that effort in the sparring back and forth in public.\u201d\n\nThat lobbying has included cameo appearances by former treasury secretary Hank Paulson and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, warned in a speech in Singapore last week that an \u201ceconomic iron curtain\u201d threatens to divide the world if the U.S. and China can\u2019t resolve their differences; Kissinger, at the same conference, said \u201cfundamental conflict\u201d between the countries \u201cwill destroy hope for the world order.\u201d Both have met with Chinese leaders in the past two weeks, the Journal reports.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who Navarro had in mind when he called out Wall Streeters. But Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, \u201cwho has one of the closest relationships to Beijing of any American executive, is in many ways the president\u2019s de facto China whisperer,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Kranish reported in March. Schwarzman, he wrote, helped \u201cpersuade the man who said Beijing\u2019s leaders were \u2018raping\u2019 the United States not to follow through on a campaign promise to declare China a \u2018currency manipulator.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe divisions aren\u2019t new: Navarro and Mnuchin had an \u201cexpletive-packed shouting match\u201d in Beijing back in May after Navarro complained he was being excluded from meetings with Chinese leaders, The Post reported at the time.\n\nBut the tensions are spilling back into the open at a critical moment. If Trump and Xi can\u2019t strike a deal, they may not get another chance to hash one out in person until the next G-20 summit in Osaka, in late June.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May. (Daniel Leal-Olivas / AFP)\n\n\u2014 Brexit deal in sight. WSJ's Max Colchester and Laurence Norman: \u201cNegotiators for Britain and the European Union on Tuesday hammered out a draft Brexit deal, setting up a critical endgame in which Prime Minister Theresa May must now try to sell the plan to her skeptical ministers and Parliament. Following more than two years of wrangling over Brexit, Mrs. May is set to put the proposed pact before her deeply divided cabinet on Wednesday. Her political future and that of her Conservative Party could well depend on the outcome. If the prime minister doesn\u2019t get the necessary backing, she could face the prospect of being unseated by her party or forced into calling new elections.\n\n\u2014 Greenspan: Watch out for inflation. Bloomberg News's Sarah Foster: \u201cFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said a rising U.S. debt burden could derail the current expansion and warned the tight labor market could lift inflation. \u2018I\u2019m beginning to see the first signs of it,\u2019 Greenspan said about inflation during an interview on \u2018The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations\u2019 on Bloomberg Television. \u2018We\u2019re seeing it basically in the tightening of the labor markets first, which, as you know, have gotten very tight now. We\u2019re beginning finally to see average wages rise, and clearly there\u2019s no productivity behind it.\u2019 ... Greenspan said a lack of productivity growth meant \u2018you\u2019re getting into a system now which has no outcome that\u2019s in equilibrium other than inflation and no productivity growth.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Oil rout rattles markets.

Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs and Jenny Leonard: \"The Trump administration will hold off for now on imposing new tariffs on automobile imports as top officials weigh revisions to a report on the national security implications, according to two people familiar with the matter. [Trump] met with his top trade advisers on Tuesday at the White House to discuss a draft report on a Commerce Department investigation into the impact of car imports.

Reuters: \"The European Union will respond with countermeasures if the United States imposes tariffs on its cars, the bloc\u2019s trade commissioner told Germany\u2019s Die Zeit weekly on Wednesday.

The Washington Post's John Wagner and James McAuley: \u201cTrump unleashed verbal attacks Tuesday on French President Emmanuel Macron, taking aim at his approval rating, his country\u2019s employment rate, its trade policies on wine and his vision for the military. The broadside on Twitter escalated a spat that began Friday when Trump took umbrage at Macron\u2019s call in a radio interview for a \u2018true European army\u2019 so that the continent can defend itself without relying on the United States . . . In another tweet Tuesday, Trump complained of a trade disparity suggesting that it makes it harder for U.S. winemakers to sell their products in France. \u2018On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S.,\u2019 the president wrote. \u2018The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\u2019 Trump made no mention of the winery he owns in Charlottesville, which he bought at a foreclosure auction in 2011 and is now run by his son Eric.\u201d\n\nOn Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs.

Bloomberg: \"A flashback to Richard Nixon\u2019s 1973 soybean embargo and Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1980 Soviet grain ban suggest that what\u2019s already happened this year may lead to permanent changes ahead as China seeks alternatives to the U.S. market. Nixon\u2019s move spurred Japan to invest in Brazil\u2019s then-nascent soy industry, setting the Latin America giant on a path to become the world\u2019s top exporter. Carter\u2019s ban was met with trade flow changes that rendered it ineffective and tarnished the U.S.\u2019s reputation as a reliable supplier. 'It\u2019s possible that China will never fully trust the U.S. as a reliable trade partner again,' said Ann Berg, an independent consultant and veteran trader who started her career at Louis Dreyfus Co. in 1974.\"\n\nMELTDOWN WATCH:\n\n\u2014 Trump's 2020 challenge: A potential recession. The Post's Heather Long: \"Most economists are predicting that the economy will be weaker \u2014 or even in a recession \u2014 by the time voters go to the polls in 2020. For Trump and the GOP, the economy was probably a tail wind in these midterms, but it could turn into a substantial head wind by then... The president will have to decide: Does he take further action to boost growth, or does he blame others for any slowdown? Pessimism is growing on Wall Street about future prospects for earnings and the economy. More than a third of top economic forecasters now predict a U.S. recession in 2020, according to the latest Blue Chip forecast, and 44 percent of fund managers in the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey expect global growth to slow in the next year, the worst outlook for the world economy since November 2008.\"\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\n\u2014 Amazon HQ2 sparks a backlash. The Post's Taylor Telford: \u201cThe drawn-out theater of Amazon\u2019s decision Tuesday to split its second headquarters between New York\u2019s Long Island City and Arlington, Va.\u2019s Crystal City was met with a maelstrom of criticism from local officials and professionals. While Amazon has touted the prosperity the headquarters would bring \u2014 pledging to make $5 billion in capital investments and create 50,000 jobs between the two headquarters \u2014 politicians voiced concerns that the influx of tech workers would fuel inequality and hurt lower-income populations. . . .\n\n\"Democratic Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Monday that her office had been flooded with calls from residents who were outraged by the pending Amazon deal. She also questioned who would truly benefit from \u2014 and who would pay for \u2014 the transformation the company touted. . . . In a statement, Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos painted the selection of two major East Coast cities as a means of keeping the company competitive when it comes to talent. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.).\u201d\n\nAmazon is a billion-dollar company.

The Post's Jonathan O'Connell and Rachel Siegel: \u201cThe concerns about Amazon\u2019s process for selecting the winning cities \u2014 as well as the taxpayer subsidies it gained \u2014 underscore how the company\u2019s furious expansion is inviting increasing political scrutiny. And as the company prepares to enter its 25th year in existence, the political risks aren\u2019t likely to ease...\n\n\u201cMany of the technology industry\u2019s giants are facing extra political skepticism today. But Amazon is unusual in that it is becoming geographically entrenched across America \u2014 offering it potential grass-roots support \u2014 as it also becomes formidable in a number of sectors such as retail, government contracting and entertainment. Amazon is now the second-largest employer in the United States after Walmart, giving it access to more lawmakers, mayors and public officials whom it can try to influence and whose support it can try to enlist.\u201d\n\nHQ2 decision could feed Trump's resentment of Bezos. \u201cAnything that makes Bezos more prominent in Washington is going to irritate Trump and he will take it personally,\u201d Michael D\u2019Antonio, author of the 2015 Trump biography \u2018Never Enough,' tells Politico's Eric Engleman and Steven Overly. \u201cHe will think Bezos made this decision to stick it to him.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Starbucks to cut jobs.

The coffee chain is restructuring to speed innovation and pump slowing sales. \u2018Today will be a difficult day for all of us,\u2019 Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in an internal email to employees viewed by Bloomberg News. \u2018As we continue evolving our core areas of marketing, creative, product, technology and store development, we are making some significant changes to these areas, as well as other functions across our global business.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2014 Whistleblower's lawyer warns about money laundering.

Stephen Kohn, a partner at U.S. law firm Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto who is representing Danske whistleblower Howard Wilkinson, told Reuters that Danske may be only a bit player in a scheme to move wealth from countries like Russia to the West . . . \u2018If this is properly investigated, and the money followed all the way to the end \u2014 it all went to large, multinational Western financial institutions and either the U.S. government or other authorities have the ability to track down every transfer and any account,\u2019 he said, without providing evidence for the allegation.\u201d\n\nDeparture of Top Wells Fargo Executive Shows Chasm With Regulator A top regulator recently sent a letter rebuking Wells Fargo\u2019s chief administrative officer, Hope Hardison, leading her to take a leave of absence and showing the issues between the lender and its overseers are far from over.

WSJ's Kate Davidson: \"The U.S. government ran a $100 billion deficit last month, compared with a $63 billion budget gap in October 2017, as spending growth outpaced revenue growth, the U.S. Treasury said Tuesday. The Treasury Department said federal outlays rose 18% in the first month of the 2019 fiscal year compared with the same period a year earlier, in large part because of higher spending on Medicare, national defense and interest payments on the debt... A strong economy typically leads to narrower deficits, as rising household income and corporate profits help boost tax collections, while spending on safety-net programs tends to decline.\n\n\u2014 Fed nominees may have to wait.

(Elaine Thompson/AP)\n\nA New Hampshire judge\u2019s attempt to compel Amazon to share recordings from an Echo device at the scene of an alleged double murder is putting a fine point on law enforcement\u2019s growing demand for data from Internet of Things devices.\n\nProsecutors are seeking two days of recordings from the smart speaker in a Farmington, N.H., home where two women were found dead in January 2017, according to a report from CBS Boston. The judge directed the company to turn over evidence in the case, but so far, Amazon has said it \u201cwill not release customer data without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.\"\n\nAs more devices such as voice assistants, home security cameras, appliances and even doorbells come online, the trove of intimate data that technology companies hold is increasing exponentially. People are voluntarily bringing in devices that record their conversations, track their heart rates, and comings-and-goings -- all of which produces more intimate and real-time potential evidence that law enforcement might want to help solve crimes.\n\nBut as the companies battle backlash over privacy concerns, there's an incentive for technology companies to protect this data from anyone other than the customer. Expect the showdown between law enforcement and companies to continue to play out the courts.\n\n\u201cAmazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman told me regarding the New Hampshire case. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nProsecutors in that case are trying to piece together the sequence of events that led to the deaths of two women sometime between January 27 and 29, 2017. Their bodies were found under the porch of a home with stab wounds, according to reports. Investigators believe one woman was attacked in the kitchen where an Echo device was located, and \"prosecutors believe there is probable cause to believe there is evidence on the Echo, such as audio recordings of the attack and events that followed it,\u201d according to court documents obtained by CBS.\n\nInvestigators think essential evidence to the case could be on Amazon\u2019s servers, where it stores recordings of customer interactions with the device after they use a \u201cwake word\u201d that alerts the device a command is coming.\n\nDevices such as the Amazon Echo and the Google Home are only supposed to record when they hear command words, such as the word \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cHey, Google.\u201d But sometimes the devices can misinterpret a wake word and start recording anyway, as was the case in Oregon this year, when an Echo device inadvertently recorded a family\u2019s conversation and sent it to one of their contacts.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Senior Staff Attorney Nate Cardozo said law enforcement has long asked technology companies to turn over data from connected devices. Such requests date back to at least the early 2000s, when law enforcement tried to surveil via car assistance programs. But it\u2019s happening with greater frequency as the number of IoT devices in consumers\u2019 homes explodes. \u201cNow that everything has a microphone or a sensor,\u201d Cardozo said, \u201cthe amount of data is just so many orders of magnitude greater.\u201d\n\nResearch firm Gartner predicts there will be 20.4 billion IoT devices by 2020. That\u2019s a significant uptick from the 11.2 billion connected devices Gartner forecasts will be in use in 2018.\n\nAmazon resisted a previous attempt to gain recordings from an Alexa device. Last year, prosecutors in Arkansas issued a warrant calling on Amazon to turn over recordings in another murder trial. The company fought the warrant, saying user conversations were protected under the First Amendment. The company eventually turned over the recordings with the permission of the device\u2019s owner.\n\nLaw enforcement\u2019s embrace of the Internet of Things has also included fitness trackers. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that police used Fitbit data to charge a 90-year-old man in the slaying of his stepdaughter. The device showed the victim\u2019s heart rate spiked significantly after the man arrived at her house and then stopped shortly before he left. Fitbit declined to comment on the New York Times piece, referring the reporter to its privacy policy, where it says it complies with legal processes when it shares data. Fitness tracker data has also been used to solve cases of sexual assault.\n\nAnd it's not only local law enforcement that is seeking to leverage Internet of Things devices. Two years ago, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. said the intelligence community could use smart home devices for investigations.\n\n\u201cIn the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\u201d the Guardian reported Clapper said at the time.\n\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks during a news briefing at the White House in Washington on April 4.

Taylor (R), a Navy SEAL, greets voters outside the Second Presbyterian Church in Norfolk on Election Day. (Jim Morrison for The Washington Post)\n\nAs many have reported by now, the 2018 midterm elections included a record number of female veteran candidates \u2014 candidates who won their races at higher rates than did non-incumbent male veterans. In general, the number of lawmakers who are military vets has been declining for years . But in the 116th Congress, the number of female veterans in Congress will rise from four to at least five \u2014 and could go as high as six, depending on the final results in the race of former Air Force captain Gina Ortiz Jones , a Democrat running for the House in Texas\u2019s 23rd District.\n\n[Having fewer veterans in Congress makes it less likely to restrain the president\u2019s use of force]\n\nHere\u2019s how female veterans did in the midterms\n\nOf the unprecedented 14 female veterans on the ballot, three were Republicans and 11 Democrats. None were incumbents, with the exception of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who won reelection. Of those who were not incumbents, only two ran for open seats that had previously been held by a member of their party: Martha McSally, who ran for Jeff Flake\u2019s Arizona Senate seat, and Wendy Rogers, a Republican running for the House, also in Arizona, both of whom lost. Another ran in a newly drawn district: Chrissy Houlahan, who ran for the House as a Democrat in Pennsylvania, against an incumbent member of Congress.\n\nFour Democrats won their elections, flipping three districts.\n\nFemale veterans who were not incumbents have won 23 percent of their races so far; if Jones wins, this will increase to 30 percent. Male veterans who were not incumbents have won just 14 percent of their races, with three still undecided. If each of the remaining seats goes to a veteran candidate, male non-incumbent veterans\u2019 success rate will rise to 17 percent.\n\n[Was it a \u2018blue wave\u2019 or not? That depends on how you define a \u2018wave.\u2019]\n\nThat success rate is a big change from female veterans\u2019 past record\n\nThe first female veteran who made it to Capitol Hill was Catherine Small Long (D-La.) after winning a special election in 1985. 1998 was the first year a female veteran won in a regular election: Heather Wilson (R-N.M.), now serving as secretary of the Air Force.\n\nSince then, a handful of notable candidates have won \u2014 but as is typical for challengers, most have lost, Republicans and Democrats alike. From 2004 through 2016, Republicans nominated 10 veteran women (we exclude California, Louisiana and Washington, which use nonpartisan primaries). The two GOP winners were Wilson and McSally. During the same time, Democrats nominated 18; again, only two won \u2014 Gabbard and Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who served in the House before winning her Senate race.\n\nEarly in 2018, it became clear that things would be different for female veterans. When Amy McGrath entered the race for Kentucky\u2019s 6th District, she was not favored to win even the Democratic primary. But her first advertisement , featuring the story of how she became the \u201cfirst female Marine to fly in an F-18 in combat,\u201d went viral, earning $300,000 within 72 hours. Fulsome media coverage of her and the other female veterans followed.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nWhy were Democratic veteran women so successful in 2018?\n\nIn all, Democrats nominated about as many female veterans this year as Republicans have ever nominated \u2014 but just nominating veteran women isn\u2019t enough to get them into office. Over the past 10 years, veteran women have run as Democrats in districts that, on average, were harder to win than the districts in which Democratic non-veteran women were running. Between 2004 and 2016, female veterans ran in districts where the baseline partisanship \u2014 a term meaning the average Democratic share of the vote in the previous presidential election \u2014 was 39 percent, making them look a bit like sacrificial lambs. In 2018, this figure was 46 percent . In other words, this year more veteran women were running in districts that were winnable.\n\nFurther, voters believe veterans are better able to handle national defense than others. However, as noted above, the overall share of veterans in Congress is declining . The intersection of gender and defense may have opened doors for Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s because when female veterans run for office, they benefit from both high levels of trust in the military and the typical advantages of running as a woman \u2014 being perceived as less corrupt , more empathetic and more competent on such domestic issues as poverty \u2014 without the risk of being seen as too weak . They may be able to appeal across party lines in a way that male veterans and women who have not served in the military do not.\n\nThere are additional advantages for female veterans who run as Democrats. When veterans run as Democrats, they challenge the general perception that Republicans are more trustworthy on military and defense issues. Female veterans may appeal to voters because they are women who have excelled in a field that is male-dominated \u2014 and because independents and Republicans can interpret \u201cveteran\u201d as an indicator of patriotism and conservatism at a time when the president refers to Democrats as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nFemale veterans in this cycle may also have served as a symbolic antidote to President Trump, even more than female candidates in general did. The party opposed to the president generally picks up seats in the midterms. But even given that, women who volunteered for combat offered a clear contrast to a man who took five wartime draft deferments . And as women, they could still implicitly rebuke the president\u2019s \u201c locker room banter \u201d that outraged so many women.\n\nThese female veterans are a subset of a large influx of women into Congress two years into the Trump presidency. While they should be seen as a part of this group , they share an experience common to only a small subset of the population. Many have framed their candidacies as continuations of their service .\n\nRebecca Best (@RebeccaBestIR) is assistant professor of political science at University of Missouri in Kansas City."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Morning Bits: Lawsuits as far as the eye can see", "description": "Must-read links to start the day", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/14/morning-bits-lawsuits-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:45:41Z", "content": "Another day, another lawsuit in Florida.

A listener rather than a grandstander. A builder of consensus at a time of polarization.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s greatest asset as she positions herself to become Germany\u2019s next leader is that she is widely regarded as Merkel\u2019s choice for the job. That is also her biggest liability.\n\nThe race to be crowned chancellor-in-waiting will culminate early next month in a vote at the ruling Christian Democratic Union\u2019s annual convention. It is fast shaping up as a referendum on Merkel\u2019s 13-year run, with the chancellor\u2019s legacy and the direction of Europe\u2019s largest economy on the line.\n\nIf Kramp-Karrenbauer is chosen, Merkelism will live on in Germany and Merkel will have a shot at an exit that is gradual and graceful, potentially finishing her full fourth term as chancellor before retiring in 2021.\n\nBut success for either of the other main contenders would set Germany on a different course: an end to Merkel-style moderation in favor of ideologically committed conservatism, and a potentially messy ejection of the woman who has been one of Europe\u2019s most consequential modern leaders.\n\nIt is not clear which way the party\u2019s 1,001 delegates will swing. Merkel long held unquestioned dominance of the CDU. But that has crumbled amid backlash to her 2015 decision to allow in more than 1 million asylum seekers.\n\nWith the party\u2019s poll numbers sagging and internal discontent brewing, Merkel announced late last month that she would not run for another term as the party\u2019s leader. Along with Kramp Karrenbauer, two Merkel critics from the party\u2019s right flank \u2014 former CDU parliamentary leader Friedrich Merz and Health Minister Jens Spahn \u2014 quickly jumped into a race that is highly likely, although not certain, to determine who will lead Germany.\n\nMerkel, 64, has not officially endorsed a candidate. But Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56 \u2014 whose tongue-twister of a name, even for Germans, often yields to the simpler AKK or \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d \u2014 is widely perceived to be the chancellor\u2019s pick. Merkel named her the party\u2019s general secretary in the spring, the same position that began her own rise to the top.\n\nMerkel\u2019s blessing is, even supporters concede, a mixed one.\n\n\u201cPeople who basically want continuity but with a different face will choose Annegret,\u201d said Karl Rauber, a close ally of Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s within the CDU who has known her for decades. \u201cThe problem is that people don\u2019t want things to continue as they are. They want changes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe candidates for Christian Democratic Union leadership \u2014 Jens Spahn, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Friedrich Merz \u2014 arrive for a media statement in Berlin on Nov. 9. (Clemens Bilan/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPolls of CDU members show Merz and Kramp-Karrenbauer running neck and neck, with Spahn a distant third.\n\nLaunching her campaign last week in Berlin, Kramp-Karrenbauer declared the \u201cend of an era\u201d defined by Merkel \u2014 and walked a characteristically pragmatic line in her pitch for how to follow it.\n\n\u201cSuch an era cannot be simply continued or reversed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe decisive question is what you do with what you have inherited.\u201d\n\nShould Kramp-Karrenbauer win the CDU vote, it would cap a rise nearly as unlikely as Merkel\u2019s head-spinning ascent from unknown East German physicist to leader of Germany\u2019s dominant postwar party in just 10 years.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer has had little experience in the rough-and-tumble of German national politics. Instead, she has forged nearly her entire career in the tiny western region of Saarland, which both literally and figuratively sits about as far as one can get in Germany from Berlin. With just 1 million people, it is the country\u2019s second smallest state. Even its biggest city, Saarbr\u00fccken, has the coziness of a remote provincial capital \u2014 which is exactly what it is.\n\n\u201cCan she handle the transition from the Saarland stage to the Berlin stage?\u201d said Daniel Kirch, chief political correspondent at the region\u2019s major newspaper, the Saarbr\u00fccker Zeitung. \u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question.\u201d\n\nWithin Saarland, where she served for seven years as state premier, she has legions of admirers and few enemies. Even her political opponents credit her with a consensual style of governance.\n\nStill, few say they ever regarded her as someone with the makings of a future chancellor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very humble and very nice and you wouldn\u2019t necessarily think she\u2019s ambitious,\u201d Kirch said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to where she is without being very ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe second-youngest among seven siblings, Kramp-Karrenbauer grew up in P\u00fcttlingen, a modest city near the French border that was hard-hit in her youth by the closure of coal mines where her ancestors had toiled for generations.\n\nThe family was devoutly Catholic and conservative. Her mother managed the home while her father served as principal at a school for children with developmental disabilities. (Merkel\u2019s father was a Lutheran pastor at a home for the disabled.)\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer would passionately debate politics with her father, although she shared many of his views, said Hans-Guenther Kramp, an older brother. She was studious and sang in the church choir \u2014 while dabbling in a taste for slightly harder-edged music, including metal band AC/DC.\n\n\u201cShe would fight with our younger brother about whose band was the best,\u201d said Kramp, who, like three of his four surviving siblings, still lives in P\u00fcttlingen. \u201cBut she would always let him finish his arguments before it was decided that both bands were equally good.\n\n\u201cShe does this in politics, too. It\u2019s her virtue.\u201d\n\nShe also can be resolute when principle is at stake, say those who have known her longest.\n\nWhen the local branch of the German Communist Party invited a Soviet official to P\u00fcttlingen\u2019s city hall in the late 1970s, Kramp-Karrenbauer and fellow young CDU activists built a Berlin Wall replica in front of the building \u2014 forcing the official into an embarrassing maneuver around it on his way inside, said Rudolf M\u00fcller, a former mayor.\n\nAs a young woman on P\u00fcttlingen\u2019s city council, Kramp-Karrenbauer was initially greeted with skepticism in a chamber dominated by older men, M\u00fcller said. But she won them over, pushing through a highly successful program to help laid-off workers.\n\n\u201cShe really listened, and only spoke when she had something to say,\u201d said M\u00fcller, who led the city for 27 years. \u201cIt took time to convince them, but she did.\u201d\n\nIn a conservative party, some were still thrown by how she balanced the demands of her career and motherhood. She accepted an interim appointment to the German parliament only days after one of her sons was born and appeared at debates with a baby in her arms. Her husband, a mining engineer, took leave from his job to care for their three children.\n\nPetra Berg, a leader of the center-left Social Democrats in Saarland, said Kramp-Karrenbauer was not taken as seriously as she should have been by male rivals. Merkel must also know that feeling. But Berg said the similarities between the two go far beyond gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too simplistic to say they have a connection because they\u2019re both women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is, they have very similar personalities. That\u2019s what ties them.\u201d\n\nLike Merkel, Kramp-Karrenbauer is reluctant to rush into a decision, preferring to wait until she has considered all available data and spoken with everyone involved.\n\nIt is an approach that has served her well in Saarland, where one of her first tasks after rising to premier was to trim 10 percent from a cash-strapped state budget.\n\nWhat might have been political poison became the path to a pair of decisive reelection victories, with Kramp-Karrenbauer convening roundtable meetings to agree collectively on how to mete out the cuts. Participants credited her with a process that was fair, even when it was painful.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not like other politicians in those situations. She\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Volker Linneweber, a former president of the University of Saarland. \u201cShe told me, \u2018I don\u2019t promise anything I can\u2019t deliver.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlthough Kramp-Karrenbauer is on the left of her party economically, she has appealed to the right on cultural issues. She opposed same-sex marriage when the parliament approved it last year. And she advocated a tough approach to asylum seekers, including mandatory age tests for those claiming to be minors.\n\nBut it is unclear whether that will be enough for the conservative wing of a party that hungers for a return to ideological roots after more than a decade camped out in the center.\n\nOn refugee politics, in particular, Kramp-Karrenbauer has not gone as far as many conservatives would like. She has stood by Merkel\u2019s decision to keep the country\u2019s borders open in 2015-16, while saying, as Merkel does, that the influx should not be repeated.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for AKK, and really value her both personally and as a politician,\u201d said Stefan Rabel, who leads the CDU in the Saarland city of V\u00f6lkingen and favors a more restrictive approach to immigration. \u201cBut after so many years of Merkel, there\u2019s appetite in the party for real change.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nGermany\u2019s Angela Merkel says she won\u2019t run again for party leader or chancellor\n\nWhile commemorating WWI, Macron auditions to be the leader of Europe\n\nMerkel and Macron got along so well in Paris that a 100-year-old woman thought they were married\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Dozens of migrants refuse to leave container ship in Libya", "description": "Dozens of migrants holed up in Libyan port city after being picked them up in foundering raft in Mediterranean", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/dozens-of-migrants-refuse-to-leave-container-ship-in-libya/2018/11/14/35c7b064-e807-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:17:10Z", "content": "MISRATA, Libya Dozens of migrants have barricaded themselves in a container ship in the Libyan port city of Misrata and refuse to disembark, saying Libya is too dangerous for them.

He said six commercial ships passed his group before the Nivin finally stopped.\n\nLibya\u2019s coast guard had no immediate comment on the situation.\n\nWith just one rescue ship patrolling the Mediterranean, and European ports refusing to take in rescued migrants, commercial ships have become increasingly leery of picking up people in the sea. Repeatedly in recent months, they have found themselves caught in the middle between governments hostile to new migrants and an obligation under international maritime law to save\n\nThe man, who identified himself only by his name, Victor, fearing for his safety, said he himself had already been imprisoned repeatedly in Libya and that his own brother had died there. He had no intention of returning, he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go out in Libya,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cYou can come and take my dead body outside.\u201d\n\nJulien Raickman, who is the head of the Doctors Without Borders mission in Libya, said Europe\u2019s policy of refusing to take in rescued migrants has led to a spike in deaths. Now one in five who cross perishes at sea, he said.\n\nRaickman said the Libyan coast guard has given international organizations access to the migrants, who have food and some degree of medical care now, but no toilets or other sanitary facilities. The ship\u2019s cargo of cars was peacefully unloaded, but the migrants remained unmoved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re afraid that this dispute will end in violence. The people who are on board are determined. They know that they went far and could face charges for taking control of a boat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these are people motivated by despair.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since Election Day, and we\u2019re still awaiting results from Florida and Georgia, where nationally prominent races are too close to call.\n\nSince Election Day, an additional 50,000 votes have been counted in Florida, narrowing the lead for Republican Gov. Rick Scott over Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson in the Senate race, and for Republican Ron DeSantis over Democrat Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial contest. Both races are headed to a recount. In Georgia, nearly 150,000 votes have been added to the election night tally, cutting the lead of Republican Brian Kemp in half over Democrat Stacey Abrams in the contest for governor. That contest, too, may be headed for a recount.\n\nAcross the country, in Arizona, a close-but-comfortable election night lead for Republican senatorial candidate Martha McSally was transformed a week later into a victory for her Democratic opponent, Kyrsten Sinema, as an additional 800,000 ballots were counted, and the results flipped.\n\nThis slow process of counting ballots has produced considerable controversy. But it shouldn\u2019t. Both state laws and sheer logistics make it impossible to finish counting ballots on election night or even within a day or two. Here\u2019s why that is \u2014 and why newly counted ballots seem to favor Democratic candidates.\n\nWhy the counting isn\u2019t done on election night\n\nThe election night tradition of gathering around the television to see the votes come in and news organizations \u201ccall\u201d the winners gives us a false impression: All the votes that need to be counted can, and should, be tallied in the minutes after the close of polls.\n\nBut this is wrong. For one, in almost every state, provisional ballots will have been cast on Election Day by voters whose registration cannot be verified. In 2016, 2.1 million voters cast a provisional ballot, 71 percent of which were eventually counted after the registration was verified. States are currently in the middle of verifying the registration status of those who cast provisional ballots in 2018, and decisions are being made about whether to count those ballots in this election. Moreover, millions of ballots have been mailed in, which now need to be opened, have voters\u2019 signatures compared to the signature on record and then scanned.\n\n[Was it a \u2018blue wave\u2019 or not? That depends on how you define a \u2018wave.\u2019]\n\nIn some states, this means that a large number of votes are counted after Election Day. In 2016, California and Washington counted less than half their votes within a day of the election. Three other states, Alaska, Arizona and Utah counted only about 60 percent. Another six states had counted only 90 percent of their ballots.\n\nIn Arizona, ballot-counting takes extra time because three-quarters of Arizona\u2019s voters cast ballots by mail. Many of these are returned in person on Election Day. Processing mail ballots is labor-intensive and can take days if not weeks to complete. Arizona also has a relatively large percentage of provisional ballots \u2014 almost 4 percent of all ballots in 2016 \u2014 and those ballots must also be painstakingly processed.\n\nIn Florida, the situation is different. Florida actually tends to have a small number of ballots to be counted after Election Day. In 2016, nearly 98 percent of all ballots were counted on either Election Day or the day after. The same pattern is repeating in 2018. Most of Florida\u2019s absentee ballots arrive before Election Day. State law allows counties to tally absentee ballots \u2014 and keep the results quarantined \u2014 which speeds up the count.\n\nFlorida law does prohibit its large number of early votes from being tabulated before the polls close on Election Day. However, it is clear that almost all counties have organized themselves in such a way that they can get the early-vote count completed within hours of the polls closing. Broward and Palm Beach Counties have not chosen to do this, but they are acting within the discretion given under Florida law.\n\nWhy do the newly counted ballots favor Democrats?\n\nSince the 2000 presidential election, the post-election-night vote count has favored Democratic candidates in most states. This pattern was first identified by Ohio State University law professor Edward B. Foley, who called it the \u201cblue shift.\u201d\n\n[The blue wave was big \u2014 and significant \u2014 in state legislatures]\n\nThe blue shift was evident in 2016. On the Wednesday after Election Day, 124 million ballots had been counted, and Hillary Clinton led Donald Trump in the national popular vote by only 0.2 percentage points. But as an additional 13 million ballots were counted, Clinton\u2019s lead widened to about 2 points. The blue shift happened in most states, as well \u2014 although Clinton\u2019s lead in Washington state actually shrank by over 3 points as all the ballots were counted.\n\nThere are two reasons the blue shift exists and has become more prominent. First, the 2002 Help America Vote Act required states to institute provisional ballots for voters with a disputed registration status when they went to vote. Because voters who cast a provisional vote are more likely to be young and members of a racial or ethnic minority group, provisional ballots are disproportionately Democratic.\n\nSecond, Democrats are slightly more likely to vote by mail than Republicans. This is probably because Democratic campaigns are more likely to emphasize turning out supporters before Election Day than are Republican campaigns. Thus as these mail ballots are counted, the overall total will again lean Democratic.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened in Florida and Arizona is nothing new. In fact, it\u2019s entirely consistent with current trends in election law and election administration. Voters across the United States have demanded greater flexibility in how and when they cast their ballots. This greater flexibility comes with a price: a delay in counting ballots.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nOf course, one must guard against shenanigans that could occur during the counting of these additional ballots.\n\nBut to date, nothing about the vote-counting in Arizona and Florida suggests that the growing number of votes or their Democratic tilt are due to electoral improprieties.\n\nCharles Stewart III is the Kenan Sahin distinguished professor of political science at MIT and director of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Andrew Van Dam", "title": "This researcher studied 400,000 knitters and discovered what turns a hobby into a business", "description": "An MIT Sloan Ph.D. candidate discovered the factors that transformed skilled hobbyists into entrepreneurs.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/14/how-an-economist-found-an-ideal-dataset-inside-facebook-knitting/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:00:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nChrystal Prue, 40, from Ft. Washington, Md., winds yarn with a swift and ball-winder at Looped Yarn Works, a knitting store in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13. (Lexey Swall/FTWP)\n\nWhen she visited Ravelry.com, a pattern-sharing and social-media website known as the \u201cFacebook of knitting,\u201d MIT PhD candidate Hyejun Kim realized she was watching the journey from hobbyist to entrepreneur happen in real time. With data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to study this,\u201d she thought.\n\nKim\u2019s resulting analysis sheds light on the hard-to-measure early stages of entrepreneurship, and the social and economic forces that cause someone to flip the switch from \u201cfun\u201d to \u201cprofit.\u201d\n\nShe analyzed almost 100 interviews and 403,168 profiles of knitters and crocheters in the United States. She found that even on one of the Internet\u2019s great niche social networks, offline encouragement and feedback helped most talented hobbyists recognize their ability and take the first steps toward monetizing it. Success on the Internet was propelled by real-life interactions.\n\nHer work was brought to our attention via an enthusiastic endorsement from trendsetting blogger and George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.\n\nKim, who tried to knit but never got the hang of it, calculates that about 96 percent of Ravelry\u2019s users are women. In a time when online side hustles and gigs are proliferating, her work helps us understand the forces that encourage skilled women to step off the sidelines and participate.\n\n\n\nA look inside Looped Yarn Works, a knitting store in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13. (Lexey Swall/FTWP)\n\nMany entrepreneurs emerge from a pool of dedicated hobbyists, but it\u2019s hard to study that transition. You\u2019d have to meticulously track years of activities, interests and output of every person who participates in a hobby. Remarkably, Ravelry\u2019s design encourages their users to do almost exactly that.\n\nThe 8 million-plus people who have signed up for Ravelry since 2007 represent a diverse cross-section of the world\u2019s knitters. According to the site, Ravelry makes most of its money through \u201cyarn-related advertising.\u201d\n\nTogether those knitters have built the kind of detailed, long-running data set that prior generations of economists could only dream of. They post the projects they complete, the patterns and yarn they use, and the real-world groups they join. They even link their accounts to personal storefronts where they sell patterns to other users.\n\n\u201cFor knitters it is great to keep records,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFor researchers, it is great to observe every knitting activity of every knitter.\u201d\n\nTo better understand what transforms pattern users into pattern sellers, Kim reviewed 99 interviews with knitters on a niche newsletter and three blogs. The most common answer, by far, was that they\u2019d been encouraged by people they knew, such as husbands and friends. Many had already been modifying patterns and designing their own yarn gnomes and cat costumes, but until they heard from others, they lacked the confidence to step out on their own.\n\n\u201cFor many entrepreneurs, I think the biggest personal challenge is believing in yourself \u2014 that what you are creating is something that is desired and valued by others,\u201d designer Luise O\u2019Neill told the Patternfish newsletter in 2015.\n\nKim\u2019s analysis of data on 403,168 individual knitters from 2007 to 2014 backs this up. People who joined a so-called \u201cstitch n\u2019 bitch\u201d group to craft socially were 25 percent more likely than otherwise identical knitters to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. This is true even when correcting for geography, experience, skill level and productivity.\n\n\n\nOffline social networks create online entrepreneurs\n\nThe transformation begins immediately, implying that knitters realized their talent soon after meeting their peers, comparing their work and receiving feedback and encouragement.\n\nKim found the effect was strongest among those who were already the most skilled knitters. That suggests that in many cases social networks such as stitch n\u2019 bitch groups create entrepreneurs by encouraging those with the most talent, rather than educating those who lag behind.\n\nUniversity of Virginia economist Eric Chyn called Kim\u2019s approach creative and effective. \u201cIt\u2019s very compelling evidence using new data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt tells us something about the way in which peers matter,\u201d said Chyn. He was not involved in Kim\u2019s research but has studied similar social effects in different contexts.\n\nChyn said Kim\u2019s analysis suggested your peers may influence you in ways academics may not typically consider. It\u2019s often believed your social connections can propel you into entrepreneurship by providing information and resources that enable you to start a new business.\n\nWomen tended to be skilled stitchers and pattern designers before they joined their stitch n' bitch groups.\n\nBut the offline social network of the gatherings gave the knitters something they didn\u2019t have before: confidence."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "JM Rieger", "title": "These incoming House Democrats are still dodging questions about Nancy Pelosi", "description": "No fewer than eight incoming House Democrats plan to vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-fix/these-incoming-house-democrats-are-still-dodging-questions-about-nancy-pelosi/2018/11/14/d7375b5c-db07-447a-93be-785186dc58bb_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:00:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "This post has been updated.\n\nAs House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi works to shore up support for her speaker bid, it is unclear whether she has the votes to become speaker during a final floor vote in January, according to a Fix analysis.\n\nOf the 57 non-incumbent Democrats elected last week, nine have continued to say they will not vote for Pelosi and 31 have dodged questions (sometimes repeatedly) about her.

Ex-Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who has been apologetic about Japan\u2019s past wrongdoing, will represent the Japanese side, according to organizers.\n\nThe forum is organized by Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, and a South Korean civic organization. The South Korean government has said it has no plans to meet with the North Koreans during their four-day visit.\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment runs deep in both Koreas because the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan for 35 years before its division at the end of World War II in 1945. However, the Koreas have rarely taken joint steps to tackle history and other issues stemming from the colonization because of their decades-long split.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved this year, with the North entering disarmament talks with a vague promise to achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

(Eric Gay, File/Associated Press)\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany \u2014 The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that global oil supplies are growing rapidly as Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia pump more oil in response to fears of higher prices as a result of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe IEA said in its monthly report that October output rose by 2.6 million barrels a day to 100.7 million barrels as producers heeded warnings that looming U.S. sanctions could mean a loss of Iranian oil to the market and thus lead to higher prices.\n\nBut when President Donald Trump imposed sanctions Nov. 5, he issued six-month waivers for some of Iran\u2019s biggest oil customers. That helped send prices lower. Brent crude is trading below $70 per barrel, down from a four-year high above $86 per barrel in early October.\n\nBrent prices rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $65.86 at 1115 GMT (6:13 a.m. EST).\n\nThe Paris-based agency welcomed the higher production and stockpiles, saying that the response to the call by the IEA and others to boost production \u201cis a reminder that the oil industry works best when it works together.\u201d\n\nThe agency said that lower prices \u201care clearly a benefit to consumers,\u201d especially those in developing countries who are seeing higher fuel prices due to weak national currencies. Oil is priced in dollars and the U.S. currency has been strong of late.\n\nThe report authors warned that although the market seems more relaxed than a few weeks ago, rising stocks should be \u201cwelcomed as a form of insurance\u201d against unpredictable market events. The report notes that \u201cthe United States remains committed to reducing Iranian oil exports to zero from the 1.8 million barrels per day seen today.\u201d\n\nThere were also concerns about the stability of production in Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela, while a tanker collision in Norwegian waters, though modest in impact, \u201cis another reminder of the vulnerability of the system to accidents.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Leaders of Southeast Asian nations have pushed back yet again an agreement on a pan-Asian free trade deal amid a whirlwind of diplomacy Wednesday at their annual summit.\n\nIn convening talks among the leaders of countries participating in the plan, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a final agreement on the deal, which is expected to encompass nearly half the world\u2019s population and 40 percent of world trade, will be pushed back until 2019.\n\nLee\u2019s comments confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord this year.\n\nThe trade talks followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders and talks on other issues such as regional security, how to keep peace in the South China Sea and the crisis over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar to escape violence.\n\nDuring the meetings in Singapore, Lee has championed the region\u2019s commitment to free trade and a multilateral approach to sorting out the issue \u2014 in contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican First\u201d preference for bilateral trade deals and distrust of international institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting at a critical time. Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished five of seven chapters in their agreement and shown \u201cstrong political will\u201d in finishing it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement would damage the RCEP\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern; China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\u201d Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \u201cgreater stability\u201d with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing\u2019s hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code was needed \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China\u2019s assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \u201cDeclaration of Conduct\u201d but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \u201cserious miscalculation\u201d and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\u201cSo you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior ...\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there\u2019s friction between the Western nations and China,\u201d Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country\u2019s leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar\u2019s arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\u201d said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \u201cThat may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nThe date was Oct. 23, 2010 \u2014 nearly two years into President Barack Obama\u2019s first term and two weeks before the first midterm elections of his presidency. Speaking to the National Journal, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a now-infamous statement: \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler has pointed out, reading the quote in its full context makes it clear that McConnell was saying that it would be impossible for Republicans to achieve their policy goals with Obama in office. But Democrats immediately seized on the remark as proof that Republicans had single-mindedly set out to obstruct Obama\u2019s agenda, putting partisanship ahead of the country\u2019s best interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, McConnell, now the majority leader, published a FoxNews.com op-ed that struck a very different note. \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d the headline asked. Needless to say, it didn\u2019t go over well with liberals, who rushed to point out McConnell\u2019s unparalleled chutzpah and accuse him of blatant hypocrisy.\n\nSuch an ironic Op-Ed title coming from you @senatemajldr - don\u2019t you think? https://t.co/RFJVeRp6z4 \u2014 Amy McGrath (@AmyMcGrathKY) November 14, 2018\n\nMy latest Op-Ed: \u201cOur number one priority should be ensuring that Mitch McConnell is an only-one-more-term Majority Leader.\u201d https://t.co/yiASk0S4ud \u2014 Pat Cunnane (@PatCunnane) November 14, 2018\n\nThe op-ed began with McConnell recounting what Republicans have accomplished over the past two years: passing tax cuts, confirming two Supreme Court nominees and rolling back federal regulations. \u201cAfter this prolific run, I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat can we realistically accomplish?\u201d\n\nThe good news, McConnell answered, is that \u201creports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated.\u201d Legislation targeting the opioid epidemic, increasing defense funding, reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and funding infrastructure improvements passed with support from both parties, he noted. Then, in an abrupt tack, he argued that Democrats, having regained control of the House, should refrain from investigating President Trump:\n\nThe Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation. And looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol. What we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference? Last week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference. That message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, McConnell (or, more likely, a member of his staff) posted a link to the op-ed on Twitter. By midnight, he had received over 29,000 replies. Virtually all of them were from aggrieved liberals, many of whom responded with just one name: Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, whose appointment was blocked by McConnell.\n\nAmong the other responses:\n\n\u201cI hope we work with you the same way you worked with President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that every time Mitch McConnell tries to use the word \u2018partisan\u2019 a pie should hit him in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, you are in my lifetime one of the most zero-sum partisans I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics. That\u2019s not something to be proud of. It\u2019s the reason why Congress is so dysfunctional.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kept Democrats off all committees and withheld all information, so no. Go eat worms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol seriously?! How often did you work with Dems? How many times did you shut them out of major decisions when you had the majority or rammed things down our throats? Maybe you should have had this epiphany before now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr McConnell, yes, you\u2019re the world\u2019s top expert on putting party above country. No one has ever done so more blatantly than you. But now YOU are calling for bipartisanship? Your hypocrisy is astounding. Obviously, no decent American is going to take you seriously.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the Twitter reaction late Tuesday night. It\u2019s worth noting that his sentiments, however unpopular online, are not entirely out of sync with top Democratic Party leaders. Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pledged that Democrats would \u201cstrive for bipartisanship\u201d and seek common ground with Republicans \u2014 a conciliatory stance that incurred the wrath of some of her constituents.\n\nPelosi, who is vying to become the next House speaker, also avoided making any definitive statements about potential investigations into the Trump administration at a news conference immediately after the midterms. Telling reporters that the House of Representatives has \u201ca constitutional responsibility to have oversight,\u201d she added that she didn\u2019t anticipate \u201cany scattershot freelancing\u201d on that front. Democrats, she said, are \u201ctrying to unify our country.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nShot in the neck at 17, this is the trauma surgeon now leading doctors against gun violence and the NRA\n\n\u2018Bill Clinton should want to apologize\u2019: Monica Lewinsky opens up about scandal in new documentary\n\nCan CNN beat the White House in court?

Af\u2026 [+7369 chars]", "fulltext": "This post has been updated.\n\nIt may wind up being the most consequential legal question in Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s entire Russia investigation, and it has nothing to do with Mueller.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, is facing a legal fight to keep his job. After several legal experts raised constitutional objections to it, the state of Maryland has sought an injunction to declare Whitaker\u2019s appointment illegal and to recognize Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein as the rightful acting attorney general. The Justice Department has now responded.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s commentary on the Mueller probe is clearly sympathetic to Trump \u2014 to the extent of musing about defunding Mueller and even suggesting the Trump Tower meeting was business-as-usual. If he continues as acting attorney general, he could rule on consequential issues including potential indictments of Trump allies, up to and including the president\u2019s son. He could reject an attempt to subpoena the president.\n\nHis fate now appears to rest, in part, on an obscure century-old Supreme Court case that isn\u2019t exactly analogous to Whitaker\u2019s situation. But it may not need to be, and the ultimate arbiter of this could be the Supreme Court.\n\nThe basic issue at hand is whether Whitaker, who did not need to be confirmed by the Senate for his previous job as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, can replace Sessions in an acting capacity. The Constitution\u2019s \u201cAdvice and Consent\u201d clause holds that principal officers \u2014 that is, those who have no superior but the president, of which the attorney general is one \u2014 must have Senate approval. Since Whitaker would be serving in place of a principal officer, George Conway and former solicitor general Neal Katyal wrote in the New York Times, his appointment is \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nUnless, that is, he wouldn\u2019t actually be considered a principal officer. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) has said in recent days that Whitaker has defended himself by citing a 2003 opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. That 2003 opinion (which was incidentally written by Ed Whelan, most recently of Brett M. Kavanaugh-related infamy) in turn relies upon an 1898 Supreme Court case called United States v. Eaton.\n\nEaton seemed to lower the bar for acting officials serving in place of principals. It addressed the case of an unconfirmed \u201cvice consul\u201d serving in Siam \u2014 what is now Thailand. That vice consul was appointed to serve as a temporary replacement for the Senate-confirmed consul when the consul fell ill, but then a compensation dispute arose, with the ill consul and the vice consul both claiming the consul\u2019s salary.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the vice consul could act for the consul, even though he hadn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate, because he wasn\u2019t technically becoming the consul:\n\nBecause the subordinate officer is charged with the performance of the duty of the superior for a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions, he is not thereby transformed into the superior and permanent official. To so hold would render void any and every delegation of power to an inferior to perform under any circumstances or exigency the duties of a superior officer, and the discharge of administrative duties would be seriously hindered.\n\nThe parallel to Whitaker\u2019s case is apparent. Just as the vice consul didn\u2019t need to be confirmed because he was only serving on an acting basis, Whitaker seems likely to argue that he, too, can serve without confirmation on a temporary basis. He\u2019ll essentially argue that the acting job isn\u2019t a principal job, because it\u2019s temporary. And he\u2019ll have some backup, given that acting officials don\u2019t assume the salary of the principals they are filling in for.\n\nBut the parallels only go so for. In Eaton, the vice consul was the highest-ranking official available in Siam; the next person in line had not yet been confirmed by the Senate and hadn\u2019t made his way overseas. In the case of Whitaker, there are Senate-confirmed officials in place, including most notably Rosenstein but also Solicitor General Noel Francisco. There is even a law on the books that determines the line of succession.\n\nThe language above from Eaton also cites \u201cspecial and temporary conditions.\u201d Trump effectively forced Sessions out, and even though Sessions technically resigned, he took care to note it was at Trump\u2019s urging. \u201cAs you requested,\u201d Sessions wrote, \u201cI am submitting my resignation.\u201d So is it an emergency if it\u2019s a situation of Trump\u2019s own making? If he can do this, couldn\u2019t he just force out people he doesn\u2019t like in the name of creating supposed emergencies and appointing unconfirmed acting replacements?\n\nAnne Joseph O\u2019Connell, an expert on presidential appointments at Stanford University, said she believes Whitaker\u2019s appointment is constitutional \u2014 even if it\u2019s \u201cterrible as a matter of policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Whitaker situation is hard as it doesn\u2019t appear to be an emergency. But such facts can make bad law,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if Sessions were pushed out for true wrongdoing? Would that have counted? I don\u2019t think courts want to get in the business of figuring out reasons for departures.\u201d\n\nThe situation might not even need to be an emergency, though. At the time of Eaton in 1898, there was no such thing as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. That act, which came exactly 100 years later, in 1998, created three means by which a Senate-confirmed vacancy could be filled on a temporary basis. The third method is by someone with at least 90 days' service in the last year at the agency at issue, provided they have served above a certain pay grade, known as \u201cGS-15\u2033 \u2014 qualifications that Whitaker meets.\n\nThe FVRA makes no mention of an \u201cemergency\u201d being required, though. Instead, it says one of the three options can be triggered as long as the principal \u201cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office.\u201d Sessions technically resigned, so as long as the FVRA is considered constitutional, Whitaker would seem to be in the clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that the Whitaker situation is different from that of our 1890s man in Siam,\u201d said Andrew Rudalevige of Bowdoin College, \u201cbut so is the law.\u201d\n\nThe counterargument to all of that comes from John Yoo, a Bush administration aide who served in the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel around the same time as the 2003 opinion and previously served as general counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. He writes in the Atlantic that Whitaker satisfies the requirements of the FVRA, but that the appointment might still be deemed unconstitutional:\n\nDefenders might rely on an 1898 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Eaton, which allowed for the temporary appointment of a vice-consul in Thailand \u201cfor a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions,\u201d namely, the illness of the consul and the vast distance between the U.S. and Thailand. This is basically the approach of a 2003 Justice Department opinion approving the elevation of an assistant Office of Management and Budget director to acting director, and the likely reasoning of the White House in appointing Whitaker. ... Elevating practical needs over constitutional meaning, however, is not an attitude usually adopted by conservatives. ... It is difficult to see [Chief Justice] John Roberts\u2019s Court finding that the acting attorney general, responsible for all federal law enforcement in the nation, amounts to the same sort of officer as a vice-consul struggling in the hinterlands of Thailand before the days of air flight and instantaneous communications.\n\nBut David Lewis of Vanderbilt University said the court was unlikely to make such an exception.\n\n\u201cIn cases where the Constitution is silent like this, Congress and the president enact laws to regularize practice,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe 1998 Vacancies Reform Act attempted to regularize the presidential practice of filling Senate confirmed positions on a temporary basis and did so with an eye toward curbing the president\u2019s ability to use acting officials as replacements for actual nominees.\u201d\n\nThe arguments against Whitaker\u2019s appointment seem more aspirational and idealistic -- as if that\u2019s what the proponents think the courts should decide and not necessarily what they will. That\u2019s not necessarily from a partisan perspective (Conway and Yoo are both Republicans) but from a Constitutional one. But on the other side, experts on appointments seem to see Whitaker as likely to prevail. We shall see. The implications are massive."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Can CNN beat the White House in court?

Debate ensues over the journalist\u2019s tactics and whether he presents a physical threat more menacing than the pummeling that issues from his pen, or his microphone. The government doesn\u2019t offer a clear account and is sued on First Amendment grounds.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jim Acosta isn\u2019t the original protagonist in this drama, which is roiling Washington and drawing stern warnings from the likes of Bob Woodward. While the controversy, like so many others with President Trump at their center, appears to occupy uncharted territory, it actually doesn\u2019t.\n\nA case cited in the network\u2019s complaint against Trump, as well as members of his administration and the Secret Service, points to an important precursor, which holds clues about the viability of CNN\u2019s suit, filed Tuesday.\n\nThe case is Sherrill v. Knight, decided in 1977 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It\u2019s still good law in the district where CNN filed its suit, to which the White House is supposed to respond by 11 a.m. Wednesday, according to an order from Timothy Kelly, a former attorney for the Senate Judiciary Committee who was named by Trump to the federal bench last year.\n\nIn the 1977 case, the court found that denial of White House credentials was a sufficiently grave infringement on the freedom of the press that it couldn\u2019t just be done by fiat. It required, at the very least, \u201cnotice of the factual bases for denial, an opportunity for the applicant to respond\u201d and \u201ca final written statement of the reasons for denial.\u201d Notably, the court prohibited \u201ccontent-based criteria for press pass issuance.\u201d\n\nThe critical finding, according to Mark H. Lynch of Covington & Burling, who argued the case before the D.C. Circuit, was this: Given the \u201cimportant First Amendment rights implicated by refusal to grant White House press passes to bona fide Washington journalists,\u201d as the court held, \u201csuch refusal must be based on a compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances of the Acosta denial, the government is not going to be able to meet that standard,\u201d Lynch predicted in an email exchange with The Washington Post.\n\nLynch, then an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, represented the late Robert Sherrill, an ink-stained contrarian who bore little resemblance to the CNN White House correspondent \u2014 except on the important point that he was an irritant to the White House.\n\nAcosta has worn that identity proudly. \u201cIf I may ask one other question,\u201d he said at Trump\u2019s post-midterms news conference last week, as the president sought to move on, telling him, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nThe exchange prompted the administration to yank the reporter\u2019s credentials, falsely accusing him of \u201cplacing his hands\u201d on a White House intern who had tried to seize his microphone.\n\nAcosta, who has been accused of showboating, didn\u2019t yield. On-screen and on social media, his tactics are tailor-made for the modern media environment.\n\nAnd his employer has his back. \u201cPlaintiffs bring this action to enforce this constitutional commitment, restore Acosta\u2019s well-deserved press credentials, and ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people,\u201d the network explained in its complaint.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the lies coming from the WH. Believe in our freedoms. Thank you all for your support. We won\u2019t back down. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #1A \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nSherrill\u2019s persona was different, yet there are parallels. Once called an \u201cinexhaustible loner of Washington journalism,\u201d he cut the capital\u2019s larger-than-life figures down to size in books that earned him the ire of his subjects, including Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert H. Humphrey. A muckraker, he exposed American greed and folly in investigations into military judicial abuses and the oil and gun industries.\n\nA self-described \u201cindependent radical journalist,\u201d he used caustic wit to document unseen suffering. \u201cSince the Depression,\u201d he wrote in the New York Times in 1967, \u201cpoor people have been much more discreet about their starving.\u201d But his work also met criticism. One review called his account of the late Democrat senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident a \u201cslander book.\u201d\n\nSherrill had little patience for the decorum of the political press corps. As a reporter for the Miami Herald in 1964, he punched a press aide to C. Farris Bryant, the Democratic governor of Florida, while aboard a campaign train for Johnson, the Democratic presidential incumbent. \u201cI may have messed up a guy\u2019s jaw, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Sherrill would later tell the Atlantic Weekly.\n\nThe truculent journalist moved to the nation\u2019s capital in 1965 and soon became White House correspondent for the Nation, his tenure distinguished by the fact that he lacked access to the White House. His application for a press pass was denied in 1966.\n\nThe Secret Service, after an investigation, determined that he was not eligible, and addressed a memorandum to Bill Moyers, Johnson\u2019s press secretary at the time, asking that the information on which the agency\u2019s conclusion was based \u201cnot be disclosed to Mr. Sherrill or his employer,\u201d as later recounted in the D.C. Circuit opinion.\n\nAs the ACLU took up his case, the White House confirmed that the reporter had been denied accreditation \u201cfor reasons of security.\u201d A Treasury official informed the reporter that his arrest for physical assault in Florida was at issue.\n\nThe ACLU filed a complaint on the reporter\u2019s behalf in district court, alleging breach of the First and Fifth amendments, which guarantee freedom of the press and due process of law. Rather than deciding on the legality of the denial itself, the court instructed the Secret Service to \u201cdevise and publicize narrow and specific standards\u201d for refusing access.\n\nA three-judge panel of the appeals court \u2014 Carl E. McGowan, Harold Leventhal and Roger Robb \u2014 affirmed that judgment, with McGowan writing for the panel. While acknowledging that \u201ca citizen\u2019s right to obtain information\u201d is limited, the appeals court reasoned that the \u201cFirst Amendment interest\u201d was significant enough to set clear \u201crequirements of notice\u201d when shutting out a journalist.\n\nFundamentally, the court found that the First Amendment protected press access to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhite House press facilities having been made publicly available as a source of information for newsmen, the protection afforded newsgathering under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons,\u201d the appeals court reasoned.\n\nThe physical safety of the president might very well be a legitimate reason, the court argued, but it had to be made publicly known and subject to rebuttal. The court further judged that \u201carbitrary or content-based criteria for press pass issuance are prohibited under the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nLuke M. Milligan, a professor at the University of Louisville School of Law and author of a law review article on press rights, told The Post in an email that it will be difficult for CNN to prove that the content of Acosta\u2019s reporting was cause for the denial, while the White House \u201cwill point to the journalist\u2019s disruptive conduct \u2014 not yielding to other reporters, refusing to hand over the microphone and lecturing the president rather than asking a question.\u201d\n\nBut Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law in Houston said a court doesn\u2019t need to decide that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s hatred of CNN renders the denial unconstitutional.\u201d The network gave a court the opportunity to avoid ruling on a thorny constitutional question by pairing its First Amendment argument with a claim that the denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\u201cIf a court is inclined to think the administration violated the First Amendment, the judge is also likely to think the denial is \u2018arbitrary and capricious,\u2019 \u201d Blackman said. \u201cTherefore, the remedy would be to restore the press pass.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s case has implications beyond his high-profile feud with the president. As the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press observed in a brief, \u201cAll members of the news media feel the threat to First Amendment freedoms posed by the government\u2019s retaliatory revocation of Acosta\u2019s security credentials \u2014 a threat made all the more real by President Trump\u2019s promise that there \u2018could be others\u2019 who also lose their White House security credentials.\u201d\n\nBut if Sherrill\u2019s case suggests that the government\u2019s approach is on infirm footing, the reporter\u2019s approach offers lessons, too.\n\nThough he won his case against the Secret Service, he didn\u2019t go running for credentials.\n\n\u201cThe fun thing about this was that when I was finally going to get a press pass, I never applied,\u201d Sherrill told the Los Angeles Times in 1990. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be in the White House. I had been in Washington long enough to realize that was the last place to waste your time sitting around for some dumb . . . to give a press conference.\"\n\nSherrill died in 2014 at the age of 89."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jacqueline Alemany", "title": "Power Up: McCarthy caught between #MAGA and GOP", "description": "\"My Kevin\" is expected to win the contest for majority leader today.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/powerup/2018/11/14/powerup-mccarthy-caught-between-maga-and-gop/5beb3ac81b326b39290547da/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/0e3aef12a6f8ca11daecce415c2fbe8c-1920-1080-70-8-t_1529590075473_name_Trump_11484_jpg_bd59e.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:52:56Z", "content": "Good morning &amp; welcome back!

The Post's Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker have new details about the president's \"foul mood\" since he jetted off to Paris last Friday.\n\nTrump berated British Prime Minister Theresa May for \u201cnot doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran\" and complained about trade deals and Brexit after she called to congratulate him on GOP wins post the midterms. Trump \u201cerupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I.\u201d \u201cThe president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack.\u201d Trump \u201ctold advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save Nielsen\u2019s job.\u201d \u201cOn his flight there and throughout the weekend, Trump was preoccupied by political developments back in the United States . . . He also complained about the lack of congressional funding for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\u201d\n\nLikely House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R) (R-Calif.) and outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan (R) (R-Wis.). (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nTRUMP'S MVP: House Republicans are expected to pick Kevin McCarthy as their minority leader when the party meets today for leadership elections. House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is challenging McCarthy, but isn't expected to best the California lawmaker despite GOP grousing about losing the House majority in the midterms.\n\nWill McCarthy's close bond with Trump and his fluency in #MAGA-speak be his greatest asset or at odds with his new responsibilities to lead Republicans back from the wilderness in 2020 alongside a president whose divisive status, some say, is partly to blame for last week's bruising defeat? We talked to some people about it:\n\nUnderstanding Trump and McCarthy's affinity for one another: It's no surprise to those who know the two men that Trump and \u201cmy Kevin,\u201d as the president calls him \u2014 both described as \u201cbackslapping\u201d and \u201caffable\u201d by allies \u2014 get along. But their relationship dates back to the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d episode in 2016.\n\nPer a source close to the White House: \u201cOn a weekend when almost every member of the GOP establishment and every member of Republican leadership chastised and attacked Trump \u2014 McCarthy was the lone member of leadership publicly defending Trump . . . and that\u2019s something that stuck with both the president and the people around him. When he was in his darkest hour, McCarthy didn't tuck tail and run away from him \u2014 he stood up and fought with him. He took the exact opposite approach that Paul Ryan and the rest of the establishment took and that cemented their relationship.\u201d\n\nHow McCarthy has shaped the House in Trump's GOP: Hill GOP sources and those close to the White House point to McCarthy's success in unifying the House GOP's ideological factions as majority leader. But some also contend, correctly, that as majority leader, McCarthy helped lead the GOP into defeat along with outgoing House Speaker Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nSources point to McCarthy's support for an ideologically diverse leadership slate as a strength. For example, the two Republicans running for the no. 5 leadership spot \u2014 chair of the GOP policy committee \u2014 are from the Freedom Caucus. McCarthy's \u201csupported leadership that is more ideologically in line with GOP voters than probably at any time in the last decade,\u201d a source close to the White House said.\n\nFor example, the two Republicans running for the no. 5 leadership spot \u2014 chair of the GOP policy committee \u2014 are from the Freedom Caucus. McCarthy has also mirrored Trump on immigration: He introduced right before the elections the \u201cBuild the Wall, Enforce the Law Act,\u201d which full funds Trump's $23.4 billion dollar wall along the Southern border. The bill also cuts off funds for sanctuary cities.\n\nHe introduced right before the elections the \u201cBuild the Wall, Enforce the Law Act,\u201d which full funds Trump's $23.4 billion dollar wall along the Southern border. The bill also cuts off funds for sanctuary cities. But: McCarthy also comes from California, one of the most problematic states for a GOP lurching rightward. Republicans stand to lose several Republican incumbents in the Golden State with the Associated Press calling the race against Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) last night, and Rep. Mimi Walters (R) and GOP candidate Young Kim in trouble there too.\n\nHow McCarthy can be most effective: Marc Short, Trump's former director of legislative affairs, said that McCarthy's greatest asset will be providing Trump advice on how policy positions will play out politically and how the president's rhetoric or actions will impact individual House members.\n\nPolitics: \u201cI recall when we had our retreat back in January . . . Kevin laid out the political map and the way he saw things going \u2014 he has the uncanny ability to retain information on almost every House district that Republicans occupy or that are swing districts,\u201d Short added.\n\n\u201cI recall when we had our retreat back in January . . . Kevin laid out the political map and the way he saw things going \u2014 he has the uncanny ability to retain information on almost every House district that Republicans occupy or that are swing districts,\u201d Short added. Policy: Trump freed federal funds for the California wildfires after berating the state for \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d following a phone call from McCarthy, who explained the devastation, on Monday night, the New York Times's Julie Davis reports.\n\nGOPers say the House GOP defeat won't hurt McCarthy: \u201cKevin is overwhelmingly going to get these votes because he has earned the trust of these members \u2014 they understand he's got their backs. He's also an asset in terms of his ability to attract money and resources and recruitment,\u201d Eric Cantor, former House majority leader, told Power Up.\n\nSupporting Evidence: Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) sang McCarthy's praises yesterday. \u201cI feel [McCarthy] invested a lot of time and interest in our area. He personally flew down to the Everglades with me, and looked at all the Okeechobee watershed restoration projects, stayed at our house. I've seen him work effectively to help us get major appropriations needed to restore the Everglades. I feel very close to [McCarthy] and think he would be a great minority leader.\"\n\nYet will he sufficiently push back on Trump when Republicans need to?: Hill sources described Ryan as a figure who could at times be diametrically opposed to some of Trump speaker.\n\nCantor: \u201cHe'll be most effective to offer advice on where there's opportunities to put some points on the board and offer wins . . . he knows how to navigate the institution, has been there a long time and knows what's possible and how to deliver,\u201d Cantor said.\n\n\u201cHe'll be most effective to offer advice on where there's opportunities to put some points on the board and offer wins . . . he knows how to navigate the institution, has been there a long time and knows what's possible and how to deliver,\u201d Cantor said. Short: His advice is \"discreet but also trusted. I don\u2019t think there's a sense that when Kevin speaks to the president that he is trying to whip him or trying to articulate something with a particular agenda.\u201d\n\nAfter pushing off questions about House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi until after the election, many non-incumbent Democrats are still dodging questions about her.

In the 1930s, a band of progressive lawmakers thought they had killed it, but it has lived on, weathering biennial torrents of criticism and even a constitutional amendment designed to end the practice. This week, as the 2018 version session kicks off, Power Up talked to Jeffery A. Jenkins, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California, about the curious history behind defeated lawmakers returning to Capitol Hill for one last hurrah.\n\nNearly as old as our government : The term \u201clame duck,\u201d once considered quite the insult, comes from 18th century Britain, when it was used to describe \u201cbankrupt businessmen, who were considered 'lame,' like a game bird injured by shot,\u201d wrote Jane Hudiburg of the congressional Research Service.

(Jasic Workers Support Group via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Students and alumni of several Chinese universities are sounding the alarm over the apparent detention of more than a dozen young labor activists who have been missing since the weekend.\n\nThree recent graduates of the elite Peking University have been taken away by authorities, the Jasic Workers Support Group said in a statement late Tuesday. According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \u201ckidnapped\u201d from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \u201cdisappeared\u201d by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square which were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists, however, are an unusual target because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers\u2019 rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 which the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred at around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school\u2019s security department said the \u201csituation\u201d on Friday was that of a \u201cpolice department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\u201d\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group\u2019s website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \u201cIf you keep yelling, we\u2019ll keep hitting you!\u201d Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \u201cillegal, gang-like violence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cPeking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\u201d\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University\u2019s pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns. Several had their phones confiscated for the remainder of the summer and continued to be hounded by police back home, according to a student who took part in the action.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The high school senior had started the night at a school football game and ended it nearly bleeding to death in the emergency room. The errant gunshot, fired into the crowd amid a fight between other teenagers, ruptured Sakran\u2019s trachea, severed his carotid artery and paralyzed his vocal chord.\n\nBut Sakran was one of the lucky ones. The trauma surgeons at Inova Fairfax Hospital saved his life \u2014 and his voice.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s louder than ever.\n\nTwo decades later, Sakran is now a trauma surgeon himself at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and an unofficial leader within the medical community\u2019s fight against gun violence, a movement that accelerated last week after the National Rifle Association told doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d rather than \u201copine on firearm policy.\u201d\n\nDozens of doctors responded with both graphic and intimate stories of gun violence in their operating rooms, each with the Twitter hashtag #ThisIsOurLane, as The Washington Post\u2019s Frances Stead Sellers previously reported. For Sakran it couldn\u2019t ring truer. He launched the page ThisIsOurLane on Twitter Saturday, turning it into a window into doctors' everyday experiences extracting bullets from bodies. In just a few days it racked up more than 10,000 followers.\n\n\u201cHaving been shot in the throat, this has been an issue that has been near and dear to my heart for so many years,\u201d Sakran told The Post. \u201cBut once the NRA came out with that statement and really tried to undermine us and our role in gun violence and ending this public health crisis, that elevated the conversation to a different level. Thanks to the NRA, they actually united the medical community.\u201d\n\nAs a Trauma Surgeon and survivor of #GunViolence I cannot believe the audacity of the @NRA to make such a divisive statement.\n\n\n\nWe take care of these patients everyday. Where are you when I\u2019m having to tell all those families their loved one has died. @DocsDemand #Docs4GunSense https://t.co/XrY1G3hIi2 \u2014 Joseph Sakran (@JosephSakran) November 7, 2018\n\nSakran knew he wanted to become a trauma surgeon almost as soon as he recovered from his own surgery. While doctors were still tearing scar tissue out of his windpipe, he successfully applied for college at George Mason University. He got his start in the business of saving lives while training as a medic and firefighter in Fairfax before he went on to graduate from Ben-Gurion University Medical School for International Health. As it happens, he completed his surgery residency at Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he had been treated.\n\nHe trained alongside the same surgeons who saved his life as a teenager.\n\n\u201cIt was awe-inspiring to say the least,\u201d Sakran said. \u201cFor me the most gratifying opportunity was to give someone else the same second chance that those surgeons gave me.\u201d\n\nSakran\u2019s activism in gun violence prevention began early in his career, when he started giving talks to students in underserved communities about his own brush with gun violence. It became particularly visible this year, however, in wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., when Sakran founded \u201cDocs Demand Action.\u201d\n\nThe network of doctors has mobilized around urging lawmakers to more robustly fund gun violence research in the same way Congress has funded research into other public health crises, such as motor vehicle fatalities or deadly diseases. Congress has not substantially funded gun violence research since 1996, when it passed the Dickey Amendment. The measure didn\u2019t necessarily ban gun violence research, but restricted research supporting \u201cgun control,\u201d resulting in a chilling effect on funds for gun violence research more broadly.\n\nThe amendment, backed by the NRA, came in response to concerns from gun rights groups that doctors would try to push anti-gun agendas \u2014 just as the NRA accused doctors of doing last week.\n\n\u201cPeople want to polarize this debate. But no one wants to take away the guns. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Sakran said. \"There\u2019s not one solution to this. Part of it is developing the right data and the right research in order to understand what solutions we need to implement. We just don\u2019t want to continue seeing these senseless tragedies come into our trauma centers day in and day out.\u201d\n\nThe NRA lashed out at doctors last week after the American College of Physicians published a position paper that also called for greater research into the effectiveness of various gun restrictions and other risk factors for gun violence. It included support for universal background checks; counseling patients about safe, childproof storage of guns in the home; consideration of waiting periods before purchasing guns, to possibly reduce suicides; and, perhaps incensing the NRA the most, a ban on ownership of semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\u201cSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,\u201d the NRA wrote in a tweet linking to commentary shredding the ACP\u2019s paper. \u201cHalf of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control.\u201d\n\nSomeone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves. https://t.co/oCR3uiLtS7 \u2014 NRA (@NRA) November 7, 2018\n\nThe #ThisIsOurLane responses from doctors invited the NRA into the hospitals, sharing photographs of blood on the floor, of blood on their scrubs, of the waiting room where surgeons must tell family members their loved one has died. The movement erupted the same night of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and in the days that followed.\n\nBut Sakran said part of the frustration for doctors is that the thousands of gunshot wound victims surgeons treat in their hospitals every year will never get the same attention.\n\nThe ones who die in his operating room become \u201cchilled into my memory,\u201d he said. Often he is the one who tells the families in the waiting room, and sometimes his scrubs are bloody so he has to change them first. The families are sometimes inconsolable but other times, Sakran said, they want to tell him about the person they lost.\n\nMany of them are young, he said, reminding him of himself that night in 1994.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about what my own family must have felt when the surgeon walked out to talk to them,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Lion cub rescued from Lamborghini on Paris boulevard", "description": "A French animal protection agency says it has taken charge of a baby cub, named Putin, nicknamed Dado and less than two months old, that police officers found in a hired Lamborghini on Paris' famed Champs-Elysees boulevard", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/lion-cub-rescued-from-lamborghini-on-paris-boulevard/2018/11/14/c549480a-e7f4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:05:11Z", "content": "PARIS A French animal protection agency says it is caring for a lion cub that was found by police in a Lamborghini on Paris famed Champs-Elysees boulevard.

Paris police officers found a lion cub in a Lamborghini during a traffic stop on the city\u2019s famed Champs-Elysees. The cub, named Putin but known as Dadou, is less than two months old, according to the French animal protection agency now caring for it. (Fondation 30 Millions d\u2019Amis via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 When Paris police officers found a lion cub in a Lamborghini during a traffic stop this week, they exposed the tip of what animal campaigners say is a bizarre and disturbing new trend: People buying or renting cubs to take bling-bling selfie photos of themselves with a baby big cat.\n\nThe male cub , named Putin but known as Dadou, is less than two months old and likely would have died of poor care had police not stopped the luxury sports car Monday on the Champs-Elysees and rescued the cat, according to 30 Million Friends, the French animal protection NGO now caring for it.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of babies going around like this illegally,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Reha Hutin, said in an Associated Press interview Wednesday. \u201cYou can buy a cub for less than a dog. It costs 300 euros (340 dollars) and so they buy them off circuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get these babies and they take selfies with them on social media.\u201d\n\nHutin believes the fad spread to France from Gulf countries.\n\nWealthy people in the Gulf pose with baby cubs and \u201ctake photographs of themselves in the car,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they grow up they\u2019re just thrown out.\u201d\n\nThe NGO works with a sanctuary in Jordan that already houses 30-40 abandoned wild cats.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s terrible (is) it\u2019s coming to France. We\u2019ve literally saved four babies in the last six months because they are copying those guys,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cLike, \u2018Look at me, look how special I am.\u2019 That\u2019s become a real fashion.\u201d\n\nNot just in France. Another lion cub is adjusting to life in a Dutch big cat center after a jogger ran into it last month in a cage dumped in a field in the central Netherlands.\n\nThe NGO is suing the driver of the sports car, who was taken into custody after police found the cub. Paris police confirmed the find and the arrest. Sports cars are often offered for hire on the Champs-Elysees, for tourists to take short, high-adrenaline rides on the famous avenue and surrounding streets.\n\n\u201cThis was a Lamborghini, a fabulous green Lamborghini and the police noticed that the guy inside had this cub,\u201d she said. \u201cThey stopped him, they took the car, they took the cub and of course we went to get the cub.\u201d\n\nIn a separate case brought by 30 Million Friends, a French court handed a 6-month jail term to another person found with a lion cub, Hutin said.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy to get that. Maybe it will dissuade the others,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Lamborghini cub is the third recovered by 30 Million Friends in a month and the sixth wild cat in under a year. One, a small lioness, was found by the customs brigade in a cage in a garage in the southern French port city of Marseille .\n\nThe NGO is calling for beefed-up government measures against the trafficking of wild animals and their use in French circuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the circuses that are breeding them, to have all these new cubs,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these babies, these cubs, are found on (the) Internet ... It\u2019s really become a huge problem.\u201d\n\nThe Lamborghini cub is basically fine, although a health check by a vet found that it was in a weakened state, has a problem with one of its back paws and a broken tail, 30 Million Friends said.\n\nThe cub is now in quarantine in a big cat wildlife park east of Paris and will later join the two cubs recovered by 30 Million Friends in October. The three will probably then be sent to a large park in South Africa, joining three other lions rescued previously in France.\n\n\u201cWe have this plan to regroup them and really have a family,\u201d Hutin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll sort of have this little group of six babies, Parisian babies.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Highs: Mid-30s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nAfter a partly sunny and chilly day today, our wet pattern persists with more precipitation arriving late tonight. But with cold air in place, now we\u2019re talking a wintry mix rather than just rain, with some accumulation possible. Things quiet down as we get into Friday and the weekend, with periods of sun and seasonably cool temperatures.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Wednesday): Cold high pressure in control provides partly sunny skies and chilly temperatures, climbing from the low 30s this morning into the low-to-mid 40s this afternoon. Winds from the north aren\u2019t too bad, around 10 mph, but enough to add a bit of an extra chill. Confidence: High\n\nTonight: Clouds increase this evening and skies turn mostly cloudy overnight, with temperatures dropping to near or a little below freezing, as our first wintry weather-maker of the season approaches from the southwest. A wintry mix of sleet, snow, and freezing rain arrives between approximately 3 and 6 a.m. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): A wintry mix of sleet, snow, and freezing rain arrives approximately 3 to 6 a.m. Treated roads and sidewalks should be manageable. But with morning temperatures near 30 to the low 30s, a slippery coating is possible, especially on untreated surfaces. The wintry mix should eventually change to rain from southeast to northwest, but the timing of that transition is uncertain, which means you should plan on at least the chance of wintry precipitation into the midday hours. For our first call we\u2019re thinking around a coating to an inch of wintry mix inside the Beltway and to the south and east, especially on grassy areas, and up to an inch or two north and west of the Beltway. Temperatures should climb a degree or two above freezing during the afternoon, reducing road impacts as scattered rain showers linger into the evening. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Scattered rain showers remain possible during the evening, with the chance of a brief wintry mix again overnight. But no accumulation is expected with temperatures in the mid-30s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nAfter a possible lingering rain or snow shower early Friday morning, we should turn partly sunny and breezy for the bulk of the day. Highs reach the mid-40s to near 50 with winds from the west-northwest gusting 20-30 mph. Skies trend mostly clear Friday night as winds diminish and lows drop back into the 30s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nHigh pressure regains control for much of the weekend, setting up a mostly sunny Sunday and partly sunny Saturday, with highs both days in the upper 40s to low 50s and light winds. Saturday night lows settle in the 30s again. Confidence: Medium\n\nSNOW POTENTIAL INDEX\n\nA daily assessment of the potential for at least 1 inch of snow in the next week, on a 0-10 scale.\n\n3/10 (\u2191): Seriously, yeah, we have a shot at that first inch somewhere in the area on Thursday, although accumulation may come more from sleet (and possibly freezing rain) than snow."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Rob Harris | AP", "title": "Fulham hires Claudio Ranieri after firing Jokanovic", "description": "Claudio Ranieri is back in the Premier League with Fulham, two years after overcoming 5,000-1 odds to win the title with Leicester", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/fulham-hires-claudio-ranieri-after-firing-jokanovic/2018/11/14/1458a784-e7f4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:00:14Z", "content": "LONDON Claudio Ranieri is back in the Premier League with Fulham, two years after overcoming 5,000-1 odds to win the title with Leicester.

(Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images) (Gregg Deguire/Getty Images)\n\nIf Monica Lewinsky were ever to come face to face with Hillary Clinton, she knows exactly what she would do: apologize.\n\n\u201cI know that I would summon up whatever force I needed to again acknowledge to her \u2014 sincerely \u2014 how very sorry I am,\u201d Lewinsky wrote in an essay published by Vanity Fair on Tuesday.\n\nApologizing to Clinton again \u2014 the first time was in a 1999 interview with Barbara Walters \u2014 was one of several topics Lewinsky addressed in an essay that went beyond explaining her decision to participate in a new A&E documentary series, \u201cThe Clinton Affair,\u201d which delves into the events leading up to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Lewinsky, 45, also discussed the power dynamics that protected Clinton and led to her public excoriation as well as whether she believes he owes her a personal apology.\n\nThe series, Lewinsky wrote, is titled \u201cThe Clinton Affair\u201d for a reason.\n\n\u201cBye-bye, Lewinsky scandal. . . . I think 20 years is enough time to carry that mantle,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe first episode will air Sunday.\n\nLewinsky, then a 22-year-old White House intern, became the center of global attention for her affair with Clinton that nearly ended his presidency. He lied about it before a grand jury led by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, an act that led to impeachment proceedings. Widely vilified and slapped by Clinton and his supporters with the unforgiving moniker of \u201cThat Woman,\u201d just one of many unflattering epithets, Lewinsky took herself out of the public eye, reemerging only just a few years ago.\n\nBecause of the taunting Lewinsky endured, she has since taken on the cause of anti-bullying. In the past, she has been reluctant to publicly address questions about the scandal, but now she is opening up about the infamous relationship in what may be her most expansive interview.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, women have been traduced and silenced,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, it\u2019s our time to tell our own stories in our own words.\u201d\n\nLewinsky continued: \u201cYes, the process of filming has been exceedingly painful. But I hope that by participating, by telling the truth about a time in my life \u2014 a time in our history \u2014 I can help ensure that what happened to me never happens to another young person in our country again.\u201d\n\n[Read the full essay here]\n\nLewinsky wrote that she was interviewed for the documentary for more than 20 hours, a process that required her to recall memories she wishes she could erase.\n\n\u201cFilming the documentary forced me to acknowledge to myself past behavior that I still regret and feel ashamed of,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere were many, many moments when I questioned not just the decision to participate but my sanity itself.\u201d\n\nIn one teaser clip released Tuesday, Lewinsky said she still feels \u201cuncomfortable\u201d talking about the affair, which didn\u2019t stop her from doing so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if it didn\u2019t register with me that he was the president,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously it did. But I think in one way, the moment we were actually in the back office for the first time, the truth is that I think it meant more to me that someone who other people desired, desired me. However wrong it was, however misguided, for who I was in that very moment at 22 years old, that was how it felt.\u201d\n\nIn the series, Lewinsky recounted the crush she began developing on Clinton and how \u201cflirtatious encounters\u201d soon escalated, Fox News Channel reported.\n\nAt a birthday party for a staff member in November 1995, Lewinsky said, she realized that the top of her underwear had been showing, according to People.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll up the game,' \" she said. \u201cI knew [Clinton] was walking out of a room, and instead of putting my trousers up, like I would have done in any other instance, I didn\u2019t. It was unnoticeable to everybody else in the room, but he noticed.\u201d\n\nThen, Lewinsky said she remembered Clinton talking to her and asking her questions, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think at that point in my life my heart had ever beat as fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI blurted out, \u2018You know, I have a crush on you,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd he laughed and smiled and then asked me if I wanted to go to the back office. And I did.\u201d\n\nThe office, Lewinsky recalled, was dark and Clinton \u201ceventually asked\u201d to kiss her. She said yes.\n\nLater that evening, Lewinsky said she was the only person in the office when Clinton came in and told her if she wanted to meet him in the \u201cback study,\u201d she could. Lewinsky did, \u201cand it became more intimate from there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rest of the story was described in what has been called a lurid report to the House that led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment on two articles: lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice. After a trial, the Senate acquitted him on Feb. 12, 1999.\n\nIn the aftermath of the affair, facing questions from the FBI and unable to escape public scrutiny, Lewinsky contemplated suicide.\n\n\u201cThere was a point for me somewhere in this sort of first several hours [of being interviewed by the FBI] where I would be hysterically crying and then I would just shut down,\u201d Lewinsky said in another clip released Tuesday. \u201cI remember looking out the window and thinking that the only way to fix this was to kill myself, was to jump out the window.\u201d\n\nCrying again as she spoke in the documentary, she added that she felt \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was scared, and I was just mortified and afraid of what this was going to do to my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I was still in love with Bill at the time, so I felt really responsible.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the series led Lewinsky to \u201cnew rooms of shame\u201d and delivered her to \u201cGrief\u2019s doorstep,\u201d she wrote in the Vanity Fair essay.\n\nBut, despite the challenges that came with reliving the \u201cmost painful and traumatic\u201d parts of her life, Lewinsky wrote that she knew this would be a chance for her to offer her perspective on a narrative that men have largely controlled for years. She noted that the new series is helmed by Emmy Award-winning director Blair Foster and four out of five of its executive producers are women.\n\n\u201cI may not like everything that has been put in the series or left out, but I like that the perspective is being shaped by women,\u201d she wrote.\n\nLewinsky also criticized the power disparity that contributed to her public humiliation, suggesting that Clinton emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed.\n\nTake, for example, Clinton\u2019s famed Oval Office address in which he declared, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, akin to a \u201csports coach signposting the playbook for the big game,\u201d Clinton \u201cthrew down the gauntlet,\u201d Lewinsky wrote.\n\n\u201cWith that, the demonization of Monica Lewinsky began,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs it so often does, power throws a protective cape around the shoulders of the man, and he dictates the spin by denigrating the less powerful woman.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s position of power continued to benefit him, Lewinsky said, pointing out how the former president was rarely asked in interviews to directly address the scandal.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what power looks like, watch a man safely, even smugly, do interviews for decades, without ever worrying whether he will be asked the questions he doesn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut now, in the #MeToo era, things appear to be changing. Clinton faced widespread backlash earlier this year when he said in a June interview with NBC News \u201cToday\u201d correspondent Craig Melvin that he did not think he owed Lewinsky an apology. Clinton said he had already given multiple public apologies and would not handle the accusations any differently today.\n\nIn the essay, Lewinsky wrote that she, too, had publicly apologized at the time \u2014 directly to Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton. The apology, made during the 1999 interview, contained her \u201cfirst public words after the scandal.\u201d\n\nBeyond whether she thinks she is \u201cowed or deserving\u201d of a personal apology from Bill Clinton, Lewinsky wrote that she thinks he \u201cshould want to apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe would be a better man for it . . . and we, in turn, a better society.\"\n\nOn social media, Lewinsky\u2019s essay and news of the forthcoming documentary series were met with mixed reactions.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful reflection on victimhood, apologies and the innate power of women narrating their own stories,\u201d HuffPost reporter Emma Gray tweeted about the essay.\n\nNew York Magazine writer Rebecca Traister called it \u201ca smart and compassionate piece.\u201d\n\nWow wow wow this @MonicaLewinsky essay.

It was the first time that a candidate for prime minister has ever been rejected by the 349-seat Riksdagen.\n\nNorlen said he would continue talks with party leaders on Thursday, without giving details.\n\nThe September election produced a hung parliament with the left-leaning side and the center-right bloc securing about 40 percent of the vote each, leaving neither with a majority and paving the way for months of uncertainty and complex coalition talks.\n\nBoth blocs have refused to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats, who made great strides in the election.\n\nAnnie Loof, the leader of the Center Party that voted against Kristersson, said he had broken up the 14-year-old center-right alliance by suggesting a two-party government, leaving out her party and the Liberals.\n\nKristersson said that that although the alliance has suffered \u201cits worst crisis,\u201d it is not dead.\n\n\u201cWe have a common platform, but we cannot agree when it comes to taking power.\u201d\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who heads Sweden\u2019s largest party \u2014 the Social Democrats \u2014 said he was willing to discuss with Loof should she be tapped to try to form a coalition.\n\nLoof earlier said that she doesn\u2019t want to be prime minister herself but is willing to try form a government.\n\nPundits say either Loof or Lofven would be next in line to try to form a government.\n\nThe emergence of Sweden Democrats \u2014 with roots in a neo-Nazi movement \u2014 reflects how deeply that Sweden is being transformed by migration.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden took in a record 163,000 migrants \u2014 the highest per capita of any European country. Since then, the country has sharply restricted immigration, but many Swedes complain that society cannot cope with integrating so many newcomers, many of them Muslims from Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, said he sees \u201ca new political landscape mushroom in Sweden, exactly like in the rest of the western world.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJan M.

Pence also said Myanmar\u2019s arrest and conviction of two Reuters journalists was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d to millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cI look forward to speaking with you about the premium that we place on a free and independent press,\u201d said Pence, who is representing an administration with an unusually adversarial relationship with the news media.\n\nPence and Suu Kyi met during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore. Pence is attending that and the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea later this week in President Donald Trump\u2019s stead.\n\nA day earlier Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed made an unusually harsh public criticism of Suu Kyi, saying that as a former political prisoner she should better understand suffering. He said the treatment of the Rohingya was \u201cindefensible.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Mahathir toned down his comments, saying that ASEAN leaders try to avoid criticizing each other. He said the issue of Rohingya had come up during a working dinner among the leaders but the main sentiment was a desire to resolve the problem.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar\u2019s earlier military dictatorship.\n\nThough she has been the de facto head of Myanmar\u2019s civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, she is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written under the former military junta. The military is in charge of security operations, including those in Rakhine.\n\nStill, Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism for not speaking out in defense of the Rohingya. Amnesty International became the latest organization to strip her of an award this week, citing the \u201cshameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\u201d\n\nResponding to Pence, Suu Kyi said it was good to exchange views, but that \u201cwe understand our country better than any other country does.

May will try to persuade her divided Cabinet on Wednesday that they have a choice between backing a draft Brexit deal with the European Union or plunging the U.K. into political and economic uncertainty. (Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday urged her divided Cabinet to back a divorce deal with the European Union in the \u201cnational interest,\u201d as pro-Brexit lawmakers raged against a draft agreement they said would make the U.K. subservient to the bloc indefinitely.\n\nMay\u2019s Cabinet was debating whether to support the deal at a marathon meeting after negotiators from Britain and the European Union broke a months-long logjam and reached agreement on divorce terms.\n\nMinisters filed into 10 Downing St. at 2 p.m. (1400 GMT; 9 a.m. EST) as noisy rival protests \u2014 one by pro-EU demonstrators, the other by Brexit-backing group Leave Means Leave \u2014 chanted and shouted down the street.\n\nThree hours later, they were still inside, and May\u2019s office said the meeting was not due to end until early evening. The prime minister was due to make a statement outside once it finished.\n\nEarlier, May told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the draft deal \u201ctakes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum\u201d of 2016 that opted to leave the EU.\n\nMay said Britain would \u201ctake back control of our borders, our laws and our money ... while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nShe said the Cabinet \u201cwill decide on the next steps in the national interest.\u201d\n\nBut pro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 a group that includes some members of the Cabinet \u2014 say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy.\n\nEuroskeptic Conservative legislator Peter Bone warned May that she would \u201close the support of many Conservative (members of Parliament) and millions of voters across the country\u201d if she pressed ahead with the agreement.\n\nMay\u2019s supporters argue that the deal is the best on offer, and the alternatives are a chaotic \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit that would cause huge disruption to people and businesses, or an election that could see the Conservative government replaced by the left-of-center Labour Party.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary William Hague warned \u201cardent Brexiteers\u201d that if they shoot down May\u2019s deal, it could lead to a change of government and a new referendum and \u201cBrexit might never happen at all.\u201d\n\nFailure to secure Cabinet backing will leave May\u2019s leadership in doubt and the Brexit process in chaos, with exit day just over four months away on March 29.\n\nIf the Cabinet supports the deal, it still must be approved by leaders of the 28-nation EU. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said EU leaders had penciled in a Nov. 25 Brexit summit to discuss the deal \u2014 though he cautioned nothing was guaranteed and much could still go wrong.\n\nThen May will need to win backing from Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 no easy task, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nThe proposed solution involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary, but pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nPro-Brexit former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the agreement would make his favored option, a loose Canada-style trade deal with the bloc, impossible. He tweeted: \u201cCabinet must live up to its responsibilities & stop this deal.\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May\u2019s minority government, said it would oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\u201d DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\nMay also faced disquiet from Scottish Conservative lawmakers, worried about what the deal means for Scotland\u2019s important fishing industry.\n\nThe party\u2019s Scottish legislators \u2014 including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, a Cabinet minister \u2014 wrote to May saying Brexit must mean \u201cfull sovereignty over domestic waters\u201d and Britain must leave the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy after Brexit.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nSophie in \u2018t Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is deputy to the legislature\u2019s Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, said the real problem during the negotiations \u201clies within the U.K.\u201d because Britain doesn\u2019t know what relationship it wants with the EU.\n\n\u201cThat is the real problem, because if the U.K. had a single agreed line, backed by the majority of parties and the majority of MPs, then the whole situation would not be so unclear,\u201d she said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jesse Ray Hooker, 23, was charged with stealing, while his friend Aimee Cummins, also 23, with receiving stolen goods.\n\nOn Wednesday police charged a third person, a 31-year-old woman, also from Beverley, with possessing stolen property.\n\nHooker appeared in Perth Magistrates Court, also on Wednesday, where defense lawyer Chad Silver said that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with the newborn meerkat as it ran toward him in its enclosure and had scooped it up and put it in his cooler bag.\n\nHe had then played loud music on the drive home to Beverley so that Cummins, unaware of the heist at the time, couldn\u2019t hear the animal\u2019s distressed cries. After a stop at McDonald\u2019s, the pair took the meerkitten home, adding it to a menagerie of four dogs and a cat.\n\nSilver told the court Hooker was in the process of returning the meerkat when the police called. In the tiny town of Beverley, population 1,700, even a secret that small was apparently too hard to keep.\n\n\u201cThe simplicity of the offence meant the police were able to capture and follow up the meerkat very quickly,\u201d Silver told the court.\n\nIn front of a large media contingent, Hooker pleaded guilty and was fined 4,000 Australian dollars ($2,800). Cummins would have faced her verdict, but Silver said she could not attend the hearing, citing medical reasons and intense media pressure.\n\nShe\u2019ll appear in person in January. The 31-year-old woman will face court next month.\n\nAs for the meerkitten, despite fears from zoo staff his mob would reject him, he\u2019s been welcomed back into the fold and given a name from the East African language of Kiswahili: Salama, which means \u201csafe.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bartiromo tried to fact-check Cicilline in real time \u2014 \u201cthe tax cut plan lowered all income levels, and they double the standard deduction\u201d \u2014 and Cicilline insisted he was right.\n\n\u201cThat is inaccurate,\u201d Bartiromo declared. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a fact,\u201d Cicilline shot back.\n\nBartiromo is a conservative, and Cicilline is a Democrat. This is yet another example of how Democrats and Republicans talk past each other when they discuss the Trump tax cut, with Republicans looking at the front end while Democrats tend to focus only on the back end.\n\nWe\u2019ve shown how House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) touted \u201cCindy,\u201d the single mom who supposedly will get $700 every year from the tax bill and how House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) claimed 86 million people would see their taxes increase. Let\u2019s dissect Cicilline\u2019s talking point.\n\nThe Facts\n\nIn 2018, most U.S. taxpayers can expect some kind of tax cut, according to just about every analysis. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase.\n\nSince the wealthy pay most of the income taxes, they end up with most of the tax cuts. (The top 1 percent in 2014 earned 20 percent of adjusted gross income and paid nearly 40 percent of federal taxes, according to the Tax Foundation.) The TPC report shows that in 2018, the top 1 percent would get 20.5 percent of the tax cuts; the top quintile would get 65.3 percent. In other words, that\u2019s not nearly as lopsided as Cicilline asserted.\n\nSo, score one for Bartiromo?\n\nNot so fast! Richard Luchette, a Cicilline spokesman, pointed to the same TPC study to defend the use of the statistic.\n\nIn 2027, the study shows, 82.8 percent of the tax cuts will flow to the top 1 percent. The top quintile actually receives 107.3 percent of the tax changes \u2014 because taxes actually increase for the folks in the lowest, second-lowest and middle quintiles. It\u2019s right there on Page 5 of the report.\n\nWhat happened? The individual tax cuts expire over the course of the decade. Republicans structured the tax cut this way to keep the whole package \u2014 especially the corporate tax cut \u2014 in a budget box that allowed only for a $1.5 trillion increase in the federal deficit over 10 years.\n\nThe assumption \u2014 possibly a big one \u2014 is that Congress will vote to extend the tax cuts when they begin to expire, just as most of the George W. Bush tax cuts were extended, with the eventual support of Democrats who had long opposed the Bush-era cuts.\n\nBut the law is the law. It certainly is within Cicilline\u2019s right to focus on the 2027 tax tables that show that the tax cuts tilted dramatically toward the richest of the rich.\n\nBut in standing his ground in his Fox News interview, Cicilline failed to make clear that he was talking about 2027, the end of the 10-year window. In fact, he confusingly says that \u201cwe need a tax cut for middle-class families, not 83 percent of it going to the top 1 percent, richest people in this country,\u201d which suggests that there is no tax cut now for the middle class. There is one; the question is whether Congress will extend it or even improve it when it starts to lapse.\n\nOther Democrats have been more adept about adding phrases such as \u201cin the long run\u201d or \u201cby the end of the decade\u201d when citing the 2027 data. But Cicilline did not do that in this interview.\n\n\u201cUnder that law, tax cuts for the middle class are temporary,\u201d Luchette said. \u201cDavid supports a permanent middle-class tax cut and repealing the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations so we can invest in infrastructure. But the stat he cited referred to the law as Republicans and President Trump wrote and enacted it.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe have tended to give politicians on both sides of the aisle Two Pinocchios for telling only half of the story of the tax bill. Given past performance by Congress, we would be shocked if lawmakers simply let the tax bill run its course and allowed it to raise taxes on tens of millions of Americans. Moreover, it is important for Cicilline to signal to viewers that he is not talking about this tax year, when many can expect to pay less in federal income taxes. So he earns two Pinocchios.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "After cease-fire, Israel captures Gaza assailant on border", "description": "The Israeli military says it has shot at and captured a Palestinian who approached the Gaza perimeter fence and hurled grenades into Israel", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/after-cease-fire-israel-captures-gaza-assailant-on-border/2018/11/14/2d9b6db4-e7e3-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:59:15Z", "content": "JERUSALEM The Israeli military says it has shot at and captured a Palestinian who approached the Gaza perimeter fence and hurled grenades into Israel.

(Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s defense minister on Wednesday abruptly resigned to protest a new cease-fire with Hamas militants in Gaza, throwing the government into turmoil and pushing the country toward an early election.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman\u2019s decision was ostensibly a show of anger over Tuesday\u2019s informal truce with Israel\u2019s Hamas enemies. But in many ways, it was the opening round of a new political campaign.\n\nHis defection leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the narrowest of parliamentary majorities \u2014 only 61 of 120 seats in his coalition.\n\nIn theory, Netanyahu can continue to govern until parliamentary elections scheduled for a year from now. But with another coalition rival, Naftali Bennett, threatening to leave the coalition if he doesn\u2019t get the defense portfolio, the days of Netanyahu\u2019s government appear numbered.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the developments:\n\nNETANYAHU\u2019S CEASE-FIRE\n\nAfter two days of heavy fighting, Netanyahu\u2019s decision to accept the Egyptian-brokered truce was more than a case of cooler heads prevailing.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader knows well that the military option has its limits. Israel has maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza and fought three wars against Hamas since the Islamic militant group seized power in 2007. This has inflicted heavy damage on Gaza, but Hamas remains firmly in power.\n\nOusting the group would require a military operation that could take months and cost the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians and many Israeli soldiers. Reluctant to pay such a price, Netanyahu instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda. Leaving the Palestinians torn between two governments \u2014 Hamas in Gaza and the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 works in his favor.\n\nWith the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and cement Israeli control over the territory.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly accused Israel and the U.S. of collaborating behind his back and preparing a peace plan offering the Palestinians a mini-state in the Gaza Strip and small autonomous areas of the West Bank. That falls short of his demand for a fully independent Palestinian state that includes both territories in full.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t true that Netanyahu doesn\u2019t have a policy. He does: He is a firm believer in perpetuating the status quo,\u201d wrote Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea.\n\nBIBI\u2019S BOUNCER\n\nLieberman is a former aide to Netanyahu who has been both an ally and rival over the years. He currently heads Yisrael Beitenu, a small ultranationalist party that appeals to immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\n\nA brawny former nightclub bouncer known for his sharp tongue and Russian-accented Hebrew, the Soviet-born Lieberman has sought to project an image as a gruff, tough-talking politician. At times, he has been critical of Israel\u2019s Arab minority, liberal opposition groups and even Israel\u2019s Arab ally Egypt. Sitting in the opposition, he once threatened to assassinate Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh if he held the defense portfolio.\n\nBut as defense minister, Lieberman\u2019s accomplishments remain limited, and Haniyeh is alive and well in Gaza.\n\nCalling the cease-fire \u201csurrender to terrorism,\u201d Lieberman also made clear that his frustrations run much deeper. He said he also opposed a recent decision to allow Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza and the cancellation, under heavy international pressure, of the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are buying quiet in the short-term at the cost of severe damage to our security in the long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weakness we displayed also projects itself to other arenas.\u201d\n\nIS NETANYAHU THREATENED?\n\nIf Netanyahu calls early elections, opinion polls forecast a broad victory by his Likud Party and his hard-line partners, including Lieberman.\n\nWith his resignation, Lieberman appears to be positioning himself for elections by painting Netanyahu as soft and portraying himself as a defense hawk.\n\nBennett, another former Netanyahu aide who leads the religious Jewish Home Party, is likely to use a similar strategy. Like Lieberman, Bennett had favored tougher military action against Hamas.\n\nAll three appeal to a similar bloc of voters. Although Netanyahu would likely emerge as the leader, siphoning off votes would strengthen his rivals and give them increased leverage.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s rivals are eager to tap into public anger over the cease-fire. Residents in rocket-battered towns in southern Israel, typically Likud strongholds, have protested the truce.\n\nLieberman is especially desperate. His party holds only five Knesset seats, barely above the threshold required to enter the parliament.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, will probably market himself as the responsible adult in a room of inexperienced children.\n\n\u201cI see the big picture of Israeli security that I cannot share with the public,\u201d he said Wednesday as he defended the cease-fire. \u201cIn times like these, leadership is not doing the easy thing. Leadership is doing the right thing, even if it is hard. Leadership is sometime facing criticism.\u201d\n\nOne wild card: Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu in a series of corruption investigations. If Israel\u2019s attorney general decides to file charges, Netanyahu could be weakened or even forced to step down, shaking up any election campaign. However, if he is re-elected before a decision is made, it could make it much harder to press charges against a leader with a fresh mandate. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has not said when he will decide.\n\nHAPPY HAMAS\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas declared victory in the latest round of fighting, boasting that it stood up to the powerful Israeli military. Large crowds of supporters celebrated in the streets.\n\n\u201cThe resistance has sent a clear message to the occupation that it can hurt them,\u201d boasted Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman.\n\nAfter the dust settles, Hamas will once again have to cope with running a territory where unemployment is over 50 percent, the economy is in tatters and where people cannot travel abroad.\n\n\u201cWe have to bear in mind that Hamas\u2019 popularity has improved on similar occasions in the past,\u201d said Mkheimer Abusada, a Gaza analyst. \u201cBut that was for a short period of time, after which people would face the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty.\u201d\n\nHamas will return its focus toward U.N. and Egyptian mediation aimed at easing the crippling Israeli blockade in exchange for assurances of quiet.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The United Nations says the atrocities could be tantamount to genocide and have sent more than 700,000 refugees pouring into neighboring Bangladesh.\n\nSuu Kyi requested Wednesday\u2019s meeting with Pence on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summits in Singapore.\n\nShe has also been criticized by some in the 10-member ASEAN bloc, despite its long-standing policy of nonintervention in the affairs of other states in the group. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the organization\u2019s elder statesman, said in comments to reporters Tuesday that Suu Kyi was \u201ctrying to defend what is indefensible\u201d by failing to condemn the Myanmar military for its actions.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of killing them, mass killing,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\n[A year after the assault on the Rohingya, Myanmar\u2019s generals are unapologetic]\n\nA senior White House official said Pence also pressed Suu Kyi \u201cmultiple times\u201d on pardoning two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who have been sentenced to jail for violating the country\u2019s colonial-era secrets act \u2014 charges widely seen as politically motivated. The pair were reporting on the massacre of 10 Muslim Rohingya men, part of the broader crackdown that occurred in August 2017, when they were arrested in December.\n\nThe official declined to comment on Suu Kyi\u2019s response on the journalists or whether Pence was satisfied with it.\n\nIn his opening remarks before the bilateral meeting, Pence said he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to speaking with Suu Kyi about the \u201cpremium\u201d his country and administration places on a free and independent press.\n\n\u201cIn America, we believe in our democratic institutions and our ideals, including a free and independent press,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe arrest and jailing of two journalists last fall was deeply troubling to millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s defense of the media, however, contrasts with President Trump\u2019s disparaging attacks against some U.S. journalists and repeated smears calling news organizations the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nOthers have joined the United States in calling for Myanmar to address the Rohingya issue, including the underlying and long-standing conditions that have made the minority vulnerable to violence and sometimes prompt Rohingya to flee to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Thailand to escape the persecution. The Rohingya say they are native to Myanmar, but Myanmar considers them to be illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship rights.\n\nMyanmar has also insisted that the August 2017 crackdown was in response to Rohingya militant attacks and has denied charges of ethnic cleansing or genocide.\n\nSingapore, which chairs ASEAN this year, has pushed behind the scenes to get Suu Kyi and other Myanmar leaders to understand the severity of the crisis they are facing, say regional diplomats.\n\n\u201cIf Myanmar drifts back into pariah status through international and other sanctions, it could pull the whole of ASEAN down with it,\u201d said Kobsak Chutikul, a retired ambassador and former member of Thailand\u2019s parliament who was involved in an advisory board on the Rohingya crisis until he quit in July over concerns that it was ineffective. \u201cContinued ASEAN centrality and relevance is considered extremely important by all members. Myanmar\u2019s condition threatens this \u2014 at the least, it is bad PR.\u201d\n\nSuu Kyi has also lost a string of international accolades awarded to her when she was under house arrest for most of two decades for standing up to Myanmar\u2019s military junta and demanding democratic rule. Amnesty International withdrew its highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, from Suu Kyi on Sunday.\n\n\u201cToday, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights,\u201d Kumi Naidoo, the rights group\u2019s secretary general, wrote in a letter to Suu Kyi that the group made public. \u201cAmnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\u201d\n\nOf particular and immediate concern, rights groups say, is the imminent repatriation of thousands of Rohingya from Bangladesh to Myanmar. The United Nations says that conditions are unsuitable for the safe return of the Rohingya to their home country, and the International Crisis Group has warned that a rushed return could trigger violence.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s strategic location \u2014 on China\u2019s southwestern border \u2014 has made the country especially important to Washington. The senior White House official also said that Pence in Wednesday\u2019s meeting warned Suu Kyi against falling into the trap of debt diplomacy \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to China, whose Belt and Road Initiative is seen as a tool to extend political influence through infrastructure building while putting countries on the hook for billions of dollars in debt.\n\nChina has signed an agreement to build a massive economic corridor through Myanmar and is developing a $1.3 billion port close to the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe United States has stressed to its allies in China\u2019s backyard that Washington offers an alternative to investment from Beijing. Pence emphasized American commitment to the Asia-Pacific region in his bilateral meetings Wednesday, which included encounters with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.\n\nRead more:\n\nMyanmar judge sentences Reuters journalists to 7 years in jail\n\nEditorial: Myanmar is now erasing the Rohingya\u2019s very name\n\nU.S. sanctions Myanmar military commanders for their role in \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "A Yemeni boy gets lost in a land prowled by US drones", "description": "A Yemeni boy one morning heard that al-Qaida were giving away free motorcycles, so he ran off with a friend to get one, never thinking that a U.S. drone was overhead, hunting for militants", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/a-yemeni-boy-gets-lost-in-a-land-prowled-by-us-drones/2018/11/14/7337f00a-e7e2-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:54:02Z", "content": "ATAQ, Yemen Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains thats what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.

(Associated Press)\n\nATAQ, Yemen \u2014 Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains \u2014 that\u2019s what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.\n\nEarly that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \u201cLet me sleep,\u201d Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn\u2019t returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents\u2019 worry grew to panic.\n\n\u2014This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen\u2019s southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah\u2019s disappearance, a drone\u2019s missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n___\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn\u2019t want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n___\n\nAbdullah\u2019s parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah\u2019s brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\u201cIf you saw him, you\u2019d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\u201d Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn\u2019t let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \u201che became a normal baby,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah\u2019s father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen\u2019s biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn\u2019t reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\u201cYou just study, and I will take care of everything else,\u201d Saleh told him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn\u2019t finish school.\u201d\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh\u2019s eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week\u2019s leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they\u2019d seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He\u2019d seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh\u2019s brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city\u2019s edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn\u2019t want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\u201cThings happen at night,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn\u2019t told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn\u2019t have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters\u2019 camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \u201cI am with al-Qaida. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow. Don\u2019t come for me.\u201d\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n___\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah\u2019s father tried calling back to the militant\u2019s phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \u201cI won\u2019t be able to get him back.\u201d Once in al-Qaida\u2019s hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \u201call roads lead to death,\u201d said one of Saleh\u2019s nephews.\n\nDespite his wife\u2019s warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh\u2019s nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn\u2019t have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn\u2019t there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh\u2019s taxi.\n\n___\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father\u2019s taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah\u2019s father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking. I wept,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cI realized he had come looking for me.\u201d\n\n____\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak\u2019s brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\u201cHe is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\u201d he said of Mubarak. \u201cHe was doing something good and got killed.\u201d\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh\u2019s nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \u201cYour brothers and uncle are in God\u2019s embrace,\u201d a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah\u2019s odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh\u2019s legs were gone; Zayad\u2019s body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. We talked in the evening,\u201d Mohsanaa said. \u201cI told them not to go out at night.\u201d\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt was my all mistake,\u201d Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\u201cI was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh\u2019s family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah\u2019s family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019ll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family\u2019s grief. She doesn\u2019t speak of the killing in front of Abdullah.

But refugees scheduled to leave said they would refuse to go because of fears for their safety.\n\nSome said their families have fled from their shanties in the refugee camps to avoid being sent back. The situation remained tense in camps overnight.\n\nRefugees, Repatriation and Rehabilitation Commissioner Abul Kalam said earlier Wednesday that 30 refugee families would be handed over Thursday at the Ghumdhum border point near Cox\u2019s Bazar, where refugees have been living in crammed camps.\n\nBut by late Wednesday, confusion grew over whether it would start.\n\nKalam said late Wednesday that they discussed the situation with the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency, which gave a report after discussion with the refugees who are on the list. The U.N. does not want the government to send the refugees back under current circumstances.\n\nDetails of the repot were not shared, but Kalam said they wanted to be \u201chopeful\u201d in beginning the repatriation on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe hope we will be able to confirm tomorrow morning (Thursday) how many we are taking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two countries had originally agreed to begin repatriating Rohingya to Rakhine State last January, but that was called off amid concerns among aid workers and the Rohingya that their safety wasn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nKalam said about 2,260 refugees from 485 families would be sent back in an initial group. Myanmar officials said recently that they would receive 150 refugees each day.\n\nBut it was unclear whether the repatriation would begin smoothly amid reports that many of the refugees on the initial list have fled.\n\n\u201cI will not go. My wife and other family members have gone elsewhere, they do not want to go,\u201d 35-year-old Nurul Amin told The Associated Press outside the Jamtoli camp, where he and his family have been living for more than a year.\n\n\u201cI stayed back to guard my valuables,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you will shoot us if we do not agree to go back, we will welcome bullets, we still will not go.\u201d\n\nMohammed Selim, 23, said his wife and seven other family members went into hiding after finding out that they would be sent back.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Bangladesh government, the Bangladeshi people for their help. Please do not force us to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we need to go, we demand that we go back to our homes, not to any camps there. We have our land, we have our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Myanmar government said it was ready to welcome returning refugees.\n\nIt said returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \u201cproviding necessary assistance\u201d for the repatriation process.\n\nDespite the promises by Myanmar, human rights activists say conditions are not yet safe for their return.\n\nLast week, the U.N.\u2019s independent investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, called the plans \u201crushed\u201d and said she was concerned there were no guarantees that the refugees would be protected from new persecution if they return home.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian organizations operating in Rakhine state. Its U.N. observer, Robert Mardini, said Wednesday that conditions are not right for Rohingya refugees to return.\n\nHe told several reporters that the conflict between the Rohingya and Myanmar\u2019s government is not resolved, and \u201cso many\u201d Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine are flattened that there is no place to go back to.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that the conditions are not right for voluntary, safe, dignified returns, and our concerns are for people to be able to move freely, to be safe and secure, and have a normal life,\u201d Mardini said. \u201cNobody can claim today that the security in Rakhine is so well established that people can return safely.\u201d\n\nForeign leaders have criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nRohingya began fleeing into Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and even genocide. Myanmar\u2019s government has denied the accusations.\n\nMyanmar officials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a national verification card that will allow them to travel in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine state, and that they can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any of returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They are viewed as \u201cBengalis\u201d who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They have also been denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nMany people who fled earlier violence and moved into displacement camps inside Myanmar have been unable to leave those settlements for years.\n\nMost Rohingya have lived in poverty in Rakhine, near the Bangladesh border. Marked by their religion and their language \u2014 most speak a dialect of Bengali, while most of their neighbors speak Rakhine \u2014 they are easy to target.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Tofayel Ahmad in Cox\u2019s Bazar and Edith M.

But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones\u2019 missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the AP and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n___\n\n\n\nThis 2018 handout image provided by the Ali family, shows a photo of Ammer Ali, in Yemen.

Nearly 70 kilometers from Marib, at 3:00 p.m. the drone struck the car and killed the Ali the other driver survived. (Ali family via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region\u2019s conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen\u2019s civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country\u2019s consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP\u2019s founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group\u2019s chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \u201csignature strikes,\u201d based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators\u2019 suspicions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don\u2019t know how to read or write,\u201d said the brother. \u201cWe live in fear. Drones don\u2019t leave the sky.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone\u2019s missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \u201cI saw it before my eyes,\u201d he said of the blast. \u201cBodies were ripped apart.\u201d A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone\u2019s missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \u201cI lost hope,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is going to happen.\u201d\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani\u2019s brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \u201cWe are against those people,\u201d Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar\u2019s father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \u201cHe might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\u201d\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Greek Culture Ministry said archaeologists have located the first tangible remains of the city. (Greek Culture Ministry/AP)\n\nMention the Trojan War, and what may first come to mind is the oft-told tale of Helen, wife of Sparta\u2019s King Menelaus and possessor of a divinely bestowed beauty, falling in love with Paris of Troy. Their supposed affair and her subsequent abduction from Sparta sparked a 10-year Greek siege of Troy that would shape Greek civilization for centuries to come \u2014 at least according to Greek mythology.\n\nNow fast-forward about three millennia.\n\nFor the past several years, archaeologist Elena Korka has been focused on a far less romantic but more concrete legacy of the Trojan War: A lost city named Tenea, reportedly settled by war prisoners brought over from Troy.\n\nTenea enjoyed an ideal location to the south of the bustling ancient port of Corinth, on the narrow strip of land connecting Greek\u2019s mainland and its Peloponnesian peninsula. Against the odds, the city of outsiders \u201cprospered more than the other settlements, and finally even had a government of its own,\u201d the Greek philosopher Strabo once wrote.\n\nAs legend has it, when the Romans invaded Corinth in 146 B.C. \u2014 ultimately destroying the city and beginning their takeover of Greece \u2014 Tenea was left unharmed. Still, even Tenea eventually crumbled and disappeared, shadowed in the history books by more consequential ancient metropolises.\n\nFor decades, very periodic archaeological finds teased modern-day scholars with evidence of Tenea\u2019s existence: An exquisite marble statue of a young man, known as the Kouros of Tenea, was discovered in 1846, just south of Corinth. A sarcophagus containing the skeletal remains of what had been a high-society woman was unearthed in 1984, where Tenea was thought to have stood.\n\n[A museum relegated an \u2018empty\u2019 coffin to a side room for decades. Inside was a 2,500-year-old mummy.]\n\nIn 2013, Korka and a team surveyed a site in the area and, encouraged by pottery and other small finds, began excavating.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of ceramics and architectural remains ... were the reasons that led us to the excavation of the site,\u201d Korka said in a guest lecture at New York University last year. \u201cOur ultimate goal was not just the unearthing of [an ancient theater purported to be there] but rather the discovery of evidence which would help us to find remains of the settlement of ancient Tenea.\u201d\n\nThe excavation produced some extraordinary artifacts. Last year, the Greek Culture Ministry announced that the team had found a trove of riches while digging up what had been a dual-chambered burial ground at the Tenea site, as Newsweek reported:\n\nFive of the most well-appointed tombs, the experts said, would have belonged to wealthy inhabitants of Roman Greece. Bodies were found alongside elaborate gilded bronze leaves, a golden ring, precious stones and gold and bronze coins from the surrounding region. Among the other ritualistic items buried with the dead were perfumes, artifacts made of gold, gold foil and elaborately crafted glassware, as well as items of pottery. Also within the dig site, the archaeologists recovered items from a series of different burial plots.

Hicks, a former top Pentagon official during the Obama administration and one of the commissioners. \u201cIt\u2019s the flashing red that we are trying to relay.\u201d\n\nThe picture of the national security landscape that the 12-person commission sketched is a bleak one, in which an American military that has enjoyed undisputed dominance for decades is failing to receive the resources, innovation and prioritization its leaders need to outmuscle China and Russia in a race for military might reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nThe military balance has shifted adversely for the United States in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, undermining the confidence of American allies and increasing the likelihood of military conflict, the commission found after reviewing classified documents, receiving Pentagon briefings and interviewing top defense officials.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.\u201d\n\nIn its list of 32 recommendations, the commission urged the Pentagon to explain more clearly how it intends to defeat major-power rivals in competition and war. It assailed the strategy for relying at times on \u201cquestionable assumptions and weak analysis\u201d and leaving \u201cunanswered critical questions.\u201d\n\nEric Edelman, a top Pentagon official during the Bush administration, who co-chaired the commission along with retired Admiral Gary Roughead, said the report wrestled with the consequences of years of ignored warnings about the erosion of American military might.\n\nRussia and China have \u201clearned from what we\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve learned from our success. And while we\u2019ve been off doing a different kind of warfare, they\u2019ve been prepared for a kind of warfare at the high end that we really haven\u2019t engaged in for a very long time,\u201d Edelman told Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA and a fellow member of the commission, during an episode of Morell\u2019s podcast, \u201cIntelligence Matters.\u201d\n\nEdelman said people had lost sight of how complicated the international security environment had become for the United States, and argued that for a lot of reasons the American public and Congress haven\u2019t been as attentive to the urgency of the situation as they should be.\n\nThe commission said that despite a $716 billion American defense budget this year, which is four times the size of China\u2019s and more than 10 times that of Russia, the effort to reshape the U.S. defense establishment to counter current threats is under-resourced. It recommended that Congress lift budget caps on defense spending in the next two years that in the past have hobbled the military\u2019s ability to plan for the long term.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond the scope of our work to identify the exact dollar amount required to fully fund the military\u2019s needs,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cYet available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy\u2019s ambitious goals, including that of ensuring that (the Defense Department) can defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously.\u201d\n\nThe call for even more robust defense spending comes as the Democrats take over the House and seek rollbacks of key Pentagon programs. It also comes after the White House instructed the Pentagon to pare back its planned budget for the coming year by about 4.5 percent, or approximately $33 billion, after the federal deficit increased sharply following last year\u2019s tax cut.\n\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton recently said he expected the defense budget to remain relatively flat in the coming years as the administration seeks to cut discretionary spending, and suggested the Pentagon would need to reshape the military with funds derived from cuts to other areas. It promises to be a dramatic shift after two years of increased defense spending and repeated statements by President Trump that he is rebuilding the American military like never before.\n\nMoney saved from planned Pentagon changes will prove insufficient to make the kind of investment the military needs to execute the new national defense strategy, the commission found. It also said Congress should look at the entire federal budget, including entitlement spending and tax revenue, to put the nation on more stable financial footing, rather than slash defense spending.\n\nCritics of the report\u2019s findings said the commission recommends catchall defense funding that is unrealistic given the current environment. One of the commission\u2019s members, retired Army officer Andrew Krepinevich, wrote a dissent to the findings arguing that the commission failed to apply analytic rigor to its own recommendations even as it accused the Pentagon strategy of lacking analytic rigor.\n\n\u201cThe commission rightly calls attention to the erosion of the American military\u2019s conventional edge and the necessity for the country to understand the urgency of the problem,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and who oversaw the strategy\u2019s development. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t give due support and credit to the hard choices that Secretary Mattis made, which are crucial to solving this problem.\u201d\n\nTo counter Russia and China, the commission said the Navy should expand its submarine fleet and sealift forces; the Air Force should introduce more reconnaissance platforms and stealth long-range fighters and bombers; and the Army should pursue more armor, long-range precision missiles and air-defense and logistical forces.\n\nIn its recommendations, the report advocated seeing through the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and putting a top Pentagon official in charge of developing additional air and missile defenses.\n\nAnother area of focus for the commission was innovation.\n\nIt described Pentagon acquisition programs as too risk-averse, and urged the Defense Department and Congress to create a new category of pilot programs aimed at \u201cleap-ahead\u201d technologies that could serve as breakthroughs to help retain American military dominance.\n\nThe report also resurfaced questions about the civilian-military divide that arose after Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, took over as defense secretary, thanks to a vote in Congress that waived a requirement for military officers to be out of uniform for 10 years before serving in that role.\n\nIn his nearly two years as secretary, Mattis has relied more on current and former military officers for expertise than his recent predecessors have.\n\nWithout singling out Mattis, the commission warned that \u201cresponsibility on key strategic and policy issues has increasingly migrated to the military,\u201d and urged Congress to exercise oversight to \u201creverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting increasingly toward the military on issues of national importance.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Lion elected Jerusalem mayor in victory for ultra-Orthodox", "description": "Longtime political activist Moshe Lion has been elected mayor of Jerusalem in a victory for ultra-Orthodox Jewish residents", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lion-elected-jerusalem-mayor-in-victory-for-ultra-orthodox/2018/11/14/f746d978-e7d9-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T06:53:18Z", "content": "JERUSALEM Longtime political activist Moshe Lion has been elected mayor of Jerusalem in a victory for ultra-Orthodox Jewish residents.

(Sebastian Scheiner, File/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 An Israeli plan to build a cable car to Jerusalem\u2019s historic Old City has united architects and Palestinian activists in opposition to a project they say is both an eyesore and a ploy to entrench Israeli control over the city\u2019s contested eastern sector.\n\nDevelopers say the proposed project is meant to relieve snarling traffic and will ferry some 3,000 tourists an hour from the western sector directly to the Old City, in east Jerusalem. It follows a series of Israeli projects in the combustible city that have enraged the Palestinians.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the project\u2019s association with the Elad Foundation, a group that has settled Jewish nationalists in the heart of Jerusalem\u2019s Arab neighborhoods. The final cable car station will be integrated into a future tourist center run by the organization.\n\n\u201cThe cable car will send oblivious tourists flying over the heads of Palestinians and drop them off in the middle of occupied east Jerusalem, the eye of the storm, the .... center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d said Betty Herschman of Ir Amim, an advocacy group that promotes equality in the city. \u201cThis cable car is putting new facts on the ground that undermine any possibility for a peace process.\u201d\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem, along with the limestone-walled Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move never recognized internationally. The Palestinians claim the eastern sector as capital of a future state while Israel considers the entire city its eternal, undivided capital. The conflicting claims to east Jerusalem lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have frequently spilled over into violence.\n\nIn recent years, Israel has carried out a series of initiatives, billed as development projects, that have infuriated the Palestinians. Israel built a light rail train through both parts of the city, abutting the Old City and snaking through predominantly Arab neighborhoods. The train is popular with Arabs and Jews, but it has also been the target of Palestinian rioters when tensions rise.\n\nAnother proposed plan involves digging a railway tunnel under Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, passing near sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The proposed line would end at the Western Wall, with a station named after President Donald Trump, who is cheered in Israel for having recognized Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nBeyond political opposition, the cable car has faced an outcry from urban planners and architects.\n\n\u201cThis project is an outrage, an affront to our historic skyline,\u201d said Moshe Safdie, a renowned architect who signed a petition against the plan along with 70 Israeli figures from architecture, archaeology and academia. \u201cThis will Disneyfy a sacred place. Imagine a huge cable car flying over the Vatican and dumping tourists in front of St. Peter\u2019s. It\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d\n\nNo image says Jerusalem like the postcard view of its Old City \u2014 with its towering ancient walls, the Western Wall and the glimmering gold-topped Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe cable car would run 1,400 meters (nearly one mile), launching from the First Station, a popular food and cultural center in west Jerusalem, sailing over the city\u2019s ancient valley, stopping at Mount Zion, a hill just outside the Old City walls, and proceeding through the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan before alighting at the tourist center.\n\nAber Zayyad, a Palestinian resident of Silwan and director of its women\u2019s community center, said she fears the cable car flying overhead will infringe on residents\u2019 privacy and that its construction may harm houses and a local cemetery.\n\n\u201cOur tombs will likely be damaged, not to mention our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it will further attempts to make Jerusalem a solely Jewish city.\u201d\n\nThe cable car\u2019s destination at the tourist center has sparked concern about the project\u2019s potential to serve settler interests by promoting Elad\u2019s exclusive Jewish narrative of the city.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an attempt to change the character of the city and its face ... its culture and identity,\u201d said Adnan Husseini, the Palestinian minister of Jerusalem Affairs.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Tourism Ministry denies any political motivation. It says the cable car presents an environmentally friendly solution to the crisis of congestion, accessibility and parking at a time of record-breaking tourist visits. The Old City is Israel\u2019s No. 1 tourist destination.\n\nIsrael\u2019s National Infrastructure Committee, which fast-tracks transportation projects of national importance, has given approval to the project. A building permit is to come after a 60-day period of public review \u2014 a step that developers believe will be a formality.\n\nIn May, Israel allocated some $55 million to the project and, barring major complications, cars should be crisscrossing the valley by 2021, the Tourism Ministry said.\n\nAmir Halevi, the ministry\u2019s director general, said he sympathizes with concerns about the sensitivity of the site but claimed that the rapidly rising tourism rates demand a dramatic response.\n\n\u201cThere is always the question of how to balance developing and preserving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you cannot stop development.\u201d\n\nHalevi added that the Ministry mapped the cable car route carefully to \u201cminimize\u201d the evacuation and demolition of buildings.\n\nHe stressed the cable car would not enter the Old City or go over its walls, but would stop just outside. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to prevent the need to construct more invasive things,\u201d he said.\n\nUrban planning experts disagree that the cable cars, which hold 10 people per carriage, will resolve the city\u2019s daunting transportation problems.\n\nSalmah Milson Arad, director of the Jerusalem chapter of the Association of Architects and Urban Planners, estimated the cable cars will relieve only around 30 percent of bus traffic.\n\nOther critics have questioned whether the massive undertaking will even appeal to customers.\n\n\u201cIsraelis come to the (Western) Wall in their cars, the ultra-Orthodox walk, Arabs won\u2019t use this, and it\u2019s hard to imagine tourists in massive buses going out of their way to get to First Station,\u201d said Giora Solar, architect and former director of conservation for Israel\u2019s Antiquities Authority. \u201cSo who\u2019s going to benefit?\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nAs Today\u2019s WorldView noted last week, talks between the United States and North Korea have hit a rut. Now a new report from a respected Washington think tank that identified hidden North Korean missile bases has sparked fresh debate about Pyongyang\u2019s trustworthiness.\n\nThese bases \u2014 and the activity at them \u2014 seem to show that North Korea continues to prepare for a potential nuclear war despite the historic summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. There have also been reports that North Korea is still producing missiles and nuclear material. All of this, along with Pyongyang\u2019s reputation for cheating in prior agreements, has created a minor panic over whether Kim deliberately deceived the United States about his willingness to dismantle his nuclear program.\n\nGiven the high stakes of the negotiations, it\u2019s worth examining the allegations of North Korean deception: What has Kim actually said he would do with his nuclear weapons program? And why are claims of North Korean deception so worrying?\n\nOn the first question, the answer is a lot.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump reaches to shake hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nKim kicked off 2018 with a New Year\u2019s Day speech, one that offered the first hint that Kim was open to negotiations after a year of weapons testing and increasingly hostile rhetoric from both Pyongyang and Washington. But there was another part of the speech that seems just as important in hindsight. Kim hailed the supposed completion of its nuclear weapons development and said it was time for a new goal.\n\n\u201cThis year, we should focus on mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThese weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim himself proclaimed that they no longer need to test parts anymore and will just mass-produce weapons,\u201d Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said to Today\u2019s WorldView. North Korea has never publicly repudiated these comments, and the United States has never clearly stated that Kim rejected them when he met with Trump in Singapore.\n\nOn Monday, in response to the Center for Strategic and International Studies report, Today\u2019s WorldView spoke to a number of experts to ask whether the continued work at North Korean missile sites, as well as other reports that North Korean is expanding its missile arsenal, would violate the agreement reached between Kim and Trump in Singapore.\n\nAll of them agreed \u2014 often quite emphatically \u2014 that it did not. \u201cKim hasn\u2019t broken any promises,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s making good on one of them \u2014 to mass-produce nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nAs such, it\u2019s not surprising that North Korea would still be manning secret missile bases, or even producing new missiles or nuclear weapons. \u201cEven though they\u2019re violating all U.N. Security Council resolutions, North Korea didn\u2019t break any promises with Trump because there\u2019s no nuclear deal in place yet with Washington \u2014 there\u2019s nothing that prevents them from expanding their nuclear arsenal,\u201d Duyeon Kim said.\n\n\u201cLike any other nuclear weapon-possessing state, North Korea is refining the facilities and procedures associated with operating nuclear forces,\u201d Ankit Panda observed in an analysis for NK News this week.\n\nSo if North Korea is doing what it said it would be doing, why are allegations of North Korean deception so worrying? Because they reveal how differently the United States and North Korea perceive what happened in Singapore, a gap that could sink any diplomatic progress.\n\nTrump himself has consistently portrayed North Korean denuclearization as a fait accompli. But North Korea, many analysts say, sees getting rid of its nuclear weapons as the last in a long series of peace-building measures that need to be taken \u2014 if it even happens at all.\n\nToday, the NYT published a piece detailing North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear advances and the IAEA declared that Iran is complying with JCPOA limits. Yet the Trump administration acts as though NK is disarming and Iran is racing to the bomb. This is the exact opposite of reality. \u2014 Nicholas Miller (@Nick_L_Miller) November 12, 2018\n\n\u201cTrump seems not to understand that he did not negotiate a \u2018deal\u2019 in Singapore,\u201d Frank Jannuzi, the president of the Mansfield Foundation and an Asia expert, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe negotiated only an \u2018intent to negotiate.\u2019 The hard work has yet to commence.\u201d\n\nIt has not. After the bonhomie between Trump and Kim faded, working-level meetings between the United States and North Korea foundered. North Korea has pushed for concessions such as a formal end to the Korean War and sanctions relief, and it has even threatened to restart testing.\n\nAccusations of dishonesty and a subsequent air of distrust have derailed many previous attempts to find common ground between Washington and Pyongyang. Certainly, North Korea\u2019s reputation for obtuseness and disregard for the truth is well-earned. But so far, North Korea has kept to the vague requirements agreed to in Singapore.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s someone confused about what that summit meant, it doesn\u2019t appear to be Kim.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Hicks, a former top Pentagon official during the Obama administration and one of the commissioners. \u201cIt\u2019s the flashing red that we are trying to relay.\u201d\n\nThe picture of the national security landscape that the 12-person commission sketched is a bleak one, in which an American military that has enjoyed undisputed dominance for decades is failing to receive the resources, innovation and prioritization its leaders need to outmuscle China and Russia in a race for military might reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nThe military balance has shifted adversely for the United States in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, undermining the confidence of American allies and increasing the likelihood of military conflict, the commission found after reviewing classified documents, receiving Pentagon briefings and interviewing top defense officials.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.\u201d\n\nIn its list of 32 recommendations, the commission urged the Pentagon to explain more clearly how it intends to defeat major-power rivals in competition and war. It assailed the strategy for relying at times on \u201cquestionable assumptions and weak analysis\u201d and leaving \u201cunanswered critical questions.\u201d\n\nEric Edelman, a top Pentagon official during the Bush administration, who co-chaired the commission along with retired Admiral Gary Roughead, said the report wrestled with the consequences of years of ignored warnings about the erosion of American military might.\n\nRussia and China have \u201clearned from what we\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve learned from our success. And while we\u2019ve been off doing a different kind of warfare, they\u2019ve been prepared for a kind of warfare at the high end that we really haven\u2019t engaged in for a very long time,\u201d Edelman told Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA and a fellow member of the commission, during an episode of Morell\u2019s podcast, \u201cIntelligence Matters.\u201d\n\nEdelman said people had lost sight of how complicated the international security environment had become for the United States, and argued that for a lot of reasons the American public and Congress haven\u2019t been as attentive to the urgency of the situation as they should be.\n\nThe commission said that despite a $716 billion American defense budget this year, which is four times the size of China\u2019s and more than 10 times that of Russia, the effort to reshape the U.S. defense establishment to counter current threats is under-resourced. It recommended that Congress lift budget caps on defense spending in the next two years that in the past have hobbled the military\u2019s ability to plan for the long term.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond the scope of our work to identify the exact dollar amount required to fully fund the military\u2019s needs,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cYet available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy\u2019s ambitious goals, including that of ensuring that (the Defense Department) can defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously.\u201d\n\nThe call for even more robust defense spending comes as the Democrats take over the House and seek rollbacks of key Pentagon programs. It also comes after the White House instructed the Pentagon to pare back its planned budget for the coming year by about 4.5 percent, or approximately $33 billion, after the federal deficit increased sharply following last year\u2019s tax cut.\n\nWhite House national security adviser John Bolton recently said he expected the defense budget to remain relatively flat in the coming years as the administration seeks to cut discretionary spending, and suggested the Pentagon would need to reshape the military with funds derived from cuts to other areas. It promises to be a dramatic shift after two years of increased defense spending and repeated statements by President Trump that he is rebuilding the American military like never before.\n\nMoney saved from planned Pentagon changes will prove insufficient to make the kind of investment the military needs to execute the new national defense strategy, the commission found. It also said Congress should look at the entire federal budget, including entitlement spending and tax revenue, to put the nation on more stable financial footing, rather than slash defense spending.\n\nCritics of the report\u2019s findings said the commission recommends catchall defense funding that is unrealistic given the current environment. One of the commission\u2019s members, retired Army officer Andrew Krepinevich, wrote a dissent to the findings arguing that the commission failed to apply analytic rigor to its own recommendations even as it accused the Pentagon strategy of lacking analytic rigor.\n\n\u201cThe commission rightly calls attention to the erosion of the American military\u2019s conventional edge and the necessity for the country to understand the urgency of the problem,\u201d said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and who oversaw the strategy\u2019s development. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t give due support and credit to the hard choices that Secretary Mattis made, which are crucial to solving this problem.\u201d\n\nTo counter Russia and China, the commission said the Navy should expand its submarine fleet and sealift forces; the Air Force should introduce more reconnaissance platforms and stealth long-range fighters and bombers; and the Army should pursue more armor, long-range precision missiles and air-defense and logistical forces.\n\nIn its recommendations, the report advocated seeing through the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and putting a top Pentagon official in charge of developing additional air and missile defenses.\n\nAnother area of focus for the commission was innovation.\n\nIt described Pentagon acquisition programs as too risk-averse, and urged the Defense Department and Congress to create a new category of pilot programs aimed at \u201cleap-ahead\u201d technologies that could serve as breakthroughs to help retain American military dominance.\n\nThe report also resurfaced questions about the civilian-military divide that arose after Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, took over as defense secretary, thanks to a vote in Congress that waived a requirement for military officers to be out of uniform for 10 years before serving in that role.\n\nIn his nearly two years as secretary, Mattis has relied more on current and former military officers for expertise than his recent predecessors have.\n\nWithout singling out Mattis, the commission warned that \u201cresponsibility on key strategic and policy issues has increasingly migrated to the military,\u201d and urged Congress to exercise oversight to \u201creverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting increasingly toward the military on issues of national importance.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Carolyn Hax", "title": "Carolyn Hax: When your roomie makes your heart go zoomie", "description": "Enjoy the moment, the anticipation, the getting to know each other.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-when-your-roomie-makes-your-heart-go-zoomie/2018/11/12/b23f3f84-e46c-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VUseBs3z7Pja2aFJsgLTh55Q7wA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MSVVAFHENQI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T04:59:00Z", "content": "Dear Carolyn: Four months ago I moved into a new place, and have fallen for one of my roommates.

I want to ask her out, but given our year-long lease I don't know if this is a good idea. We hang out and really get along, and I do not want to jeopardize our friendship.\n\nI was telling her about a road trip I am taking in about seven months for a wedding, and she wants to come with. It would be us two on a 12-hour road trip to the wedding. We would then take five days to go hiking about in the mountains because we both love to do that, and then head back home. This does not seem like something you would do with \"just a friend,\" but again we really get along and maybe she is just doing this because she likes to hike and hang out with me.\n\nIt's hard for me to keep on going like this. Do I wait until the end of the lease to ask her? What if she loses interest in me because I waited too long to ask her out? Do I take the chance now and, if she does not like me, have a possibly awkward living situation and maybe lose a friendship?\n\n\u2014 Do I Wait?\n\nDo I Wait?: Congratulations on such a nice problem to have.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re handling it well. You have way more to lose by rushing in than by biding your time \u2014 and I\u2019m not even sure waiting seven-ish months while actively hanging out and travel-planning and suffusing the air with expectant glances like so many dust motes in sunlight even qualifies as romance-snuffing behavior.

They divorced, and Sally had a daughter, Zelda, with another man seven years later. Because Zelda is our grandson's half sister, is she any relation to us? We are close with Sally and always treated Zelda as a granddaughter, though not blood-related.

Not that you meant it to be so, and not that you were even asking me about this (ahem), but your choice to be inclusive sets such an important example for these kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not always possible to do this, of course. Sallys aren\u2019t always open to an ex-parent-in-law\u2019s presence in their new families, so yay for her, and even just numbers can get in the way.

She and four others from that small group now say the sense of intimacy, artistry and discovery that defined early Instagram and led to its success has given way to a celebrity-driven marketplace that is engineered to sap users\u2019 time and attention at the cost of their well-being.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, you felt your post was seen by people who cared about you and that you cared about,\u201d said Richardson, who left Instagram in 2014 and later founded a start-up. \u201cThat feeling is completely gone for me now.\u201d\n\n[From Silicon Valley elite to social media hate: The radicalization that led to Gab]\n\nThe catalyst for Richardson\u2019s decision to quit Instagram came when its co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, unexpectedly announced that they were leaving the company. With their exit, Richardson and other former Instagram employees worried Facebook would squash whatever independent identity the company had managed to retain.\n\nShe sent her goodbye to Instagram the next day.\n\nEven in Silicon Valley, where it\u2019s common to hear start-up workers become frustrated with management after an acquisition, the disillusionment of the early Instagram employees is striking: People seldom swear off or criticize the product they built, particularly when it has enjoyed such remarkable success. Instagram reached 1 billion users this year.\n\nThe people who worked at social networks long saw the connection and free expression they facilitated as a powerful force for good and evidence of the contribution they were making to society. For them, the public questioning of the role social networks play in democracy and in individual lives, sparked by concerns over privacy and health, is deeply personal.\n\nThree of the early Instagram employees, including Richardson, have deleted it \u2014 permanently or periodically, comparing it to a drug that produces a diminishing high. One of the people said he felt a little embarrassed to tell people that he worked there. Two of the other early employees said they used it far less than before.\n\nThis shift is part of an existential crisis for Facebook, which has seen a slew of top executives resign this year, including the leaders of its major acquisitions: Oculus, WhatsApp and Instagram. Some people are also abandoning Facebook: It lost 4 million users in Europe in the last six months and growth has plateaued in the United States.\n\nThe Instagram employees, including Richardson, said they hoped their concerns would not be dismissed as nostalgia and would be seen as a call to future entrepreneurs to recognize these pitfalls and build something better.\n\n\u201cThere was so much pressure to do things that \u2018scaled,\u2019 to use the Silicon Valley buzzword,\u201d said Josh Riedel, the third employee after Systrom and Krieger. \u201cBut when you have over a billion users, something gets lost along the way.\u201d\n\nIan Spalter, Instagram\u2019s head of design, said in an interview that experiences on Instagram are subjective \u2014 one person\u2019s frustration may be another person\u2019s pleasure \u2014 and that the app was not designed to be a time-suck. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the game to have you leave Instagram feeling worse off than when you went in,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the departed founders of a company Facebook acquired, WhatsApp\u2019s Brian Acton, has actively encouraged people to delete Facebook, though he is still a proponent and a user of WhatsApp. (He is also funding a rival messaging app.) Other former Facebook executives have expressed regrets about the products they built. Instagram\u2019s Systrom continues to champion the service but recently said of his departure: \u201cYou don\u2019t leave a job because everything is awesome, right?\u201d\n\nII.\n\nWhen Richardson joined Instagram in February 2012, at age 26, the former art history major was drawn to what was then a fast-growing indie platform for photographers, hipsters and artistic-types who wanted to share interesting or beautiful things they discovered about the world. At that time, Instagram was \u201ca camera that looked out into the world,\" said one of the company\u2019s first engineers, \"versus a camera that was all about myself, my friends, who I\u2019m with.\u201d\n\nRichardson ran the start-up\u2019s blog as well as the official @instagram account from the company\u2019s offices in San Francisco\u2019s South Park neighborhood. Before there were software algorithms suggesting accounts to follow, Richardson selected featured Instagrammers by hand. For the most devoted users, she organized in-person \u201cInsta-meets\u201d in places as far-flung as Moscow and North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe felt like stewards of that passion,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\n\nRichardson moved to New York after leaving Instagram. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nOne of the first people she featured prominently was an early Instagrammer in Spain. The exposure Richardson gave @IsabelitaVirtual, an amateur photographer whose real name is Isabel Martinez, helped Martinez become one of the most popular Instagram users in the country and led to a career in high-end fashion photography.\n\nBoth say that type of random connection that resulted in their friendship is hardly possible in the current iteration of Instagram. Too many people to follow, too much showmanship, too many posts flickering by, they say. \u201cI don\u2019t even see her posts anymore,\u201d Richardson said. Martinez told The Post that while she wouldn\u2019t quit Instagram for professional reasons, the app has in recent years become more anxiety-producing than pleasurable for her.\n\n[Facebook\u2019s former security chief warns of tech\u2019s \u2018negative impacts\u2019 \u2014 and has a plan to help solve them]\n\nEven in the early days, Richardson was aware that the app had a dark side. She was one of the first content moderators and spent many days and weekends culling through pornographic and other undesirable images that sprung up as the app grew.\n\nIII.\n\nA few months after Richardson started her job at Instagram, Systrom announced to the dozen employees that the company had been acquired by Facebook \u2014 taking everyone by surprise. The entire team got in a bus and drove about 30 miles south to Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, where Facebook employees broke into applause as they entered the building. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took them into his office, where he welcomed them excitedly and assured them that they would maintain their own unique identity.\n\nRichardson said she was excited but apprehensive. The details of the acquisition were still murky. Ultimately only Systrom and Krieger walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars; Facebook offered other early employees small signing bonuses and limited Facebook stock grants for staying on. And Facebook had a reputation for alienating users with its privacy scandals, including charges it had settled with the Federal Trade Commission the previous year for sharing people\u2019s personal details that they thought were private with app developers and the public.\n\nA few months later, the team was officially installed in Menlo Park, where Instagram was given a separate area on campus to work.\n\nIts employees were seen as the cool kids on campus. They had figured out how to make a smartphone-only product go viral, something Facebook was still struggling to accomplish ahead of its impending public offering.\n\nBut there were things Facebook wanted to improve about Instagram. Facebook\u2019s growth team \u2014 an influential unit whose goal was to identify and implement measures to acquire users and keep them engaged \u2014 came in and picked apart every feature of the app, three of the former employees said.\n\nNo detail was too small. The team helped fix Instagram\u2019s clunky sign-in process, which was leaking users. It borrowed techniques that had worked on Facebook, like sending users an email alert about their friends\u2019 activities when they hadn\u2019t used the app in a while. They rolled out photo-tagging, much to the frustration of Instagram employees, who felt these features were too associated with Facebook and would fall flat with Instagram\u2019s user base, said four of the employees.\n\nThe photo-tagging feature triggered \u201cemotional anxiety,\u201d said the early engineer. \u201cIt introduced a whole new dynamic.\u201d\n\nRichardson\u2019s team of about six employees, which was focused on managing Instagram\u2019s most passionate power users, was also targeted for change. Facebook told them that in order for the product to scale to a large audience, software tools would need to replace manual processes, Richardson and two former employees said.\n\nRichardson said she was taken aback, \u201cnot because of the boldness of it or because of how crappy it made me and my contribution feel, but because of the misunderstanding of what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nShe began making plans to leave and resigned in 2014, along with most of the employees The Post spoke with. By then, the app had more than 200 million users, compared with roughly 30 million at the time of the acquisition. Three of the original 13 employees are still at Instagram or Facebook, according to Facebook.\n\nInstagram moved to an algorithmic feed in 2016 \u2014 prior to that posts were in chronological order \u2014 and software is now doing much of the discovery on behalf of users, feeding them tailored content. The Stories feature, added the same year, introduced a flickering element to Instagram\u2019s design by automatically reloading new stories in a carousel. The result of these changes and others prior to it was increased follower counts, produced larger social networks with weaker ties, and more time spent in the app.\n\nRichardson, who is a big fan of hedgehogs, found herself looking at many more of them on Instagram. \u201cI clicked on one, but then I get dozens, which is more than my brain can possibly manage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes all the agency out of it.\u201d\n\n[A content moderator says she got PTSD while reviewing images posted on Facebook]\n\nSpalter, the Instagram design chief, pointed out that Instagram\u2019s rapid growth has required the company to build tools that will assist people in finding posts and users. \u201cWe have a billion people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we have content from every weird niche interest, and we have made it easier for you to find things. That\u2019s also the beauty of having a much larger community.\u201d\n\nInstagram is aware that its software was offering up too much celebrity content and content from people with large followings at the expense of posts from people who users know personally, according to Spalter, who joined Instagram in 2015. The company has rejiggered the software to adjust the balance, he said.\n\n\u201cManaging that balance is critical to Instagram\u2019s future. ... If you feed gets overrun with celebrities, you won\u2019t feel comfortable sharing content with your friends anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI get how, in the early days, when you\u2019re connecting with everyone, that\u2019s very special. We\u2019re at a different phase of development at this point, and it\u2019s a different world in that way. But it\u2019s still a place where people connect.\u201d\n\nHe added that Instagram released tools in August to help people manage the time they spend on the app.\n\nRichardson says that content on Instagram is now \u201ctoo eager for your attention.\u201d Before, \u201cyou had to make an effort to find someone, and that meant something to you and to the people you found. Today I\u2019m amazed by how little honor each piece of content is given.\u201d\n\n\n\nBailey Richardson's final Instagram story. (Courtesy of Bailey Richardson )\n\nAfter leaving Instagram, Richardson traveled around the world, meeting Instagram users whom she had connected with online. She eventually settled in New York City, where she founded a start-up called People & Company, where she helps nonprofits and businesses, including Nike, find ways to connect with their audiences online.\n\nShe says she wasn\u2019t thinking actively about Instagram until late September, when news broke that its founders were resigning \u2014 once again taking most of their employees by surprise.\n\nRichardson was flooded with memories. She remembered first meeting Martinez, and all that had changed since. She called up a friend from her Instagram days, and they concluded that Instagram no longer had value in their lives. Together, they decided to quit. She composed her last post while sitting in her car.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re all addicted to a drug that doesn\u2019t get us high anymore,\u201d she said of the decision. \u201cSo I wanted to make space for something that really does.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "BTS's agency apologizes over band member's A-bomb shirt - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post BTS's agency apologizes over band member's A-bomb shirt Washington Post SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The agency for K-pop superstars BTS apologized Wednesday for members wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb and a hat with a Nazi\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/btss-agency-apologizes-over-band-members-a-bomb-shirt/2018/11/13/ad10fdd6-e7b9-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T04:06:18Z", "content": "SEOUL, South Korea The agency for K-pop superstars BTS apologized Wednesday for members wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb and a hat with a Nazi emblem.

Many Koreans were living in Japan at the time, including laborers who were forcibly mobilized by the Japanese, and estimates of the number of Koreans killed in the bombings range from 20,000 to 50,000.\n\nSouth Korean politicians criticized the Japanese broadcasters\u2019 decision to cancel BTS appearances, accusing Japan of harboring \u201cself-centered views on history\u201d and letting politics interfere with cultural exchanges.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear the T-shirt controversy is seriously affecting the band\u2019s huge popularity in Japan, with 50,000 people reportedly filling up the Tokyo Dome on Wednesday evening to watch them perform.\n\nThe BTS agency said the A-bomb shirt\u2019s wearing was \u201cin no way intentional\u201d and wasn\u2019t designed to \u201cinjure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\u201d However, it said it still apologizes for \u201cfailing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\u201d\n\nIn regard to the hat, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication. It said the flags were intended to symbolize South Korea\u2019s restrictively uniform and authoritarian educational systems, not Nazism.\n\n\u201cWe will carefully examine and review not only these issues but all activities involving Big Hit and our artists based on a firm understanding of diverse social, historical and cultural considerations to ensure that we never cause any injury, pain or distress to anyone,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe seven members of the band, which has a worldwide following, in May became the first South Korean artists to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with \u201cLove Yourself: Tear.\u201d The band began a Japan tour earlier this week.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nScientists behind a major study that claimed the Earth\u2019s oceans are warming faster than previously thought now say their work contained inadvertent errors that made their conclusions seem more certain than they actually are.\n\nTwo weeks after the high-profile study was published in the journal Nature, its authors have submitted corrections to the publication. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, home to several of the researchers involved, also noted the problems in the scientists' work and corrected a news release on its website, which previously had asserted that the study detailed how the Earth\u2019s oceans \u201chave absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we made mistakes here,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, a climate scientist at Scripps, who was a co-author of the study. \u201cI think the main lesson is that you work as fast as you can to fix mistakes when you find them.\u201d\n\nThe central problem, according to Keeling, came in how the researchers dealt with the uncertainty in their measurements. As a result, the findings suffer from too much doubt to definitively support the paper\u2019s conclusion about how much heat the oceans have absorbed over time.\n\nThe central conclusion of the study \u2014 that oceans are retaining ever more energy as more heat is being trapped within Earth\u2019s climate system each year \u2014 is in line with other studies that have drawn similar conclusions. And it hasn\u2019t changed much despite the errors. But Keeling said the authors' miscalculations mean there is a much larger margin of error in the findings, which means researchers can weigh in with less certainty than they thought.\n\n\u201cI accept responsibility for what happened because it\u2019s my role to make sure that those kind of details got conveyed,\u201d Keeling said. (He has published a more detailed explanation of what happened here.)\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author was Laure Resplandy of Princeton University. Other researchers were with institutions in China, Paris, Germany and the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.\n\n\u201cMaintaining the accuracy of the scientific record is of primary importance to us as publishers and we recognize our responsibility to correct errors in papers that we have published,\u201d Nature said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cIssues relating to this paper have been brought to Nature\u2019s attention and we are looking into them carefully. We take all concerns related to papers we have published very seriously and will issue an update once further information is available.\u201d\n\nThe original study, which appeared Oct. 31, derived a new method for measuring how much heat is being absorbed by the oceans. Essentially, the authors measured the volume of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, that have escaped the ocean in recent decades and headed into the atmosphere as it heats up. They found that the warming \u201cis at the high end of previous estimates\u201d and suggested that as a result, the rate of global warming itself could be more accelerated.\n\nThe results, wrote the authors, may suggest there is less time than previously thought to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The study drew considerable media attention, including from The Post.\n\nHowever, not long after publication, an independent Britain-based researcher named Nicholas Lewis published a lengthy blog post saying he had found a \u201cmajor problem\u201d with the research.\n\n\u201cSo far as I can see, their method vastly underestimates the uncertainty,\u201d Lewis said in an interview Tuesday, \u201cas well as biasing up significantly, nearly 30 percent, the central estimate.\u201d\n\nLewis added that he tends \u201cto read a large number of papers, and, having a mathematics as well as a physics background, I tend to look at them quite carefully, and see if they make sense. And where they don\u2019t make sense \u2014 with this one, it\u2019s fairly obvious it didn\u2019t make sense \u2014 I look into them more deeply.\u201d\n\nLewis has argued in past studies and commentaries that climate scientists are predicting too much warming because of their reliance on computer simulations, and that current data from the planet itself suggests global warming will be less severe than feared.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the authors agree with all of Lewis\u2019s criticisms, but Keeling said \u201cwe agree there were problems along the lines he identified.\u201d\n\nPaul Durack, a research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said that promptly acknowledging the errors in the study \u201cis the right approach in the interests of transparency.\u201d\n\nBut he added in an email, \u201cThis study, although there are additional questions that are arising now, confirms the long known result that the oceans have been warming over the observed record, and the rate of warming has been increasing,\u201d he said.\n\nGavin Schmidt, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, followed the growing debate over the study closely on Twitter and said that measurements about the uptake of heat in the oceans have been bedeviled with data problems for some time \u2014 and that debuting new research in this area is hard.\n\n\u201cObviously you rely on your co-authors and the reviewers to catch most problems, but things still sometimes slip through,\u201d Schmidt wrote in an email.\n\nSchmidt and Keeling agreed that other studies also support a higher level of ocean heat content than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, saw in a landmark 2013 report.\n\nOverall, Schmidt said, the episode can be seen as a positive one.\n\n\u201cThe key is not whether mistakes are made, but how they are dealt with \u2014 and the response from Laure and Ralph here is exemplary. No panic, but a careful reexamination of their working \u2014 despite a somewhat hostile environment,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSo, plus one for some post-publication review, and plus one to the authors for reexamining the whole calculation in a constructive way. We will all end up wiser.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Expensive APEC summit sows division in host Papua New Guinea", "description": "After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders meeting in the country that can least afford it", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/expensive-apec-summit-sows-division-in-host-papua-new-guinea/2018/11/13/518cff1a-e7bd-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T03:34:10Z", "content": "PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders meeting in the country that can least afford it.

(Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press)\n\nPORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea \u2014 After three decades of promoting free trade as a panacea to poverty, the APEC grouping of nations that includes the U.S. and China is holding its lavish annual leaders meeting in the country that can least afford it.\n\nBarely penetrated by roads and scarred by violence, Papua New Guinea hopes the parade of world leaders will lift the mountainous Pacific nation of hundreds of tribal groups out of obscurity and attract investment.\n\nBut the expense has brought criticism when the government has a budget crisis, basic medicines are scarce, and polio, eliminated from all but a handful of countries, has returned. In 2015, the International Monetary Fund estimated that upgrading the capital for the event and hosting a year of related meetings could cost $1 billion.\n\nAustralia, the biggest foreign aid donor to Papua New Guinea and former colonial occupier, as well as China and other countries have absorbed some of the cost but critics have already been given plenty of vindication.\n\nIn an eye-popping move, the government imported 40 luxury Maserati cars to whisk VIPs among convention venues in the secure bubble of the APEC meetings. Officials said the government would sell them to recover the cost, sparking more disbelief and suspicions of a corrupt scheme.\n\nChinese government money, meanwhile, has built what has been dubbed a boulevard to nowhere in the capital Port Moresby, a city described by the World Bank as among the world\u2019s most violent due to high unemployment and brazen criminal gangs known as \u201craskols.\u201d\n\nA VIP terminal costing about $19 million was added to the city\u2019s airport. Construction of an iconic building \u201cAPEC Haus\u201d for the leaders\u2019 summit was paid for by oil and gas company Oil Search, which operates all of Papua New Guinea\u2019s oil fields, in exchange for tax credits. That avoided an immediate cost for the government but will erode its revenue in the future.\n\n\u201cI think the money should have been used to fix our backyard instead of decorating the front porch. We have health, education and infrastructure deficiencies that need to be addressed,\u201d said activist and writer Martyn Namorong.\n\n\u201cMany teachers haven\u2019t been paid and hospitals lack medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much misery experienced by ordinary Papua New Guineans while the elite party with the world like there is no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhat the weeklong talkfest will produce, other than its signature photo of world leaders in locally themed shirts, is unclear. In the impenetrable language of APEC, the meeting is about \u201cHarnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future.\u201d\n\nAllan Bollard, executive director of the APEC secretariat, said the meeting is complicated by the tensions between China and the U.S. over trade and the broader backlash against globalization \u2014 the dominant Western-led ideology over the past four decades that freer trade and movement of people is inevitably good for all.\n\n\u201cThis year we\u2019ve had more bilateral trade friction, between the U.S. and China in particular, and that does make it more complex around the table in the sense that APEC only does initiatives where everybody agrees,\u201d Bollard said.\n\nPort Moresby, a city where foreigners and the local elite live in homes barricaded behind high walls and barbed wire, will host more than 12,000 visitors for the meetings that end on Sunday.\n\nBecause of a shortage of hotels, many will stay in three cruise ships docked at Port Moresby and be shuttled back and forth in some of the hundreds of vehicles imported for the event. The city will be crawling with police and military, some of them from Australia and New Zealand, who are providing air force planes, navy patrol boats, special forces and other personnel.\n\nAustralian media reports say Canberra is spending more than $100 million on security and other support for APEC. The Australian prime minister\u2019s office declined to release a figure, calling the assistance an \u201cextension of long-term cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security is going to be so tight,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \u201cThis is going to be the safest time to be in Port Moresby.\u201d\n\nEven so, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage will be flying into the country each day from northern Queensland in Australia.\n\nOutside of the spruced-up capital, 2018 has been a year of renewed tribal and political violence.\n\nEarlier this month, rioting engulfed the coastal town of Alotau more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Port Moresby after police leaving for APEC killed a woman and her child in a road accident, said the town\u2019s Catholic Bishop Rolando Santos. Gunfights erupted when police reinforcements arrived from the capital, he said. The growth of a Chinese diaspora, said Pryke, has also fueled economic tensions that have led to protests and riots.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much funds for education, health,\u201d said Santos, a Filipino who\u2019s lived in Papua New Guinea for 17 years. \u201cMany were affected because of APEC.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Catholic Bishops Conference has criticized dire shortages of basic services while the government poured resources into getting the capital ready for world leaders.\n\n\u201cWe share the concern of many about the huge amount of our limited resources being expended on this event which seems designed to entertain and impress the rich and powerful,\u201d said its president Rochus Tatamai.\n\nPapua New Guineans, he said, are \u201csuffering and dying in order to make APEC a success.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jon Elswick/AP)\n\nThe CIA explored finding a \u201ctruth serum\u201d to use on terrorism detainees in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to a declassified report that was released as part of a lengthy Freedom of Information lawsuit.\n\nThe report, written by a chief CIA medical official whose identity has not been disclosed, detailed that Project Medication, as the effort was named, was shelved in 2003.\n\nBut not before the agency doctors had explored whether \u201cdrug-based interviews\u201d would make for a less harsh alternative to the brutal interrogation practices like sleep deprivation, small-space confinement and waterboarding that the CIA employed in the years after 9/11, tactics that have come to be widely referred to as torture.\n\nThe report noted the agency\u2019s previous forays into the field of truth serums, citing a 1961 report that concluded that individuals who could withstand interrogations would probably still be able to hold out in altered mental states. It also cited the CIA\u2019s use of LSD and other drugs during its notorious MK-ULTRA project in the 1950s and \u201960s, when the agency conducted 149 experiments in mind control, including the use of 25 unwitting subjects.\n\nA drug called Versed, known by its generic name, midazolam, was identified by the report as the preferred drug for truth inducement. A benzodiazepine, a class of drugs normally used to treat anxiety, the drug did have a drawback for interrogation purposes, the report noted: It had to be administered by a physician intravenously, compared to LSD, which could be administered without a subject\u2019s knowledge.\n\n\u201cAmbivalently, Versed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\u201d the report noted.\n\nBut the report noted that any use of such a drug would probably bump up against legal obstacles: those that banned conducting medical experiments on prisoners, as well the use of mind-altering drugs in interrogations. The CIA never asked the Justice Department to look at the issue, effectively shelving it.\n\n[Newly released CIA files expose grim details of agency interrogation program]\n\nOrdered released by a judge as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the report sheds more light on a contentious aspect of President George W. Bush\u2019s legacy: the CIA\u2019s use of brutal interrogation techniques after 9/11. It details the tactics used against suspects, including slapping, being thrown against a wall, waterboarding and being confined in a cramped box.\n\nAnd it shows the complicated legal and moral arguments employed by agency officials, including those in the medical world, to justify such ethically challenging decisions.\n\nThough the harsh interrogation methods have been widely condemned since, including by President Barack Obama, and outlined in a public Senate report that noted that the techniques were \u201cin violation of U.S. law, treaty obligations, and our values,\u201d no CIA officers were ever prosecuted for their roles.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most striking element of the document is the CIA doctors\u2019 willful blindness to the truth of what they were doing,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Dror Ladin wrote about the report. \u201cCIA doctors decided that waterboarding actually \u2018provided periodic relief\u2019 to a prisoner because it was a break from days of standing sleep deprivation. Similarly, CIA doctors decided that when a different prisoner was stuffed into a coffin-sized box, this provided a \u2018relatively benign sanctuary\u2019 from other torture methods.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of doctors and psychologists in the CIA\u2019s interrogation programs has drawn wide outcry from the medical community.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment but pointed to statements made by one of its legal officers in a court case that said the report was a working draft that had never been finalized.\n\nThe report was titled \u201cSummary and Reflections of Chief of Medical Services,\u201d on participation in the CIA\u2019s extraordinary rendition program.\n\nThe ACLU had been working for more than two years to get the report released, as the government has fought the disclosure, the Associated Press reported.

(Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 Leaders of Southeast Asian nations have again pushed back an agreement on a pan-Asian free trade deal amid a whirlwind of diplomacy Wednesday at their annual summit.\n\nIn convening talks among the leaders of countries participating in the plan, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a final agreement on the deal, which is expected to encompass nearly half the world\u2019s population and 40 percent of world trade, will be delayed until 2019.\n\nLee\u2019s comments confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord this year.\n\nThe trade talks followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders and talks on other issues such as regional security, how to keep peace in the South China Sea and the crisis over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh to escape violence in Myanmar.\n\nDuring the meetings in Singapore, Lee has championed the region\u2019s commitment to free trade and a multilateral approach to sorting out the issue \u2014 in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican First\u201d preference for bilateral trade deals and distrust of international institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting at a critical time. Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished seven of 18 chapters in their agreement and shown \u201cstrong political will\u201d to finish it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement, already in negotiations for six years, would damage the RCEP\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern. China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\u201d Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \u201cgreater stability\u201d with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing\u2019s hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code is needed \u201cat all cost\u201d to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China\u2019s assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \u201cDeclaration of Conduct\u201d but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \u201cserious miscalculation\u201d and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\u201cSo you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there\u2019s friction between the Western nations and China,\u201d Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country\u2019s leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar\u2019s arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\u201cThey are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\u201d said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \u201cThat may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don\u2019t do that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Opinion polls indicate Bainimarama is poised to win a second term in Fiji\u2019s general election Wednesday after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after he seized power in a coup. (Richard Drew, File/Associated Press)\n\nSUVA, Fiji \u2014 The man who first seized power in a military coup then refashioned himself as a legitimate leader appears set to rule Fiji for another four years.\n\nPrime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama and his FijiFirst party were headed for a convincing election win early Thursday as votes were tallied. Bainimarama has ruled the island nation since his 2006 coup, and won his first election in 2014 after returning democracy to the country.\n\nWith about half of the votes counted, FijiFirst was ahead with 53 percent while closest rival the Social Democratic Liberal Party, led by Sitiveni Rabuka, was at 37 percent. The margin was closer than in the last election, when FijiFirst won almost 60 percent of the vote.\n\nRabuka led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister in the 1990s. Just this week, a judge cleared him of an electoral disclosure violation in a case that many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nHeavy rainfall throughout Wednesday affected voter turnout. The bad weather prompted officials to close more than 20 polling venues, affecting more than 7,000 voters who were promised the chance to vote at a later date.\n\nBefore voting ended, Supervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem urged voters to brave the weather, saying low turnout needed \u201cto increase as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weather is a bit discouraging,\u201d said Akanisi Lal. That didn\u2019t stop the 53-year-old from taking a break from looking after her family to vote for Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cI have seen what he has been doing over the past four years,\u201d she said, citing policies such as free bus fares for seniors. \u201cHe will go deeper if he comes again in power.\u201d\n\nSome voters were reluctant to say who they voted for because of fear of reprisals. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be victimized,\u201d said Jashneel Kumar, a 24-year-old nurse.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation\u2019s pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability was a big issue leading up to the election, as were racial tensions and economic issues.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they\u2019ve made under Bainimarama.\n\n\u201cThere are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\u201d said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \u201cBainimarama\u2019s government is not bad. He\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There were rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bound to have another coup if he doesn\u2019t win,\u201d said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, who make up about 57 percent of the population, and away from Fijians of Indian descent, who make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\u201cBainimarama\u2019s key success has been to establish the name \u2018Fijian\u2019 for all citizens of Fiji,\u201d said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \u201cHis legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believed Rabuka would help restore their prestige, and liked his promise to bring back the nation\u2019s Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has changed his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji\u2019s externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji\u2019s relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama\u2019s government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama\u2019s opponents vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It\u2019s expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison\u2019s meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan\u2019s biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abe\u2019s visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries\u2019 strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\u201d Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \u201cat the final stage in discussions\u201d on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia\u2019s new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan\u2019s call for alternative sources of investment to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington\u2019s push against China\u2019s growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence\u2019s press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \u201cdeliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington\u2019s rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \u201cThe United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values. The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\u201d\n\nAustralia will show off a heavy military presence around the APEC meeting to maintain security including a helicopter-landing ship, fighter jets and 500 troops to be stationed in Port Moresby.\n\nThe U.S., Japan, China, Canada, New Zealand and Indonesia are also contributing to security arrangements.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nAs he jetted to Paris last Friday, President Trump received a congratulatory phone call aboard Air Force One. British Prime Minister Theresa May was calling to celebrate the Republican Party\u2019s wins in the midterm elections \u2014 never mind that Democrats seized control of the House \u2014 but her appeal to the American president\u2019s vanity was met with an ornery outburst.\n\nTrump berated May for Britain not doing enough, in his assessment, to contain Iran. He questioned her over Brexit and complained about the trade deals he sees as unfair with European countries. May has endured Trump\u2019s churlish temper before, but still her aides were shaken by his especially foul mood, according to U.S. and European officials briefed on the conversation.\n\nFor Trump, that testy call set the tone for five days of fury \u2014 evident in Trump\u2019s splenetic tweets and described in interviews with 14 senior administration officials, outside Trump confidants and foreign diplomats, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\n\u201cHe was frustrated with the trip. And he\u2019s itching to make some changes,\u201d said one senior White House official. \u201cThis is a week where things could get really dicey.\u201d\n\nDuring his 43-hour stay in Paris, Trump brooded over the Florida recounts and sulked over key races being called for Democrats in the midterm elections that he had claimed as a \u201cbig victory.\u201d He erupted at his staff over media coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I.\n\nThe president also was angry and resentful over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s public rebuke of rising nationalism, which Trump considered a personal attack. And that was after his difficult meeting with Macron, where officials said little progress was made as Trump again brought up his frustrations over trade and Iran.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a bull carrying his own china shop with him when\u00adever he travels the world,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said.\n\n\n\nPeople react in front of a large inflatable blimp depicting President Trump in Republique Square in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018. (Vadim Ghirda/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump was plotting a shake-up in his administration. He told advisers over the weekend that he had decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and that he also was seriously considering replacing White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, who scrambled early this week to try to save Nielsen\u2019s job.\n\nThe senior White House official, who speaks to the president regularly, said Trump has been grousing lately about getting rid of Kelly. \u201cBut he\u2019s done this three or four times before,\u201d this person said. \u201cNothing is ever real until he sends the tweet.\u201d\n\n[In Paris, a relatively understated Trump finds he\u2019s still the center of the world\u2019s attention \u2014 and outrage]\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s flight to Washington from Paris, aides filed into the president\u2019s private cabin to lobby against the leading contender to replace Kelly, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff. These aides told Trump that appointing Ayers would lower staff morale and perhaps trigger an exodus. But the president has continued to praise Ayers, who also enjoys the support of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, according to multiple White House officials.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump shared her husband\u2019s irritation and impatience with some of the staff. On Tuesday, amid reports that the president had decided to oust deputy national security adviser Mira R. Ricardel over tensions between her and other administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office issued an extraordinary statement to reporters calling for her firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nMelania Trump said in an October interview with ABC News that the president had people working for him whom she did not trust and that she has let her husband know. \u201cSome people, they don\u2019t work there anymore,\u201d the first lady said.\n\n\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been trying to save the job of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nIn her role as No. 2 to national security adviser John Bolton, Ricardel berated colleagues in meetings, yelled at military aides and White House professional staff, argued with Melania Trump regarding her recent trip to Africa and spread rumors about Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, according to three current and two former White House officials.\n\nKelly has sought for months to oust Ricardel, calling her a problematic hire in the West Wing, and Mattis has told advisers that he wants her out as well, the officials said.\n\nA National Security Council spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nGrisham\u2019s statement was remarkable because it is so unusual for a first lady or her East Wing staff to weigh in on personnel matters elsewhere in the White House, particularly in the realm of national security.\n\nLast week, the tumult began even before Trump took off for Paris. After directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, controversy swirled around acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s qualifications for the job, business entanglements and previous public opposition to the Russia investigation.\n\n[\u2018When you lose that power\u2019: How John Kelly faded as White House disciplinarian]\n\nAs Trump walked out of the White House residence to board the Marine One helicopter on Friday morning, he paused to answer questions from the press corps and snapped when CNN correspondent Abby Phillip asked whether he wanted Whitaker to rein in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\n\u201cWhat a stupid question that is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d\n\nLater, aboard Air Force One, Trump again lost his cool, this time during his phone call with May. He berated the British prime minister on Iran, trade and Brexit, among other topics. The White House did not announce that the call took place nor did it provide an official readout, but U.S. and European officials said in interviews that Trump\u2019s mood was sour and his conversation with May was acrimonious.\n\nOn his flight there and throughout the weekend, Trump was preoccupied by political developments back in the United States. He watched TV with rapt attention as late-counting votes resulted in the Senate race in Arizona and a number of House contests to slip out of Republican hands, and as recounts got underway in Florida\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial races. He also complained about the lack of congressional funding for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump sent political aides in Washington scrambling to prepare detailed briefings for him on the still-to-be-called races. He aired baseless allegations of voter irregularities on Twitter \u2014 writing from the plane that elections attorney Marc Elias was the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbest Election stealing lawyer\u201d but that he would send \u201cmuch better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\u201d\n\nStill, the president told aides he felt disconnected from the action in his suite at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Paris \u2014 even as he consumed countless hours of television news on the trip.\n\n\u201cTrump needs adulation, so heading into the midterms, holding these rallies, he was cheered and it became narcissistic fuel to his engine,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cAfter the midterm, it\u2019s the sober dawn of the morning.\u201d\n\n\n\nRain pours on President Trump and his lectern with the presidential seal during the commemoration ceremony for Armistice Day at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in Paris on Nov. 11, 2018. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nTrump was awake Saturday well before dawn, if he got much sleep at all, tweeting at 4:52 a.m. Paris time a two-part defense of Whitaker as \u201chighly thought of\u201d and \u201coutstanding.\u201d Later in the day, he scuttled plans to attend a ceremony honoring the military sacrifice of World War I at an American cemetery outside the French capital, citing bad weather.\n\nTrump was told that morning by Deputy White House Chief of Staff Zachary D. Fuentes that the Secret Service had concerns about flying Marine One through the rain and fog from Paris to the cemetery 50 miles away, and that a motorcade could be lengthy and snarl traffic in the area, according to one senior White House official.\n\nTrump chose not to make the trip, and Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended in his stead.\n\nBut Trump quickly grew infuriated by a torrent of tweets and media coverage suggesting that the president was afraid of the rain and did not respect veterans.\n\n[Critics pile on after Trump cancels visit to U.S. military cemetery outside Paris, citing weather]\n\nFormer secretary of state John F. Kerry, a decorated Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, tweeted: \u201cPresident @realDonaldTrump a no-show because of raindrops? Those veterans the president didn\u2019t bother to honor fought in the rain, in the mud, in the snow \u2014 & many died in trenches for the cause of freedom. Rain didn\u2019t stop them & it shouldn\u2019t have stopped an American president.\u201d\n\nTrump told aides he thought he looked \u201cterrible\u201d and blamed his chief of staff\u2019s office, and Fuentes in particular, for not counseling him that skipping the cemetery visit would be a public-relations nightmare.\n\nTrump was still litigating the episode on Tuesday, when he tweeted from the White House that he suggested driving to the cemetery and \u201cSecret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, he got angry at Macron for his remarks at a ceremony honoring the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. The French president denounced rising nationalism around the world and called it a \u201cbetrayal of patriotism,\u201d with two of the world\u2019s leading nationalists \u2014 Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin \u2014 in attendance.\n\nTrump told advisers he considered Macron\u2019s comment a personal insult, and it came on the heels of a disagreement between the two leaders over Macron\u2019s call for a \u201ctrue European army.\u201d At their bilateral meeting on Saturday, Trump appeared subdued and almost sullen.\n\nOnce he was back home in Washington, Trump unloaded on his French counterpart, likening Macron\u2019s call for a European army to Germany\u2019s military expansion in World War I and World War II. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, \u201cHow did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d\n\nTrump also lashed out over trade agreements \u2014 \u201cNot fair, must change!\u201d he tweeted \u2014 that he argued make it easy for the United States to sell French wines but difficult for France to sell American wines.\n\nAnd then he attacked Macron for his unpopularity in France \u2014 while providing a bit of sloganeering advice.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe was just trying to get onto another subject.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe most diverse House freshman class in history convened Tuesday for the first time since last week\u2019s elections.\n\nBut of the two political parties\u2019 freshman gatherings, only one looked something like the country as a whole.\n\nThe incoming lawmakers \u2014 memorialized in a flier that circulated on Capitol Hill \u2014 are overwhelmingly white on the Republican side, with only one woman, while women and people of color are a majority of the newcomers on the Democratic side.\n\nAs the incoming members gathered at a hotel in Southeast Washington, several Democrats said they hoped that the diversity of their numbers would inform the party\u2019s approach to policy.\n\n\u201cIt brings a different perspective to the table,\u201d said Rep.-elect Kendra Horn (Okla.), the first Democratic woman elected to Congress from her state, adding: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be part of this new class that looks a lot more like our communities.\u201d\n\nThe freshmen were projected ahead of the election to be younger, more female and more racially diverse, the embodiment of a coalition that helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008. The new members include several firsts for Congress \u2014 the first Muslim women, the first Native American women and the first African American women from several states.\n\nThe diversity underscored a looming debate for Democrats ahead of 2020, when the party will choose its candidate to challenge President Trump. A large group of up-and-coming Democrats, including several women and minorities, have shown interest in presidential bids. Choosing a white man as the Democratic nominee would disappoint some of the party faithful.\n\nThe next Congress has already hit a long list of milestones. More than 100 women have been elected to the House, with 29-year-old Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) the youngest women to enter Congress. Many lawmakers of Latino or Asian heritage were elected or won fresh terms.\n\nThe Democratic gains were illustrated on the cover of the Nov. 19 issue of the New Yorker magazine, which depicted a room full of white men in outline as new political talents \u2014 drawn with detail in color \u2014 entered through the door.\n\nDave Wasserman, the House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, recently calculated that the percentage of white men as a share of House Democrats is \u201cset to decline from 41 percent to 38 percent as a result of the 2018 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the percentage of white men as a share of House Republicans is on track to rise from 86 percent to 90 percent,\u201d he tweeted Sunday.\n\nThe story for House Republicans is different, with the party losing several female members to retirement or higher office, including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), Lynn Jenkins (Kan.) and Gov.-elect Kristi L. Noem (S.D.).\n\nThe fate of two Republican women of color was uncertain late Tuesday, as Rep. Mia Love (Utah) trailed Democrat Ben McAdams in her suburban Salt Lake City district and Republican Young Kim, running for the House in Orange County, Calif., held a lead of roughly 2,000 votes over Democrat Gil Cisneros.\n\nNew members spent part of Tuesday in orientation, a multiday process that will teach them to find their way around Capitol Hill, run a congressional office and handle constituent casework.\n\nDemocrats, some seemingly overwhelmed by the crush of media attention, described wide-ranging policy priorities they hoped the party will focus on next year.\n\n\u201cHelping children and families, working on voting rights issues, working on criminal justice issues,\u201d said Rep.-elect Mary Gay Scanlon (Pa.).\n\n\u201cClimate change and renewable energy,\u201d said Rep.-elect Deb Haaland (N.M.), who is one of the first Native American women elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cHealth care and education,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Horn said.\n\nOther newly elected Democratic members will arrive in Congress already associated with certain policies.\n\nRep.-elect Lucy McBath (Ga.), a gun-control activist whose son was fatally shot six years ago, flipped a longtime Republican congressional seat outside Atlanta last week.\n\nThe younger bent of the incoming class was also on display, as Rep.-elect Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) arrived at the hotel carrying his infant son.\n\nOcasio-Cortez drew attention for joining a protest in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over climate change.\n\n\u201cShould Leader Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, we need to tell her that we\u2019ve got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than a hundred activists with the Sunrise Movement had streamed into Pelosi\u2019s office on Tuesday morning, delivering letters demanding that Pelosi commit to a Marshall Plan-size economic blueprint that would transition the country away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy.\n\nIt was not enough, they said, to simply reestablish the select committee on climate change. Many protesters wore shirts that read \u201c12 years,\u201d a reference to estimates that by 2030, it will be impossible to wind back the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cPelosi\u2019s plan on climate change is the equivalent of bringing a squirt gun to a raging drought-induced wildfire killing Americans right now,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movement\u2019s co-founder.\n\nOcasio-Cortez played down her own involvement.\n\n\u201cThis is not about me.

Instead, Green dribbled the ball upcourt and into traffic, failing to get a shot off as the game went to overtime. Durant was asked after Tuesday\u2019s win over the Atlanta Hawks if Green had taken things too far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna keep that in-house,\u201d said Durant, wearing a Redskins cap pulled low over his brow. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do here.

Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports reported that Green \u201cchallenged\u201d Durant about the latter\u2019s \u201cimpending free agency,\u201d and that the entire episode was \u201ca simmering issue for the Warriors\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski and Marc J. Spears of ESPN reported that witnesses described the ensuing locker room scene as \u201cone of the most intense of this Warriors era,\u201d although it never got physical. Klay Thompson surprised his teammates, per Haynes, when the usually quiet shooting guard addressed the room with a message about the importance of sticking together.\n\nBoth Kerr and Myers tamped down the notion that Durant\u2019s impending free agency this summer might have played a role in the incident or be affecting the locker room dynamics. Since arriving in Golden State as a free agent in 2016, Durant has passed up opportunities to sign long-term contracts and has instead chosen two-year deals with opt-out clauses after the first year. The nine-time all-star, who has earned back-to-back Finals MVP honors in leading the Warriors to consecutive NBA titles, is expected to again exercise the clause this summer and hit the market, although he may well end up staying with the Warriors.\n\nAsked Tuesday if Durant\u2019s possible departure in free agency was a \u201cfestering\u201d issue in the locker room, Myers said he did not think it was, instead pointing to how \u201chard\u201d it is to win championships and claiming, \u201cThat\u2019s all anybody\u2019s thinking about, because I think that\u2019s all you can think about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody ever talks about Kevin\u2019s free agency,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on this year.\u201d\n\nAs Anthony Slater of the Athletic pointed out Tuesday, though, that kind of ongoing contract situation caused stress and uncertainty in Cleveland when LeBron James continued to sign such deals rather than commit long-term to the Cavaliers. Nevertheless, most of the tension Monday, according to Slater, stemmed from Green\u2019s aggressive response to being questioned by teammates about his decision-making with the ball at the end of regulation.\n\nWhile making himself an indispensable member of the Warriors' dynasty, including another NBA title and a record 73-win season before Durant arrived, Green also has become known for his volatile, occasionally abrasive personality. Under Kerr, Golden State has been more than willing to try to manage that side of Green in exchange for his defensive and passing skills, as well as his overall intensity.\n\nESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe reported that some members of the Warriors organization were of a belief that Green \u201cwent too far\u201d on Monday, while other \u201care still shrugging this off.\u201d According to Sam Amick of the Athletic, Kerr made the decision to suspend Green for Tuesday\u2019s game. On Wednesday, the Warriors will try to move forward and Durant said he had no idea if the team\u2019s core would emerge stronger as it chases a third consecutive NBA title.\n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nNBA true or false: Will Jimmy Butler sink the 76ers, too?\n\nNets' Caris Levert should be back this season after suffering graphic-looking leg injury\n\nHave the Wizards turned a corner?

We concentrate on our own domestic issues and assume the rest of the world will remain fixed while we sort them out. We\u2019ll get back to you later \u2014 in 2021, say.\n\nBut the world moves on. It\u2019s dynamic, not static: Erratic changes in one country produce reactions in other countries. Alliances that once seemed solid become weaker and are recast; ambitious powers exploit new opportunities created by shifting dynamics; some countries rise, and others fall.\n\nLast weekend\u2019s events in Paris offered a dramatic demonstration that \u201cother things being equal\u201d is not a safe assumption. The world is moving to adapt to the reality that Donald Trump is president of the United States. Our friends and allies may hope his election eventually will be reversed, and maybe they think the United States turned a corner with the 2018 midterm elections. But they can\u2019t count on it, so these countries must consider that the United States may be a different country from what they had believed.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron articulated this reality last week. In one of his World War I remembrances, he told a French radio station that Europe needs a \u201ctrue European army\u201d at a time when the United States is a less reliable ally. \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\u201d Macron said.\n\nTrump blasted Macron\u2019s comments as \u201cvery insulting,\u201d and he continued to complain in tweets Tuesday about French ingratitude and claimed that Macron was trying to distract from his \u201cvery low\u201d approval ratings. But joining Macron on Tuesday was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who told the European parliament that she shared others\u2019 view that \u201ca common European army would show the world that there would never again be war in Europe.\u201d\n\nTrump set the NATO alliance wobbling from the day he took office, raising doubts about the United States\u2019 continued readiness to pay for other countries\u2019 defense. Europeans spent a year trying to make nice, but they seem to have gotten the message. The United States isn\u2019t a fully reliable protector anymore. Europeans indeed have to take greater responsibility for their defense \u2014 and depend less on a U.S.-led NATO. What Trump has done is folly, in my view, but it is precisely what he wanted.\n\nThe world is moving on, in other ways, from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d idea of U.S. power. Macron announced Monday the \u201cParis Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace.\u201d The document proposed a basic code of conduct to prevent interference in elections and other malicious hacking. It was backed by more than 50 countries, 90 nonprofits and 130 private companies, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and IBM. Absent from the list was the United States \u2014 along with Russia, China, Iran and Israel. Nice: the big five of cyberwar.\n\nBut the \u201cParis Call\u201d alliance of countries, corporations and nongovernmental organizations will probably move forward on cyberspace \u2014 just as a similar global coalition has remained intact to fight climate change, despite the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to participate.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s United States retreats from global diplomatic engagements, other opportunistic countries are stepping forward. The most obvious example is Russia. President Vladimir Putin may hold a weak hand, but he\u2019s in the game. Russia talks with everyone: Israel and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, the Taliban and the Afghan government. Putin may be a bully boy, but he\u2019s wearing a diplomat\u2019s pinstriped pants \u2014 sponsoring negotiations on Syria, Afghanistan and other issues. Once upon a time, America owned this role of global broker, but not anymore.\n\nThe greatest beneficiary of Trump\u2019s retreat is China, which openly proclaims its desire to challenge U.S. global primacy. A senior Australian official told me this week that everywhere Australia looks in Asia, it sees China seeking to find potential bases for its increasingly powerful military. Australia is one of the countries that has relied upon U.S. power, and officials still hope that\u2019s a good bet. But looking at Trump, they have to wonder.\n\nCommentators have noted that 1918 marked a global inflection point. After the horror of World War I, empires collapsed, aristocracies faded, aggrieved citizens challenged and eventually toppled the old order. Another transitional year was 1945, which began a half-century of overwhelming American global dominance.\n\nThe United States suffered a political hiccup in 2016, electing a man who was manifestly unprepared to be president. Most of the world hopes we\u2019ll find our balance again, but in the meantime, they must consider making other arrangements.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Anne Gearan", "title": "Trump names retired general John Abizaid to be ambassador to Saudi Arabia", "description": "The diplomatic post has been vacant throughout Trump\u2019s presidency.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-names-retired-general-john-abizaid-to-be-ambassador-to-saudi-arabia/2018/11/13/ccf62336-e79d-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:49:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "President Trump announced Tuesday that he will nominate retired Army Gen.

Turkey, where Washington Post contributing columnist Khashoggi was killed last month, also has no U.S. ambassador.\n\nAbizaid, best known from his time overseeing the Iraq War, is now a consultant and a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. His selection emphasizes the importance Trump has placed on the military partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a major customer for U.S. arms.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to disrupt arms sales in protest of Khashoggi\u2019s death but has promised unspecified consequences for Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.\n\nSaudi leaders initially denied any involvement by the kingdom in the death, but now acknowledge it was premeditated.

Currently, a career State Department diplomat is in charge at the embassy.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration launched a public pressure campaign urging Saudi Arabia to end the conflict in Yemen amid growing opposition in Congress to U.S. military support for the kingdom\u2019s war there.\n\nPompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for an end to more than three years of conflict between Houthi rebels and a government recognized by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the West. U.N. officials have warned that the war has left half the population of Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, on the precipice of famine.\n\nIf confirmed, Abizaid would succeed Joseph Westphal, a former Pentagon official chosen by President Barack Obama.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Abizaid was tapped in 2016 to advise Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak. The Pentagon said at the time that the retired general would offer advice as Ukraine sought to reform and modernize its armed forces to more closely resemble Western militaries found in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nAbizaid rose through the ranks to become the four-star chief of U.S. Central Command in July 2003, putting him in the position of overseeing the Iraq War a few months after the United States invaded and Baghdad fell. Over the next four years, he oversaw the conflict and operations in more than two dozen other countries, including Saudi Arabia, as insurgent violence escalated and the United States faced scandals including the abuse of detainees by U.S. soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.\n\nMore recently, Abizaid has advocated that the United States take a leading role in setting global norms for how drones are used by military forces and called for more transparency by the Pentagon involving them.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 drone policies damage its credibility, undermine the rule of law and create a potentially destabilizing international precedent \u2014 one that repressive regimes around the globe will undoubtedly exploit,\u201d he wrote in a 2014 opinion piece along with former Pentagon official Rosa Brooks. \u201cAs lethal drones proliferate, the future imagined above is becoming all too likely.\u201d\n\nAbizaid also has called for the United States to find moderate centers of power in the Middle East and work with them, taking an active role there overall.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to stand for something instead of saying it\u2019s all up to them,\u201d he said in a 2015 speech at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cWe have to make ourselves reliable.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Anne Gearan", "title": "Trump refuses to acknowledge the fraught history of nationalism", "description": "Nursing a grudge after a public shaming in France, the president lashes out.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-refuses-to-acknowledge-the-fraught-history-of-nationalism/2018/11/13/35fd0694-e76a-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vZpm5daHpzisDkpkpMkrUILtG5A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KRZ4ZNHHUMI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:47:26Z", "content": "President Trump took a peevish tone Tu esday as he revisited complaints about French President Emmanuel Macron, who used a weekend commemoration of the end of World War I to warn the president during his visit to Paris of the perils of the nationalist label h\u2026 [+5988 chars]", "fulltext": "President Trump speaks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Nov. 10, prior to their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump took a peevish tone Tuesday as he revisited complaints about French President Emmanuel Macron, who used a weekend commemoration of the end of World War I to warn the president during his visit to Paris of the perils of the nationalist label he embraces and to suggest he has a lot to learn about history.\n\nMacron called nationalism a dangerous trap and the opposite of patriotism while invoking the bloodiest episodes of 20th-century European history.\n\nBut Trump has shown little patience for the lesson Macron tried to impart or the two days of praise the young French leader has received since his not-so-veiled criticism of his U.S. counterpart.\n\nInstead, Trump, who once avoided calling himself a nationalist, flaunted his embrace of the term and suggested that Macron do the same while arguing the French president was criticizing him to distract from his poor poll numbers.\n\n\u201cBy the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. He followed up with \u201cMAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nThe taunts on Twitter showed again that Trump refuses to entertain arguments about the baggage that nationalism carries or show any signs that he is troubled by the historical antecedents to the rise of Nazism in Europe and its overlap with modern racists who call themselves \u201cwhite nationalists.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in his tweetstorm against Macron, Trump invoked the Nazi march across Europe \u2014 the very event the French president had warned of when he spoke about nationalism.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nFrench Ambassador G\u00e9rard Araud corrected Trump to note that Macron had not suggested that Europe needs defending against the United States, just that it should not assume it can rely on its ally, and added some advice for anyone cheering Trump on.\n\n\u201cYou should listen to Europe that has bred two WW and a genocide in two generations,\u201d Araud wrote on Twitter, referring to World War I and World War II. \u201cNationalism is dangerous. Subject to miscalculation and misperception, it always carries the risk of conflict. Patriotism and cooperation.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to define his brand of nationalism as a form of patriotism devoid of the darker aspects his critics warn the term conjures.\n\n\u201cIt means I love the country, it means I\u2019m fighting for the country,\u201d Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during an Oct. 29 interview, adding that he feels no need to clarify what he means by the term. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this country and I call that \u2018nationalism.\u2019 I call it being a nationalist and I don\u2019t see any other connotation than that.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the terminology fits his political brand of anti-elitism, said University of Washington historian Margaret O\u2019Mara. It\u2019s similar to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d slogan he has trumpeted since his presidential campaign, always shrugging off criticism about whether he was nodding to anti-immigrant fervor and isolationism.\n\n\u201cMy inclination is that he does not really know the history because he\u2019s, self-admitted, not a big book reader and not someone who marinates in this stuff,\u201d O\u2019Mara said. \u201cTrump may or may not be thinking about Lindbergh when he talks, but it\u2019s very effective for the political base he\u2019s trying to reach \u2014 positioning himself as the adversary of these global elites, against internationalism.\u201d\n\nAviator Charles Lindbergh, who wrote about \u201cEuropean blood\u201d as the most precious American commodity, became the spokesman for a nativist, nationalist, antiwar movement called the America First Committee, which sought to keep the United States out of World War II. It was never a far leap from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda and the \u201cnationalist\u201d label, but Trump had not made such a direct link before the midterm election campaign.\n\nBoth terms hark back to dark periods of American history, and \u201cnationalism\u201d has become the preferred term for some white-power activists.\n\nCampaigning in Houston on Oct. 23, Trump tried out the term.\n\n\u201cThey have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned, it\u2019s called a nationalist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018Really, we\u2019re not supposed to use that word.\u2019 You know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist, okay? I\u2019m a nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word. Use that word.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the term was cheered by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who tweeted that Trump was really referring to white nationalism.\n\n\u201cThere is no ethnic or racial group in America more Nationalist than White Americans,\u201d Duke wrote.\n\nTrump says he is not a racist and does not endorse the views of Duke or others who call themselves white nationalists. But using the term is encouragement to those views, and it speaks to a rejection of the caution and centrism that past presidents have tended to adopt as they settled into the job, said Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University.\n\n\u201cI generally see a progression on the part of the president to becoming more reckless, to really articulate controversial, outlandish things without regard to the consequences,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cThe more outlandish things he says, the more cheers he gets at his rallies and that\u2019s what he cares about.\u201d\n\nTrump has had to contend before with the uncomfortable overlap between his message and political base and racism. During the 2016 campaign, Trump reposted a Twitter message from someone called \u201cWhiteGenocideTM.\u201d As president, Trump was criticized for equivocating about the culpability of white-power activists whose rally in Charlottesville ended in the death of a counterprotester.\n\nNicholas J. Fuentes, a white nationalist YouTube personality who attended that \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in 2017, live-tweeted election results as Democrats won control of the House on Nov. 6. He praised Trump and criticized national Republican leaders he views as too moderate or timid.\n\n\u201cThe next two years will be tough but not impossible,\u201d Fuentes wrote. \u201cHopefully this will be a wake up call [for Republicans] and most importantly Trump that the Heritage agenda just won\u2019t win elections anymore. We have to fully embrace populist-nationalism or we\u2019ll fail.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Sean Sullivan", "title": "Key contests in Florida and Georgia remain mired in uncertainty amid expanding legal fights over ballot counts", "description": "A slew of new lawsuits could further prolong the vote count in both states.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/key-contests-in-florida-and-georgia-remain-mired-in-uncertainty-amid-expanding-legal-fights-over-ballot-counts/2018/11/13/b863cc66-e752-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:46:28Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "One week after Election Day, high-stakes contests in Florida and Georgia remained mired in uncertainty amid expanding legal fights and political wrangling that could further prolong the counting of ballots.\n\nIn Florida, where elections officials are conducting machine recounts in the races for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner, Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a suit in federal court Tuesday evening seeking to extend the deadline to finish the count in all 67 counties.Separately, Nelson and the state party went to court to try to loosen the rules for a manual recount as both parties braced for the ultra-close Senate race to come down to a hand inspection of ballots.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Florida elections officials to take as much time as they need to tally votes, even if they blow past a key deadline. He also demanded that Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is narrowly ahead of Nelson in the Senate race, recuse himself from the recount. Scott\u2019s campaign swiftly rejected that notion, which is the subject of a suit expected to be heard in federal court this week.\n\nIn Georgia, a federal judge late Monday barred the secretary of state\u2019s office from immediately certifying the state election results there to give voters a chance to address questions about their provisional ballots \u2014 a move that further prolongs the hard-fought Georgia governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nAnd from Maine to California and in between, 10 House races were still unresolved \u2014 leaving the size of the Democrats\u2019 majority undetermined as new lawmakers reported to Capitol Hill for orientation.\n\nThe unsettled races extended the intense partisan combat that gripped the country during this year\u2019s campaigns.\n\n\n\nMiami-Dade Election Center supervisors recount ballots Monday. (C.M. Guerrero/AP)\n\nIn Florida, the Senate race will determine the size of the GOP\u2019s majority in 2019 and shape the power structure in the nation\u2019s largest swing state. Elections officials face a deadline of 3 p.m. Thursday to complete machine recounts of three statewide races. Observers expect the margins in the Senate and agriculture commissioner contests to remain narrow enough after the machine counts to trigger hand recounts.\n\nThe suit filed by Nelson on Tuesday aims to stop the state canvassing board from certifying the results before all 67 counties complete their machine and manual recounts. In their filing, Democrats noted that officials in Palm Beach County have said it may be impossible to meet the deadlines.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, announced that vote-counting machines had overheated and stopped working \u2014 requiring staff to redo a recount of 174,900 early-vote ballots that took a day and a half to get through the first time.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the mechanical problems,\u201d Bucher said. \u201cWe\u2019re working 24/7 to get the job done.\u201d\n\nThe defendants of the latest suit by Democrats include the members of the Florida Elections Canvassing Commission, which is required to certify the final results by Nov. 20. Under Florida law, if local officials fail to meet that deadline, the state will certify the previously reported, pre-recount totals.\n\n\u201cThis process is about one thing \u2014 making sure that every legal ballot is counted and protecting the right of every Floridian to participate in our democracy. And that is to have their ballot counted and to count as they intended,\u201d Nelson told reporters in Washington.\n\nStanding next to Nelson, Schumer said officials \u201cshould have all the time they need to count every Floridian\u2019s ballot, to make sure the candidate with the most votes is actually seated in January, even if the vote count has to go beyond Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like @SenBillNelson is cutting out the middle man and letting @ChuckSchumer speak directly for him,\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign said on Twitter. \u201cChuck - we won\u2019t let DC lawyers and N.Y. senators steal this election from the people of Florida.\u201d\n\nTim Cerio, an attorney for Scott, said on a call with reporters that \u201cthe idea that deadlines don\u2019t matter in elections is an in\u00adcred\u00adibly partisan and irresponsible comment.\u201d\n\nThere is also building tension in Georgia, where Abrams is hoping to force a runoff with Kemp, who is leading by about 59,000 votes in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nTuesday was the deadline for Georgia\u2019s 159 counties to finalize their election results, and the secretary of state had planned to certify them Wednesday. But U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg said late Monday that the secretary of state\u2019s office could not do so before Friday and had to \u201cimmediately establish and publicize on its website a secure and free-access hotline or website for provisional ballot voters to access to determine whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, the reason why.\u201d\n\n[Federal judge delays certification of Georgia election results, citing concerns over provisional ballots]\n\nKemp, who resigned as secretary of state late last week and declared victory, said there are not enough outstanding votes to keep him from winning. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters that as of Tuesday, Abrams needed 20,595 votes to force a runoff and 18,259 to initiate a recount.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office has reported that 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the Nov. 6 election.\n\nThe Republican advantage in the Senate race in Florida is even slimmer. Scott led Nelson by fewer than 13,000 votes after the initial count, or 0.15 percent. A margin of 0.25 percent or smaller would trigger a manual recount.\n\nThe Senate election has caught the attention of President Trump, who leveled another unsubstantiated allegation Tuesday against administrators in Broward and Palm Beach counties and suggested Nelson should bow out.\n\n\u201cThe characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u2018find\u2019 enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments marked the latest attempt by Republicans, including Scott, to try to undermine confidence in the process. But state officials said they have seen no signs of criminal activity or fraud in the vote tallying.\n\nThe recount kicked off over the weekend in many Florida counties. But Broward, the state\u2019s second-most-populous county, began counting ballots only Tuesday morning. Republicans have complained about the pace in the Democratic stronghold.\n\nAbout midday at the Broward elections office in Lauderhill, Joe D\u2019Alessandro, director of election planning and development, carried in five bins of recounted ballots with \u201cunder votes\u201d and \u201cover votes,\u201d to be set aside for closer scrutiny in the event of a hand recount.\n\nOn those ballots, voters did not choose a candidate or chose more than one. The chair of the canvassing board, Broward Judge Betsy Benson, instructed him to put the bins in a corner \u201cwhere they will always be in public view.\u201d She asked whether more bins would be coming.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot more,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro replied.\n\nBy midafternoon, Broward County had finished recounting early votes. But it still had more than 400,000 ballots left to tally.\n\n\u201cWe will complete the recount,\u201d said Brenda Snipes, the elections supervisor in Broward County. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a deadline that we\u2019ve missed.\u201d\n\nAsked about the latest attack from Trump, Snipes said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a treasure trove for going out digging on the beach somewhere to find any votes.\u201d She said she had never met Trump \u201cother than seeing him from television, and he hasn\u2019t met me.\u201d\n\nAfter Snipes noted that she was appointed to replace another black woman who was removed from office, she was asked whether she thought her race was a factor in the criticism of her management. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard to rule out,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she hinted that she is not likely to run for reelection in 2020. \u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d said Snipes, a Democrat.\n\nSeveral pro-Trump Facebook pages and one Twitter account on Monday posted the home address and phone number of Snipes \u2014 a tactic called \u201cdoxing\u201d that often is a step toward harassment of people in the public spotlight and is prohibited by Facebook, Twitter and most other online platforms.\n\n[As recount politics heat up, two Florida election officials are the targets of online harassment]\n\nFacebook confirmed Tuesday that it had removed personal information about Snipes after the incident was reported to the company. Twitter declined to comment. Two tweets from an account visible Tuesday morning were deleted by noon.\n\nIn neighboring Miami-Dade County, the most populous in the state, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Monday he was \u201cvery confident we\u2019re going to get this done on time.\u201d\n\nBut several variables could complicate the recount \u2014 most notably the mounting legal disputes.\n\nOne of the new suits filed by Democrats on Tuesday seeks to widen the latitude of canvassers to determine voter intent when and if they start examining ballots manually.\n\nIn another case, a court Wednesday will hear a request from Nelson to count absentee and provisional ballots that were not tallied because voters\u2019 signatures did not match their voter registration records \u2014 which could affect as many as 4,000 absentee ballots.\n\nSeparately, Scott withdrew his lawsuit against Palm Beach County seeking to impound the election equipment not in use for the recount, a day after a judge denied a similar request in Broward County.\n\nWhile Scott has been a vocal critic of Democrats during the recount, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis has been much quieter. DeSantis, a close Trump ally, has a more comfortable margin over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). Democrats and Republicans are not anticipating a hand recount in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nCongressional officials were also keeping tabs on the House races that have yet to be called. They include contests in Maine\u2019s sprawling 2nd District, where Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R) filed a lawsuit rejecting the state\u2019s tabulation of ranked-choice ballots, and a pair of Republican-held districts in California where the GOP candidates were narrowly ahead but losing ground. In Utah, Rep. Mia Love (R) trailed her Democratic opponent, though her deficit narrowed Tuesday.\n\nSullivan reported from Tallahassee, Reinhard from Lauderhill, Williams from Washington and Rozsa from Riviera Beach, Fla.

(David Longstreath, File/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 The death of a 13-year-old boy who was knocked out during a kickboxing match in Thailand has sparked debate over whether to ban matches involving children.\n\nThe death of Anucha Tasako came after a Muay Thai \u2014 Thai boxing \u2014 match Saturday in the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn. The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand\u2019s Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\u201cThis would have a major impact on the industry,\u201d Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \u201cThose who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\u201d he said. \u201cWe call it \u2018boxing bones.\u2019 You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\u201d\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened before and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn\u2019t quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn\u2019t have a doctor on standby, which shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha\u2019s death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Courtesy Virginia Tech) (Courtesy of Virginia Tech)\n\nVirginia Tech plans to build a $1 billion graduate campus within walking distance of Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in Northern Virginia, the keystone in an expansion of technology education in the state designed to lure the company to the region and then to address the long-term impact of Amazon\u2019s decision.\n\nVirginia Tech\u2019s president, Tim Sands, called it a watershed moment for the school, one that will drive economic development in Virginia. It\u2019s also a moment of change for other universities in the commonwealth.\n\nThe Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be the most visible sign of that shift, with a 1 million-square-foot campus in Alexandria expected to educate hundreds of graduate students. But an infusion of money and an anticipated increase in demand for technology education is expected to be felt at schools across Virginia.\n\nThe pitch for Amazon\u2019s headquarters included a statewide investment to double the annual number of graduates with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science and related fields, according to a Tuesday announcement by Gov. Ralph Northam (D). That commitment is expected to yield an additional 25,000 to 35,000 graduates over the next two decades.\n\nAt George Mason University, an institute will be created to focus on digital innovation, and a new school of computing will be established. More than 5,000 students are enrolled in its computing programs, but with the Amazon decision the school expects the number of students seeking such degrees to triple.\n\nThe commonwealth has committed up to $125 million over the next 20 years to expand George Mason\u2019s Arlington campus with an emphasis on research and graduate education in technology, according to university officials. The school will match that figure.\n\n\u201cThis is a watershed moment that is going to really rebrand Greater Washington and Virginia as a hub of information technology,\u201d George Mason President \u00c1ngel Cabrera said. \u201cThis puts us on the map in a really major way.\u201d\n\nJames E. Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, said in a statement Tuesday that U-Va. is looking forward to working with Amazon and other universities in Virginia. U-Va. has been expanding its programs in Northern Virginia over the past decade and plans to do even more.\n\n\n\nA rendering of the planned Innovation Campus. (Courtesy of Virginia Tech)\n\nSands said Virginia Tech had been working on the idea of an innovation campus for about four years, but a little over a year ago, state officials asked the university to lead a higher-education package that would be part of the region\u2019s bid to Amazon. That accelerated the process \u2014 especially with a $250 million funding commitment from the commonwealth.\n\nVirginia Tech will match that, with the remaining cost of the campus covered by private donations, industry partnerships and other revenue streams.\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech President Tim Sands. (Jim Stroup)\n\nThe Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be focused on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics.\n\nNext year, the first 100 students are expected to begin studying in a temporary space, but within five years, the university envisions 500 students on the campus. Ultimately, Virginia Tech expects to have 750 master\u2019s degree candidates and hundreds of doctoral candidates and postdoctoral fellows enrolled.\n\nSands said he expects a significant amount of money to be committed toward expanding enrollment in tech fields at many campuses in Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be scaling up significantly to meet the new challenge,\" he said.\n\nDavid J. Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and former president of Cornell University, compared the innovation campus to the Cornell Tech project he helped launch in New York. Cornell Tech \"reinvented graduate tech education for the digital age and is further energizing the start-up culture in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled Virginia Tech\u2019s leaders have stepped up to create a similar innovation hub.\u201d\n\nSheila Martin, vice president of economic development and community engagement for the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said she wasn\u2019t surprised Amazon picked Northern Virginia and New York as the locations for new headquarters, because a company like Amazon is dependent on a high-skills workforce and the research that comes out of universities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a validation of the fact that universities are drivers of the growth and innovation in our economy,\u201d she said.

(Gregory Bull/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans arrived in Tijuana by the hundreds Wednesday, getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border.\n\nSeveral hundred people from the caravan got off buses and made their way to a shelter on the Mexican side near the border to line up for food. Doctors checked those fighting colds and other ailments while several dozen migrants, mostly single men, spent the night at a Tijuana beach that is cut by a towering border wall of metal bars.\n\nSeveral Border Patrol agents in San Diego watched them through the barrier separating the U.S. and Mexico. American troops carrying machine guns stood near the agents next to recently installed concertina wire atop a stretch of the barrier.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nMany of the new arrivals were waiting in Tijuana to make their next step to enter in the U.S., either by illegally crossing the border or by seeking asylum at a port of entry.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first arrivals generally received a warm welcome from Tijuana, despite the fact that its shelter system to house migrants is at capacity. The city\u2019s secretary of economic development has said there are about 3,000 jobs for migrants who want to stay in the city. Some residents came down to where the men were camped on a beach and gave them tacos to eat Wednesday.\n\nThe Central Americans in the caravan are the latest migrants to arrive in Tijuana with the hope of crossing into the United States. Tijuana shelters in 2016 housed Haitians who came by the thousands after making their way from Brazil with plans to get to the U.S. Since then, several thousand Haitians have remained in Tijuana, finding work. Some have married local residents and enrolled in local universities.\n\n\u201cMexico has been excellent; we have no complaint about Mexico. The United States remains to be seen,\u201d said Josue Vargas, a migrant from Honduras who finally pulled into Tijuana on Wednesday after more than a month on the road.\n\nDouglas Matute, 38, of Honduras, said he arrived Wednesday in a convoy of nine buses. Matute, who joined the caravan with his brother to flee violence and poverty, said he heard rumors that Canada and European countries would offer work visas and said he was also holding out hope that the U.S. Congress would pave the way for him to legally enter the country. Until a clearer picture emerged, he said, he would stay in Tijuana and wouldn\u2019t attempt to cross the border illegally.\n\nA few people pitched tents at the Tijuana beach plaza while most, like Henry Salinas, 30, of Honduras, planned to sleep there in the open.\n\nHe said that he intended to wait for thousands more in the caravan to arrive and that he hoped to jump the fence in a large group at the same time, overwhelming Border Patrol agents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. ... All against Trump, and Trump against all,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a couple of dozen migrants scaled the steel border fence to celebrate their arrival, chanting \u201cYes, we could!\u201d One man dropped over to the U.S. side briefly as border agents watched from a distance. He ran quickly back to the fence.\n\nTijuana\u2019s head of migrant services, Cesar Palencia Chavez, said authorities offered to take the migrants to shelters immediately, but they initially refused.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to stay together in a single shelter,\u201d Palencia Chavez said, \u201cbut at this time that\u2019s not possible\u201d because shelters are designed for smaller groups and generally offer separate facilities for men, women and families.\n\nBut he said that after their visit to the border, most were taken to shelters in groups of 30 or 40.\n\nOn Wednesday, buses and trucks carried some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and farther northward into the border state of Sonora.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante in the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the state government, the Roman Catholic Church and city officials in Escuinapa, Sinaloa, were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest said the church had been able to get \u201cgood people\u201d to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-hour drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nSmall groups were also reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a stadium in Mexico City, where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States. Referring to the first group nearing the end of the journey, Pineda said, \u201cif they could do it, there is no reason why we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum and work visas to the migrants, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat reported in Tijuana, Mexico, and AP writer Maria Verza reported from Escuinapa, Mexico.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The 13-member selection committee sustained its professionalism and refused any temptation for mischief when it flew to Dallas-Fort Worth, spent hours meeting and ruminating, then dispensed a top 10 identical to that of last week.\n\nThat surpassed the flatlining week of Nov. 25, 2014, when the committee kept the top seven teams constant from Nov. 18, the previous frivolous record.\n\nThis time, as with that time, Alabama remained No. 1, a position it has held for 15 of the 28 weeks since the concept of a four-team playoff and the weekly rankings leading to it began with the 2014-15 season. In its heyday of heydays this decade, the Crimson Tide (10-0) has appeared in the top four in 24 of the 28 listings across five seasons, and in 24 of the past 25.\n\nFamiliarity insisted at No. 2 as well, when Clemson (10-0) stayed there as it has for all three rankings weeks this season. The Tigers\u2019 27-7 win at then-No. 17 Boston College on Saturday couldn\u2019t quite boost them past Alabama, and its 24-0 home win against then-No. 16 Mississippi State. Clemson has appeared in the top four in 21 of the 28 listings and in all of the past 21.\n\nFrom there, as with last week, came two teams that played each other on Sept. 1: No. 3 Notre Dame (10-0) and No. 4 Michigan (9-1). The Fighting Irish will have a chance to put some cement on that ranking Saturday when they head to the Bronx to play Syracuse (8-2), which climbed a notch to No. 12.\n\n[As football conference championship races wind down, which ones matter?]\n\nMichigan remained ahead of No. 5 Georgia (9-1) in a case of two teams with identical records and similar CVs. \u201cMichigan has a very strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d committee chairman Rob Mullens, the athletic director at Oregon, said in a conference call. \u201cThey\u2019ve won nine games in a row. Their only loss was to the No. 3-ranked team\u201d way back in the first weekend. He cited the Wolverines\u2019 No. 1 defense alongside its wins at No. 22 Northwestern, at previously ranked Michigan State and at home against No. 14 Penn State.\n\nHe also cited Georgia\u2019s surge since it got ransacked on Oct. 13 at LSU, a recovery featuring wins over No. 13 Florida, the highest three-loss team on the list, No. 17 Kentucky and previously ranked Auburn.\n\nNone of the top 10 teams lost last week, a rare turn of calm in a sport often beloved for its turbulence. The highest-ranked team to lose was No. 11 Kentucky, which fell to No. 17 and to 7-3 because it lost at its eternal nemesis, Tennessee. Beyond that, the only teams to lose to anyone beneath them were No. 14 North Carolina State, No. 21 Iowa and No. 23 Fresno State.\n\nThe committee omitted those from its list but proved more forgiving to No. 16 Mississippi State and No. 17 Boston College, dropping them to Nos. 21 and 20, respectively. The previous teams at Nos. 18 and 24, Michigan State and Auburn, also lost to higher-ranked teams but vanished.\n\n[These college football teams are displaying the art of the in-season turnaround]\n\nKentucky\u2019s loss caused another rankings milestone by enabling Central Florida (9-0) to slide upward to No. 11. That became the highest ranking to date for any team from the second tier of the top rung of the sport, known as the Group of Five. It bested the No. 12 with which an unbeaten UCF finished last season, and the No. 12 it had held down the first two weeks of this season, much to its ambitious chagrin.\n\n\u201cSimilar to past weeks,\u201d Mullens said of the UCF considerations. \u201cObviously we saw their game against Navy and the win. Obviously their offense continues to perform, [quarterback] McKenzie Milton\u2019s a special talent, but the strength of schedule continues to be part of the discussion, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re No. 11.\u201d\n\nAfter ranking only two Group of Five teams in its first two lists, the committee did bring four into the light this week: UCF, No. 23 Utah State (9-1), No. 24 Cincinnati (9-1) and No. 25 Boise State (8-2). The top-ranked Group of Five team at the end of the season receives a bid into a major New Year\u2019s Six bowl.\n\n[Saturday\u2019s winners and losers: Bedlam, Northwestern and a lot of chalk]\n\nSitting outside the top four were No. 5 Georgia (9-1), No. 6 Oklahoma (9-1), No. 7 LSU (8-2), No. 8 Washington State (9-1), No. 9 West Virginia (8-1) and No. 10 Ohio State (9-1). Four of those six \u2014 Georgia, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Ohio State \u2014 figure to have remaining chances for emphatic statements. Georgia already has clinched passage to play Alabama in the SEC title game of Dec. 1. Oklahoma and West Virginia have a date with each other in Morgantown, W.Va., on the night after Thanksgiving, which they will reach after Oklahoma plays at home against Kansas and West Virginia visits Oklahoma State.

(Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News)\n\nPresident Trump is leaning in favor of backing a measure that would reform U.S. sentencing laws \u2014 a compromise drafted by the Senate that marks a significant overhaul of the criminal justice system by easing some mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related and other crimes.\n\nBut Trump did not commit one way or the other on the pending legislation, which he was briefed on Tuesday by senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, who has taken on criminal justice reform as one of his core issues.\n\nThat meeting at the White House was described by two people with knowledge of it. One person said Trump is a \u201csoft yes\u201d on the bill, but signaled that he wants more law enforcement groups to publicly support the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is not a 100 percent done deal,\u201d according to the second person briefed on the short meeting. No lawmakers attended, but White House officials later briefed congressional leadership.\n\nKushner is pressing Trump to offer formal support of the bill this week, according to a White House official. The White House has organized a criminal justice reform event for 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to two congressional officials, although it was still unclear whether Trump will explicitly endorse the legislation.\n\nThe criminal justice overhaul, scaled back from its initial ambitious Senate draft but vastly more comprehensive than legislation the House passed this year, could be one of the most significant and bipartisan laws signed by Trump in his first two years in office.\n\nOpponents of the overhaul push lost a high-ranking ally when Jeff Sessions, who opposed any initiative to relax sentencing laws, resigned as attorney general last week.\n\n\u201cI talked to the president last night,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a vocal supporter of the sentencing measure who has Trump\u2019s ear, said Tuesday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic than I am now, but we\u2019re not there yet. . . . He seemed supportive last night.\u201d\n\nThe compromise criminal justice measure, which was hammered out in principle this summer, adds four provisions to a House-passed bill that focused on reducing prisoner recidivism and did not include the more controversial sentencing changes.\n\nThe new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree-strike\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats.\n\nIt also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. The latter also would not apply to people already sentenced for these crimes.\n\nThe agreement also lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more types of cases.\n\nOne new addition since the August negotiations is language that would bar prisoners who had been convicted of certain fentanyl offenses \u2014 primarily those that involved five- and 10-year mandatory minimums \u2014 from being able to receive credit for time served, according to two officials familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe addition is significant because Trump told Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a close ally and avowed opponent of the emerging criminal justice measure, that he disagrees with allowing early prison release for fentanyl dealers, and the tentative agreement could have done so. Another section of the earlier measure could have allowed fentanyl dealers to earn time credits.\n\nThose revisions prompted the Fraternal Order of Police to endorse the compromise, calling it a bill that will \u201cmake our streets and neighborhoods safer,\u201d better protect police officers and \u201cimprove the ability of our criminal justice system to effectively rehabilitate offenders.\u201d\n\nFurther giving advocates hope, the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association \u2014 which has opposed previous versions of the sentencing measure \u2014 has been quiet on the compromise.\n\nIn the White House meeting Tuesday, Trump was pleased that so many different law enforcement groups had signed on to support it, according to one of those briefed on the meeting. But Trump reservations because many conservatives lawmakers remain opposed, advisers said.\n\n\u201cHe is really concerned he\u2019s going to be seen as soft on crime,\u201d one person said. \u201cHe really cares that law enforcement supports him politically.\u201d\n\nThe individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private conversations.\n\nSeveral people involved in the negotiations cautioned Tuesday that the emerging agreement needs an explicit endorsement from Trump to proceed. Supporters of the bill would begin gauging support for the bill later this week, officials said, if Trump signs off on the measure.\n\n\u201cSince those are negotiations that are going on, I can\u2019t comment on anything until we get a final product and get some word from the White House,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), one of the bill\u2019s chief authors, said Tuesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has been quiet on the merits of the legislation, appears unlikely to take the lead in formally rounding up support, however. And some liberal Democrats may not ultimately endorse the compromise product, fearing they have conceded too much to the right on the sentencing changes.\n\n\u201cI have not signed off on it,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a prominent Democratic supporter of the initial, more wide-ranging Senate legislation. \u201cI\u2019m still dealing with the details.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump picks retired general for ambassador to Saudi Arabia", "description": "A retired four-star general is President Donald Trump's pick to be U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-picks-retired-general-for-ambassador-to-saudi-arabia/2018/11/13/bb4242f8-e7a4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T00:38:29Z", "content": "WASHINGTON A retired four-star general is President Donald Trumps pick to be U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, filling a key diplomatic vacancy at a time when U.S.-Saudi relations are being tested by the slaying of a journalist critical of the Saudi royal fami\u2026 [+1555 chars]", "fulltext": "FILE - In this Dec. 10, 2007 file photo, retired Army Gen.

Well, North Korea is also in no rush. After Mr. Trump\u2019s showy June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear materials production, missile operating sites and brutal concentration camps are all still grinding along.\n\nIt is true that North Korea has not tested a missile or an atomic bomb lately. But nor has it been idle. In a report published on Monday, Beyond Parallel, a project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, documented with satellite imagery 13 North Korean missile operating bases, and perhaps as many as 20, that have been undeclared by the government. The disclosure is another reminder that North Korea has rebuffed the U.S. demand for a complete inventory of its nuclear weapons programs, while insisting the United States make a full declaration of the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War. Mr. Kim is a wily negotiator. In September, he pledged to \u201cpermanently dismantle\u201d a missile engine test site, a mere fraction of the missile and nuclear weapons complex that is still running at full steam, including the newly disclosed sites, such as Sakkanmol, which handles short-range missiles and is located about 50 miles north of the demilitarized zone.\n\nSince the summit, Mr. Trump has swooned in unseemly fashion that \u201cwe fell in love\u201d when Mr. Kim wrote to him: \u201cNo, really \u2014 he wrote me beautiful letters, and they\u2019re great letters.\u201d In fact, while Mr. Kim has focused on a rapprochement with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, the Trump approach to slowing North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons systems appears to be at an impasse. A meeting scheduled for Nov. 8 between North Korean officials and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fell apart. Mr. Kim, like his father, is well versed in the tools of deception, delay, threat and extortion. He is proving it once again, to the detriment of Mr. Trump \u2014 and global security.\n\nMeanwhile, the human rights catastrophe in North Korea is unaddressed. Four years ago, a United Nations commission of inquiry found \u201csystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations\u201d by North Korea, including \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d perpetrated by the state. Now, the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, said, \u201cThe human rights situation at the moment has not changed on the ground in North Korea despite the important progress on security, peace and prosperity.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat is needed from North Korea is a signal that they will discuss human rights . . . . We haven\u2019t heard anything coming from the summits in this respect.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, the world was shocked to discover North Korea had one, then six, nuclear weapons. The number is now probably in the dozens. Tens of thousands of people are suffering in brutal prison camps.

While votes are still being counted, Democrats are on track to win anywhere from 35 to 40 seats \u2014 their biggest single pickup since the post-\n\nWatergate election of 1974.\n\nMany Democrats credit Pelosi, 78, whose hefty fundraising and disciplined message on health care propelled the party to victory.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi has proven herself as a first-rate legislator,\u201d said Rep.-elect Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), the former health and human services secretary. \u201cWe would not have Obamacare without her.\u201d\n\nBut with greater power comes greater tension inside the caucus. Not only are a handful of Democratic incumbents insisting on new leadership despite the electoral gains, several of the incoming lawmakers say they won\u2019t back down from campaign promises to install a new speaker.\n\nIn 2016, dozens of House Democrats opposed Pelosi in an internal party vote only to vote for her on the floor. Around a dozen Democrats set to vote this time around \u2014 with the speakership actually at stake \u2014 say they won\u2019t fall in line.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a leader of the anti-Pelosi faction, rejected the GOP comparisons. \"The Freedom Caucus is trying to break government,\" he said. \"We're just trying to get new leadership.\"\n\nA critical test may come later this week as Democrats consider an internal rule change to raise the threshold vote for nominating a speaker candidate from a simple majority to 218 votes. The change is expected to fail, in a boost for Pelosi.\n\nIn 2015, the Freedom Caucus played a key role in forcing out Republican Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) by threatening to call a vote on his removal. Rather than put vulnerable lawmakers in a difficult spot, Boehner quit.\n\nMcCarthy, as the No. 2 leader, was the obvious heir apparent, but conservative hard-liners saw him as too much like Boehner \u2014 an establishment-minded operator without a strong interest in conservative policy. So they coalesced behind a stalking horse, Rep. Daniel Webster (Fla.), and promised as a bloc to stick with him \u2014 thus denying McCarthy the absolute majority he would need on the House floor.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, McCarthy withdrew his speaker bid, and the Freedom Caucus was emboldened to make demand after demand under the compromise choice, Paul D. Ryan (Wis.).\n\n\u201cDifferent principles, but in terms of the tactics . . . you can really make a difference,\u201d said Rep. Warren Davidson (Ohio), a Freedom Caucus member who saw a resemblance between his group and the anti-Pelosi faction.\n\nThe Democrats who are plotting against Pelosi base their objections almost entirely on politics, not ideology or policy.\n\n[Pelosi\u2019s Democratic opponents scramble to organize the resistance]\n\nWhere the conservatives wanted their leaders to adopt tough positions on issues such as immigration and government spending, the Democrats mainly want Pelosi to move on, fearing she is a drag on candidates in competitive districts.

Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want is to have our caucus so conditioned to the way a minority party functions that we don\u2019t really think about the consequences of all the choices we make.\u201d\n\nClyburn, who is in a contested race for House majority whip, said he would \u201cresist anything that would be destructive to our caucus\u201d \u2014 including a potential floor fight over the speakership.\n\n\u201cThe American people restored House Democrats to the majority; they didn\u2019t restore that for us to go out on a tangent, for us to go out on ego trips,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a boost for the current leadership, 155 Democrats, including newly elected members, signed a letter Tuesday endorsing Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) to be the next majority leader. \u201cWe will need a steady, experienced leader over the next two years, who also works to empower our Members and prepare them for future leadership opportunities,\u201d they said of Hoyer.\n\nSmall groups of legislators using their leverage is nothing new, of course \u2014 especially to Pelosi, who dealt with several ad hoc groups that formed to shape major pieces of legislation the Democrats moved in 2009 and 2010, when the party controlled the House, Senate and presidency.\n\nBut none emerged as a persistent thorn in the side of the broader caucus in the way that the Freedom Caucus has for Republicans. And Democrats are happy to keep it that way.\n\nIn the days since the Democrats\u2019 sweeping victory, lawmakers and liberal groups have spoken up in praise of Pelosi \u2014 her legislative skills, her fundraising acumen and her groundbreaking status as the first female speaker \u2014 but a few have added sharp warnings against internal divisions.\n\nIn a letter to Democratic colleagues Monday, Rep. Elijah E.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nThe Russian government is arguing that a federal court should dismiss a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee alleging that Moscow\u2019s military spies, the Trump campaign and the WikiLeaks organization conspired to disrupt the 2016 campaign and tilt the election to Donald Trump.\n\n[Democratic Party sues Russia, Trump campaign and WikiLeaks alleging 2016 campaign conspiracy]\n\nIn a letter and statement this month to the State Department and a judge in the Southern District of New York, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Justice argued that the United States\u2019 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act protects the Russian government from such lawsuits.\n\nIn particular, the lawsuit\u2019s naming of the GRU military spy agency as a defendant takes the litigation out of bounds on the basis that \u201cany alleged \u2018military attack\u2019 is a quintessential sovereign act,\u201d said a Nov. 6 statement by the ministry\u2019s Department for International Law and Cooperation.\n\nThe Russian government also warned that if the suit is allowed to proceed, it exposes American spy services such as the National Security Agency \u2014 an arm of the Defense Department \u2014 to \u201ca tidal wave of civil litigation\u201d in foreign courts.\n\nThe statement cited a former senior Justice Department official, Jack Goldsmith, who said \u201cthe U.S. intelligence services break into computers and computer networks abroad at an astounding rate, certainly on a greater scale than any other intelligence service in the world.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Russians argued that the allegations raised by the DNC were a \u201cpolitical question\u201d best handled on a \u201cstate-to-state\u201d basis by the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress.\n\n[Read Russia\u2019s letter arguing that the DNC lawsuit be dismissed]\n\nMoscow\u2019s statement \u2014 the first substantive response to the DNC lawsuit filed in May \u2014 comes as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been investigating Russian interference in 2016 and whether any Trump associates conspired with Russians to affect the election\u2019s outcome. In July, Mueller obtained an indictment of 12 GRU officers, laying out in detail how various operatives allegedly hacked Democratic emails and transferred them to WikiLeaks, often using GRU intermediaries.\n\nIf the DNC case is allowed to proceed, the Democrats will seek internal documents and testimony from the Trump campaign that might illuminate interactions with Russia. They are asking for damages that they expect amount to several million dollars to compensate for alleged harm to the DNC\u2019s campaign operations, employees and fundraising activities.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has an easy choice to make: defend our democracy or do Putin\u2019s bidding,\u201d DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement, referring to Russian president Vladi\u00admir Putin. \u201cThe Trump Administration should stand up for the American people by telling Putin that the American judiciary has the jurisdiction and power to hold foreign governments that attack our people accountable for the harm they cause.\u201d\n\nIn a September communication to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the U.S. government to \u201ctake immediate action to stop\u201d the lawsuit, nudging the State Department to weigh in on Russia\u2019s behalf.\n\n[Read Russia\u2019s memo to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow]\n\nThe State Department said it needed time to review the matter before it could comment.\n\nThe Democrats are among a potentially growing class of plaintiffs seeking to sue foreign governments for alleged hacking-related crimes. The bar for such litigation is high, however, because of the 1976 law, which generally forbids lawsuits against foreign states.\n\nThe DNC, however, has argued that it can sue the Russian government because, the committee alleged, its agents stole \u201ctrade secrets, a form of commercial activity\u201d and the hack was a \u201ctortious act\u201d committed in the United States.\n\nMoscow argued that the commercial-activity exception does not apply to \u201can alleged military attack by a \u2018military intelligence agency,\u2019 \u201d and that a tort case cannot be recast as a commercial-activity case.\n\n\u201cRussia certainly has a credible argument for dismissal,\u201d said Scott Anderson, a former lawyer in the State Department\u2019s office of the legal adviser and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a strong one. This is treading on an area where there\u2019s a fine line to say what does and doesn\u2019t qualify for an exception.\u201d\n\nHe called Moscow\u2019s focus on military acts a \u201cred herring\u201d because it is not the purpose but the type of activity that counts when determining that something is commercial. Here, he said, \u201cit\u2019s still an unsettled area of law.\u201d\n\nAnother expert, Ashley Deeks, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for National Security Law and also a former State Department lawyer, said she thinks \u201cRussia is likely to prevail in arguing that the commercial-activity exception does not fit the situation at hand.\u201d\n\nThe DNC has proprietary information about its strategy, \u201cbut calling it trade secrets is where I trip up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u201cstriking thing\u201d about the Russian response, she said, was how it framed the alleged acts in strongly military terms. That framing, she said, \u201crings hollow here.\u201d\n\nThe Russians have not entered a formal motion to dismiss, and a Justice Ministry official, Mikhail V. Vinogradov, made clear in the letter that the document \u201cdoes not [constitute] an appearance in the litigation.\u201d\n\nThe documents were entered into the docket by U.S. District Judge John G.

That\u2019s according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shakeup as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, but it is unclear who is going and who is staying.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was thought to be out as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the issue, but she is now likely to remain in the post for a longer period because there is no obvious successor in place.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the people. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his own re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\u201cI worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\u201d\n\nQuestions about Nielsen\u2019s job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump\u2019s first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\u201cThe secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president\u2019s security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\u201d spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
