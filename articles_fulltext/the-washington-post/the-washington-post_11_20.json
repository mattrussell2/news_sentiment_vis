For the president, the migrants, many of them desperate women and children fleeing violence in Honduras, were a convenient electoral foil. And the nearly 6,000 U.S. troops he sent to \u201cguard\u201d the border against the caravans were props in his political theater.\n\nMr. Trump has moved on, but the thousands of soldiers deployed at his command to repel the phony invasion will now spend Thanksgiving at the border without their families.\n\nIt is a remarkable misuse of the U.S. military, at a cost that may reach a couple hundred million dollars. Past presidents have sent troops to the border, but usually National Guardsmen, often to grapple with a more authentic problem and rarely in the numbers Mr. Trump cavalierly deployed. Most of the soldiers sent to the border in recent weeks aren\u2019t anywhere near Tijuana, Mexico, near San Diego, where most of the migrants have arrived. Now comes word from the Army general commanding the border mission that some troops, having run out of tasks where they are, may be sent elsewhere \u2014 or home.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric, the problem of migrants is real. Many cross the border with their children and apply for asylum, overwhelming existing legal mechanisms, feeding what the president calls a \u201ccatch and release\u201d revolving door for migrants freed as they await hearings, and contributing to a backlog of about 1 million cases in immigration courts.\n\nA rational response would be to add to the 350 or so immigration judges, who cannot handle the tens of thousands of asylum claims flooding the immigration courts annually. The administration this year hired a few dozen judges, a fraction of what is required. As the caseload has more than quadrupled since 2006, the number of judges has not even doubled, according to congressional testimony in April by Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.\n\nDespite that, Mr. Trump has sneered at the idea of hiring more, even after aides pressed him to do so. \u201cWho are these people?\u201d he raged, before suggesting darkly that adding many new judges would somehow corrupt the system. \u201cNow can you imagine the graft that must take place?\u201d he asked.\n\nGranted, new hiring can be challenging, in vetting and cost. But any major challenge involves scaling up resources and personnel, and it\u2019s hard to see why that\u2019s beyond the government\u2019s capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Mr. Trump prefers having an issue rather than a solution. He has made it clear he believes the immigration question propelled him into the White House. Now, by ramping up his inflammatory rhetoric, and by over-the-top measures such as sending thousands of troops to the border, it seems apparent Mr. Trump has opted for crisis instead of constructive improvements to what he rightly calls a broken system. If he actually wanted to solve the problem, he would send the troops home and hire hundreds of judges."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Possible Russian president of Interpol raises alarm in West - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Possible Russian president of Interpol raises alarm in West Washington Post LONDON \u2014 Interpol is facing a pivotal \u2014 some say possibly fatal \u2014 moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladim\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/possible-russian-president-of-interpol-raises-alarm-in-west/2018/11/20/f1382e20-ed1e-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:52:06Z", "content": "LONDON Interpol is facing a pivotal some say possibly fatal moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladimir Putins Russia.

Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk lashed out at critics, accusing them of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d the Russian candidate Alexander Prokopchuk. (Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Interpol is facing a pivotal \u2014 some say possibly fatal \u2014 moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nKremlin critics fear they could soon face arrest wherever they go. Western governments worry that Russia could use the post to undermine the rule of law.\n\nInterpol, which elects a new president Wednesday , has weathered many challenges in its 95 years. While Hollywood has portrayed it as a hive of swashbuckling agents, in reality it\u2019s an organization sometimes tangled in red tape and clashing geopolitical interests. Nazis took it over in the 1930s, and authoritarian governments have long tried to use it to hunt down fugitive dissenters.\n\nBut the latest storm of criticism comes at an exceptional time \u2014 just as Russia is trying to expand its global clout and as some powerful countries are questioning whether they need multilateral organizations like Interpol at all.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is choosing the agency\u2019s new president at a meeting in Dubai where the front-runner is Alexander Prokopchuk, a general in Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry who is currently an Interpol vice president. Interpol\u2019s interim president, South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Yang, is also seeking the post.\n\nTwo prominent Kremlin critics warned Tuesday that electing a high-placed Russian would undermine the international law enforcement agency and politicize police cooperation across borders.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky told reporters in London that Putin has tried to use Interpol to hunt down critics such as themselves. Having a Russian lead the agency could intensify such efforts to silence dissent, they said.\n\nActivists argue that the organization needs to increase recent efforts at muscular reform, and this won\u2019t happen if Prokopchuk becomes president, because of his ties to Putin.\n\n\u201cIt was his government that organized a terrorist attack in the U.K. using chemical weapons in Salisbury. It was his government that shot down MH17, killing 298 innocent individuals. It was his government that cheated and hacked in elections in the United States and Europe,\u201d Browder said of Putin. \u201cTo put his representative in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge.\u201d\n\nTo Moscow, the complaints are all part of a Western-led campaign to weaken a resurgent Russia.\n\nRussia denies accusations of foreign interference and announced new charges against Browder this week in a long-running legal battle against him. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk accused critics Tuesday of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\n\nBrowder has pressed for sanctions against Russian officials charged with human rights abuses after his former lawyer died in custody. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, spent a decade in prison after exhibiting political ambitions. Both said their places in the public eye would make them poor targets for abuse, adding that they were motivated to speak out because many other campaigners who are less well-known would be silenced if governments are allowed to export repression.\n\nThe White House came out Tuesday against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying that \u201cthe Russian government abuses Interpol\u2019s processes to harass its political opponents.\u201d He said the U.S. \u201cstrongly endorses\u201d Kim.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added: \u201cWe encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world\u2019s most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.\u201d\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is made up of its 192 member states, each of which has an equal vote.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing \u201cred notices\u201d that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world\u2019s \u201cmost-wanted\u201d list.\n\nCritics argue that countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists.\n\nThe watchdog group Fair Trials International detailed in a report last month the strides Interpol has made in reducing political abuse of red notices. The group\u2019s chief, Jago Russell, said a Russian official as Interpol president could stall or reverse those reforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment for Interpol,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cEither countries back away from it and find other ways to cooperate, or Interpol fixes its system so that it can be trusted. ... Already there are noises about pulling out of Interpol\u201d and creating a separate agency just for democratic countries, he said.\n\nThe U.S. seems committed to Interpol for now, but has pulled out of UNESCO and international accords under President Donald Trump. Britain is pulling out of the European Union and has expressed concern about management of international bodies funded by taxpayers.\n\nInterpol itself won\u2019t comment on the upcoming vote. The Interpol presidency is more of an oversight position, compared with the hands-on leadership role of the secretary-general.\n\nInterpol\u2019s charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, and two years ago it introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out.\n\nBut the possibility of a Putin loyalist in such a prominent role has prompted concern among those critical of the Russian president\u2019s leadership. Four U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio, have urged the Trump administration to oppose the Prokopchuk candidacy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who on Monday stated that Russia was \u201crooting for the Russian candidate,\u201d said that amounted to meddling in the vote.\n\nFair Trials International warned that a Russian president of Interpol could try to limit the money spent on staff needed to vet red notices, for example, or get rid of a recent measure to protect refugees from unfair arrest.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Interpol\u2019s votes are causing controversy.\n\nHuman rights groups raised the alarm two years ago when Interpol\u2019s general assembly approved Meng Hongwei, a longtime senior Chinese security official, as president. Amnesty International criticized \u201cChina\u2019s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\u201d\n\nMeng is now under arrest in China as part of a possible domestic political purge \u2014 hence Wednesday\u2019s emergency vote to replace him.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly also votes on membership, like they did on Tuesday when they rejected admitting Kosovo . Interpol members voted last year to admit Palestine as a member, creating an uproar in Israel.\n\n___\n\nCharlton reported from Paris.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nThe federal government issued an ultimatum to an energy company to stop an oil spill that has been leaking thousands of gallons into the Gulf of Mexico every day for more than 14 years.\n\nIn an order issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, Taylor Energy Co. was told to \u201cinstitute a \u2026 system to capture, contain, or remove oil\u201d from the site or face a $40,000 per day fine for failing to comply. The order was issued Oct. 23, a day after The Washington Post reported that the spill was far greater than Interior Department estimates, which were based on company data.\n\nUp to 700 barrels of oil per day have leaked from Taylor Energy\u2019s former site 12 miles off the coast of Louisiana since the platform was destroyed during Hurricane Ivan in 2004, according to an analysis issued by the Justice Department. Each barrel contains 42 gallons. Based on reports from contractors hired by Taylor Energy, the government had previously estimated that the spill amounted to zero to 55 barrels per day.\n\nThe spill so far amounts to at least 1.5 million barrels and up to 3.5 million barrels. That would rival the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest offshore spill in the nation\u2019s history, which spewed 4 million barrels of oil into gulf waters.\n\nThe Justice Department analysis by Oscar Garcia-Pineda, a geoscience consultant who specializes in remote sensing of oil spills, was commissioned as part of the government\u2019s defense against a lawsuit by Taylor. The company is requesting that the Interior Department return more than $400 million placed in a trust to pay for plugging the wells and cleaning the site.\n\nActing on the analysis, the Coast Guard requested that Taylor attend an early November meeting of federal agencies overseeing the spill and present at least two plans for implementing a containment system and timeline for completing it. By the end of the meeting on Nov. 9, government officials would choose a plan.\n\nA Coast Guard spokesman, John Fitzgerald, said Tuesday that Taylor Energy presented a plan Nov. 8 but that the company\u2019s proposal was rejected in favor of one submitted by an independent contractor because it \u201cprovided both the best capability and timeline for responding\u201d to the ongoing spill.\n\nTaylor has already plugged nine of the 28 wells at its platform. The company has disputed that the wells, buried under 100 feet of mud from an underwater avalanche triggered by the hurricane, are the source of a massive spill. It said \u201cthe best science\u201d shows that the wells were low pressure, meaning that little oil remained at the site.\n\n\"The Coast Guard issued its order relying on deeply-flawed analysis and inflated volumes\u201d by Garcia-Pineda, the Taylor statement said. The company called the analysis a legal tactic by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThe inflated volumes are completely inconsistent with the scientific record built over a decade by the world's leading scientists, including those regularly relied upon by the government,\u201d the Taylor statement said. Those scientists have said oil has contaminated soil at the site and could be released if it is disturbed.\n\n\u201cTaylor Energy\u2019s greater concern is that the government is leading the response down a dangerous path that will create an environmental impact that currently does not exist,\u201d the Taylor statement said. \u201cIf there were anything legally permissible and effective that Taylor Energy could do in an environmentally responsible manner to stop the sheen, we would have already done it.\u201d\n\nThe Taylor site\u2019s rainbow-colored oil slicks are often visible for miles, and the broken wells release so much oil that researchers have needed respirators to study the damage.\n\nGarcia-Pineda pointedly said that the Coast Guard estimates based on Taylor Energy\u2019s reporting were wrong. There were several instances when the Guard reported low estimates on the same days he said he was finding heavy layers of oil in the field. \u201cThere is abundant evidence that supports the fact that these reports \u2026 are incorrect,\u201d Garcia-Pineda wrote. Later he said: \u201cMy conclusion is that [Coast Guard] reports are not reliable.\u201d\n\nThe Taylor spill was hidden for years as the company and the Coast Guard declined to inform the public that it existed. Environmental groups that monitor the gulf were unaware that the broken wells were leaking for six years \u2014 until the catastrophic BP Deepwater oil spill in April 2010.\n\nWhile monitoring that spill, both the Gulf Restoration Network, a conservation group, and SkyTruth, a nonprofit organization that uses satellite images to monitor spills, stumbled upon oil slicks that were unrelated to the Deepwater Horizon site.\n\n\u201cIt was there all the time, longer than the BP spill,\u201d said John Amos, founder and president of SkyTruth.\n\nThe two groups traced the spill to Taylor Energy\u2019s platform and called the Coast Guard. A group of conservationists eventually took Taylor Energy to court, arguing that its agreement with the federal government to clean the site without the public\u2019s knowledge amounted to a secret deal \u201cthat was inconsistent with national policy,\u201d which calls for citizen input under the Clean Water Act."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Joe Davidson", "title": "Racist incidents flare in federal facilities as hate crimes rise; Trump blamed for divisiveness", "description": "As hate crimes increase under President Trump, the largest federal union warns of \u201can alarmingly growing trend\u201d of racial incidents in places ranging from an African Burial Ground Monument in a New York federal park to government offices in Washington.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/20/racist-incidents-flare-federal-facilities-hate-crimes-rise-trump-blamed-divisiveness/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IZSH36LyWAoPuToBQpKge5htmBg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QQMXRWNPII6RLIKBYA67OR4YE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:43:00Z", "content": "During this season of joy and merriment, beware of the racists.

Nothing can put more of a damper on a fun, relaxing evening than a relative complaining about overcooked turkey after you\u2019ve slaved away in the kitchen all day (sorry, Aunt Faye, your Thanksgiving invite has been revoked). But you can easily avoid this frustrating mishap \u2014 and several other common cooking errors \u2014 by following these simple Thanksgiving tips from notable D.C. chefs.\n\nThanksgiving Cluckup: Dried-out turkey\n\nPro tip: Brine the turkey\n\nBrining can be time-consuming, but David Deshaies of Shaw\u2019s Unconventional Diner says it\u2019s an essential way to keep the turkey moist. \u201cUse water with some salt and leave the turkey sitting for a few hours,\u201d he says. The longer it sits, the more liquid will seep into the bird. Deshaies typically adds spices to the water \u2014 such as thyme, rosemary, garlic and peppercorns \u2014 before boiling the liquid, cooling it and adding the turkey.\n\nPro tip: Adjust the temperature\n\nMarjorie Meek-Bradley of Smoked and Stacked in Shaw has a tried-and-true system: Cook the turkey low and slow, and give it a good searing at the end. \u201cI take it out when it\u2019s at 150 degrees, let it sit on the counter, and right before dinner I blast it in the oven\u201d for 15 minutes at 450 degrees, she says. She also puts a small pan of water in the oven, which \u201cgives it a steam roast, keeping the turkey juicy.\u201d\n\nPro tip: Place foil on top\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about burning your turkey, Amy Brandwein of Italian restaurant Centrolina at CityCenterDC recommends placing a piece of aluminum foil on top of the bird. \u201cThat will save the day, and then take it off for the last 10 to 20 minutes of cooking,\u201d she says.\n\nPro tip: Spatchcock the turkey\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in a hurry and need a turkey done quickly. What do you do? \u201cFor the past couple years, I\u2019ve spatchcocked a turkey to cook it faster and more evenly,\u201d says Kevin Tien of Petworth restaurant Himitsu. To do this, Tien removes the turkey\u2019s spine and lays the bird flat on a rack. For a turkey weighing 12 to 14 pounds, you can get it cooked in 30 minutes at 450-degree heat, or 90 minutes in 350-degree heat. He recommends cooking the turkey on a bed of root vegetables \u2014 such as carrots, potatoes and parsnips \u2014 for extra flavor.\n\nIf you mess up: Don\u2019t panic, Tien says. A family tradition he relies on is using the dried-out meat to make a turkey pot pie. \u201cShred [the meat] up,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can bake it by using frozen peas and carrots and add gravy and meat to the bottom of a pan, with a puff pastry on top.\u201d\n\nThanksgiving Cluckup: Boring side dishes\n\nPro tip: Share your unique family traditions\n\nMashed potatoes, root vegetables and stuffing may be required, but your side dishes don\u2019t have to stop there. Tien\u2019s family shakes up dinner by mixing Vietnamese dishes with American foods. \u201cWe have a blend of turkey and a bunch of Asian sides,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom loves making fried spring rolls.\u201d Meek-Bradley says her friends from Los Angeles bring an enchilada casserole. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing Thanksgiving for seven years now, and it\u2019s like a blending of our two families,\u201d she says.\n\nThanksgiving Cluckup: Hard, burnt pie crust\n\nPro tip: Use a chilled metal bowl\n\nKate Jacoby of plant-based H Street restaurant Fancy Radish says a flaky crust is mostly dependent on temperature. \u201cPeople usually overwork the dough with their hands, not thinking that their hand is a lot warmer than a wooden or metal spoon,\u201d she says. Jacoby recommends working the dough in a metal bowl that\u2019s been pre-chilled in the fridge for as long as possible (or freezer if you\u2019re pressed for time) to better control the temperature.\n\nPro tip: Easy on the water\n\nAdding too much water can \u201ctoughen up the flour and make for a less delicate pie crust,\u201d Jacoby says. She recommends adding 2 tablespoons of water when making a single pie crust. \u201cYou want [the dough] to remain soft, almost brittle, as it comes together in a ball, not stretchy and elastic,\u201d she says.\n\nPro tip: Put foil around the rim\n\nIf the edge around the pie top isn\u2019t covered before baking, it will burn quickly, Brandwein warns. \u201cIt should be covered because it can have the tendency to be overcooked before anything else,\u201d she says.\n\nIf you mess up: If everything came out great except for the burnt crust edge, one option is to make a deconstructed pie, Jacoby says. \u201cTreat it almost like a cheesecake,\u201d she says. \u201cStamp out the center of the pie with a knife and then cut straight sides.\u201d\n\nThanksgiving Cluckup: Bland gravy\n\nPro tip: Use pan drippings and stock\n\nBrandwein has a family recipe for gravy that helps make the finished product more flavorful. \u201cI usually make a brown turkey or chicken stock, reduce it, and put that into my pan drippings,\u201d she says. Once you have your mixture and bring the drippings to a boil on the stove, add corn starch or Wondra flour until it thickens, Brandwein says, then add a piece of butter to make a mouthwatering gravy.\n\nThanksgiving Cluckup: Shortchanged vegans/vegetarians\n\nPro tip: Embrace the mushroom\u2019s many varieties\n\nFancy Radish\u2019s Richard Landau recommends making a mushroom pot roast. \u201cYou can\u2019t do without mushrooms \u2014 to me they\u2019re more iconic than the turkey,\u201d he says. The trick is to use more than one kind. \u201cDo a whole bunch of them: Put creminis in there and get some wild mushrooms, black trumpets, chanterelle, maitake or bluefoot,\u201d he adds.\n\nPro tip: Add color to the meal\n\n\u201cMost Thanksgiving Day tables are not very pretty \u2014 everything is brown, gray and just not the most colorful table in the world,\u201d Landau says. The solution? Add squashes, red peppers, zucchini and fresh herbs to the various meatless dishes.\n\nPro tip: Sunchokes are your friend\n\n\u201cNot enough people use sunchokes the right way,\u201d Landau says. His recommendation? Make a sunchoke sauce instead of using canned gravy. This requires boiling the sunchokes in vegetable stock, adding olive oil, vegan butter and herbs, and then pureeing it in a blender.\n\nPro tip: Don\u2019t deprive guests of dessert\n\nFor pies, Jacoby recommends using agar or cornstarch in lieu of eggs. When it comes to fats, \u201cif you have a great vegan shortening and butter with olive oil, you can make a beautiful, very flaky, tasty pie crust,\u201d she says. For a foolproof cream substitute, plant milk is the way to go."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Facing criticism, Trump says he'll visit troops in war zone - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Facing criticism, Trump says he'll visit troops in war zone Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump frequently credits himself with accomplishing more for the military and veterans than any other president in recent memory.

(Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump frequently credits himself with accomplishing more for the military and veterans than any other president in recent memory. But he has yet to embark on what has long been a traditional presidential pilgrimage important to the military: a visit to troops deployed in a war zone.\n\nAs he departed Tuesday for Florida to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday at his private club in Palm Beach, Trump said he\u2019d soon correct the oversight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to a war zone,\u201d he said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about his support for the troops. He did not say when he would be making the trip or to which conflict area he would be going. An official said a White House team recently returned from beginning to plan for a visit.\n\nThe omission is one of a long list of norm-breaking moves that underscore the president\u2019s increasingly fraught relationship with the military, which has celebrated Trump\u2019s investments in defense spending but cringed at what some see as efforts to politicize their service.\n\nJust this week, Trump leveled criticism against the storied commander of the 2011 mission that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, retired Adm. William McRaven. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe latest controversy followed a pattern of concerns raised by former senior military officers about Trump\u2019s grasp of the military\u2019s role, and it comes as White House aides and defense officials have raised alarm about what they view as the president\u2019s disinterest in briefings about troop deployments overseas.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump appeared to try to deflect responsibility for the death of a servicemember in a failed operation in Yemen, saying planning for the mission began under his predecessor and was backed by senior military commanders.\n\n\u201cThey explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected,\u201d he told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d at the time. \u201cAnd they lost Ryan.\u201d\n\nTrump won the White House on a platform of ending U.S. military commitments abroad, but he\u2019s been bedeviled by many of the same challenges as his predecessors. More American troops are now deployed in conflict zones than when he took office.\n\nAides have suggested that Trump is wary of traveling to conflict zones where he doesn\u2019t fully support the mission. Trump begrudgingly backed a surge of troops in Afghanistan last year and boosted U.S. deployments in Iraq, Syria and Africa to counter the Islamic State and other extremist groups.\n\nTrump said last week in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview that he was \u201cvery much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened.\u201d Trump, in fact, offered lukewarm support for the invasion at the time but began offering public doubts about the mission after the conflict began in March 2003.\n\nAt home, some assert that Trump\u2019s decision to send thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was a political stunt. And Defense Department officials said they rejected requests by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and backed by the White House \u2014 for armed active-duty troops to bolster Border Patrol agents, saying it ran afoul of federal law.\n\nTrump also drew criticism for his decision not to visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day, following his trip to Europe. He said later he \u201cshould have\u201d visited the cemetery but was too busy with official business. His public schedule that day listed no events.\n\nIn the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, Trump was asked why he hadn\u2019t visited the troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years he\u2019s served as commander in chief.\n\n\u201cWell, I think you will see that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things that are being planned.\u201d\n\nHe also touted his support for the men and women in uniform.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s been more with the military than I have, as a president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn terms of funding, in terms of all of the things I\u2019ve been able to get them, including the vets, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s done more than me.\u201d\n\nTrump received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, four for education and one for a diagnosis of bone spurs \u2014 though he later told The New York Times he could not remember which foot was affected by the malady or how long it lasted.\n\nTrump told The Associated Press in a recent interview that he doesn\u2019t think visiting troops in a war zone is \u201coverly necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very busy with everything that\u2019s taking place here,\u201d he added.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Graham (R-S.C.) is the co-author of a bill that would impose a blanket ban on U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nOne of President Trump\u2019s closest congressional confidants suggested Tuesday that lawmakers may not extend federal funding unless a measure to stiffen sanctions Saudi Arabia is included in the deal.\n\nThe message comes as congressional Democrats and Republicans alike excoriated Trump\u2019s defense of Saudi denials that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi over the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials. Those comments prompted a backlash from the Democratic and Republican heads of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well, who ordered Trump to issue a formal determination of whether Mohammed is responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said on Twitter. Shortly after, he and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, invoked their authority under the Global Magnitsky Act, through which they can force the president to weigh sanctioning officials implicated in human rights offenses, to deliver a verdict on Mohammed\u2019s responsibility within 120 days.\n\nBut the more pressing matter for Congress may be Sen. Lindsey O. Graham\u2019s (R-S.C.) assesment that \u201cit will be hard to get a deal to fund the government without doing something that will send a clear message\u201d to Saudi leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the crown prince, it is not wise to look away,\u201d Graham added in an interview Tuesday, calling Mohammed \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d on the global stage.\n\nGraham is a co-author of pending legislation to impose a blanket ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u2014 deals Trump has held up as the reason he believes supporting Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince is an essential part of his \u201cAmerica first\u201d strategy. Graham\u2019s warning to the contrary was part of an eruption of vitriol from leading GOP voices on Capitol Hill, many of whom accused Trump of shilling for the Saudis instead of prioritizing the United States\u2019 interests.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First, not America First,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said on Twitter. \u201cWe should, at the very least, NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians.\u201d\n\nPaul has long advocated a recalibration of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, primarily out of concern that the United States\u2019 support for the Saudi-led coalition is worsening already-catastrophic conditions for civilians in Yemen\u2019s long-running civil war.\n\nTheir cause has picked up steam in the weeks since Khashoggi\u2019s slaying, which shocked Capitol Hill and drove many to openly question why the Saudi relationship was sacrosanct \u2014 and why Trump keeps moving closer to the kingdom, despite its documented human rights abuses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump called Saudi Arabia a \u201cgreat ally\u201d \u2014 angering some members of his party even more.\n\n\u201c \u2018Great allies\u2019 don\u2019t plot the murder of journalists, Mr. President,\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has become increasingly critical of Trump as he nears his retirement from Congress, wrote on Twitter. \u201c \u2018Great allies\u2019 don\u2019t torture their own citizens into a trap, then kill them.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have long criticized Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record as abysmal, but for years, Congress has turned a blind eye, in deference to the U.S.-Saudi security relationship, which U.S. presidents have seen as central to their anti-terrorism strategy in the Middle East. But Trump\u2019s all-encompassing embrace of Saudi Arabia has disquieted some of the GOP\u2019s most influential foreign policy figures, who chafed Tuesday as Trump doubled down on his argument that it was necessary to defer to Saudi leaders in \u201ca very dangerous world.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote on Twitter, arguing that human rights violations drive the sort of unrest that fuels instability and terrorism. \u201cIt is in our natl interest to defend human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an utterly absurd, irresponsible, and repugnant statement from @POTUS,\u201d Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) noted, also in a Twitter post. \u201cNo amount of money justifies the betrayal of our principles and values as Americans.\u201d\n\nYet lawmakers have struggled to pass, or in some cases even consider, legislation to curtail U.S. support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Earlier this month, Republican leaders in the House adopted a rare rule change to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on a bill to stop U.S. military, intelligence and air support to the Saudi coalition under the War Powers Resolution \u2014 by nullifying parts of the War Powers Resolution, specifically for that bill.\n\nThe Senate has yet to consider a measure specifically directed at Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi\u2019s killing, though several senators have warned that they will personally intervene to block any future arms sales. Presently, Menendez \u2014 who along with Graham co-wrote the bill to raise sanctions on Saudi Arabia and others fomenting unrest in Yemen \u2014 is preventing a sale of precision-guided munitions to the Saudis.\n\nCongressional leaders have not weighed in on the likelihood that the sanctions bill will be added to the federal funding extension, due by Dec. 7. It is unlikely that lawmakers will be able to find enough time on the floor to put such a bill to a separate vote, with only weeks left until lawmakers depart Washington.\n\nIn the House, Democratic leaders have already promised to take up the issue of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and the fate of Yemen, as part of their agenda when they assume the majority in the chamber next year. But with the future of legislation uncertain, and a Trump ally set to inherit the gavel on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, some Democrats are looking to the House to lead the charge against Saudi policy \u2014 and not just with sanctions bills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now 100% clear the Saudis own our President \u2014 and the new House Dem majority needs ot get to the bottom of this ASAP,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote on Twitter \u2014 promising to push for a vote on ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen before the end of the year.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Whitaker earned nearly $1M from right-leaning nonprofit - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Whitaker earned nearly $1M from right-leaning nonprofit Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 Before joining the Justice Department, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned nearly $1 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesn't disclose \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/schumer-asks-for-probe-into-whitakers-white-house-contacts/2018/11/20/c7dbb602-ecd1-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:25:11Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Before joining the Justice Department, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned nearly $1 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesnt disclose its donors, according to financial disclosure forms released Tuesday.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Before joining the Justice Department, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker earned nearly $1 million from a right-leaning nonprofit that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, according to financial disclosure forms released Tuesday.\n\nThe documents, released by the Justice Department show Whitaker received $904,000 in income from the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust from 2016 through nearly the end of 2017. He also received $15,000 from CNN as a legal commentator, according to the documents.\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Associated Press, and outside groups had requested the documents after President Donald Trump ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and elevated Whitaker to the top Justice Department post on Nov. 7.\n\nThe documents show that Whitaker began revising his public disclosures the day he was appointed as acting attorney general. He revised the forms four more times, including on Tuesday.\n\nIn a disclosure form Whitaker completed when he joined the Justice Department in September 2017, he reported receiving $1,875 in legal fees from a company called World Patent Marketing. Whitaker has come under scrutiny for his involvement with the company that was accused of misleading consumers and is under investigation by the FBI.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed his partial interest in a family farm in Ely, Iowa, that he valued at between $100,000 and $250,000. The forms also included disclosures of $20,000 to $30,000 in credit card debt in 2017.\n\nThe nonprofit group Whitaker worked for, known as FACT, styles itself as a nonpartisan government ethics watchdog. However, its challenges and its website have focused largely, though not exclusively, on Democrats and their party.\n\nWhitaker used his role as president and executive director of FACT in 2016 as a platform to question the ethics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nFACT drew its funds from 2014-2016 mainly from Donor\u2019s Trust, another nonprofit designed to provide anonymity to conservative and libertarian donors.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment has been criticized by Democrats who have challenged its constitutionality and are concerned that he will interfere with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat asked the Justice Department\u2019s watchdog to investigate communications between Whitaker and the White House.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer asked the inspector general to look into whether Whitaker had access to confidential grand jury information in Mueller\u2019s probe. Schumer also wants investigators to examine whether Whitaker shared information with Trump or others in the administration.\n\nJohn Lavinsky, a spokesman for the inspector general, declined to comment on Schumer\u2019s request.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, had been overseeing the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation until Whitaker\u2019s appointment. Whitaker is now overseeing the investigation.\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have said they are concerned about Whitaker\u2019s past criticism of the Mueller probe, which is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nAfter Whitaker\u2019s appointment, Schumer called for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation and said he would seek to tie a measure protecting Mueller to must-pass legislation if he refuses to do so.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump\u2019s family finances. In a talk radio interview he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nOn Monday, three other Senate Democrats \u2014 Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 filed a lawsuit arguing that Whitaker\u2019s appointment is unconstitutional because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.

The Chicago Tribune reported that O\u2019Neal had ended the engagement and that Lopez went to the hospital to demand his ring back.\n\nOfficials and witnesses that night described how the argument escalated when a friend tried to intervene. Lopez brandished a gun, causing the friend to flee, and shot O\u2019Neal repeatedly. He then ran inside the hospital and exchanged gunfire with officers.\n\n[Gunman in Mercy Hospital killings targeted his ex-fiancee, an emergency room physician]\n\nTwo others died as a result of Lopez\u2019s rampage: Dayna Less, a 24-year-old pharmacy resident, and Chicago police officer Samuel Jimenez.\n\nLopez also died at the scene, though it was not clear whether he was killed by police or a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nA 38-year-old native of La Porte, Ind., O\u2019Neal drew admiration from her peers for her success in medicine, especially as a black woman.

There, they treated patients and worked together in the emergency room.\n\nAfter graduating, O\u2019Neal became a doctor at Mercy Hospital. Her colleagues there say they\u2019ll miss her outgoing personality and willingness to go out of her way for others.\n\n\u201cYou would think being a new graduate, she would be kind of shy and timid around [people] with many, many years of experience,\u201d said Adele Cobbs, assistant director of the emergency department at Mercy Hospital. \u201cBut she wanted us to know who she was immediately.\u201d\n\nWhen Cobbs\u2019s father fell ill, she said, O\u2019Neal sat with him, held his hand and talked to him as if she had known him for years.\n\n\u201cAnd this was in no more than three weeks of me knowing her,\u201d Cobbs said.\n\nO\u2019Neal also strove to do right by her patients and wasn\u2019t afraid to fight for them.\n\n[\u2018This just tears at the soul\u2019: 1 day, 5 cities, 11 killings]\n\nPatrick Connor, chairman and director of the emergency department at Mercy Hospital, said O\u2019Neal would stay well after the end of her shift to make sure her patients were taken care of.\n\nWhen she did go home, he added, she would call and ask the other doctors how her patients were doing.\n\n\u201cIf we were all ill and Tamara was going to be our doctor, we would be in the greatest hands possible,\u201d he said.\n\nUpon starting her job at Mercy Hospital, Connor noted that O\u2019Neal requested to have Sundays off to attend church because her faith played a central role in her life. This dispensation was not one the hospital typically granted, Connor said, but O\u2019Neal was willing to work evenings and Fridays to make up for it.\n\n\u201cIt was the basis of everything for her, even in her relationship, the church was where she went for counsel,\u201d Cobbs said. \u201cIt was where she harvested her strength.\u201d\n\n['THIS IS OUR LANE': The NRA told doctors to mind their business.

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nThe federal government issued an ultimatum to an energy company to stop an oil spill that has been leaking thousands of gallons into the Gulf of Mexico every day for more than 14 years.\n\nIn an order issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, Taylor Energy Co. was told to \u201cinstitute a \u2026 system to capture, contain, or remove oil\u201d from the site or face a $40,000 per day fine for failing to comply. The order was issued Oct. 23, a day after The Washington Post reported that the spill was far greater than Interior Department estimates, which were based on company data.\n\nUp to 700 barrels of oil per day have leaked from Taylor Energy\u2019s former site 12 miles off the coast of Louisiana since the platform was destroyed during Hurricane Ivan in 2004, according to an analysis issued by the Justice Department. Each barrel contains 42 gallons. Based on reports from contractors hired by Taylor Energy, the government had previously estimated that the spill amounted to zero to 55 barrels per day.\n\nThe spill so far amounts to at least 1.5 million barrels and up to 3.5 million barrels. That would rival the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, the largest offshore spill in the nation\u2019s history, which spewed 4 million barrels of oil into gulf waters.\n\nThe Justice Department analysis by Oscar Garcia-Pineda, a geoscience consultant who specializes in remote sensing of oil spills, was commissioned as part of the government\u2019s defense against a lawsuit by Taylor. The company is requesting that the Interior Department return more than $400 million placed in a trust to pay for plugging the wells and cleaning the site.\n\nActing on the analysis, the Coast Guard requested that Taylor attend an early November meeting of federal agencies overseeing the spill and present at least two plans for implementing a containment system and timeline for completing it. By the end of the meeting on Nov. 9, government officials would choose a plan.\n\nA Coast Guard spokesman, John Fitzgerald, said Tuesday that Taylor Energy presented a plan Nov. 8 but that the company\u2019s proposal was rejected in favor of one submitted by an independent contractor because it \u201cprovided both the best capability and timeline for responding\u201d to the ongoing spill.\n\nTaylor has already plugged nine of the 28 wells at its platform. The company has disputed that the wells, buried under 100 feet of mud from an underwater avalanche triggered by the hurricane, are the source of a massive spill. It said \u201cthe best science\u201d shows that the wells were low pressure, meaning that little oil remained at the site.\n\n\"The Coast Guard issued its order relying on deeply-flawed analysis and inflated volumes\u201d by Garcia-Pineda, the Taylor statement said. The company called the analysis a legal tactic by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThe inflated volumes are completely inconsistent with the scientific record built over a decade by the world's leading scientists, including those regularly relied upon by the government,\u201d the Taylor statement said. Those scientists have said oil has contaminated soil at the site and could be released if it is disturbed.\n\n\u201cTaylor Energy\u2019s greater concern is that the government is leading the response down a dangerous path that will create an environmental impact that currently does not exist,\u201d the Taylor statement said. \u201cIf there were anything legally permissible and effective that Taylor Energy could do in an environmentally responsible manner to stop the sheen, we would have already done it.\u201d\n\nThe Taylor site\u2019s rainbow-colored oil slicks are often visible for miles, and the broken wells release so much oil that researchers have needed respirators to study the damage.\n\nGarcia-Pineda pointedly said that the Coast Guard estimates based on Taylor Energy\u2019s reporting were wrong. There were several instances when the Guard reported low estimates on the same days he said he was finding heavy layers of oil in the field. \u201cThere is abundant evidence that supports the fact that these reports \u2026 are incorrect,\u201d Garcia-Pineda wrote. Later he said: \u201cMy conclusion is that [Coast Guard] reports are not reliable.\u201d\n\nThe Taylor spill was hidden for years as the company and the Coast Guard declined to inform the public that it existed. Environmental groups that monitor the gulf were unaware that the broken wells were leaking for six years \u2014 until the catastrophic BP Deepwater oil spill in April 2010.\n\nWhile monitoring that spill, both the Gulf Restoration Network, a conservation group, and SkyTruth, a nonprofit organization that uses satellite images to monitor spills, stumbled upon oil slicks that were unrelated to the Deepwater Horizon site.\n\n\u201cIt was there all the time, longer than the BP spill,\u201d said John Amos, founder and president of SkyTruth.\n\nThe two groups traced the spill to Taylor Energy\u2019s platform and called the Coast Guard. A group of conservationists eventually took Taylor Energy to court, arguing that its agreement with the federal government to clean the site without the public\u2019s knowledge amounted to a secret deal \u201cthat was inconsistent with national policy,\u201d which calls for citizen input under the Clean Water Act."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Waldman", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/11/20/happy-hour-roundup-1487/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p_2f-ctYE7cKjt-25InqKjJfqFY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7DOJKUWQNQ2WJK3HN2WAQTP2MU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:22:29Z", "content": "* Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report that Ivanka should be getting ready to testify : The House Oversight Committee plans to investigate whether Ivanka Trump violated federal law by using a personal email account for government business, the panels inco\u2026 [+4882 chars]", "fulltext": "Opinion writer\n\n* Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report that Ivanka should be getting ready to testify:\n\nThe House Oversight Committee plans to investigate whether Ivanka Trump violated federal law by using a personal email account for government business, the panel\u2019s incoming chairman, Rep.

Whitaker received more than $1.2 million as the leader of a charity that reported having no other employees, some of the best pay of his career. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust described itself as a new watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials. For Whitaker, it became a lucrative steppingstone in a swift rise from a modest law practice in Iowa to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job. As FACT\u2019s president, he regularly appeared on radio and television, often to skewer liberals. But FACT\u2019s origins and the source of funding used to pay Whitaker \u2014 now the acting attorney general \u2014 remain obscured. An examination of state and federal records, and interviews with those involved, show that the group is part of a national network of nonprofits that often work in concert to amplify conservative messages.\n\nThis is what liberals call \u201cwingnut welfare,\u201d in which conservatives are paid huge sums to do strangely little. Under ordinary circumstances it\u2019s perfectly fine, but it does raise doubts about whether Whitaker can ever be an objective enforcer of the law.\n\n* Ken Sweet reports on what should be a scandal at the Department of Education:\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s largest student loan servicing companies may have driven tens of thousands of borrowers struggling with their debts into higher-cost repayment plans. That\u2019s the finding of a Department of Education audit of practices at Navient Corp., the nation\u2019s third-largest student loan servicing company. The conclusions of the 2017 audit, which until now have been kept from the public and were obtained by The Associated Press, appear to support federal and state lawsuits that accuse Navient of boosting its profits by steering some borrowers into the high-cost plans without discussing options that would have been less costly in the long run. The education department has not shared the audit\u2019s findings with the plaintiffs in the lawsuits. In fact, even while knowing of its conclusions, the department repeatedly argued that state and other federal authorities do not have jurisdiction over Navient\u2019s business practices.\n\nSo to reiterate: It sure looks like Betsy DeVos\u2019 department is covering up malfeasance on the part of a loan servicing company.

I mean, literally: Slow down the circuits. Put more friction in the system. Make social media slower, more local and less instantly connected to people we don\u2019t know.\n\nOur hyper-fast world has become destructive. We can see that in the instantaneous hurricanes of rage that sweep our politics; in the screen obsession on display in every elevator, restaurant and public place; in the manipulation of cyberspace by bad governments and people.\n\nThe speed and omnipresence of communications have themselves become an addiction: Unfortunately, our always-connected world seems to accelerate anger and breed mistrust.\n\nListening to a senior Facebook executive explaining his company\u2019s woes at a gathering here last Friday of the Trilateral Commission was a reminder of how the dream of instant global connection has turned nasty, even for its greatest proponents. Facebook\u2019s first informal motto was \u201cMove fast and break things.\u201d That was replaced by an anodyne official mission statement: \u201cBring the world closer together.\u201d (A mission achieved, as it turned out, by Russian intelligence.)\n\n\u201cSlow it down.\u201d That\u2019s my suggested motto for the new Facebook that will emerge from the corporate train wreck described last week in a New York Times piece headlined, \u201cDelay, Deny and Deflect.\u201d Facebook, at this writing, has lost nearly 40 percent of its stock-market value since July. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg may have changed the corporate slogan, but the company is definitely still breaking things.\n\nThe virtues of a slower, less fluid Internet were outlined in an important recent article on Motherboard by Justin Kosslyn, who heads product management for the Jigsaw think tank operated by Alphabet, which also owns Google. The article\u2019s title makes the basic, heretical argument: \u201cThe Internet Needs More Friction: Tech companies\u2019 obsession with moving data across the internet as fast as possible has made it less safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriction \u2014 delays and hurdles to speed and growth \u2014 can be a win-win-win for users, companies and security,\u201d Kosslyn writes. \u201cHighways have speed limits and drugs require prescriptions . . . yet digital information moves limitlessly.\u201d Unfortunately, he notes, this combination of blazing speed and non-oversight \u201caccelerates the flow of phishing, ransomware and disinformation.\u201d\n\nI like Kosslyn\u2019s idea because it\u2019s an alternative to the potential trap Facebook has entered, of hiring many thousands of human content assessors and fact-checkers to decide what ideas should be allowed on its platform. To many people, this sounds like Facebook\u2019s version of thought police. Next, alas, come the government regulators.\n\nRather than create a new regulation regime for Facebook (as Congress is discussing), maybe it would be wiser to treat these social-media companies as publishers of content \u2014 and apply the same, well-established legal standards (including libel laws for reckless defamatory comments) that apply to any other publisher. This transition \u2014 from platform to publisher \u2014 should be implemented carefully, not in the heat of anti-Facebook agitation. In the meantime, slow it down.\n\n\u201cFriction buys time, and time reduces systemic risk,\u201d argues Kosslyn. He notes that in addition to highway speed limits, we routinely accept the need for such delays as mortgage inspections and employment background checks.\n\nSuper-speed will continue to be important for some applications, but Kosslyn contends that \u201conly urgent content should be fast.\u201d Emails that might contain phishing or malware could be delayed so algorithms could search for suspicious links. And automated systems shouldn\u2019t be allowed to multiply uncontrolled, without human review.\n\nFinally, argues Kosslyn, we should be locavores when it comes to information, just as we are increasingly with food. We may decide to bypass this local content and jump to broader interest groups that are political or topical, but we shouldn\u2019t automatically be dumped in the global sea of information.\n\nGovernment regulation of social media scares me, frankly. I wouldn\u2019t want this president or this Congress telling me how I can consume information. I\u2019d feel safer if it were just slower, clunkier and more local.\n\nAs a Facebook official said here, weighing the question of new regulation to protect privacy: \u201cBefore, we had privacy by obscurity. There was a lot of information about us, but there was friction in the system\u201d that made it harder to obtain.\n\nThe blessings of the Internet age are obvious, but so, increasingly, is the threat it poses for democracy and freedom. Consider the contrarian remedy: Slow is good.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "David Weigel", "title": "The Trailer: O'Rourke, Warren, Klobuchar, plus way more on 2018 and 2020", "description": "In this edition: Reader questions get answered, Mississippi airwaves get nasty, John Delaney talks about 2020, and Tom Steyer heads to primary states.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2018/11/20/the-trailer-o-rourke-warren-klobuchar-plus-way-more-on-2018-and-2020/5bf300211b326b392905491e/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/2a05b28ec75006e28ad79725b5f33bda-3500-2333-70-8-20181106T221322Z_526568996_RC1B5FF9AB40_RTRMADP_3_USAELECTIONTEXAS_tstmp_1542749440.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:51:13Z", "content": "In this edition: Reader questions get answered, Mississippi airwaves get nasty, John Delaney talks about 2020, and Tom Steyer heads to primary states.

(Cathal McNaughton/Reuters)\n\nIt's been a busy two months for this newsletter, and like most of the country, it will be taking off Thursday for the holiday. With that in mind, I asked for questions, encouraging readers to tell me what they want to know now that the midterms were over.\n\n\u201cHow well would the GOP have done (how many seats in House, Senate) in the 2018 midterms if they had won the popular vote by the margin Democrats won? I assume much better than what Democrats did, given the map and gerrymandering, but I'm curious what a ballpark estimate would be.\u201d \u2014 Chris Larson\n\nThe short answer is, \u201cbetter.\u201d It looks as though Democrats will win the popular vote by eight points; in 2010, Republicans won it by 6.6 points. That was good enough for them to win 63 seats, 23 more than Democrats won this year. There are caveats, like the fact that 2010 was the last House election before California's \u201ctop two\u201d runoff system; this year, eight California House races had no Republican candidate, compared with just one House race with no Democrats. But in general, yes, the current maps, drawn mostly by Republicans, would have been more favorable to them in a wave year.\n\nAnother, more answerable question is: How many seats did gerrymandering cost Democrats this year? If you look at how close Republicans came to defeat in the suburbs of Austin, Charlotte, Dallas and Houston, you can see the impact of gerrymanders that split big cities and suburbs up and loaded them up with rural Republican voters. Nonpartisan maps in Michigan and Ohio probably would have let Democrats play for two or three more seats. If every state drew \u201cfair\u201d maps, Democrats probably would have done a little bit worse in New Jersey but better in North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, probably good enough for a 48- to 50-seat gain. The worst result for the Democrats' long-term House ambitions was their defeat in Ohio's race for governor, which, combined with the GOP legislative supermajority in the state, will allow Republicans to draw safe seats for themselves into the next decade.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think about the Colorado Senate race in 2020? [Republican Sen. Cory] Gardner is surely the top target for removal, though I think Gardner losing is less certain than many Democrats think. Who do you think will challenge him?\u201d \u2014 Thomas Van de Pas\n\nYou're right that he's seen as the Democrats' top target, but I think they're sober about the challenges. In 2014, Gardner was outraised by $8 million and still pushed past Mark Udall. The 2020 version of Gardner, with a term atop the NRSC behind him, is going to have all the resources he needs. But if you're a nervous Republican, you just watched Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) go down to a strong but not phenomenal Democratic candidate in a state that's a lot like Colorado but redder. Like Heller, Gardner got to the Senate with a moderate image (one that Democrats disputed) that has been incredibly hard to maintain with Trump in the White House.\n\nThe Democrats' other advantage in Colorado is a deep bench. They swept Republicans out of every statewide office this year, and they have a farm team in the state legislature. There's no need to pull Udall or Ken Salazar out of retirement. I've heard the most chatter about Crisanta Duran, the former state House speaker, who'd be just 40 years old in 2020; Democrats also think another woman, Cary Kennedy, the 50-year-old former state treasurer who lost this year's gubernatorial primary, could be a strong candidate. Did you notice that female candidates ran ahead of the ticket in 2018? So did Democrats.\n\n\u201cI recently saw a tweet about Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s moderate policy positions and voting record. He has been critiqued for opposing Medicare-for-all (HR 676), opposing college for all (HR 1880), opposing taxing Wall St. transactions (HR 1144), being the 2nd largest recipient of oil and gas money (2018), and voting three times to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157) Do you think a white man with such a moderate record really has a chance in the 2020 primaries?\u201d \u2014 Parker Sprow\n\nNot to cast any aspersions on O'Rourke, who, famously, did not hire a pollster in his race. But he was running in a state that's about 10 points more Republican than the states any Democrat needs to win the presidency, and I do think he'd calibrate a little bit if he ran for president. He went out on a limb on some liberal issues in Texas and got credit for that, so I think it'd be less about what positions he took than what he emphasized; he has liberal bona fides that Texans didn't hear much about, like his support for mass transit and carbon taxes.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think Senator Warren is after the Native American explainer video? It seemed like she was killing it with her policy proposals, with the sprinkling of staff in early states, and with capitalizing on women\u2019s anger at the Kavanaugh nomination. Since the video, some on the left view her as politically inept for the decision, even though many hold that view that past presidential candidates should have more boldly confronted their Swift boat/email scandals.\u201d \u2014 Johnny Khuu\n\nIt didn't go as well as Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren expected, obviously, though let's consider what her plan was. She dropped the video and DNA test two weeks before the midterms, understanding (even as many pundits did not) that it had no bearing on any campaign but her own. She won reelection in Massachusetts with 60.3 percent of the vote, and by the usual rules of campaigns, if you win election after a scandal, you beat the scandal. Warren's thinking on this has been that some portion of the state, and country, was always going to hate her, and when the moment came, she was going to deal with the issue \u2014 whether she falsely claimed Native American heritage to get a career advantage \u2014 in a way that put it to bed.\n\nThe problem, I think, is that Warren did not have the full support of her party the way that John Kerry did during the Swift boat attacks, because she's not the party's nominee. Only around 10 to 20 percent of primary voters in early states support her right now, and the similar number of voters who want Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to run again saw this as Warren proving she could not handle a 2020 campaign. (Listen to the Chapo Trap House discussion of this to see what I mean.) In my own trips to New Hampshire and South Carolina after the Warren video dropped, it definitely was the first issue voters brought up, though few said it was a dealbreaker for her campaign. (These were people who generally preferred other candidates.) I think this is going to get litigated by a metric that we know is not that solid \u2014 popularity polls and head-to-head matchups with President Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat's the history and likelihood of challengers preemptively teaming up as prez/VP tickets? Kamala Harris/Beto O'Rourke? Bernie Sanders/Cory Booker? Kirsten Gillibrand/Sherrod Brown? etc. Everyone wants to be at the top of the ticket, but do you think a team would have a better shot at fundraising, fusing fractious identity politicos, and fending off Trump (and other early challengers) if two joined?\u201d \u2014 Michael Read\n\nWell, the most recent example we have of this is ominous: The decision by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to run as a ticket with Carly Fiorina. You could argue that the hasty timing of that, right before the Indiana primary in 2016, discredited the whole idea by making it look like a ploy by a candidate (Cruz) who was losing to Trump; the early-ticket idea hasn't been employed at an early stage in a primary.\n\nThe question is really how any candidate, at any time, gets away with this without the appearance of gimmickry or desperation. The candidate who submits as a running mate does not bring with him/her all of his support; he/she looks like a sort of rescue candidate. It would be deeply surprising if anyone tried this before Iowa, and it would not be promising if they tried it later in the primary season.\n\n\u201cI recently started thinking about someone like [Minnesota Sen.] Amy Klobuchar who easily won reelection with a wide margin (although she did worse than 2012) who could also contest in the Democratic primary. Do you think a rather low-profile candidate (and I apologize to Sen. Klobuchar for calling her that, but I hope you get what I mean) stands a chance if the primaries would be filled with stars and rising stars like Beto, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Booker, and Harris?\u201d \u2014 Anonymous\n\nKlobuchar has a different and very specific problem: She represents a state that shares a long border with the first caucus state, Iowa. After 2016, I think it's foolhardy to predict, long in advance, who can and can't catch fire; in early states, you hear a decent amount of buzz about candidates who are seen as long shots, like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Candidates will need to raise tens of millions of dollars to reach the first \u201ctier,\u201d but unlike Republicans, Democrats face a stigma with their base if they launch any kind of super PAC. That's going to level some of this out.\n\nBut back to Klobuchar. As a Minnesotan, she can't afford anything less than a breakout win in Iowa. Ask Minnesota politicians Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann; if you can't win with a home-field advantage, you fade quickly.\n\n\"2020 will likely feature half as many caucuses as 2016, if not fewer. What are the likely other changes in the timing and rules governing contests going into this cycle? Is there finally enough pressure for reform in the registration rules in New York to remove obstacles to participation or is it too late to make those changes?\u201d \u2014 Solomon Steen\n\nThis is a great and underrated point. Just a handful of states will hold caucuses in 2020: Colorado, Idaho, Maine and Minnesota have abandoned them. Given how well Barack Obama did in those caucuses in 2008, and how narrowly he won the nomination, you could argue that he would have lost to Hillary Clinton that year but for the caucus system. This is going to change the math, in important ways, for organizing-focused candidates.\n\nNew York is possibly going to make up for that. Democrats had two pivotal state elections this year; a September primary that wiped out most of the \u201cIndependent Democratic\u201d senators who caucused with Republicans, and a November election that gave them a landslide majority in the next Senate. There have been bills designed to open up party registration, making it possible to show up at the polls and become a Democrat on primary day, a change that probably would have given Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) a chance at winning that state in 2016. But it needs to pass first.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nMississippi Senate. On the eve of her only debate with Democrat Mike Espy, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) launched new negative ads that feature Trump's attacks on Espy. The sharpest one: Trump citing Espy's 30-year-old vote for \u201ctaxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens,\u201d a way to characterize any health-care bill that does not go out of its way to exclude noncitizens.\n\nThe antiabortion Susan B. Anthony List, which played in a number of red state Senate races this cycle, is also up with a spot highlighting Espy's support for abortion rights bills.\n\nAnd the Senate Majority PAC's first buy attacks Hyde-Smith as a lobbyist who'd make health care worse.\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nWho should be the next speaker of the House? (CBS News, 356 Democrats)\n\nNancy Pelosi - 49%\n\nAnother Democrat - 40%\n\nThis poll, and the next one, capture the dynamics of the attempt to dislodge Nancy Pelosi before the election for speaker in six weeks. No poll has found a majority of Democrats opposed to Pelosi, who is marginally more popular than she was during the 2010 loss of the House but less popular than she was when she first won the job in 2007. Asked if they prefer \"someone else\" for the job, with no name provided, two in five Democrats are willing to consider it.\n\nWould you like to see Nancy Pelosi become the next Speaker? (Quinnipiac, 345 Democrats)\n\nYes - 53%\n\nNo- 27%\n\nAsk the same question about Pelosi, but don't suggest a name, and the support for an alternative plunges. Quinnipiac's crosstabs also suggest that Pelosi has more potential support than it seems at first; just 54 percent of \"liberal\" Democrats support Pelosi. That's consistent with a dynamic you see on social media, with plenty of liberal and left-wing Democrats, frustrated by Pelosi's support for \"pay-go\" rules and tax hike caps, asking if a more liberal candidate could run for the job. But the announced opposition to Pelosi skews to the party's center-right; if the choice is seen as Pelosi or a more Wall Street-friendly Democrat, you'd probably see liberal support cohere behind the leader.\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nJohn Delaney speaks in Panora, Iowa, on Aug. 9. (Rachel Mummey for The Washington Post)\n\nOur occasional sit-downs with declared presidential candidates continued this week when Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), the first Democrat to announce a 2020 White House bid, called to answer some questions. (Previously: West Virginia state Sen. Richard Ojeda.)\n\nWashington Post: Tell us what you're building in Iowa right now. How much of a campaign will you have on the ground by January, when you start getting more company?\n\nJohn Delaney: We have 15 people now, and we\u2019re extending offers as we speak. We\u2019re using this time to hire some of the good people we met in Iowa over the last year, as we campaigned in all 99 counties. Our goal is 25 people on the ground on our staff, and we think that is going to happen very soon.\n\nWP: So, having spent that much time on the ground: Why did Democrats lose the race for governor? The Des Moines Register poll is not wrong that often, and it had Governor Kim Reynolds (a Republican) behind, but she won; Democrats didn't gain much ground in rural Iowa.\n\nJD: Obviously I was disappointed that [Democratic nominee] Fred Hubbell didn\u2019t win. If you told people that Democrats would gain two House seats and Fred wouldn't win, they'd have been very, very surprised; so, relative to House races, we can say that he had a better opponent. I don\u2019t chalk it up to much more than that. Governor Reynolds obviously ran a better campaign than it looked to us from our side. And a lot of the races we lost were close. Rob Sand won the auditor's race, and he was a fantastic candidate.\n\nWP: Rob is someone whose campaign team is getting calls from prospective candidates for president right now. Why should those people look at the election result and look to you as the best presidential candidate?\n\nJD: My take is that moderate Democrats who were trying to run as the candidates of a big-tent party did really well. Look at most of the new members who are coming to Congress right now; it's clear where the winning strategy lies if we want to be a party that wins. I don't think that strategy involves falling into a battle over who's more progressive. I think the strategy starts with being solutions oriented, and I don't think there's any other conclusion from the election.\n\nWP: Do you agree with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Democrats who suggest that some races, especially Stacey Abrams's race in Georgia, were effectively stolen by voter suppression?\n\nJD: I think voter suppression is a huge issue. Money in politics, voter suppression, that's been the Republican playbook for a few decades, and it's deeply harmful.\n\nWP: Was the Georgia race stolen?\n\nJD: Obviously what happened in Georgia is very concerning, very concerning, but I\u2019m not on the ground there.\n\nWP: You're leaving the House, obviously, but you've said that as president, you'd spend your first 100 days on bipartisan legislation only. What do you make of the rules changes that moderate Democrats are asking for if Pelosi becomes speaker, specifically a supermajority to raise taxes on people making less than the top 20 percent?\n\nJD: The Congress has the power to raise revenue, and we shouldn\u2019t change the voting rules. I do think if two-thirds of members sign onto a bill, it should automatically get a vote. If that rule existed, we\u2019d have had comprehensive gun reform done years ago. That's the supermajority rule that makes sense to me. I think whether it's done by this Congress or the next one, you can get infrastructure and criminal justice reform with a broad majority. The country is clearly going toward progressive values, but we've got to find them through common ground.\n\nWP: Do you agree with the liberals who want to expand the Supreme Court, who worry that Trump's appointments have otherwise locked in a conservative majority?\n\nJD: I haven\u2019t settled on an answer to that. Some of the ideas people have talked about, term limits and staggered appointments, those are interesting. My position right now is, first, to win the White House, then to put up Supreme Court justices with broad appeal. When FDR tried to expand the court, it was the one thing he couldn\u2019t get through, and he started losing votes.\n\nWP: What about giving statehood to D.C. and Puerto Rico?\n\nJD: I\u2019m entirely supportive of that. It\u2019s ridiculous that citizens in D.C. don't get full voting rights. You can put a \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d sticker on my bus.\n\nWP: Do you think the Democratic Party, after the election we just went through, is looking for a white male nominee?\n\nJD: A: I think people are rightly striving for greater equality in this country, and I consider myself part of the social justice movement. We still don\u2019t have equality of opportunity. We still have too much discrimination and racism. But in a Democratic primary, I don't think this is what people are going to base their decisions on. People are going to look at the candidates.\n\nWP: Michael Avenatti is in a legal battle right now with an ex-girlfriend who claims he abused her. Should he stay out of the presidential race?\n\nJD: I said something to you in Iowa when you asked me about him a few months ago. What was it?\n\nWP: You said, \u201cnext?\u201d\n\nJD: Yeah, and I would say that again.\n\n2020\n\nCory Booker.

But this is not because of false promises made by Brexit supporters; it is because the negotiations on the British side have been led by a Remain-supporting prime minister backed by a Remain-supporting chancellor of the exchequer and a Remain-supporting, unelected civil servant who has been put in charge of the negotiations over the head of two Brexit secretaries. These three see Brexit as a problem rather than an opportunity, and have consistently caved in to the European Union\u2019s demands rather than negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nTo take just one example, there is no legal basis for Britain to have to pay a so-called divorce bill. The offer to pay this money should have been withheld until the outlines of a fairer deal became clear. But that would have required leaders with Churchillian qualities; they are not in evidence in the current British government.\n\nPeter Fisher, Fredericksburg"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Brian Fung, Tony Romm", "title": "The FCC has a new plan to combat unwanted robocalls and spammy texts", "description": "But critics say it could lead to censorship of legitimate messages.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/20/fcc-has-new-plan-combat-unwanted-robocalls-spammy-texts/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hW2nz9kzRC9ef6-vXHwFYX1KiYI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZXRFX4VLUII6RGT5ZUYFAT7ZAI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:40:49Z", "content": "The U.S. government said Tuesday that it plans to take aim at the scourge of unwelcome phone calls and spam text messages plaguing millions of consumers but one of its proposals drew sharp rebukes, with critics concerned that it could enable telecom giants to\u2026 [+5780 chars]", "fulltext": "The U.S. government said Tuesday that it plans to take aim at the scourge of unwelcome phone calls and spam text messages plaguing millions of consumers \u2014 but one of its proposals drew sharp rebukes, with critics concerned that it could enable telecom giants to censor legitimate communications.\n\nThe first measure, announced by the Federal Communications Commission, aims to create a national database containing information about phone numbers that have recently been disconnected and reassigned to someone else. The effort aims to help businesses, such as banks and pharmacies, avoid dialing the wrong customers repeatedly.\n\nThe second, more controversial measure, however, would give text messaging the same legal status as high-speed Internet, in effect offering wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon added leeway to block and filter text messages they recognize as spam.\n\nCombined, the two proposals could cut down on unwanted robo-calls and texts by empowering telecom companies to fight spam and by placing renewed expectations on businesses to look before they dial, said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who will bring the measures up for a vote in December.\n\nBut Pai\u2019s plan targeting texts, in particular, drew fury from Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who slammed his rationale as \u201cbogus doublespeak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought to you by the same agency that gave broadband providers the right to censor your online activity by rolling back net neutrality,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNow, the agency wants consumers to believe that giving cell phone companies the ability to block your text messages is a good thing. This makes no sense.\u201d\n\nDetailing his plans on Tuesday, Pai stressed in a blog post that the FCC aims \u201cto help shield consumers from unwanted contacts on their phones, no matter what kind of contact it is.\u201d Earlier this month, he also warned AT&T, Verizon and other telecom giants that the agency would \u201ctake action\u201d in 2019 if the industry fails to adopt additional robo-call protections of its own.\n\nTo clear up how carriers may handle spam texts, the agency said it hopes to classify text messages as a lightly regulated information service \u2014 the same legal category that the FCC applies to regulate Internet access. If adopted, it would be the first time the agency has given text messaging a formal classification, senior officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe move marks a setback for the cloud-based communications company Twilio, which in 2015 asked the FCC to impose stricter rules on text messaging so that competing wireless carriers could not block its services. That petition would be denied should the FCC move forward with Pai\u2019s plan. In a statement Tuesday, the company said it \u201cwill be reviewing the FCC decision in detail when it is released.\u201d\n\nPai\u2019s move drew further fire from the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, which said the government had already made abundantly clear in 2016 that wireless carriers had narrow permission to block and filter unwanted texts. The new measure could instead give telecom companies wider latitude to block even legitimate text messages, said Public Knowledge, which submitted its own petition on the matter in 2007 and had supported Twilio\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the holiday season without Chairman Pai giving a great big gift basket to corporate special interests at the expense of American consumers,\u201d said Public Knowledge Senior Vice President Harold Feld. \u201cChairman Pai\u2019s action would give carriers unlimited freedom to censor any speech they consider \u2018controversial,\u2019 as Verizon did in 2007 when it blocked NARAL.\u201d\n\nVerizon quickly reversed course and unblocked the group\u2019s texts hours after the incident came to light. But the episode raised questions about the power of the telecom industry to discriminate against Americans and control their speech, Public Knowledge said in its 2007 petition.\n\nPai said the forthcoming \u201cdecision would keep the floodgates to a torrent of spam texts closed, remove regulatory uncertainty, and empower providers to continue finding innovative ways to protect consumers from unwanted text messages.\u201d Other supporters of Pai\u2019s proposal, such as the National Emergency Number Association, warned that 911 dispatchers could someday be \u201cinundated\u201d with spam texts if the FCC did not approve the measure.\n\nWith its proposed phone number database, meanwhile, the FCC is targeting \u201clegitimate businesses\u201d \u2014 including pharmacies that auto-dial customers to inform them that their prescriptions are ready, for example, or credit card companies that robo-call their cardholders with payment reminders. If it\u2019s adopted, carriers would pool their knowledge about people who have changed their numbers into a searchable portal so that the new owners of that number don\u2019t receive unwanted calls.\n\nTo senior FCC officials, the effort is meant to spare consumers from annoyances while helping businesses avoid lawsuits under federal rules to combat robo-calls. Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have supported the adoption of such a database, as have consumer advocates, including the National Consumer Law Center. Margot Freeman Saunders, senior counsel at the NCLC, said Tuesday that it could \u201chelp consumers quite a bit by stopping unwanted calls.\u201d\n\nMany details of its implementation, however, are unresolved, including how the FCC plans to enforce it. The FCC also opted against rewriting all of the government\u2019s anti-robo-call rules, after a court challenge \u2014 chiefly brought by a trade association of debt collectors \u2014 tossed regulations adopted under President Barack Obama. Agency officials said such an overhaul is coming.\n\nReports of unwanted phone calls are rising. Nearly half of all cellphone calls next year will be spam, according to projections by First Orion, a caller ID firm.\n\nJust 2.8 percent of text messages are spam, Pai wrote in his blog post. But, he added, that\u2019s because wireless carriers have been working to block the unwanted messages and need greater certainty that their efforts will not result in an FCC violation."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump", "title": "A candidate photographed in Confederate garb could be a scandal.

What would seem to be a layup for the Republican Party \u2014 a Republican running in a special election in a deep-red state \u2014 has become complicated by a series of controversies into which Hyde-Smith has stumbled.\n\nFirst, she was recorded making a joke about being willing to be in the front row at a public hanging, a comment that is particularly ill-advised given Mississippi\u2019s history with lynching and that Hyde-Smith is running against a black man. Then she was recorded suggesting that it was a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to make it harder for liberals to vote, again stumbling over a fraught subject, given concerns about the suppression of votes in Georgia and Florida, particularly black voters.\n\nOn Monday, a Twitter user posted an image of a 2014 Facebook post showing Hyde-Smith wearing a hat typical of Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. Her visit to the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library in Biloxi, she wrote, was \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d\n\nIn this photo Cindy Hyde-Smith poses with what appears to be a Confederate hat and weapon.

Coming after Hyde-Smith\u2019s other problems \u2014 which have Republicans increasingly worried about her viability \u2014 it seems particularly challenging.\n\nThat may not be the case. A casual embrace of the Confederacy certainly wouldn\u2019t play that well in, say, Massachusetts. But how problematic is it in the Deep South?\n\nOver the past 12 months, it\u2019s primarily Southern states that have shown the most interest in the Confederacy in Google searches. The state that showed the least relative search interest in the subject (save Hawaii) was New York. The state that was most interested in it? Mississippi.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s a sort of abstract metric. We have data from a 2015 Post-ABC News poll that provides a bit more explicit insight into views of Confederate iconography. At that point, with a national debate roiling over the display of the Confederate flag after the racist massacre of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C., we asked Americans whether displays of the flag should be allowed on public property. In the Northeast, most people supported a ban on their display. In the West, responses were about mixed.\n\nIn the South \u2014 and only in the South \u2014 was there more opposition to a ban than support.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat massacre spurred a broad reexamination of Confederate monuments nationally, with several states removing statues and flags that had been erected \u2014 mostly in the Civil Rights era \u2014 to pay tribute to the rebellious South.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Ingraham wrote in June, though, Mississippi removed only two of its 149 monuments, one of the lowest removal rates in the country.\n\n\n\n(Christopher Ingraham/The Washington Post)\n\nNone of those data points is conclusive, certainly, but it does suggest that an embrace of the Confederacy in the South broadly and Mississippi in particular may not be disqualifying.\n\nInterestingly, a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that the gulf in opinion on removing the Confederate battle flag from public places was wider between Democrats and Republicans than between white and black Americans.\n\nMost Americans had little reaction, positive or negative, to the display of the Confederate battle flag, though the percentage of white Americans who expressed a positive reaction to seeing the Confederate battle flag displayed had doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nLast year, President Trump tried to soften the political fallout of his response to the killing of a woman protesting racism in Charlottesville by claiming that the demonstration where she died was primarily about the removal of Confederate monuments and not about the white nationalism embraced by many of those at the original protest. That was a much more tenable position, with even Democrats split on the removal of Confederate monuments, according to NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist polling.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s nationally, not just in the Southern states where the Confederacy actually existed. (The same poll found that Republicans were only slightly more likely to say they mostly disagreed with the beliefs of white nationalists as with the beliefs of the Black Lives Matter movement.)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say categorically, given the data above, what reaction the photo of Hyde-Smith must spur in Mississippi. It seems safe to argue, though, that the reaction might be relatively muted.\n\nOr that it at least would have been if it were the first problematic thing to emerge."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "A candidate photographed in Confederate garb could be a scandal.

Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s (R-Miss.) bid to permanently replace retired senator Thad Cochran depends on winning a runoff contest against Democrat Mike Espy in a week\u2019s time. What would seem to be a layup for the Republican Party \u2014 a Republican running in a special election in a deep-red state \u2014 has become complicated by a series of controversies into which Hyde-Smith has stumbled.\n\nFirst, she was recorded making a joke about being willing to be in the front row at a public hanging, a comment that is particularly ill-advised given Mississippi\u2019s history with lynching and that Hyde-Smith is running against a black man. Then she was recorded suggesting that it was a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to make it harder for liberals to vote, again stumbling over a fraught subject, given concerns about the suppression of votes in Georgia and Florida, particularly black voters.\n\nOn Monday, a Twitter user posted an image of a 2014 Facebook post showing Hyde-Smith wearing a hat typical of Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. Her visit to the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library in Biloxi, she wrote, was \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d\n\nIn this photo Cindy Hyde-Smith poses with what appears to be a Confederate hat and weapon. Any #twitterstorians care to weigh in? pic.twitter.com/NaEBkzwBWj \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) November 20, 2018\n\nIn the context of modern politics and this election cycle, such a photo seems problematic for a candidate. Coming after Hyde-Smith\u2019s other problems \u2014 which have Republicans increasingly worried about her viability \u2014 it seems particularly challenging.\n\nThat may not be the case. A casual embrace of the Confederacy certainly wouldn\u2019t play that well in, say, Massachusetts. But how problematic is it in the Deep South?\n\nOver the past 12 months, it\u2019s primarily Southern states that have shown the most interest in the Confederacy in Google searches. The state that showed the least relative search interest in the subject (save Hawaii) was New York. The state that was most interested in it? Mississippi.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s a sort of abstract metric. We have data from a 2015 Post-ABC News poll that provides a bit more explicit insight into views of Confederate iconography. At that point, with a national debate roiling over the display of the Confederate flag after the racist massacre of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C., we asked Americans whether displays of the flag should be allowed on public property. In the Northeast, most people supported a ban on their display. In the West, responses were about mixed.\n\nIn the South \u2014 and only in the South \u2014 was there more opposition to a ban than support.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat massacre spurred a broad reexamination of Confederate monuments nationally, with several states removing statues and flags that had been erected \u2014 mostly in the Civil Rights era \u2014 to pay tribute to the rebellious South.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Ingraham wrote in June, though, Mississippi removed only two of its 149 monuments, one of the lowest removal rates in the country.\n\n\n\n(Christopher Ingraham/The Washington Post)\n\nNone of those data points is conclusive, certainly, but it does suggest that an embrace of the Confederacy in the South broadly and Mississippi in particular may not be disqualifying.\n\nInterestingly, a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that the gulf in opinion on removing the Confederate battle flag from public places was wider between Democrats and Republicans than between white and black Americans.\n\nMost Americans had little reaction, positive or negative, to the display of the Confederate battle flag, though the percentage of white Americans who expressed a positive reaction to seeing the Confederate battle flag displayed had doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n\n(Pew Research Center)\n\nLast year, President Trump tried to soften the political fallout of his response to the killing of a woman protesting racism in Charlottesville by claiming that the demonstration where she died was primarily about the removal of Confederate monuments and not about the white nationalism embraced by many of those at the original protest. That was a much more tenable position, with even Democrats split on the removal of Confederate monuments, according to NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist polling.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s nationally, not just in the Southern states where the Confederacy actually existed. (The same poll found that Republicans were only slightly more likely to say they mostly disagreed with the beliefs of white nationalists as with the beliefs of the Black Lives Matter movement.)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say categorically, given the data above, what reaction the photo of Hyde-Smith must spur in Mississippi. It seems safe to argue, though, that the reaction might be relatively muted.\n\nOr that it at least would have been if it were the first problematic thing to emerge."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Erik Wemple", "title": "\u2018Enemy of the state\u2019: The chilling and familiar term for Jamal Khashoggi in Trump\u2019s statement", "description": "Does the president even realize the echo?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/20/enemy-of-the-state-the-chilling-and-familiar-term-for-jamal-khashoggi-in-trumps-statement/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RafyKRTZY1DgNDFrissSfpZD7fo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JLJ7JLFGME7FFEMGAAFM4JZLEY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:37:35Z", "content": "The White House is calling it a statement, though confession may be a better term for this abominable collection of words from President Trump.

It\u2019s a confession that Trump rejects the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman orchestrated the brutal murder of Post columnist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi. It\u2019s a confession that money matters more than humanity. It\u2019s a confession that Trump, or whoever was the author, cannot write.\n\nIt\u2019s also a confession \u2014 right there in black and white \u2014 regarding the criminal power of Trump\u2019s very own rhetoric against journalism. Have a look:\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body. Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nBolding inserted to highlight an assertion replete with circuitous and weaselly slander. Note how Trump repeats the Saudi \u201cposition\u201d on Khashoggi without refuting it. He seems to be saying that even though Khashoggi may indeed have been an enemy of the state, his killing was \u201cunacceptable and horrible.\u201d\n\nThe merits here have been addressed by The Post, which cited experts as indicating that Khashoggi was once sympathetic to Islamist movements but evolved later in life toward \u201ca more liberal, secular point of view.\u201d David Ignatius, a Post columnist, traced Khashoggi\u2019s early flirtations with the Muslim Brotherhood and his subsequent disenchantment with it. \u201cKhashoggi\u2019s path took him through risky territory,\u201d Ignatius wrote. \u201cHe was friendly with Osama bin Laden in his militant youth; his patron in midcareer was Prince Turki al-Faisal, the longtime Saudi intelligence chief; he traveled sometimes to Qatar in the past decade, as a poisonous feud grew between Riyadh and Doha. But his public writings and private messages show that in his head and heart, he was always a Saudi patriot.\u201d And in a Brookings piece, Tamara Cofman Wittes points to this dynamic while also reminding everyone: \u201c[E]ven if you believe that Jamal Khashoggi was a full-bore Brotherhood member with an agenda of Islamization for the Arab world, you should still condemn his apparent assassination for the crime of speaking his mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a short walk from \u201cenemy of the state\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s description of the Saudis\u2019 position on Khashoggi \u2014 to \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d Trump\u2019s very own moniker for the allegedly \u201cfake news media\u201d that churns out so much (deservedly) negative coverage about him. Nor does Trump stop and scold the Saudis for deploying such a term against a journalist/dissident.\n\nThe rhetorical connection isn\u2019t hard to trace: \u201cWhat\u2019s truly chilling about that is it\u2019s the same language that Donald Trump uses to describe American journalists. So he just described a journalist who was literally chopped into pieces in a third country in the same way that he describes people who sit in the briefing room and ask him questions,\u201d said former Obama White House official Ben Rhodes on MSNBC on Tuesday afternoon."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/nelson.pressley", "title": "Trump's presidential turkey pardon felt like a reality show meets absurdist theater - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trump's presidential turkey pardon felt like a reality show meets absurdist theater Washington Post In theater, the definition of a \u201cturkey\u201d is a disaster that can't be saved.

Does that apply to the perpetually peculiar presidential Thanksgiving turkey pardoning? Can Donald Trump do whimsy?\n\nPerforming America\u2019s pre-dinner theater demands it, topped with a dollop of sincerity. Weird as it is, there is reassurance in routine \u2014 as travel and grocery shopping logistics pile up, you sort of want to glance at this novelty act and hear healing words for just a moment \u2014 and on Tuesday in the Rose Garden, the president played the role of hardball politician softening for the week\u2019s holiday pretty much by the book. He joshed about the annual event\u2019s brand-new \u201creality show\u201d wrinkle of public voting between two turkeys named Peas and Carrots to see which one gets, you might say, the embrace.\n\n\u201cThe winner of this vote was decided by a fair and open election conducted on the White House website,\u201d the president announced as the first lady looked on. \u201cThis was a fair election. Unfortunately, Carrots refused to concede and demanded a recount, and we\u2019re still fighting with Carrots.\u201d\n\nDemocrats might not honor these pardons, Trump warned. Watch out for a reversal by that dastardly Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, he said, as another court was reversing his administration\u2019s asylum policy.\n\nThis elbow in the ribs had a sharp Trumpian edge but fits within the established script for turkey pardoning, which, in this 2018 edition, lasted a fleet eight minutes. Beltway quips, some earnest platitudes (\u201cAll joking aside, this is a time for Americans to unite together in a spirit of love, understanding, unity and joy as one very proud American family\u201d), then the main course. \u201cI hereby grant you a full pardon,\u201d the president said, stepping toward the turkey named Peas as the assembled crowd dutifully laughed.\n\nThe online vote barely made a ripple in this benign sideshow. (It may be best viewed as a kids\u2019 event; Trump went on about its roots in Tad Lincoln\u2019s pleading to his father, Abraham, to spare a turkey\u2019s life.) Yet absurdity inevitably flavors everything touching this tongue-in-cheek melodrama of \u201csaved\u201d turkeys. Peas, interested voters learned in bios posted on the White House website, has a \u201cgobble style\u201d categorized as \u201cboisterous,\u201d while the gobble of Carrots is rated \u201cstrong and confident.\u201d Peas likes Brad Paisley. Carrots digs Elvis.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump pardons Peas the turkey during the presentation of the National Thanksgiving turkey at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nCarrots enjoys yoga and M&Ms. Peas prefers popcorn and watching airplanes. That is plenty of information to vote on.\n\nThese birds are groomed for the limelight, and they are even named according to a theatrical custom: What do actors in crowd scenes traditionally murmur to replicate a general hubbub? \u201cPeas and carrots, peas and carrots.\u201d The president\u2019s explanation for the name was funnier because it was so cryptic: \u201cI am pleased to announce that today\u2019s lucky bird and guest of honor is named Peas, along with his alternate, named Carrots,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe children will understand that.\u201d\n\nPeas and Carrots practiced their roles in South Dakota, so they would be seasoned performers prepared for Washington\u2019s pressure-cooker stage. Before their White House gig, they lodged in style at the Willard Hotel.\n\n\u201cExtremely lucky birds,\u201d Trump noted.\n\nAll this taps into the something deeply loony that hangs on Thanksgiving\u2019s beak like a snood. Thanksgiving inspired the legendary \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati\u201d episode \u201cTurkeys Away,\u201d with the radio station promoting itself by generously dropping free live turkeys onto startled Ohioans from a helicopter. Thanksgiving gave us the brilliantly daffy \u201cTurkey Lurkey Time\u201d dance in the 1969 musical \u201cPromises, Promises\u201d (thank you, Donna McKechnie), plus a thread in \u201cWest Wing\u201d when President Bartlet wondered whether pardoning birds would make him seem \u201csoft on turkeys.\u201d\n\nSay it like Spike Lee did in \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\u201d: \u201cIs this your first turkey?\u201d\n\nDavid Mamet\u2019s presidential farce \u201cNovember\u201d has never been professionally staged in Washington \u2014 that\u2019s how wildly politically incorrect it is \u2014 though it ran for half an election year on Broadway in 2008 with Nathan Lane as a cocksure, bumbling, unpopular and unapologetic incumbent desperate to raise funds for a reelection campaign. Where can he get money? Maybe, just maybe, through the turkey pardoning. Shake down the poultry industry for, say, $200 million, or else tell the public that what really happened with the Pilgrims and the Indians involved another food: tuna.\n\nWhat happens to Mamet\u2019s turkeys is a riot, and it\u2019s effortless comedy because it mines the zany premise we know to be true. Pardoning a turkey?\n\n\u201cWhat did it do?\u201d the \u201cNovember\u201d president asks in a rare innocent moment.\n\nThe play, with its conflicts about same-sex marriage and border walls, ends with reconciliation all around, for comedy resolves with marriages and with kingdoms made whole. That\u2019s the intended gesture with this slight, and slightly ham-handed, nugget of Americana. \u201cThanksgiving is a time of great American traditions, and today we continue a very special one when a lucky turkey gets a presidential pardon,\u201d Trump said, pretty much as presidents do. Then, the personal touch: \u201cThat turkey is so lucky. I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful turkey.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bear scrutiny, but so what? Grant a pardon.

He reported that he had two liabilities of between $10,000 and $15,000 in 2017 \u2014 both credit card accounts.\n\nThe disclosure report covers 2016 through October 2017, when Whitaker started at the Justice Department. Although Whitaker first signed it in November 2017, the report was revised several times after he took over as acting attorney general in the wake of Sessions\u2019s ouster.\n\n[Conservative nonprofit with obscure roots and undisclosed funders paid Matthew Whitaker $1.2 million]\n\nWhitaker filed another disclosure in 2018, covering only the previous calendar year. It lists similar sources of income but does not reference World Patent Marketing.\n\nIn addition to facing scrutiny from the FTC, World Patent Marketing had been separately probed by the FBI. A Justice Department spokeswoman has said, \u201cActing attorney general Matt Whitaker has said he was not aware of any fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the company\u2019s advisory board, Whitaker collected about $10,000 in fees, court documents show, and he personally intervened when a consumer complaint website posted comments critical of the company. A receiver appointed to oversee World Patent Marketing said he wrote to Whitaker and other paid members of the advisory board to ask that they return the fees they had received. Whitaker did not respond.\n\nEven before his financial disclosure was made public, Whitaker\u2019s finances had come under intense scrutiny.\n\nOver the past two decades, Whitaker owned a day-care center, a concrete supply business and a trailer manufacturer; served as the U.S. attorney in Iowa; and before coming to the Justice Department to be Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, did legal commentary and led the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which described itself as a watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials.\n\nWhitaker also was involved in a taxpayer-subsidized effort to rehabilitate an apartment building for affordable housing in Des Moines but made little progress \u2014 frustrating city leaders \u2014 and ultimately walked away from the project.\n\n[Whitaker\u2019s unusual path to Justice Department included owning day-care center, trailer maker and concrete supplier]\n\nDemocrats and others have separately raised questions about whether Whitaker can legally hold the position of acting attorney general because he has not been confirmed by the Senate, and whether he might seek to interfere with the special-counsel probe into Russian election interference, of which he had been publicly critical. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to explore Whitaker\u2019s communications with the White House, saying he was concerned that the acting attorney general might have shared with President Trump information about that investigation.\n\nRosalind S.

(Eric Gay/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Using thousands of military troops to help secure the Southwest border will cost an estimated $210 million under current plans, the Pentagon told Congress on Tuesday, even as questions arose about the scope and duration of the controversial mission.\n\nThe total includes $72 million for approximately 5,900 active-duty troops providing support to Customs and Border Protection, plus $138 million so far for 2,100 National Guard troops who have been performing a separate border mission since April, according to a report sent to Congress on Tuesday but not released by the Pentagon.\n\nA copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press. After the AP published its story the Pentagon released a statement confirming the active-duty portion of the deployments is estimated at $72 million. It did not mention the $138 million in National Guard costs.\n\nThe total would grow beyond the current combined estimate of $210 million if the active-duty mission is extended beyond the current completion date of Dec. 15. Officials said an extension appeared likely but had not yet been agreed upon.\n\nThe Pentagon also was working on a potential adjustment to the mission that would give the active-duty troops who are operating in Texas, Arizona and California the authority to defend Customs and Border Protection personnel if necessary. The troops, who include military police, are currently authorized to defend themselves.\n\nAbout 2,800 of the active-duty troops are in South Texas, far from the main migrant caravan in Tijuana, Mexico, south of California. The movement of the Central American migrants into Mexico in October was the stated reason that President Donald Trump ordered the military to provide support for Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTrump, who called the migrant caravan an \u201cinvasion,\u201d has been accused by critics, including some retired military officers, of using the military deployment as a political tool in the run-up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said Tuesday the Pentagon\u2019s cost report shows the mission was a \u201ccharade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese soldiers spent weeks away from home and the Pentagon wasted millions of taxpayer dollars so President Trump could stoke fears of asylum seekers and try to influence election results,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing our military men and women as political pawns to support an anti-immigrant agenda is a low point, even for this president.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he was sure the troops are happy to be on the border mission, even though it means being away from home over Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Thanksgiving. These are tough people,\u201d Trump told reporters before flying to Florida for the holiday. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019re great and they\u2019ve done a great job. You\u2019re so worried about the Thanksgiving holiday for them. They are so proud to be representing our country on the border where if you look at what\u2019s happening, Mexico, the people from Tijuana are saying, wow these are tough people. They\u2019re fighting us.\u201d\n\nIf, as expected, the mission is extended beyond Dec. 14, at least some of the troops are likely also to be away for Christmas.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis has declined to publicly discuss cost estimates for the border mission, saying as recently as last week that he had little confidence in the accuracy of figures he had seen thus far.\n\n\u201cWe can estimate costs all we want, I\u2019d prefer to give you real costs. Right now, I can\u2019t give that to you,\u201d Mattis told reporters last Wednesday when he flew to Texas to see the military\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of deploying them, it\u2019s the cost of transferring their equipment to the border, it\u2019s fuel costs, it\u2019s all those kinds of costs. So, I just don\u2019t want to get into something I can\u2019t give you what I believe confidently is accurate.\u201d\n\nIn its report to Congress on Tuesday, the Pentagon said it expects the deployment of 5,900 active-duty troops through Dec. 15 to cost $72 million, while adding that the mission, which is now three weeks old, is still being refined. The cost includes $19 million for personnel, $20 million for transportation of personnel, equipment and supplies, $28 in operating expenses and $5 million for concertina wire and other border barrier materials.\n\n\u201cThe total cost of the operation has yet to be determined and will depend on the total size, duration and scope,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt said that as of Nov. 14, about $14 million in actual payments for expenses such as travel, supplies and transportation had been reported by the units involved.\n\nThe National Guard\u2019s border mission, which is being conducted by troops for numerous states, has cost an estimated $138 million as of Tuesday, the Pentagon report said. That mission, involving about 2,100 troops, began in April.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Uruguay strikers Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez were shut down by the French defenders but the world champions rarely threatened.\n\n\u201cWe needed this, we finished the year on a good note after what we went through this summer,\u201d Giroud said. \u201cWe are a bit disappointed we did not qualify for the final four, but we wanted to show a good reaction and we did it.\u201d\n\nMbappe was at the heart of most of France\u2019s chances before his injury. He missed a good chance 15 minutes in when he collected a pass from Antoine Griezmann and broke into the box but completely fluffed his shot.\n\nHe hurt his shoulder on the half-hour mark after he failed to convert another one-one-one with Uruguay keeper Martin Campana, who dived at his feet to block the ball. Mbappe fell over after making contact with Campana and landed awkwardly on his right shoulder, forcing Deschamps to substitute him for Florian Thauvin.\n\nFrance continued to push after the interval and was awarded a penalty in the 52nd minute after Martin Caceres was penalized for a handball in the box. Giroud converted his 33rd international goal with a low shot to the right of Campana.\n\nUruguay substitute Jonathan Rodriguez had a good chance to level with seven minutes left when Cavani picked him out unmarked in the box but he mishit his volley.\n\n\u201cIt was not perfect, but we played far better than in our previous match,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cIt was important to finish on a positive note.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I haven\u2019t been told that, but it\u2019s evident there\u2019s going to be a change in the very near future,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cTo look back on the games that we played, the players that we\u2019ve exposed to this level, that we brought forth, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s going to pay dividends down the line. So for me I feel as though when the next person comes in, they\u2019re going to have a great starting point and that makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nNew U.S. general manager Earnie Stewart has said a new coach will be hired later this year, and Columbus Crew coach Gregg Berhalter is the favorite. The new coach will take over for a January training camp followed by a pair of friendlies, and his first competitive matches will be next June at the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nNine of the 11 U.S. starters were 23 or younger, and the lineup\u2019s average age of 22 years, 71 days was an American record low, besting the 22-160 against Bolivia on May 28.\n\nEthan Horvath, on his home field for Club Brugge, made his first international appearance since January and had five saves before the goal by Politano, a 25-year-old winger playing his second match for the Azzurri. Politano passed to Marco Verratti about 25 yards above the penalty arc and sprinted through the penalty area. Roberto Gagliardini beat defender Aaron Long to Verratti\u2019s feed into the area and poked the ball ahead to the onrushing Politano, who cut past Jorge Villafana, touched the ball from his left foot to his right and beat Horvath from 8 yards.\n\nPulisic was the only holdover in the U.S. starting lineup from last Thursday\u2019s 3-0 loss at England. At 20 years, 63 days, Pulisic bettered Landon Donovan, who was 22 years, 220 days when he first captained the Americans in a World Cup qualifier at El Salvador on Oct. 9, 2004, a match regular captain Claudio Reyna missed because of a quadriceps injury.\n\nBefore last week, Pulisic had played just once for the U.S. since the defeat at Trinidad, sidelined by minor injuries and taking time off from the national team to concentrate on his club career with Borussia Dortmund in Germany. Pulisic was moved from wide midfield to forward in a 3-5-2 formation against Italy. The new coach will face the issue of where to deploy Pulisic, who usually is wide for Dortmund.\n\nThe U.S. finished with three wins, five losses and three draws in 2018, its fewest games in a year since going 1-2 in 1987, all that June at the President\u2019s Cup in South Korea. The Americans have one win and three draws in 12 matches against Italy.\n\nNotes: The U.S. will play Costa Rica in an exhibition on Feb. 2 at Avaya Stadium in San Jose, California.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Scott Heppell/Associated Press)\n\nMADRID \u2014 Two years after being recognized by UEFA, Kosovo has given itself a chance to make it to the 2020 European Championship.\n\nThe small Balkan republic routed Azerbaijan 4-0 in Pristina on Tuesday to cap an impressive campaign in the inaugural UEFA Nations League and secure at least a playoff spot in qualifying for Euro 2020.\n\nThe triumph comes only two months after Kosovo defeated the Faeroe Islands 2-0 for its first competitive win since being admitted to UEFA and FIFA events in 2016.\n\nAfter winning two other matches in the lower-tiered League D, Kosovo entered the final round in Group 3 needing at least a draw to finish in first place and guarantee the playoff berth.\n\nArber Zeneli scored a hat trick and Amir Rrahmani added another goal to keep Kosovo unbeaten and at the top of the group. It finished with 14 points from six matches, five points in front of second-place Azerbaijan.\n\nPlaying in the playoffs could give Kosovo a shortcut to Euro 2020 as it is unlikely to qualify directly from its group. It ended last in its European qualifying group for the 2018 World Cup with only one point from 10 matches.\n\nMaking it to Euro 2020 would be a huge sporting success for the country, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. The competition will be played in cities across Europe, including in some countries which still don\u2019t recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence.\n\nIn the top-tier League A, Final Four host Portugal ended the group stage with a 1-1 home draw against relegated Poland, while Sweden gained promotion from League B by defeating visiting Russia 2-0. Scotland moved up from League C by coming from behind to defeat Israel at home, as did Serbia after a 4-1 win over relegated Lithuania.\n\nAll group winners in the four leagues are guaranteed a place in the playoffs for Euro 2020.\n\nEngland, Switzerland and the Netherlands will join Portugal in the Final Four in June.\n\nIn friendlies on Tuesday, France defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Paris while Italy beat the United States by the same score in Belgium.\n\nUNBEATEN PORTUGAL\n\nAndre Silva gave Portugal the lead in the first half but Arkadiusz Milik equalized for Poland by converting a 66th-minute penalty.\n\nThe European champions played a man down after conceding the equalizer as Danilo was sent off for the foul that prompted the penalty.\n\nPortugal, which played all of its matches without Cristiano Ronaldo, had already secured its Final Four berth with a draw at Italy last week.\n\n\u201cWe are candidates to win the tournament for sure, but maybe not favorites,\u201d Portugal goalkeeper Beto said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the luxury of having our fans with us.\u201d\n\nSWEDEN PROMOTED\n\nRussia missed a chance to gain promotion to League A despite entering the match against Sweden with a three-point lead in its group.\n\nThe hosts earned the comfortable win with a goal by Victor Lindelof in the first half and another by Marcus Berg in the second.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we were able to showcase how we can play here at home,\u201d Sweden coach Janne Andersson said. \u201cI am immensely pleased with what we have achieved in this competition.\u201d\n\nSCOTLAND RALLIES\n\nScotland needed a win at home and got it despite conceding early in the match against Israel in Glasgow, rallying with three unanswered goals by forward James Forrest before the visitors pulled closer again.\n\n\u201cA great night,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cGoing one goal behind after 10 minutes really took a lot out of the boys and we showed a lot of character.\u201d\n\nBEST AND WORST\n\nThe draw against Poland kept Portugal from finishing the group stage with the best campaign in League A. It finished with eight points in Group 3, one point fewer than Switzerland and Belgium in Group 2, which was won by the Swiss thanks to their come-from-behind victory over the Belgians on Sunday.\n\nNo other nation earned more than seven points in the four groups.\n\nIceland was the worst team in the top-tiered league after losing four matches in the group that also had Switzerland and Belgium, while Poland and Germany finished with two points each in their groups. Iceland, Poland, Germany and Croatia were demoted to League B. Ukraine, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Denmark will join Sweden in League A.\n\nThe final positions in the overall Nations League ranking determines the teams\u2019 seeding in the qualifying draw for Euro 2020.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Posted by Cindy Hyde-Smith on Friday, August 8, 2014\n\nAt the White House on Tuesday, before leaving for Florida, President Trump said that Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment about attending a public hanging was made \u201cin jest\u201d and that she \u201cfeels bad\u201d about it. He went on to predict that she will still win the Mississippi runoff against Espy.\n\nHistorically, Mississippi had one of the highest statewide rates of lynching in the United States, according to extensive research by the Equal Justice Initiative, which works to end mass incarceration and racial injustice in the country. Between 1877 and 1950, 614 African Americans were lynched in Mississippi, according to the EJI.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Espy campaign said it was confident that \u201cvoters will follow Walmart\u2019s lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cCindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments have embarrassed Mississippi, and shown why she can\u2019t be trusted to work with the businesses Mississippi needs to grow good-paying jobs,\u201d said Danny Blanton, communications director for the Espy campaign.\n\nWalmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins said the retailer made three donations to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, including one in June and one in September for $1,000 each. On Nov. 8, two days after the midterm elections, Walmart made a third campaign donation for $2,000. Walmart has asked that all $4,000 be returned.\n\nJenkins said this was the first time, for any candidate in any race, that Walmart requested a donation be returned.\n\n\u201cWhen we are made aware of comments like this, we have to do what\u2019s best for our company and our core values,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nBoston Scientific and Union Pacific on Monday each distanced themselves from Hyde-Smith in tweets. Both companies are requesting a refund.\n\nKate Haranis, a spokeswoman for Boston Scientific, said a $2,500 contribution was made to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign on Nov. 8. Haranis said that the company wasn\u2019t aware of Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks about public hangings before the donation was made and that Boston Scientific hadn\u2019t given to the campaign previously.\n\nUnion Pacific is also requesting a refund and said the company \u201cin no way, shape or form condones or supports divisive or perceived to be divisive statements.\u201d\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s comments about public hangings were made before the Nov. 6 election. But it took roughly one week for her comments to circulate and even longer for Walmart, Boston Scientific and Union Pacific\u2019s donations to come under fire on Twitter. On Monday, for example, \u201cWill & Grace\u201d actress Debra Messing tweeted a story about Walmart\u2019s donation from the site Popular Information. The tweet quickly went viral.\n\nBusinesses have always had to tread carefully when it comes to wading into social or political issues. Most recently, U.S. companies have come under pressure to take stances on immigration policy and gun control.\n\nBut the decision to come out against one person is unique, said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at the public relations firm Weber Shandwick. Rather than have a CEO come out with a critical statement and then quietly walk away, Walmart, Boston Scientific and Union Pacific went a step further, she said.\n\nTypically, to take a moral stance on a social issue, companies \u201cdonate to the [American Civil Liberties Union], or they take action with an amicus brief on the immigration ban,\u201d Gaines-Ross said. \u201cThis is different. They\u2019re asking for a refund.\u201d\n\nThe strategy could also align with what the public increasingly expects from corporations and their leaders. According to a June 2018 survey by Weber Shandwick, 74 percent of Americans agreed that when CEOs take a public position on a hotly debated issue, they should back up their words with actions.\n\nStill, what ultimately motivates those actions isn\u2019t always clear, said Joseph Holt, an expert on business ethics at the University of Notre Dame. Often, it\u2019s only after a public outcry that a company will sever ties with a person or group, as many tech companies did this summer with Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and prominent right-wing talk show host.\n\nPlus, Holt said, simply withdrawing a campaign contribution doesn\u2019t clarify exactly how Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments conflict with the companies' \u201ccore values.\u201d Holt gave the example of how when Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier resigned from Trump\u2019s American Manufacturing Council in August 2017, following Trump\u2019s response to the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Frazier clearly explained that he was taking \u201ca stand against intolerance and extremism.\u201d\n\nWhen asked specifically what company values Hyde-Smith violated when she spoke about public hangings, Boston Scientific pointed to a list of six values, including global collaboration and diversity. Union Pacific said it could not comment. Walmart also would not elaborate.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not saying why, and which value it violates,\u201d Holt said, \u201cthen that is an indication that you don\u2019t have a clearly held set of values in mind.\""}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis", "title": "Conservative nonprofit with obscure roots and undisclosed funders paid Matthew Whitaker $1.2 million - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Conservative nonprofit with obscure roots and undisclosed funders paid Matthew Whitaker $1.2 million Washington Post In the three years after he arrived in Washington in 2014, Matthew G.

Whitaker worked for a charity called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust for three years, starting in 2014. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nIn the three years after he arrived in Washington in 2014, Matthew G. Whitaker received more than $1.2 million as the leader of a charity that reported having no other employees, some of the best pay of his career.\n\nThe Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust described itself as a new watchdog nonprofit dedicated to exposing unethical conduct by public officials. For Whitaker, it became a lucrative steppingstone in a swift rise from a modest law practice in Iowa to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job. As FACT\u2019s president, he regularly appeared on radio and television, often to skewer liberals.\n\nBut FACT\u2019s origins and the source of funding used to pay Whitaker \u2014 now the acting attorney general \u2014 remain obscured. An examination of state and federal records, and interviews with those involved, show that the group is part of a national network of nonprofits that often work in concert to amplify conservative messages.\n\nContrary to its claims in news releases and a tax filing, the group was created under a different name two years before Whitaker\u2019s arrival, according to incorporation and IRS records. At least two of the organizers were involved in another conservative charity using the same address.\n\nIn its application to the IRS for status as a tax-exempt organization, the organizers reported that the group would study the impact of environmental regulations on businesses, records show. In that incarnation, the group took no action and \u201conly existed on paper,\u201d one man named in IRS filings as a board member told The Washington Post. Another named in a state filing as a board member said he never agreed to be on the board.\n\nOver a series of 2017 interviews, acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker expressed skepticism about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nWhitaker\u2019s 2017 pay from the charity \u2014 more than $500,000 for the first nine months, or half the charity\u2019s receipts for the year, according to tax filings \u2014 and the group\u2019s earlier, dormant incarnation have not been previously reported by media.\n\nWhitaker did not respond to requests for interviews. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to answer detailed questions about his involvement in FACT, referring a reporter to the charity.\n\nA FACT spokesman who provided a statement on the condition that his name not be used declined to disclose the source of its funding.\n\n\u201cLike nearly all non-profit organizations \u2014 including those with similarly stated missions \u2014 FACT does not and is not required to release its donor information,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis protects free speech rights of all of these groups\u2019 supporters as outlined in the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that FACT \u201cproperly notified the IRS of its name change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for a corporation, not for profit or profit, to refine its name and purpose, and since its inception FACT\u2019s purpose has always been consistent with non-profit law and all appropriate notifications were made,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the group told the IRS about its change in mission, as is required by IRS rules.\n\nPresident Trump said Nov. 18 he would not stop acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, if he decides to curtail the special counsel probe. (Elyse Samuels /The Washington Post)\n\nWhen the nonprofit was launched in 2012, Whitaker was a former U.S. attorney with a modest legal practice in Iowa that paid him $79,000 that year, according to a later disclosure he filed for a failed Senate bid. He also had several local side businesses, including a day-care center and a trailer manufacturer.\n\nA Virginia resident named Raymond Wotring and two others filed papers to create the Free Market American Educational Foundation, state and federal records show. Its stated mission was to \u201cconduct research and provide informational studies on free market concepts in relation to government regulations and policy.\u201d\n\nWotring and one of the other founding members had also served on another conservative nonprofit, Americans for Limited Government, which shared the same mailing address, records show.\n\nWotring did not respond to multiple phone calls or to a note left at his home.\n\nJames Crumley, who provides marketing services to conservative nonprofits and campaigns, was listed in an IRS filing as one of the directors. In a phone call, he initially said he did not remember anything about the group, including why it was formed.\n\n\u201cI can only speculate since I didn\u2019t even remember this group existed,\u201d he wrote in an email later.\n\nCrumley said he\u2019d learned that the group held no meetings and apparently had no bank account in its first two years. \u201cThe organization only existed on paper and didn\u2019t do anything at all,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNoah Wall, now a vice president of advocacy for a conservative nonprofit called FreedomWorks, was listed in Virginia state filings as a director of the group in 2014. Wall said he was surprised to learn of his role. He said he was approached by Wotring but never agreed to join.\n\n\u201cI never signed anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure what any of this is.\u201d\n\nOn July 21, 2014, the IRS approved the group\u2019s application for tax-exempt charity status, which was also signed by Wotring, the group\u2019s secretary. In its application, the group said it would be nonpartisan and aim \u201cto develop unbiased research on how government regulations on environmental policy can impact business.\u201d The group by then had changed its address to a UPS Store in Fairfax, which was also used by Americans for Limited Government.\n\nBut just six weeks later, the newly approved charity changed its name, according to corporate records in Virginia. It was briefly called Working for Rights to Express & Communication.\n\nThe name was changed again in October of that year, to the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, according to records in Virginia. That same month, Whitaker, who had lost a primary bid for a U.S. Senate seat, became the group\u2019s leader, according to Kupec, the Justice spokeswoman.\n\nThe charity\u2019s mailing address was moved from Virginia to an office suite at a prestigious spot on K Street in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 a virtual office and mailing address shared by 200 organizations.\n\nKupec did not respond to questions about how Whitaker connected with the nonprofit.\n\nMarcus Owens, a lawyer and nonprofit specialist who oversaw the IRS\u2019s exempt-organizations division for a decade, said that in its first years the nonprofit appears to have been a \u201cshell charity\u201d that \u201cwas not utilized and remained on the shelf\u201d until Whitaker\u2019s arrival.\n\nTaking over an existing charity makes it easier for groups to quickly stand up the operation and accept tax-deductible donations, he said. But charities that change their names and missions are required to alert the IRS, he said, to ensure they are still operating within guidelines for charities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this organization is misusing its status as a charity,\u201d said David Nelson, a specialist on nonprofit organizations and a former tax partner at the Ernst & Young accounting firm, who reviewed the group\u2019s tax filings at The Post\u2019s request. \u201cIt appears the IRS never gave approval to FACT.\u201d\n\nIn its federal tax filing for 2014, FACT declared that it had not changed its name or its mission that year, records show, and there was no mention of the prior names. The spokesman for FACT declined to provide documents that he said showed it had notified the IRS of the name change.\n\nIn the 2014 filing, FACT reported that it had no employees and that it paid Whitaker $63,000 for three months of work, 30 hours a week, as president and director. It received $600,000 in donations, the document shows.\n\nThe Post determined from other tax filings that the money came from DonorsTrust, a large nonprofit organization that wealthy contributors have used to anonymously give millions to conservative nonprofits in recent years.\n\nThe president of DonorsTrust, Lawson Bader, declined to identify the source of the funding contributed to FACT through his organization.\n\nFACT launched its advocacy efforts shortly after Whitaker took over, describing itself in a news release as a \u201cnew watchdog group.\u201d\n\nOn its website and in tax filings in 2014, FACT said that its mission was \u201cto educate the public about unethical conduct on the part of public officials by publicizing these actions through media outlets throughout the country\u201d and through its own website.\n\nThe new three-member board now comprised Whitaker, Whitaker\u2019s former law partner and a conservative activist, Neil Corkery, who is involved in operating or funding multiple conservative charities.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s former partner, William Gustoff, did not return calls for comment. Corkery did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe IRS prohibits charities from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, for or against candidates. The prohibition is rarely enforced.\n\nThe FACT spokesman said the group is nonpartisan and focuses on Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nA Post analysis of more than 200 television and radio appearances by Whitaker from 2014 to September 2017, when he was named chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, shows that Whitaker was overwhelmingly focused on Democrats.\n\nWhitaker or the often-conservative television hosts interviewing him uttered the name of one of the five Republican lawmakers that the group has targeted in elections complaints a combined 37 times, compared with more than 750 mentions of Hillary Clinton.\n\nMost of those Clinton references \u2014 more than 600 \u2014 came in the run-up to the 2016 election, and nearly all were comments critical of Clinton\u2019s tenure, including her email scandal or possible ethical conflicts surrounding the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAfter the election, Whitaker\u2019s focus in those interviews turned to another target, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Whitaker or hosts named Mueller 185 times.\n\nTax filings show that one of FACT\u2019s biggest contractors was America Rising, a research and communications firm in Arlington, Va., \u201cwhose mission is to help its clients defeat Democrats,\u201d according to its website. FACT paid America Rising at least $500,000 for research from 2015 to 2017, tax filings show.\n\nFACT paid another half-million dollars to CRC Public Relations in Alexandria, Va. The FACT representative who declined to be named in this report is a CRC executive.\n\nIn December 2014, FACT began posting news items and commentary on its new website, including the prediction that a super PAC formed to promote Clinton\u2019s presidential aspirations might someday illegally coordinate with her future campaign.\n\n\u201cThese moves will likely draw [Federal Election Commission] complaints due to possible federal election law violations,\u201d the post says.\n\nWhitaker, the face of the organization, was often in Iowa in those early months, according to a review of interviews he conducted at the time. But being the president of a nonprofit conferred legitimacy on him, helping to raise his profile in Washington even as it allowed the group\u2019s backers to claim tax deductions.\n\nHe was increasingly appearing as a commentator on conservative media outlets \u2014 including Newsmax TV and Fox TV \u2014 and last year became a paid legal analyst on CNN.\n\nIn addition to targeting Clinton, Whitaker took aim at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) while filing election law complaints against Democrats and some Republicans. When asked by a radio host about the group\u2019s pursuit of Democrats, Whitaker said, \u201cIt is a target-rich environment.\u201d\n\nIn the three years he worked at the charity, Whitaker\u2019s pay rose sharply each year, tax filings show. Last year, he was paid $55,000 a month. In all, he earned $1,219,000 \u2014 more than a third of the donations the group received from 2014 to 2017.\n\nAn IRS spokesman declined to comment, citing federal privacy law.\n\nAlice Crites and Andrew Ba Tran contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Lisa Rein", "title": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke remains defiant amid ethics probes", "description": "A tour of California\u2019s fires, along with horseback and motorcycle rides, have occupied his last week and-a-half", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interior-secretary-ryan-zinke-remains-defiant-amid-ethics-probes/2018/11/20/a83c7666-ec03-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J-nnksIhYovNqO73_3HiMH0xOiI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGVXZKHM2II6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T21:33:15Z", "content": "WHITEFISH, Mont.

(Louise Johns for The Washington Post)\n\nZinke\u2019s personal conduct and management decisions have led to at least 15 investigations by Interior\u2019s inspector general and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, nine of which have closed. Acting inspector general Mary Kendall found last month that Zinke violated official policy by having his wife accompany him in government vehicles and raised concerns by trying to appoint her as an official agency volunteer. Investigators also closed two probes because of a lack of cooperation, including one regarding Zinke\u2019s move to cancel a $1 million study into the health impacts of strip-mining coal.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel, which investigates prohibited political activity by public officials, cleared Zinke in three different probes involving charges of combining political and official business. However, the Interior inspector general\u2019s office found that ethics officials had not properly vetted one trip involving a speech to a contributor\u2019s hockey team and a $12,375 chartered flight.\n\nZinke\u2019s comments to Breitbart came during an extended period away from his agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, during which he returned to this small mountain community in northwestern Montana and gave multiple interviews before flying to California to tour areas destroyed by wildfires.\n\nThe secretary spent the Veterans Day weekend at his family home here, enjoying drinks at a local bar. A month and a half ago, his critics distributed fliers mocking him at local breweries during the city\u2019s Oktoberfest celebration, which read, \u201cRyan Zinke\u2019s Double Tap Brewing Company, sponsored by Halliburton, opening soon in Whitefish, Montana.\u201d\n\n[Z inke\u2019s own watchdog referred his inquiry to the Justice Department]\n\n\n\nA flier mocks Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s real estate investments in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown.\n\nIt\u2019s here that he faces the glare of a federal inquiry that shows no sign of wrapping up.\n\nInvestigators are examining Zinke\u2019s involvement in a $90 million residential and commercial project, steps from his childhood home, that the city approved late last year on the site of a long-closed timber mill abutting the BNSF freight railroad tracks.\n\nThe scenic property \u2014 which lies beneath Whitefish Mountain Resort and is by a forested lake ringed by wealthy homes \u2014 is prime for redevelopment. The venture, called 95 Karrow, is the largest project so far in a community of 7,600 residents in the midst of a real estate boom.\n\nIt is backed by Halliburton chairman David J. Lesar, who owns a home in a gated community by the lake and whose firm is one of the country\u2019s largest engaged in oil and gas drilling on public lands. Zinke\u2019s position as the Cabinet official managing 500 million acres of public land \u2014 and overseeing a rollback of environmental regulations to increase drilling \u2014 has raised questions about the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nLesar\u2019s son John and his daughter-in-law Katie are also listed as investors in the project, according to Montana state records.\n\nIn October, investigators referred their inquiry to the Justice Department, a sign they have found potential criminal action.\n\nZinke faces at least two other ethics investigations by the inspector general, including whether he redrew a national monument\u2019s boundaries to benefit a Republican state representative in Utah. Another examines his decision blocking two Connecticut tribes from expanding their casino operations after meeting with lobbyists for a competitor, the casino giant MGM Resorts.\n\nThe publicity over Zinke\u2019s land deal has rattled Whitefish, an old railroad town quickly bouncing back from economic decline. Its main streets now boast satellite offices for Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, along with high-end restaurants, gift shops selling Montana ceramics and a jeweler where necklaces sell for $3,000 apiece.\n\n[White House concerned Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated federal rules ]\n\nCity officials are reluctant to discuss Zinke. The Lesar family and Casey Malmquist, 95 Karrow\u2019s lead local developer, have hired powerhouse D.C. trial lawyer Brian Heberlig to represent them.\n\nHeberlig\u2019s client list includes the \u201chighest ranking BP executive charged in connection with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill,\u201d his LinkedIn profile says. \u201cI defend clients facing allegations of public corruption, securities and accounting fraud, FCPA violations, antitrust conspiracies, . . . obstruction of justice, false statements, environmental offenses, and other business crimes.\u201d\n\nHeberlig, of Steptoe & Johnson, declined to comment.\n\nLocals worry their little town\u2019s reputation is getting sullied by a Washington scandal. And one partner on the development team is distancing himself from Zinke in frustration.\n\nThe secretary and his wife, Lola, own more than a dozen acres of land next to the project that BNSF donated to them a decade ago. They established the Great Northern Veterans Park Foundation to oversee what they predicted would be a community gathering spot. The park has been graded but remains relatively undeveloped.\n\nZinke served as the nonprofit\u2019s president until after he joined Trump\u2019s Cabinet. His wife now heads it, and in that capacity gave the 95 Karrow project an easement for 34 parking spaces last fall as the developers applied for city approval.\n\nThe arrangement was mandated by the local fire marshal to ensure an additional route of egress for both the park and the development in an emergency, city planning records show.\n\nTo many in town, the controversy surrounding Zinke is overblown.\n\n\u201cFrom the city\u2019s perspective, the park and 95 Karrow went through a public process that was well vetted,\u201d said Whitefish Mayor John Muhlfeld, a Democrat. \u201cRyan Zinke followed a due process we have in place.\u201d\n\nBut what is arguably a simple, by-the-book parking easement still serves as the linchpin for what investigators are examining, according to people familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was still ongoing.\n\nInterior spokeswoman Heather Swift declined requests for information on Zinke\u2019s whereabouts this week.\n\nThe project was approved for shops, apartments, a hotel and space for artists, as well as a microbrewery, which Zinke himself has long hoped to build on one of his own properties. Neighborhood opposition thwarted that plan, and early in the process Zinke expressed interest in reviving his dream for 95 Karrow.\n\n\u201cZinke said, \u2018What if I did put my brewery over here?\u2019 \u201d recalled Michael Anderson, a 95 Karrow investor and prominent Whitefish real estate agent. \u201cWe said, \u2018Possibly.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut in recent months, Anderson added,\u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a conversation with Ryan\u201d about the brewery.\n\nThe Zinkes own two other properties across the street from 95 Karrow and one on the same side of the street. The modest neighborhood\u2019s value is set to at least double once the project is built, according to David Oberlitner, a real estate agent with Christie\u2019s PureWest. A recently completed city plan provides for greater residential density along with a rebuilt main street steps from the project, and will also boost the area\u2019s worth.\n\nZinke has continued to be involved in discussions over 95 Karrow since he took office, according to public records released by both Interior and the town of Whitefish.\n\nBruce Boody, the landscape architect, said the team briefed the secretary on the project\u2019s progress as it wound its way through city approvals last fall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of the development,\u201d Boody said, adding that the Zinkes, through the park, \u201care preserving a nice thing for the community.\u201d\n\nBut Anderson was quick to distance himself from Zinke.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with Ryan Zinke, and he has nothing to do with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of land. We have extra parking already.\u201d\n\nAnderson said that he developers approached the secretary with the intention of giving the park another means of access, and plan to break ground in the spring.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to be neighborly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the park property.\u201d\n\nZinke, 57, grew up in Whitefish as the son of a plumber and returned to start his political career after retiring from the Navy. His current policy positions are largely out of sync with his hometown, one of the few liberal enclaves in an otherwise conservative state.\n\nHillary Clinton won here with 65 percent of the vote. Many residents who enjoy the outdoors and consider themselves conservationists have been disillusioned by Zinke\u2019s alliances with the oil and gas industry. As his political career soared, he allied himself with companies such as Halliburton, which gave more to his campaign than any other House or Senate candidate in the 2014 cycle.\n\nWhitefish was an early signatory to the Paris climate agreement that Trump announced he would exit in June 2017, making a symbolic stand against the administration. The town is home to an advocacy group, the Western Values Project, that has assailed Zinke from the moment he took office.\n\n\u201cThe publicity is so bad for us,\u201d said Rhonda Fitzgerald, owner of the Garden Wall Inn and a local neighborhood activist. \u201cIt mispresents the community as a place of shady land deals and rich power brokers. It\u2019s really a community of people who work and enjoy the pristine natural environment.\u201d\n\nZinke, for his part, has told friends that he is determined to stay and convinced that the inspector general will not find any wrongdoing. On Tuesday he tweeted that he spent part of the day touring Montana\u2019s Badger-Two Medicine area by horseback: \u201cRugged, remote, and beautiful.

It was unsurprising because the shifting stories about Khashoggi\u2019s murder that the Saudi government had put out \u2014 finally culminating in the claim that it was the work of a \u201crogue\u201d group \u2014 were utterly ludicrous; no one actually believes that a team of 15 operatives would have been dispatched to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi without the knowledge of the country\u2019s ruler. And it was vitally important because once the CIA\u2019s conclusion was made public, that put pressure on President Trump to do something about it.\n\nOn Tuesday he did something about it, in his way. The White House released a statement from the president, one that seems to have been dictated, transcribed and then released with no editing, since it\u2019s spoken not in the careful language of diplomacy or law but in the way Trump communicates when tweeting or calling in to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Including all the exclamation points.\n\nThe statement begins by criticizing Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s principal adversary in the Middle East, and excuses Saudi human rights abuses in Yemen by saying, \u201cSaudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave.\u201d Then Trump gets to what really matters to him anyway: money.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that these figures are bogus. The Saudis did not agree to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States, a number Trump seems to have just made up; they did not order $110 billion in military equipment; and they will not be creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States.\n\nBut if you wanted to be generous, you could give Trump some credit for placing a kernel of truth under his pile of lies: We may not like it if you repress dissent and murder journalists who criticize your regime, but as long as you keep paying us, we\u2019ll look the other way.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, the United States has a long history of propping up oppressive dictatorships if we get something out of the relationship, whether it\u2019s oil in the case of the Saudis, a Cold War proxy in too many countries to mention, or just business. We deal every day with China, which is probably the most oppressive government on earth in terms of the sheer quantity of people imprisoned, executed or otherwise punished for getting on the wrong side of the regime.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s still value in arguing for democratic norms of liberty and freedom of expression, even if there\u2019s only so much we\u2019re willing to do to make them a reality. But even Trump, who evinces no commitment to those norms whatsoever, can\u2019t quite bring himself to say that he\u2019s A-OK with Khashoggi\u2019s murder. So in this statement, he retreats to a kind of implausible deniability, finally arriving at the position that while the crown prince might be responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, it could also be a 400-pound guy sitting on his bed in New Jersey:\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nLet\u2019s not forget an important angle to all this: Trump\u2019s reaction to the Khashoggi murder could very well be the subject of oversight conducted by House Democrats next year. As former congressional and State Department aides recently told this blog, such an examination could be a big-picture one that looks back at the administration\u2019s whole handling of this.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the intelligence angle. We learned from Post reporting that the CIA has concluded that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing. But this is based, appropriately, on anonymous sources, and there are multiple areas in which what we know is vague. Democratic oversight might flesh out what intelligence agencies concluded \u2014 and perhaps how and when the administration was briefed on it.\n\nDemocrats could also try to look at private communications between the administration and the Saudis during the period in which neither side was acknowledging the Saudi role. Remember, at that time, The Post reported that the administration and the Saudi royal family were \u201csearching for a mutually agreeable explanation\u201d for Khashoggi\u2019s death that would \u201cavoid implicating\u201d the crown prince.\n\nSuch an examination could also look at Trump\u2019s financial entanglements with the Saudis. As it is, Senate Democrats have already requested that Trump provide information about the Trump Organization\u2019s business relationships with the Saudi government and royal family, suggesting there are possible conflicts of interest at play. One cannot dismiss the possibility that Trump\u2019s personal profiting off the Saudis is shaping U.S. policy \u2014 a ripe area for oversight that could go beyond just the Khashoggi killing.\n\nRep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the incoming chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently hinted to this blog that the committee might take a look at the Trump administration\u2019s response, if it became clear the administration went along with Saudi efforts to whitewash the killing.\n\n\u201cThis is not something we can turn our heads away from,\u201d Engel told us at the time. \u201cI want a full accounting of what happened.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s Trump statement does not deny the Saudi role in the killing, but one could see the committee taking an interest, given just how bizarre and solicitous toward the Saudis the statement really is.\n\nAs Mariah Sixkiller, who was national security adviser to Rep. Steny Hoyer for years, put it: \u201cThis level of administration deference in the face of such a radical act merits heavy congressional scrutiny.\u201d\n\nGiven today\u2019s insanity, that can\u2019t come soon enough."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Pompeo cites 'positive momentum' in US-Turkey ties", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says U.S. relations with NATO ally Turkey have improved since the release of an American pastor", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pompeo-cites-positive-momentum-in-us-turkey-ties/2018/11/20/27637e0e-ed07-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:59:22Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says U.S. relations with NATO ally Turkey have improved since the release of an American pastor.

(Handout/Reuters)\n\nSeveral countries have expressed concern that Interpol might elect a Russian as its new chief despite criticism that Moscow has used the international police agency to punish political opponents.\n\nPolice chiefs meeting in Dubai are expected to vote Wednesday on a successor to Meng Hongwei, who went missing in China in September. Chinese officials, who admitted detaining him, later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes.\n\nThe United States \u201cstrongly endorses\u201d the South Korean candidate to replace Meng, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday. But the leading candidate for the job is Alexander Prokopchuk, a major general in the Russian Interior Ministry who is one of Interpol\u2019s vice presidents.\n\nThe possibility of a Russian ascending to the presidency of Interpol has set off alarm bells in capitals including Washington and London. The agency is a clearinghouse for national police services pursuing suspects outside their borders.\n\nIn the past, Russia and other countries have been accused of abusing \u201cred notice\u201d alerts on perceived political enemies, leading to their being stopped at airports and detained.\n\nThe best known example is Bill Browder, a U.S.-born British financier and Kremlin critic. Browder lobbied Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, named after Browder\u2019s Russian lawyer and friend Sergei Magnitsky, who accused the Russian government of tax fraud and died in prison in 2009. Browder has vowed to avenge Magnitsky\u2019s death. Since then, he has been detained at least seven times in numerous countries while Interpol sought to verify arrest warrants issued by Russia.\n\nOnly this week, Russian authorities launched a new criminal investigation into Browder, accusing him of being involved in Magnitsky\u2019s death.\n\n[Browder: The world can\u2019t let Russia run Interpol. My experiences show why.]\n\nProkopchuk is well known within Interpol and considered a professional. He is believed to have the support of numerous countries that are not usually allies of Russia. The South Korean candidate, Kim Jong-yang, is the acting president now, but he is not as well known as Prokopchuk.\n\nThe State Department in recent days has sent d\u00e9marches to embassies and consulates, according to people with knowledge of the diplomatic notes used to persuade and inform foreign governments.\n\n\u201cWithout getting into details, we would note that there is more than one candidate for this position, and we are actively and broadly engaged with Interpol member states to underscore the need to elect someone who will promote, not undermine, the values and practices that make Interpol such a vital international body,\u201d said an official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be more frank about the behind-the-scenes lobbying effort.\n\nFour U.S. senators issued a statement Monday likening Prokopchuk\u2019s selection to \u201cputting a fox in charge of a henhouse\u201d and urging police chiefs from the 192 member nations to reject him.\n\n\u201cRussia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists,\u201d said the statement, which was signed by senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Christopher A.

Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who left Washington last week planning to take the Thanksgiving holiday to ponder a run against Pelosi for speaker. But her dalliance ended Tuesday. Fudge said she would support Pelosi after the minority leader agreed to make Fudge chairman of a resurrected subcommittee on elections and pledged that \u201cthe most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party, black women, will have a seat at the decision-making table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am now confident that we will move forward together,\u201d Fudge said in a statement. \u201cI now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) is seeking to become majority leader, and Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.), currently the assistant Democratic leader, is running for majority whip.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents continue to insist they have the votes to block her from the speakership when the full House meets Jan. 3. But Fudge\u2019s withdrawal showed that their numbers are dwindling, not growing \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAnd it demonstrated that Pelosi \u2014 whose bare-knuckle political skills were forged in her Baltimore upbringing, numerous prior House leadership races, and high-stakes legislative battles during her four-year speakership \u2014 has considerable tools at her disposal to win further support.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday in Chicago, Obama hailed Pelosi as \u201cone of the most effective legislative leaders that this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy is not always the best on a cable show or with a quick sound bite or what have you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut her skill, tenacity, toughness, vision, is remarkable. Her stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things and to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done I think stands up against any person that I\u2019ve observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime.\u201d\n\nNo living Democrat holds more sway than Obama, who signed the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial restructuring bill and economic stimulus legislation that all passed through Pelosi\u2019s House in 2009 and 2010.\n\nObama prefaced his remarks, made in Chicago during the public taping of a podcast hosted by his former political adviser David Axelrod, by saying he was \u201cnot going to wade into House Democratic caucus politics.\u201d But he then proceeded to deliver what amounted to an unqualified endorsement.\n\nWith Fudge opting not to run for speaker, the cadre of Pelosi opponents will be forced to find another standard-bearer to try to depose the longtime Democratic leader. Sixteen Democrats signed a letter Monday vowing to oppose Pelosi in a party-nominating contest next week as well as during the floor vote, while four more Democrats who did not sign the letter said they remained opposed to her.\n\nTogether, those members could block Pelosi from taking the speaker\u2019s gavel if they maintain their opposition. But Pelosi is working to convince and cajole members, with help from her allies in the House and other key Democratic players.\n\nSpokesmen for two of Pelosi\u2019s leading critics, Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), declined to comment Tuesday and instead pointed to recent op-eds calling for new leadership.\n\nPelosi\u2019s detractors have pounced on several fronts, noting that her continued presence atop the Democratic hierarchy has impeded younger leaders and that she remains a political liability for her party\u2019s candidates in Republican-leaning districts.\n\nBut they have struggled to escape the perception that they represent a group of Democrats who are whiter, more male and more moderate than the party caucus as a whole. Losing Fudge, their only prominent African American supporter, is a further blow.\n\nThey have also struggled to attract support from young incoming members associated with the party\u2019s left flank \u2014 such as Reps.-elect Jahana Hayes (Conn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) \u2014 who made calls for new leadership during their campaign but have kept their distance from Pelosi\u2019s vocal opposition.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC on Monday night, Ocasio-Cortez said the rebel group was \u201cnot necessarily reflective of the diversity of the party\u201d and questioned why they were determined to oust Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI do think that we got sent to Congress on a mandate to change how government works, to change what government even looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we are not on the same page about changing the systems and the values and how we\u2019re going to adapt as a party for the future, then what is the point of just changing our party leadership just for the sake of it?\u201d\n\nPelosi continued to rack up support Tuesday, winning the votes of two incoming freshmen \u2014 Reps.-elect Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Harley Rouda (Calif.) \u2014 and endorsements from the Sierra Club and the Alliance for Retired Americans.\n\n\u201cDivisions within our own party and public disputes over leadership will only hurt our efforts to get our country and our government back on the right course,\u201d said Omar, who has allied herself with the other young liberals.\n\nDemocrats have won 233 seats to Republicans\u2019 199 after Ben McAdams ousted GOP Rep. Mia Love in Utah. Three races remain unresolved, with a Democrat leading in one. Some Republicans also believe that Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), who was declared the winner on election night, could ultimately lose his race to Democrat T.J. Cox after the final ballots are counted in the coming days.\n\nFudge\u2019s decision to withdraw her potential challenge came the same day she faced serious questions about a letter of support she wrote in 2015 for a former judge and state senator who is now accused of killing his ex-wife.\n\nFudge wrote the letter to a prosecutor as Lance Mason prepared to plead guilty to beating his then-wife, Aisha Fraser, so severely in 2014 that she required reconstructive plastic surgery. Mason, Fudge wrote, was \u201ca good man who made a very bad mistake.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Fraser was found fatally stabbed, according to news reports. Mason, who served a nine-month sentence for the earlier assault, was taken into custody and is expected to be charged in her killing.\n\n[A former judge brutally assaulted his wife in 2014. Now she\u2019s dead, and he\u2019s been arrested.]\n\nIn a statement released by her office Tuesday, Fudge said that her \u201cheart breaks\u201d for Fraser and her family.\n\n\u201cMy support of Lance in 2015 was based on the person I knew for almost 30 years \u2014 an accomplished lawyer, prosecutor, state legislator and judge. That\u2019s the Lance Mason I supported,\u201d she said. \u201cThe person who committed these crimes is not the Lance Mason familiar to me. They were horrific crimes, and I condemn them. I and everyone who knew Aisha are mourning her loss.\u201d\n\nIn the 2015 letter, obtained by a reporter for WOIO-TV in Cleveland, Fudge said Mason\u2019s assault on Fraser was \u201cout of character and totally contrary to everything I know about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLance accepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Avi Selk", "title": "Sarah Palin mocks Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u2018basic civics\u2019 knowledge, falls into Twitter ratio abyss", "description": "A ratio is what happens when a tweet\u2019s endorsements \u2014 as measured in retweets and likes \u2014 are vastly outnumbered by criticism in the form of replies.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/20/sarah-palin-mocks-ocasio-cortezs-basic-civics-knowledge-falls-into-twitter-ratio-abyss/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WvXAfNf0uhwYKO59OzfSFKDSicM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LHTQ3BUE7UI6RHQGJW2SVRBOAU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:40:52Z", "content": "Today in basic Twitter lessons: the ratio.

Jaindl Turkey Farms proudly boasts on its Web site that it has been asked to \u201csupply the turkey that graces the holiday table at the White House each Thanksgiving.\u201d But, at least in the Obama White House, the Jaindl turkeys are not eaten by the chief executive. Instead, President Obama has donated the Jaindl turkeys to a local charity. Where the White House gets the turkey that is eaten by the first family is a state secret. \u201cFor a variety of reasons, including security of the White House food supply, we aren\u2019t usually able to give out details on where we get food, beverages, etc.,\u201d a White House official told the Loop. When the Turkey Federation started giving turkeys to the White House in 1947, the intention was for the president to eat them, a spokesman for the group said. Since at least 1962, those turkeys have always come from Jaindl, specifically its Grand Champion brand. No one could confirm whether Obama is the first president to give the Jaindl turkeys away.\n\nBut, owner David Jaindl said Tuesday, he believes other presidents ate his turkeys.\n\nOne year, President Ronald Reagan sent a note, letting the Jaindls know he had made sure the turkeys got on his plane back to his ranch in California for Thanksgiving, Jaindl said. President George H.W. Bush sent a personal \u201cthank you\u201d raving about the meal.\n\nHe also recalled receiving a photo of President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton roasting their Jaindl turkey.\n\nJaindl confirmed that two 40-pound turkeys from his farm were presented to the White House as always, but no word yet whether Trump will eat them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "A journey south bonds an unlikely pair in 'Green Book' - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post A journey south bonds an unlikely pair in 'Green Book' Washington Post Early in \u201cGreen Book,\u201d Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen, arrives at his Bronx home and finds some black handymen fixing his sink.

Except \u201cGreen Book,\u201d which opens nationally Wednesday, is based on a true story.\n\nTony, better known as \u201cTony Lip,\u201d is working as a bouncer at the Copacabana when he\u2019s hired by pianist Dr. Don Shirley (\u201cMoonlight\u2019s\u201d Mahershala Ali) to be his driver and bodyguard as the musician \u2014 \u201cDoc,\u201d to Tony \u2014 embarks on a series of gigs playing at places where he\u2019s not allowed to eat.\n\nThe dramedy\u2019s title refers to a travel guide for African-Americans, published annually from the 1930s into the 1960s, originally called \u201cThe Negro Motorist Green-Book.\u201d It listed safe restaurants and hotels in the South, as well as the names of towns to avoid \u2014 including \u201csundown towns,\u201d where it was illegal for black people to be after sunset.\n\nAs the two set out, neither has any idea what they\u2019re in for.\n\n[\u2018Green Book\u2019 is the rare Hollywood crowd-pleaser that triumphs on all counts]\n\n\u201cDoc, he\u2019s ignorant about people like Tony and how they live and how they think,\u201d says Mortensen (\u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d). \u201cWhen he first meets Tony, he\u2019s like, \u2018This guy is just a pig. This is going to be a really long trip.\u2019 Then Tony\u2019s thinking, \u2018Why is this guy stuck-up? This is going to be a really long trip.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs Tony and Don make their really long trip, the two begin to find more of an understanding \u2014 while still finding time to annoy each other.\n\nDirector Peter Farrelly \u2014 who co-wrote the script with Nick Vallelonga, the real-life Tony\u2019s son, and Brian Currie \u2014 wanted the film to examine the impact of the journey on both participants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the white savior trope and the black savior trope,\u201d Farrelly says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want either of those; it\u2019s just done too much in Hollywood films, and that wasn\u2019t the story. It would have been inaccurate. The truth is these guys both changed on that journey. They changed each other.\u201d\n\nAnd their contact with the racism of that time and place winds up forging a team.\n\n\u201cWithout even realizing it, it\u2019s pushing them closer,\u201d Mortensen says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re back to back, and their backs gradually touch.

A question-and-answer segment focused on whether a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton could pardon herself. At one point, Judge Jeanine Pirro demonstrated what it would be like to smash two BlackBerrys with a hammer.\n\nSo when news broke Monday that the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump was embroiled in a similar issue \u2014 only with some names and political parties switched around \u2014 it was a chance for \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to dive into its deep repository of information about the ethical and political implications of private email use.\n\nThe segment lasted 25 seconds.\n\nThe information was one of several news tidbits relayed to viewers of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d by Jillian Mele, an early-morning host, and focused on Ivanka Trump\u2019s lawyer \u201cslamming a report.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Washington Post claims the White House adviser may have violated federal rules by using her personal account to communicate with officials,\u201d Mele read, echoing language that had been read on other Fox News shows. \u201cA spokesperson for Trump\u2019s lawyer tells Fox News, quote, there was never classified information transmitted; the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization; no email was ever deleted.\u201d\n\nMedia observers were quick to point out the irony.\n\n\u201cI mean, this seems pretty light in comparison to the Fox News outrage over Hillary\u2019s private email, but I\u2019m sure that they will start to spew similar amounts of bile that they spewed over the Clinton email, right?\u201d Colby Hall wrote in an opinion piece for Mediaite. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t, they\u2019d look ridiculous, right?\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey reported Monday, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails to Cabinet officials, White House aides and assistants using a private account, which violated rules about federal records.\n\nAccording to Leonnig and Dawsey, shortly after then-candidate Donald Trump blasted Clinton on the campaign trail, his daughter used her personal account for \u201cmuch of 2017\u201d with Jared Kushner, her husband and fellow White House adviser. She sent hundreds of emails from the account.\n\n\u201cThe discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s prac\u00adtices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton, an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign,\u201d Leonnig and Dawsey wrote. \u201cHe attacked his Democratic challenger as untrustworthy and dubbed her \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 for using a personal email account as secretary of state.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump\u2019s use of the private account was unearthed by White House ethics officials responding to a public records lawsuit.\n\nPeople close to Ivanka Trump told Leonnig and Dawsey that she wasn\u2019t trying to hide her government work and was unaware she was breaking email rules. Such use of email could violate the Presidential Records Act, which requires official White House communications be preserved. It\u2019s also a security and potential risk. The House Oversight Committee plans to investigate.\n\nFox News has faced criticism from those who have claimed the network serves as a mouthpiece for the Trump administration.\n\nOn the day before Election Day, for example, Fox News host Sean Hannity joined President Trump at a rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo. The campaign had described Hannity as a \u201cspecial guest.\u201d Hannity maintained on Twitter that he was covering the rally for his show, not campaigning with the president.\n\nJudge Jeanine, the smasher of BlackBerrys, was also present and was singled out by Trump.\n\nShe \u201ctreats us very, very well,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, and she\u2019s your friend.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA felon pleaded his case on \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019 Days later, Trump pardoned him.\n\nJoe Arpaio is back \u2014 and brought his undying Obama birther theory with him\n\nCarl Icahn denies he knew about Trump\u2019s steel tariff announcement before dumping stocks"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Iraq says airstrikes kill 40 Islamic State fighters in Syria", "description": "The Iraqi military says it has killed 40 Islamic State militants in airstrikes in Syria", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraq-says-airstrikes-kill-40-islamic-state-fighters-in-syria/2018/11/20/0bb8dbfc-ecff-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T20:01:22Z", "content": "BAGHDAD The Iraqi military says it has killed 40 Islamic State militants in airstrikes in Syria.

Restaurants should not serve it, stores should not sell it, and people should not buy it, no matter where or when the lettuce was grown. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is chopped, whole head or part of a mix.\n\nThe unusually broad warning, issued just two days before Americans sit down for their Thanksgiving dinners, reflects the uncertainties about the origin and extent of the bacterial contamination. The CDC is not claiming that all romaine contains the dangerous bacteria \u2014 something the millions of people who have eaten the popular lettuce recently should bear in mind \u2014 but investigators don\u2019t know precisely where, when or how the contamination happened.\n\nThus all romaine is suspect.\n\nThe CDC reported that 32 people in 11 states have become sick from eating contaminated romaine. Of those, 13 have been hospitalized, with one patient suffering from a form of kidney failure. The Public Health Agency of Canada has reported that 18 people have been infected with the same strain of E. coli. in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nNo deaths have been reported.\n\n\n\nRomaine lettuce could be contaminated and should be thrown away, CDC advises. (karandaev/iStock)\n\n\u201cConsumers who have any type of romaine lettuce in their home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick,\u201d the CDC said in the Food Safety Alert issued Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThis advice includes all types or uses of romaine lettuce, such as whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad,\u201d the CDC said. \u201cIf you do not know if the lettuce is romaine or whether a salad mix contains romaine, do not eat it and throw it away.\u201d\n\nThe agency also advised consumers to wash and sanitize drawers and shelves where the lettuce was stored. People usually become sick within three or four days of consuming lettuce contaminated with the E. coli, according to the CDC.\n\nScott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the looming Thanksgiving holiday weighed on the minds of federal officials as they prepared the food alert.\n\n\u201cI think we felt increased pressure to try to communicate earlier and more substantively with the public given that we know people are going to sit down for holiday meals,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nBut he acknowledged that it is \u201cfrustrating and unfortunate\u201d that the alert has to be so broad, covering all romaine lettuce. The federal agencies and the industry are trying to improve traceback techniques to narrow down the sources of outbreaks, he said. \u201cWe need to be able to get consumers more precise information about what they shouldn\u2019t be eating, rather than these more general alerts.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has the highest number of reported illnesses, with 10, followed by Michigan with seven, New Jersey with three, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York with two each, and the remainder in Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration issued a statement saying it is making a special effort to test romaine for contamination across the country.\n\n\u201cThe quick and aggressive steps we\u2019re taking today are aimed at making sure we get ahead of this emerging outbreak, to reduce risk to consumers, and to help people protect themselves and their families from this foodborne illness outbreak. This is especially important ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, when people will be sitting down for family meals,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nFive people died in the most recent major outbreak from contaminated romaine, which lasted from March to June of this year and led to 210 cases in 36 states. That outbreak was traced to the Yuma, Ariz., growing region, but investigators never conclusively determined the precise source. Gottlieb said the leading suspect is contaminated canal water used by multiple farms.\n\nThe latest outbreak does not appear to be connected to the Yuma outbreak. Rather, this outbreak involves a strain of E. coli that has the same genetic fingerprint as the one that caused illnesses late last year in both the United States and Canada. Canada linked its cases to romaine lettuce specifically, although the U.S. investigators said only that origin was in leafy greens. Once again, the precise origin was never determined. That outbreak was declared over in January.\n\nThe first illness from this outbreak was reported on Oct. 6. There are typically delays in reporting illnesses linked to E. coli outbreaks, and the CDC said cases from early November onward likely have not been logged by health officials.\n\nBut it\u2019s striking that this year\u2019s outbreak comes at roughly the same time as the one last year and with a similar fingerprint. The Canadian health agency noted that this \u201csuggests there may be a reoccurring source of contamination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the 2017 outbreak and this outbreak are a genetic match, that should give the FDA an incredible window where this outbreak, where that lettuce, was grown, so they\u2019re able to triangulate back to a particular area,\u201d said prominent food-safety lawyer Bill Marler.\n\nHe said his firm has received many calls from people in the past month saying they\u2019re suffering from E. coli, but they did not know this might be linked to a broad outbreak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to hire more lawyers,\u201d Marler said.\n\nE. coli is a bacteria found in the intestines of animals. It can contaminate a wide variety of agricultural products. People can become infected with E. coli and report no symptoms. Those who do get sick from E. coli usually recover without complications in 5 to 10 days. The illness can be spread from person to person through direct contact.\n\nAll three outbreaks \u2014 the current one, the one from Yuma and the one from last year \u2014 are caused by contamination of an E. coli strain known as O157:H7. It produces a Shiga toxin that in severe cases can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure.\n\nSymptoms of infection from this strain include severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Anyone suspecting they have been infected should see a doctor and have the case reported to a local health department.\n\nUntil the 1990s, most E. coli cases in humans came from eating contaminated hamburger. In more recent years, after reforms in the livestock industry, the outbreaks have been most often associated with leafy greens.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Gottlieb said the apparent increase in outbreaks could be misleading. Food is not less safe today than it was in the past, he said:\n\n\u201cIt probably seems that there\u2019s more outbreaks. What\u2019s happening is that we\u2019re getting much better at identifying outbreaks.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nSalmonella outbreak in turkey continues as Thanksgiving approaches\n\nSource of E. coli-contaminated romaine lettuce still a mystery\n\nThis mock pandemic killed 150 million people.

InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is scheduled to arrive at the planet on Monday, Nov. 26, 2018. (NASA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 Mars is about to get its first U.S. visitor in years: a three-legged, one-armed geologist to dig deep and listen for quakes.\n\nNASA\u2019s InSight makes its grand entrance through the rose-tinted Martian skies on Monday, after a six-month, 300 million-mile (480 million-kilometer) journey. It will be the first American spacecraft to land since the Curiosity rover in 2012 and the first dedicated to exploring underground.\n\nNASA is going with a tried-and-true method to get this mechanical miner to the surface of the red planet. Engine firings will slow its final descent and the spacecraft will plop down on its rigid legs, mimicking the landings of earlier successful missions.\n\nThat\u2019s where old school ends on this $1 billion U.S.-European effort .\n\nOnce flight controllers in California determine the coast is clear at the landing site \u2014 fairly flat and rock free \u2014 InSight\u2019s 6-foot (1.8-meter) arm will remove the two main science experiments from the lander\u2019s deck and place them directly on the Martian surface.\n\nNo spacecraft has attempted anything like that before.\n\nThe firsts don\u2019t stop there.\n\nOne experiment will attempt to penetrate 16 feet (5 meters) into Mars, using a self-hammering nail with heat sensors to gauge the planet\u2019s internal temperature. That would shatter the out-of-this-world depth record of 8 feet (2 \u00bd meters) drilled by the Apollo moonwalkers nearly a half-century ago for lunar heat measurements.\n\nThe astronauts also left behind instruments to measure moonquakes. InSight carries the first seismometers to monitor for marsquakes \u2014 if they exist. Yet another experiment will calculate Mars\u2019 wobble, providing clues about the planet\u2019s core.\n\nIt won\u2019t be looking for signs of life, past or present. No life detectors are on board.\n\nThe spacecraft is like a self-sufficient robot, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got its own brain. It\u2019s got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun,\u201d he said.\n\nBy scoping out the insides of Mars, scientists could learn how our neighbor \u2014 and other rocky worlds, including the Earth and moon \u2014 formed and transformed over billions of years. Mars is much less geologically active than Earth, and so its interior is closer to being in its original state \u2014 a tantalizing time capsule.\n\nInSight stands to \u201crevolutionize the way we think about the inside of the planet,\u201d said NASA\u2019s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen.\n\nBut first, the 800-pound (360-kilogram) vehicle needs to get safely to the Martian surface. This time, there won\u2019t be a ball bouncing down with the spacecraft tucked inside, like there were for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004. And there won\u2019t be a sky crane to lower the lander like there was for the six-wheeled Curiosity during its dramatic \u201cseven minutes of terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was crazy,\u201d acknowledged InSight\u2019s project manager, Tom Hoffman. But he noted, \u201cAny time you\u2019re trying to land on Mars, it\u2019s crazy, frankly. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a sane way to do it.\u201d\n\nNo matter how it\u2019s done, getting to Mars and landing there is hard \u2014 and unforgiving.\n\nEarth\u2019s success rate at Mars is a mere 40 percent. That includes planetary flybys dating back to the early 1960s, as well as orbiters and landers.\n\nWhile it\u2019s had its share of flops, the U.S. has by far the best track record. No one else has managed to land and operate a spacecraft on Mars. Two years ago, a European lander came in so fast, its descent system askew, that it carved out a crater on impact.\n\nThis time, NASA is borrowing a page from the 1976 twin Vikings and the 2008 Phoenix, which also were stationary and three-legged.\n\n\u201cBut you never know what Mars is going to do,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve done it before doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not nervous and excited about doing it again.\u201d\n\nWind gusts could send the spacecraft into a dangerous tumble during descent, or the parachute could get tangled. A dust storm like the one that enveloped Mars this past summer could hamper InSight\u2019s ability to generate solar power. A leg could buckle. The arm could jam.\n\nThe tensest time for flight controllers in Pasadena, California: the six minutes from the time the spacecraft hits Mars\u2019 atmosphere and touchdown. They\u2019ll have jars of peanuts on hand \u2014 a good-luck tradition dating back to 1964\u2019s successful Ranger 7 moon mission.\n\nInSight will enter Mars\u2019 atmosphere at a supersonic 12,300 mph (19,800 kph), relying on its white nylon parachute and a series of engine firings to slow down enough for a soft upright landing on Mars\u2019 Elysium Planitia, a sizable equatorial plain.\n\nHoffman hopes it\u2019s \u201clike a Walmart parking lot in Kansas.\u201d\n\nThe flatter the better so the lander doesn\u2019t tip over, ending the mission, and so the robotic arm can set the science instruments down.\n\nInSight \u2014 short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport \u2014 will rest close to the ground, its top deck barely a yard, or meter, above the surface. Once its twin circular solar panels open, the lander will occupy the space of a large car.\n\nIf NASA gets lucky, a pair of briefcase-size satellites trailing InSight since their joint May liftoff could provide near-live updates during the lander\u2019s descent. There\u2019s an eight-minute lag in communications between Earth and Mars.\n\nThe experimental CubeSats, dubbed WALL-E and EVE from the 2008 animated movie, will zoom past Mars and remain in perpetual orbit around the sun, their technology demonstration complete.\n\nIf WALL-E and EVE are mute, landing news will come from NASA orbiters at Mars, just not as quickly.\n\nThe first pictures of the landing site should start flowing shortly after touchdown. It will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed. Add another several weeks for the heat probe to bury into Mars.\n\nThe mission is designed to last one full Martian year, the equivalent of two Earth years.\n\nWith landing day so close to Thanksgiving, many of the flight controllers will be eating turkey at their desks on the holiday.\n\nHoffman expects his team will wait until Monday to give full and proper thanks.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun was holding the talks with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Do-hoon.\n\n\u201cWe have made clear to the ROK that we do want to make sure that peace on the peninsula and denuclearization of North Korea aren\u2019t lagging behind the increase in the relationship between the two Koreas,\u201d Pompeo told a news conference, using the acronym for the South\u2019s official name, the Republic of Korea. \u201cWe view them as moving forward together.\u201d\n\nNegotiations between the U.S. and North Korea on ending its nuclear program have appeared to stall in the months since President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un held a historic summit in Singapore, where they made a vague commitment on \u201cdenuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula but glossed over how to make it happen.\n\nSo while North Korea is pressing for sanctions relief now, the U.S. is continuing to intensify economic restrictions and says it won\u2019t relent until Pyongyang denuclearizes.\n\nIn the meantime, South Korea\u2019s liberal government has pressed forward in cooperation with the North, staging brief reunions of divided families and dialing down military tensions. North Korea on Tuesday blew up some of its front-line guard posts on the heavily fortified border as part of an agreement with the South, Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said.\n\nThat\u2019s not been opposed by the U.S., but last month, South Korea was forced to walk back on a proposal to lift some of its unilateral sanctions against North Korea, which was viewed as premature by Washington. At that time, Trump retorted that Seoul could \u201cdo nothing\u201d without Washington\u2019s approval.\n\nWhile fears of armed conflict between the U.S. and North Korea have reduced since their leaders were trading threats and insults last year, doubts linger over the North\u2019s commitment to giving up its nukes. U.S. officials are also wary of any effort by the North to create a rift in the seven-decade U.S.-South Korean alliance.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Not by the British people, or their long-term guests.\n\nEast London, West London, posh or poor, public school or private, city or country \u2014 if there is a queue, you bloody well take your place.\n\nKeep calm and carry on?\n\nThe whole reason the British \u2014 who are actually highly excitable \u2014 can keep calm is because there is a queue, and they know that if they stand at the back of it, they will eventually get to the front of it.\n\nOrder, people.\n\nYou know who cuts in line? In the British mind? Barbarians. Vikings. Foreigners.\n\nIt is true that sometimes a clueless tourist will jump the queue and then everyone in line, collectively, begins to get twitchy and invisibly upset, until, collectively, they decide not to actually say anything out loud to the tourist because that would be rude.\n\nBut they think it.\n\nIn a major speech to promote her Brexit deal to business leaders in the country on Monday, May promised, \u201cIt will no longer be the case that E.U. nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi.\u201d\n\nEgads. The Europeans didn\u2019t like this at all.\n\nNice to be told, after 28 years in the UK, that I jumped a queue that didn\u2019t in fact exist. I\u2019m sure such language makes \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d want to rush to the sort of country that\u2019ll unilaterally un-invite and demonise them the moment they become politically inconvenient. \u2014 Alex Andreou (@sturdyAlex) November 19, 2018\n\nEU citizens living, working, contributing to UK communities didn't \"jump the queue\" & neither did UK nationals in Europe.

This post was written by Lily Howard Scott, who until recently taught in Brooklyn and who now lives and teaches in Washington.\n\nScott says it is important for educators to develop curriculum that melds academic, social and emotional learning. She also says classrooms should feel less like fact-dispensing assembly lines and more like \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d: intellectually exciting spaces in which children can connect with one another, explore their inner lives and develop greater self-awareness and empathy.\n\nScott says she has discovered that helping students become emotionally literate does not distract from academic achievement, but is a catalyst for it, as students with deeper inter- and intrapersonal understanding develop into \u201cmore sophisticated readers, writers, and critical thinkers.\u201d\n\nAll students benefit from learning how to navigate their emotions but boys have a special need because of societal norms. She argues that educators should lead the way in teaching and inspiring emotional literacy.\n\nHere\u2019s her piece.\n\nBy Lily Howard Scott\n\nThere\u2019s a gift shop in Brooklyn that knows its audience well. In the window, sequined pencil cases and T-shirts shout \u201cGirl Boss\u201d and \u201cFearless Female Warrior.\u201d When two of my third-grade students walk into the classroom wearing identical \u201cStrong Is the New Pretty\u201d tank tops, they high-five one another. I beam, feeling uplifted and a bit smug \u2014 yes, girls, you are powerful and proud! Did my teaching embolden you? (Answer: No. These two were born in Park Slope and have been railing against the patriarchy since preschool.)\n\nI turn to their male classmates and wonder: Will any of them ever don a \u201cSensitive Is the New Strong\u201d backpack? An \u201cEmotional Warrior\u201d T-shirt? A \u201cVulnerable Vibes\u201d beanie?\n\nIn the age of #ShePersisted and #TimesUp, many of us are thrilled that girls are, well, behaving more like boys: challenging authority and speaking their minds. Thank goodness we\u2019re broadening our understanding of what girls can do and be. But while we\u2019re eager to celebrate girls who display traditionally \u201cmasculine\u201d virtues like courage and assertiveness, we haven\u2019t been as quick to celebrate boys who embrace traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d qualities like introspection or vulnerability.\n\nThis asymmetry is just another manifestation of sexism: As Sarah Rich recently observed, when we \u201csend a message to children that \u2018boyish\u2019 girls are badass but \u2018girlish\u2019 boys are embarrassing, [we] are telling kids that society values and rewards masculinity, but not femininity.\u201d\n\nIf emotional literacy \u2014 the ability to identify, understand, and express our feelings and to empathize with the feelings of others\u2014 is to be gendered as \u201cfeminine,\u201d we\u2019re in trouble.\n\nMichael Ian Black warns that emotionally stunted boys become dysfunctional men who remain \u201ctrapped in the same suffocating, outdated model of masculinity, where manhood is measured in strength, where there is no way to be vulnerable without being emasculated, where manliness is about having power over others.\u201d\n\nBut cultural and economic changes have diluted that power and left many men feeling insignificant and angry (if not downright obsolete). It\u2019s no surprise that quite a few have taken comfort in far-right movements and misogynist Internet subcultures.\n\nOn a less dramatic note, I know plenty of men who seem well-adjusted but are emotionally illiterate. They try to suppress their insecurities and anxieties, but when those feelings inevitably bubble up, these men don\u2019t understand them, can\u2019t name them, and are therefore at their mercy. Unable to communicate productively, they shut down or lash out.\n\nIt\u2019s critical that we find a way to give America\u2019s boys the tools to wrangle with their inner lives. How can we normalize the language of emotional literacy before it\u2019s too late?\n\nAccording to the inimitable (and aptly named) Fred McFeely Rogers \u2014 T.V.\u2019s Mister Rogers \u2014 we need to start early. Testifying before the Senate in 1969, Fred Rogers insisted that young children need to learn that their \u201cfeelings are mentionable and manageable,\u201d and that talking to children about the \u201cmad that they feel\u201d can be the first step to their learning how to navigate tricky emotions.\n\nParents can have these conversations with their children. So can therapists. But these options only work when families are aware of and interested in tackling this issue.\n\nWho\u2019s left? Happily, someone who spends about 1,800 hours with young boys every year: their elementary-school teacher. Responsible for the holistic education of students during the most formative time of their lives, a lower-grade teacher has a particularly powerful platform for reaching children because she\u2019s with them all day long. And a second- or third-grade boy, not yet paralyzed by self-consciousness, is an enthusiastic and impressionable being.\n\nIf his teacher models how to identify her feelings, how to share about them with others, and how to manage them, he\u2019ll listen. If she asks him to do the same, he\u2019ll give it a try.\n\nThrough role-playing, writing and talking about his emotions, he\u2019ll learn how to name and categorize them. He may even discover how to recognize his personal predilections and patterns, how to interrupt negative self-talk, and how to quiet his anxieties. Perhaps most importantly, by listening to his classmates share about their inner lives, he\u2019ll realize that his worries and insecurities aren\u2019t unique to him.\n\nHe\u2019ll feel less alone, and he\u2019ll develop a heightened sense of connectedness with, and empathy for, the experiences of others.\n\nAlthough this sounds like a tall order, it\u2019s possible. Determined to try to Mister Rogersify my teaching, I recently integrated emotional literacy instruction throughout my language-arts curriculum. My 8- and 9-year-old students created maps of their \u201cinner swirls and outer shells\u201d \u2014 what they feel and how they believe others perceive them, respectively \u2014 and used those maps to inspire poetry writing.\n\nAs the children shared about their fears, hopes and wonderings, they marveled at the assumptions they had made about one another and at their unexpected connections.\n\nOne boy cautioned his classmates not to underestimate him: \u201cjust because I\u2019m disabled/ doesn\u2019t mean you can win every battle/ just because I have glasses/ doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m blind.\u201d Another explored the pressures he feels to act in different ways with different people: \u201cthey are my true friends/ who I dare show both sides of me to.\u201d And a third boy taught us all a lesson in dealing with anxiety: \u201cif you think focusing on your worries is gonna help/ it really isn\u2019t/ so let them do their thing/ and eventually/ poof/ they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\nWhile this introspective work resonated with all my students, I was pleased \u2014 and frankly a bit surprised \u2014 to find that many boys were especially eager to jump into it. They seemed thrilled to discover that revealing their \u201cinner swirls\u201d didn\u2019t alienate them from their peers but actually connected them to one another more deeply.\n\nSome might question how my class spent its time. Plenty of people seem to think of a teacher\u2019s job as dispensing facts and taking responsibility for test scores and other readily quantified indicia of \u201cachievement.\u201d\n\nBut I think it\u2019s at least as important to invest in forming functional human beings as it is to impart readily available knowledge and soon-to-be-automated skills. And emotionally literate students are generally more sophisticated readers, writers and critical thinkers than their classmates who haven\u2019t yet learned how to cope with anxiety or self-doubt \u2014 when faced with an intimidating assignment, these ill-equipped children tend to withdraw or give up.\n\nLower-grade teachers are some of the most thoughtful interventionists I know. They can boost a student\u2019s reading level or transform a child\u2019s attitude about math.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we reconceive what they\u2019re capable of and train them to expressly teach children to identify, express and manage their feelings? Public and private schools spend thousands of dollars each year on professional development. This fall, I\u2019d encourage administrators to prioritize something a bit harder to quantify than test scores, but just as vital: the emotional lives of America\u2019s kids \u2014 especially its boys."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Woman claims Avenatti dragged her by arm across floor - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Woman claims Avenatti dragged her by arm across floor Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 An actress who says she had a relationship with Michael Avenatti alleges that he dragged her across the floor of his Los Angeles apartment after an argument ove\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/celebrities/woman-claims-avenatti-dragged-her-by-arm-across-floor/2018/11/20/ad308bb4-ecfb-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:38:01Z", "content": "WASHINGTON An actress who says she had a relationship with Michael Avenatti alleges that he dragged her across the floor of his Los Angeles apartment after an argument over money, according to court documents obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.

Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trump\u2019s \u201cfailure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way . . . is just one more example of this White House\u2019s retreat from American leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s publisher and CEO, Fred Ryan, also heavily criticized the president\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s response to the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is a betrayal of long-established American values of respect for human rights and the expectation of trust and honesty in our strategic relationships,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHe is placing personal relationships and commercial interests above American interests in his desire to continue to do business as usual with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nTrump indicated that he would fight congressional efforts to curtail the U.S-Saudi relationship. \u201cI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cI will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported last week that the CIA had determined it was effectively impossible that such an operation could have been carried out without the approval of Mohammed, the son of King Salman and the country\u2019s de facto leader. Many of the 18 people the kingdom has said it arrested in connection with the crime were members of the royal guard, and two top aides to the crown prince were reportedly fired. On Sunday, Trump said he was awaiting a full briefing on intelligence conclusions.\n\nThe agency\u2019s assessment relied on audio recordings provided by Turkey and intercepted phone calls, as well as other analysis work performed by Saudi experts at the CIA, according to people familiar with the agency\u2019s work. Trump had already received intelligence briefings on the matter, and CIA Director Gina Haspel had shown the president details of the crown prince\u2019s involvement.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear that he had received any additional information before issuing Tuesday\u2019s eight-paragraph statement. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe statement \u2014 titled \u201cAmerica First!\u201d \u2014 began: \u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d\n\nTrump went on to describe the danger posed by Iran. In addition to fighting proxy wars and supporting terrorists, he said, \u201cthe Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East,\u201d and Iran \u201cstates openly, and with great force, \u2018Death to America!\u2019 and \u2018Death to Israel!\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he continued, Saudi Arabia has \u201cagreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\u201d He lauded U.S.-Saudi economic ties and personally took credit for what he called historic Saudi investments here.\n\n\u201cAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money,\u201d Trump claimed, citing a figure that many experts have said greatly exaggerates the real value of Saudi deals.\n\nSince Saudi Arabia first acknowledged that Khashoggi had been killed in an operation at its Istanbul consulate, Trump has repeatedly emphasized the economic aspects of the relationship, and the statement again stressed his concern that Saudi investments here could be canceled and that major defense contracts would go instead to Russia and China.\n\nRussia has been actively courting Saudi weapons purchases, and Riyadh, despite U.S. urging, has declined to say that it will rebuff those entreaties. An internal Saudi memo obtained by The Post, confirmed as genuine by a Saudi official close to the government with knowledge about the topic, indicated that Mohammed, in the weeks before a trip he made to Moscow in June, was briefed on what the Russians could provide. The list included equipment and training for ground forces, major weapons systems such as the S-400 antimissile defense system along with reconnaissance ships, and electronic warfare and other intelligence equipment.\n\nIn the memo, dated June 15, 2018, the day after Mohammed met with Putin, he repeated those options and asked the head of Saudi defense development to \u201cprovide your vision on this matter.\u201d\n\nTrump also referred to Saudi Arabia as \u201cafter the United States . . . the largest oil producing nation in the world,\u201d and said the Saudis have been \u201cresponsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels.\u201d Trump indicated that in anticipation of the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports early this month, he had made a deal with Riyadh to keep its own production high to avoid a spike in oil prices.\n\nBut U.S. sanction waivers granted to most of Iran\u2019s major customers have kept prices unusually low, and the Saudis said last week that they intended to cut production.\n\nTrump took up a Saudi claim, fanned by some on the American political right, that Khashoggi was seen as an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group opposed by Riyadh, although he described the killing as \u201ca horrible crime.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s statement smearing Jamal Khashoggi and giving Saudi Arabia a pass, annotated]\n\nBut the reference amounted to an unsubstantiated slur of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, who although he had friends within the movement had also once been a loyal supporter and close ally of the Saudi royal family.\n\nTrump insisted that \u201cmy decision was in no way based on that,\u201d referring to the claims that Khashoggi was a danger to Saudi Arabia. When The Post first reported on Nov. 1 that the crown prince privately described Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist to senior administration officials, Saudi officials denied making any such claims and portrayed Khashoggi as a friend of the kingdom.\n\nEven before the Khashoggi killing, Saudi Arabia\u2019s conduct in the ongoing war in Yemen, which Mohammed launched in 2015 in his role as defense minister, had led to calls by lawmakers for reducing the relationship. The conflict has become a bloodbath, with thousands of casualties blamed on Saudi airstrikes and many more dead or dying from starvation.\n\nWhile both Saudi Arabia and the United States have tried to refocus attention on Iranian support for Houthi militias on the other side of the fighting, the Saudis have come in for heavy global criticism. Earlier this month, the administration said it would end U.S. refueling of Saudi jets striking Yemen, although other logistical and intelligence support has continued.\n\nIt was Iran, Trump said, that was responsible for the war, and for \u201ctrying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave,\u201d Trump said in his statement. \u201cThey would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its support against Iran, Trump said, the Saudi-U.S. partnership also helps \u201censure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\u201d The administration has been counting on Saudi Arabia to lead the Arab world in supporting its still-unrevealed plan to forge a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe statement, and further comments by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, left little doubt that, as far as the administration was concerned, relations with Saudi Arabia would continue as normal and that Trump planned to put the Khashoggi crisis behind him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mean, nasty world out there. The Middle East in particular,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cIt is the president\u2019s obligation and indeed the State Department\u2019s duty as well to ensure that we adopt policy that furthers America\u2019s national security. So as the president said today, the United States will continue to have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nJohn Hudson, Carol Morello, Tom Hamburger and Karoun Demirjian and Loveday Morris contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Washington Post Staff", "title": "Trump continues to question CIA conclusion that Saudi crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death", "description": "The statement from President Trump came after he said he would be receiving a full report on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month and after The Washington Post reported that the CIA had assessed with high con\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/11/20/trump-continues-to-question-cia-conclusion-that-saudi-crown-prince-was-responsible-for-khashoggis-death/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:09:10Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "President Trump declared his strong support for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, effectively ignoring the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and asserting that relations with a critical ally should not be derailed.\n\nIn an exclamation-mark-packed statement that aides said he dictated himself, Trump said that U.S. intelligence would continue to \u201cassess\u201d information but that the United States \u201cmay never know all the facts surrounding the murder.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of whether the crown prince knew about or ordered the killing by Saudi agents last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Trump said \u201cmaybe he did or maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d But the president indicated that U.S. interests in Saudi oil production, weapons purchases and support for administration policies in the Middle East were more important than holding an ally to account, and he stressed the importance of staying in the kingdom\u2019s good graces.\n\n\u201cThey have been a great ally,\u201d he said of the Saudis, and \u201cthe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner.\u201d Speaking later to reporters as he left the White House for his Florida resort, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to destroy our economy by being foolish with Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense of Saudi Arabia, whose leaders have denied knowledge of the operation while acknowledging that its agents carried it out, marks another instance when he has sided with the personal assurances of an autocrat over the analysis of his own intelligence officials.\n\nHe also took the word of Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin that he didn\u2019t interfere in the 2016 election, despite the unanimous conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community to the contrary.

Turkish officials said the crown prince has requested a meeting there with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has all but directly accused him of ordering the killing of Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post who had lived in the United States since leaving the kingdom last year out of what he said was fear for his safety.\n\nTuesday\u2019s startling presidential statement was quickly condemned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\n[Trump\u2019s full statement giving Saudi Arabia a pass for Jamal Khashoggi, annotated]\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Sen.

It\u2019s a remarkable statement that even includes a smear against the slain journalist, while insisting that Trump didn\u2019t believe the smear.\n\nBelow is the statement in full, with our annotations.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia\n\nAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.

It\u2019s a remarkable statement that even includes a smear against the slain journalist, while insisting that Trump didn\u2019t believe the smear.\n\nBelow is the statement in full, with our annotations.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia\n\nAmerica First!\n\nThe world is a very dangerous place!\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nAfter my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\n###"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Trump\u2019s political safety net hangs by a thread", "description": "Trump will head into 2020 without economic winds at his back.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/20/trumps-political-safety-net-hangs-by-a-thread/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xgVenxdig8mdIleqqS5Jl-aLK1g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EORTLW3F6YYBPMNR7OLACUOXZI.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T18:00:58Z", "content": "Anthony W.

The story\u2026 [+5017 chars]", "fulltext": "\n\nTrader Gregory Rowe works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 8. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nAnthony W. Orlando writes for The Post about the economic fortunes of counties that voted for Trump:\n\nTrump counties \u2014 and especially counties with higher proportions of Trump voters \u2014 continue to fall farther behind the rest of the country economically. The story of our economy, like the story of our politics, continues to be a story of division and divergence. \u2026\n\nThe average Trump county added 1.13 percent more jobs, while the average Clinton county added 0.49 percent. These increases are quite small, especially considering that significantly fewer jobs existed in Trump counties to begin with. Housing prices tell a similar story, with even more data stretching into 2018. Regardless of how I compare the counties, Clinton supporters consistently come out on top.\n\nNone of this should be surprising, because President Trump hasn\u2019t done much of anything for these Americans. His tax cuts for the rich and for corporations (which used tax savings for stock buybacks) didn\u2019t help them. Moreover, Trump\u2019s trade policy has hurt rural America.\n\nIn the Trump economy, the rich get richer, while the poor and the poor locales in the United States get poorer. (\u201cStatistically, there appears to be no significant improvement in job growth. The gap in housing price growth actually widens. In fact, the larger the Trump electorate and the larger the degree of Trump support, the worse the county\u2019s economic performance.\u201d)\n\nIf Trump had anything resembling a rural development policy or an infrastructure plan or a meaningful worker training policy, we might see improvement in Trump country. Instead, we see the toll of income inequality in which the gap between rich and poor \u2014 as well as between rich and poor regions \u2014 grows.\n\nMoreover, this is all happening in the context of a very strong economy. What happens when the economy cools?\n\nEconomic prognosticators see the economy slowing down as the sugar high from the tax cuts wears off. Goldman Sachs, for example, sees GDP growth at \u201c2.9 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019, 1.6 percent in 2020, and 1.5 percent in 2021.\u201d Couple that with Trump\u2019s tariff war and an already softening housing market, and you will the full impact of Trump\u2019s economic policies. (\u201cThe National Association of Home Builders on Monday said its housing-market index dropped by eight points to a reading of 60 in November, well below economists\u2019 expectations and the lowest level in more than two years.\u201d)\n\nThe Post reports: \u201cMore than a third of top forecasters believe the U.S. economy will enter a recession in 2020; and a new Reuters poll of economists found they think the probability of a recession in the next two years is rising, to a median 35 percent. (The Fed projects GDP will slow to 2.5 percent next year, a 2 percent in 2020, before slipping to 1.8 percent in the longer run.)\u201d\n\nWhile debate rages about whether the economy will tip into a recession, few economists expect that the economy will be doing better in 2020 than it is now. And that, politically speaking, is potentially disastrous for Trump and even his most dogged fans in red states. Economically insecure Americans will feel the pain first and most acutely, so when Democrats ask them and other Americans whether they are better off than they were in 2017, the answer could well be no.\n\nFormer car czar Steven Rattner noted that Trump already performed worse politically than predecessors given the economy. \u201cAs President Trump has often bragged, he went into this election with consumer sentiment at a historically high level,\u201d Rattner explained. \u201cIndeed, only one other president (Bill Clinton in 1998) enjoyed such strong sentiment on the eve of a mid-term election. But unlike Mr. Clinton, who was handed a pick-up of five seats in the House, Mr. Trump will end up losing about 39.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s false bravado, \u201cThat is the third worst showing since this consumer confidence series was first compiled in the late 1970s. During this four decade time period, seven incumbent presidents saw their party perform relatively better, despite consumer sentiment levels lower than Mr. Trump\u2019s.\u201d Now imagine Trump\u2019s 2020 performance if the economy is weaker than it is now.\n\nIn sum, Trump\u2019s economic promises to his rural base haven\u2019t been kept. His policies either ignored rural voters or made their finances worse. They\u2019ve stuck with him more or less during a time of overall prosperity, but for them as well as for other Americans still struggling to regain their economic footing from the financial crash in 2008, an economic downturn between now and the 2020 election might send Trump\u2019s approval rating and reelection prospects spiraling downward.\n\nDemocrats in the meantime would be wise to develop an economic program that helps rural America close the gap with more prosperous parts of the country and directs tax benefits and spending to those who aren\u2019t rich already. If Democrats offer something demonstrable better for Trump voters than what Trump has offered, these voters would be foolish not to dump Trump. After all, they want to start winning again.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Republican Party isn\u2019t \u2018grand,\u2019 and its old ideas are making it irrelevant\n\nA critical lawsuit over the acting attorney general\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t want to be called racists \u2026\n\nRepublicans used to vilify presidents who disrespected the military"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Michael O'Sullivan", "title": "Who needs another new \u2018Robin Hood\u2019 movie?

The more invested you are in the old-fashioned Robin Hood of legend \u2014 here played by Taron Egerton, in a quilted, black-leather hoodie that makes him look like he stepped out of Barney\u2019s on Madison Avenue, and not Sherwood Forest \u2014 the less likely you are to enjoy what amounts to a chilly and flavorless frapp\u00e9 of historical speculation, revisionist folklore and every lazy action-movie cliche ever written.\n\n\u201cThis is not gonna end well,\u201d says our hero\u2019s sidekick, Friar Tuck (Tim Minchin), early in the film.\n\nTuck\u2019s prediction turns out to be not only a prophetic review of the film\u2019s tedious and bloated plot, which involves collusion between the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Ben Mendelsohn), a larcenous Roman Catholic cardinal (F. Murray Abraham) and unnamed Arabs, but the first of many gratingly anachronistic lines of dialogue. Other ear-jarring examples include:\n\n\u201cWhat else ya got?,\u201d \u201cI wanna go big\u201d and \u201cAre we really gonna do this now?\u201d Apparently, medieval people talk just like Dwayne Johnson in \u201cSkyscraper.\u201d\n\n\n\nTaron Egerton, left, and Jamie Foxx star in \u201cRobin Hood.\u201d (Attila Szvacsek/Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment)\n\nSet during the Crusades, the film is at heart just another superhero origin story, at first presenting its spoiled, upper-class toff of a protagonist as a disaffected war veteran. Returning home from the Middle East wounded, Robin finds his manor home in ruins and his love interest, Marion (Eve Hewson), seeking comfort in the arms of another man (Jamie Dornan). Marion presumes Robin is dead, see? (Judging by Egerton\u2019s wooden performance \u2014 except when performing acrobatic stunts \u2014 she\u2019s not far off.)\n\nEgged on by Little John (Jamie Foxx), a Moorish stowaway who has come to England in hopes of ending the Crusades by cutting off their funding, Robin begins to carry out ever-larger heists of the state\u2019s treasury. True to the Robin Hood myth, that money goes straight back to the people. Soon, that altruism inspires a grass-roots rebellion, with Robin leading the downtrodden masses in an armed uprising against an unjust tax system.\n\nDoes \u201cRobin Hood,\u201d with its subtext of populism, have anything to say about the current cultural moment? Doubtful.\n\nIt\u2019s probably more helpful to think of the director Otto Bathurst as just a poor man\u2019s Guy Ritchie, the filmmaker who never met a beloved character he couldn\u2019t improve on. I\u2019m thinking of Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s turbocharged Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Hunnam\u2019s steroidal King Arthur.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the constant need to reinvigorate the classics. Bathurst\u2019s \u201cRobin Hood\u201d gives us a Prince of Thieves who is so made over for the modern moviegoer that he\u2019s virtually unrecognizable."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Thomas M.

This exchange took place early Monday, before reports surfaced of verbal altercations at a recent Washington practice, which a person familiar with the team described as \u201cembarrassing.\u201d Still, the chat question \u2014 and Boswell\u2019s answer \u2014 captured some of the current angst surrounding the franchise.\n\n\u201cI have a mini-ticket package and have been to three Wizards games this season,\u201d wrote the reader. \u201cAs you can imagine, they lost each game, two of them in spectacular fashion. There\u2019s a lot wrong with the team. I\u2019m not sure how much I believe in Scott Brooks as their coach. The team is so flat (or randomly not-flat) that you have to wonder if the team is done hearing Brooks\u2019s voice. Was one of the reasons he was hired to lure Kevin Durant to D.C. in the summer of \u201916? Given that Durant didn\u2019t even take a meeting with them, it was pretty clear he didn\u2019t want to play in Washington. Wouldn\u2019t the Wiz brain trust have known this fact and perhaps gone a different way in their coaching hire? I would have expected the team to know that Durant wouldn\u2019t even take a meeting with them and therefore strategize differently around the summer of 2016.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Boswell\u2019s answer:\n\nVery good points. I felt the same thing at the time: What are they thinking? They aren\u2019t going to get within a thousand miles of K.D., and everybody \u2014 except them \u2014 knows it.\n\nDoes anybody listen to anybody within that franchise. When players, especially your best players \u2014 like John Wall and Bradley Beal \u2014 constantly seem to be saying that the problem after a bad loss was \u201clack of effort,\u201d that often means they don\u2019t want to say the truth, which is that there\u2019s a lack of talent \u2014 including less talent in their own games than they want to admit, even to themselves. The only thing Beal can do at an above-NBA-average level is shoot. That\u2019s a great thing to be good at. But there\u2019s not a lot more to his game. Wall can do a lot of things \u2014 if he would focus on those things, including defense \u2014 but he can\u2019t shoot, from any distance, including layups in traffic. And he doesn\u2019t know it.\n\nI wrote a column about Bad Owners last week. I should have mentioned Abe Pollin and Ted Leonsis in their combined incompetence in running the Bullets/Wiz for what is now 40 seasons of despair. The Wiz need to go on a winning streak to reverse this trend.\n\n[\u2018I\u2019m sick of this\u2019: Wizards\u2019 dysfunction boils over into verbal altercations at recent practice]\n\nHow long a winning streak? Just to make them a .500 team over the last 40 seasons? They\u2019d need to win 454 games in a row.\n\nThis is one of the historically awful teams in U.S. pro sports. And the spiral, after some hopes in recent years, seems to be going back down the drain.\n\nWhenever the Wiz start talking about \u201cHow do we get better?\u201d I always want to say, \u201cLOOK IN THE MIRROR. You first order of business is to make sure that you DON\u2019T GET EVEN WORSE.\u201d\n\nWith some franchises, I\u2019d be quick to advise 'em to \u201cbreak this mess up.\u201d With the Wiz, I wouldn\u2019t. Because it\u2019s more likely they\u2019d find a way to get back down to 25-to-30 wins for several seasons, but still never land the lottery pick Hall of Famer who changes the whole picture.\n\nMy advice: Stop trying. Just play. Get a little better. Stop pretending your weaknesses are strengths. Listen to the coach. Oh, and fire the GM, just to get people's attention.\n\nNext week: I plan to have new, and completely different, advice. I have only one rule with the Wiz: Don\u2019t let 'em spoil your day. And when I have a half-dozen games that I\u2019ve recorded in various sports, I always make sure to keep the Wiz game to watch last \u2014 or, if I\u2019m lucky, never.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAround the NBA, skepticism over whether Wizards would actually trade John Wall or Bradley Beal\n\nLeBron James: Cavs\u2019 Kyrie Irving trade was \u2018the beginning of the end for everything\u2019\n\nJimmy Butler is fitting into the 76ers' system seamlessly\n\nSteve Kerr and the Warriors awaken from their \u2018dream\u2019 run to face \u2018real adversity\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Saudi women's rights advocates reportedly abused while in prison", "description": "Several of the women were given electric shocks or flogged, said people familiar with the incidents.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/saudi-womens-rights-advocates-reportedly-abused-while-in-prison/2018/11/20/9e77f11c-ebfb-11e8-9236-bb94154151d2_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6quXmMgLG_moIG31zgP4EPLcyUc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L3TQM2HM4II6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:59:00Z", "content": "ISTANBUL Several womens rights activists who have been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for more than six months have been subjected to psychological or physical abuse while in custody, including sleep deprivation and beatings, according to four people familiar wit\u2026 [+5602 chars]", "fulltext": "Saudi authorities began detaining the country\u2019s most prominent feminists in mid-May, after several waves of previous arrests had targeted other high-profile figures. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n\nSeveral women\u2019s rights activists who have been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for more than six months have been subjected to psychological or physical abuse while in custody, including sleep deprivation and beatings, according to four people familiar with the conditions of the activists\u2019 detention.\n\nSome of the abuse occurred during interrogations in which several of the women were administered electric shocks or flogged, two of the people said, citing a witness account. Other women displayed what witnesses said were apparent signs of abuse, including uncontrollable shaking or difficulty standing, the people said.\n\nThe allegations of abuse and torture were impossible to independently confirm. Families are reluctant to repeat what they hear from the detainees during prison visits, fearing retaliation by the authorities. The four people who spoke about the abuse, all Saudi citizens, have contacts in the prison or had been briefed on conditions there. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern that revealing their names could identify the detainees.\n\nAsked to comment on the allegations, a Saudi official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an emailed statement: \u201cThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s judiciary system does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture. Anyone, whether male or female, being investigated is going through the standard judiciary process led by the public prosecution while being held for questioning, which does not in any way rely on torture either physical, sexual, or psychological.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International released a report Tuesday also saying that several of the Saudi activists detained since May have reportedly faced sexual harassment, torture and other forms of mistreatment while being interrogated. The report was released subsequent to The Washington Post\u2019s independent interviews with the four people familiar with detention conditions.\n\nThe killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last month in Istanbul has heightened scrutiny of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and fueled rumors that Saudi authorities were considering releasing some of the female activists to blunt some of the criticism of the kingdom.\n\nBut seven weeks after the killing of Khashoggi, who contributed opinion pieces to The Post, none of the activists have been released, and there has been no indication that prosecutors have taken new steps to indict them.\n\nSaudi authorities began detaining the country\u2019s most prominent feminists in mid-May, after several waves of previous arrests targeted other high-profile figures, including clerics, royal family members, business executives and independent political activists. Some of the women had worked for decades to repeal a ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe arrests, which included men who had worked with the female activists, drew international outrage in part because they occurred just weeks before the Saudi government officially lifted the driving ban \u2014 and hailed its repeal as an important step forward for women\u2019s rights in the kingdom.\n\nSaudi authorities, who usually withhold the names of criminal suspects, also mounted a highly unusual campaign to publicize the women\u2019s identities after detaining them on accusations that included illegal contacts with foreign countries.\n\nNone of the activists have been charged or granted access to lawyers, said the people familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to the people familiar with the detentions, some of the female activists were detained for months at a building believed to be a hotel, where some of the worst abuses occurred at the hands of male interrogators. Many were then transferred to Dhahban prison in the coastal city of Jiddah. In both facilities, detainees were held in solitary confinement for long periods.\n\nIn addition to the beatings and electric shocks, at least one prisoner was hung from the ceiling during an interrogation. Another prisoner was told, falsely, that a relative had been killed. A third inmate has attempted suicide several times, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA former inmate at Dhahban who said she was released about three months ago said that she had witnessed interrogators beating inmates at the facility, using phone cables and other implements. She did not have any specific information about the treatment of the women\u2019s rights activists, she said.\n\nThe Amnesty report said one of the female detainees was reportedly subjected to sexual harassment by interrogators wearing masks. According to testimonies cited by Amnesty, activists were repeatedly administered electric shocks or flogged. Some of the activists were left unable to walk or stand properly.\n\n\u201cOnly a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities,\u201d Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East research director, said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Amnesty, at least a dozen women and men associated with the Saudi feminist movement have been detained since May. Several who were well known for their activism had been arrested in the past, including Samar Badawi, Aziza al-Yousef and Loujain al-Hathloul.

Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who left Washington last week planning to take the Thanksgiving holiday to ponder a run against Pelosi for speaker. But her dalliance ended Tuesday. Fudge said she would support Pelosi after the minority leader agreed to make Fudge chairman of a resurrected subcommittee on elections and pledged that \u201cthe most loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party, black women, will have a seat at the decision-making table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am now confident that we will move forward together,\u201d Fudge said in a statement. \u201cI now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) is seeking to become majority leader, and Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.), currently the assistant Democratic leader, is running for majority whip.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents continue to insist they have the votes to block her from the speakership when the full House meets Jan. 3. But Fudge\u2019s withdrawal showed that their numbers are dwindling, not growing \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAnd it demonstrated that Pelosi \u2014 whose bare-knuckle political skills were forged in her Baltimore upbringing, numerous prior House leadership races, and high-stakes legislative battles during her four-year speakership \u2014 has considerable tools at her disposal to win further support.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday in Chicago, Obama hailed Pelosi as \u201cone of the most effective legislative leaders that this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy is not always the best on a cable show or with a quick sound bite or what have you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut her skill, tenacity, toughness, vision, is remarkable. Her stamina, her ability to see around corners, her ability to stand her ground and do hard things and to suffer unpopularity to get the right thing done I think stands up against any person that I\u2019ve observed or worked directly with in Washington during my lifetime.\u201d\n\nNo living Democrat holds more sway than Obama, who signed the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial restructuring bill and economic stimulus legislation that all passed through Pelosi\u2019s House in 2009 and 2010.\n\nObama prefaced his remarks, made in Chicago during the public taping of a podcast hosted by his former political adviser David Axelrod, by saying he was \u201cnot going to wade into House Democratic caucus politics.\u201d But he then proceeded to deliver what amounted to an unqualified endorsement.\n\nWith Fudge opting not to run for speaker, the cadre of Pelosi opponents will be forced to find another standard-bearer to try to depose the longtime Democratic leader. Sixteen Democrats signed a letter Monday vowing to oppose Pelosi in a party-nominating contest next week as well as during the floor vote, while four more Democrats who did not sign the letter said they remained opposed to her.\n\nTogether, those members could block Pelosi from taking the speaker\u2019s gavel if they maintain their opposition. But Pelosi is working to convince and cajole members, with help from her allies in the House and other key Democratic players.\n\nSpokesmen for two of Pelosi\u2019s leading critics, Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), declined to comment Tuesday and instead pointed to recent op-eds calling for new leadership.\n\nPelosi\u2019s detractors have pounced on several fronts, noting that her continued presence atop the Democratic hierarchy has impeded younger leaders and that she remains a political liability for her party\u2019s candidates in Republican-leaning districts.\n\nBut they have struggled to escape the perception that they represent a group of Democrats who are whiter, more male and more moderate than the party caucus as a whole. Losing Fudge, their only prominent African American supporter, is a further blow.\n\nThey have also struggled to attract support from young incoming members associated with the party\u2019s left flank \u2014 such as Reps.-elect Jahana Hayes (Conn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) \u2014 who made calls for new leadership during their campaign but have kept their distance from Pelosi\u2019s vocal opposition.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC on Monday night, Ocasio-Cortez said the rebel group was \u201cnot necessarily reflective of the diversity of the party\u201d and questioned why they were determined to oust Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI do think that we got sent to Congress on a mandate to change how government works, to change what government even looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we are not on the same page about changing the systems and the values and how we\u2019re going to adapt as a party for the future, then what is the point of just changing our party leadership just for the sake of it?\u201d\n\nPelosi continued to rack up support Tuesday, winning the votes of two incoming freshmen \u2014 Reps.-elect Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Harley Rouda (Calif.) \u2014 and endorsements from the Sierra Club and the Alliance for Retired Americans.\n\n\u201cDivisions within our own party and public disputes over leadership will only hurt our efforts to get our country and our government back on the right course,\u201d said Omar, who has allied herself with the other young liberals.\n\nDemocrats have won 233 seats to Republicans\u2019 199 after Ben McAdams ousted GOP Rep. Mia Love in Utah. Three races remain unresolved, with a Democrat leading in one. Some Republicans also believe that Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), who was declared the winner on election night, could ultimately lose his race to Democrat T.J. Cox after the final ballots are counted in the coming days.\n\nFudge\u2019s decision to withdraw her potential challenge came the same day she faced serious questions about a letter of support she wrote in 2015 for a former judge and state senator who is now accused of killing his ex-wife.\n\nFudge wrote the letter to a prosecutor as Lance Mason prepared to plead guilty to beating his then-wife, Aisha Fraser, so severely in 2014 that she required reconstructive plastic surgery. Mason, Fudge wrote, was \u201ca good man who made a very bad mistake.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Fraser was found fatally stabbed, according to news reports. Mason, who served a nine-month sentence for the earlier assault, was taken into custody and is expected to be charged in her killing.\n\n[A former judge brutally assaulted his wife in 2014. Now she\u2019s dead, and he\u2019s been arrested.]\n\nIn a statement released by her office Tuesday, Fudge said that her \u201cheart breaks\u201d for Fraser and her family.\n\n\u201cMy support of Lance in 2015 was based on the person I knew for almost 30 years \u2014 an accomplished lawyer, prosecutor, state legislator and judge. That\u2019s the Lance Mason I supported,\u201d she said. \u201cThe person who committed these crimes is not the Lance Mason familiar to me. They were horrific crimes, and I condemn them. I and everyone who knew Aisha are mourning her loss.\u201d\n\nIn the 2015 letter, obtained by a reporter for WOIO-TV in Cleveland, Fudge said Mason\u2019s assault on Fraser was \u201cout of character and totally contrary to everything I know about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLance accepts full responsibility for his actions and has assured me that something like this will never happen again,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Amnesty says Saudi activists beaten, tortured in detention", "description": "Amnesty International says several activists imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, including a number of women, have been beaten and tortured during interrogation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/amnesty-says-saudi-activists-beaten-tortured-in-detention/2018/11/20/71e8cd18-eced-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:55:20Z", "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Amnesty International says several activists imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, including a number of women, have been beaten and tortured during interrogation.

(Lefteris Pitarakis, File/Associated Press)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Several activists imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since May, including a number of women who campaigned for the right to drive, have been beaten and tortured during interrogation, Amnesty International said Tuesday.\n\nSaudi Arabia has detained at least 10 women and seven men on vague national security allegations related to their human rights work. Those detained include Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, who had campaigned for the right to drive before the decades-long ban was lifted in June.\n\nAmnesty said that according to three testimonies it obtained, some of the activists were repeatedly tortured by electrocution and flogging, leaving some unable to walk or stand properly. In one instance, an activist was hung from the ceiling. Another testimony said one of the detained women was subjected to sexual harassment by interrogators wearing face masks.\n\nThe kingdom is at the center of an international firestorm after the brutal killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had written critically about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s crackdown on dissent, including the arrests of the women activists. Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered by Saudi agents in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\n\u201cOnly a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East research director.\n\nSome of the imprisoned activists were unable to walk or stand properly, had uncontrolled shaking of the hands and marks on their bodies. One of the activists reportedly attempted to take her own life repeatedly inside the prison, Amnesty said.\n\nAl-Hathloul, an activist in her late 20s, was held in solitary confinement for around three months after her May arrest, a person close to her told The Associated Press.\n\nShe was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia earlier this year from the United Arab Emirates, where she was pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Abu Dhabi. Her husband was pressured into divorcing her after he too was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia from Jordan, where he was working, according to the individual, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.\n\nSome of the men detained in that sweep include Mohammad al-Rabae, a writer and activist, and Ibrahim al-Modeimigh, a human rights lawyer who defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in 2014 and held for more than 70 days for attempting to drive from the UAE to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlso imprisoned is Samar Badawi, whose brother Raif Badawi is serving 10 years in prison and was publicly flogged in 2015 on charges related to blog posts that were critical of the kingdom\u2019s ultraconservative clerics. Others detained include Nassima al-Sada, a rights activist from the Eastern Province, and Hatoon al-Fassi, an esteemed professor of Gulf history who was recently announced as the recipient of the Academic Freedom Award by the Arizona-based Middle East Studies Association.\n\nNearly all the women detained are mothers or grandmothers and well-known in their fields of work. A few of those initially detained were in their 70s and have since been released.\n\nSome of the women detained were at the forefront of calls to lift guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\nDana Ahmed, a researcher at Amnesty, told the AP that Saudi authorities have yet to charge any of them. She said the crackdown that began in May targeted human rights defenders, including many who had been silent for years and had previously been persecuted for their human rights work.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Reilly and Sarah Silverman, center) venture to the Internet in search of a replacement part for her game, Sugar Rush. (Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)\n\nExpress Senior Arts Writer\n\nRating:\n\nSix years ago, the animated feature \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d gave us a little girl with a talent for racing cars and a giant man with a gift for smashing buildings. They met and formed a relationship built on mutual respect, admiration and a fondness for fart jokes. As the sequel \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d begins, not much has changed in this relationship. And therein lies the problem \u2014 at least for one of them.\n\nThe video game characters Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) spend their days doing their jobs at Litwak\u2019s Arcade and their evenings hanging out at the bar from the game Root Beer Tapper or racing motorcycles in Tron. Ralph is perfectly happy with this arrangement; Vanellope is restless. Her game, a candy-saturated racing game titled Sugar Rush, has become a predictable slog. When Ralph attempts to spice things up, the game\u2019s controller \u2014 a steering wheel \u2014 gets broken and the game is unplugged. That means that all of the sugar-based characters have to flee, like so many Red Dye 40-coated refugees. There\u2019s only one replacement wheel left, and it\u2019s on eBay. So Ralph and Vanellope use the arcade\u2019s newly installed WiFi network to travel into the Internet to win the online auction.\n\nLike in \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d illustrates just how far computer animation can advance between one movie and its sequel. (Admittedly, \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d had 14 years to improve its game). Now, you can make out the individual threads hanging from Ralph\u2019s shirt sleeves and the fuzziness of Vanellope\u2019s sweater. But it\u2019s not just on the micro level that the images pack a punch. The \u201cMetropolis\u201d-style world of the Internet \u2014 which features mostly real-life companies, including Snapchat, Google and Pinterest \u2014 is a swirling, infinite city that combines a technological sheen with a frenetic pace. It also appears that Ralph and Vanellope have entered a version of the Internet where the parental filters are firmly on, as the more-adult elements of the Web are nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d video-game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly, center) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman, right) venture into the expansive world of the Internet, where they meet eBay Elayne (Rebecca Wisocky, left). (Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)\n\nCo-directed by Phil Johnson and Rich Moore, \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d looks great. But it\u2019s the script (co-written by Johnston and Pamela Ribon) that gives it its heart. Like many buddy movie series, the first \u201cRalph\u201d was about getting the gang together; the second is about what happens when the buddies break apart. Vanellope finds what feels like a home in a gritty racing game presided over by a lanky driver named Shank (Gal Gadot, in the movie\u2019s one voice performance that falls flat). Staying there, however, would mean leaving Ralph behind. Watching her try to balance her own happiness with that of her friend\u2019s feels like a very heartfelt, very real dilemma, thanks to Silverman\u2019s performance, which has only gotten more powerful since the first film. Ralph may get top billing here, but this new story belongs to Vanellope.\n\nThe movie is saturated with nods to current Internet culture: Cat videos are there as well as unboxing videos, videos of people falling down and the relentless presence of the game Fortnite and its dances. It also includes a few gags at the expense of the real world, including an effective jab at Disney, the studio behind the film. (Here, the Disney section of the Internet is a chaotic mess of characters from its various properties, including the Marvel and Star Wars universes.)\n\nRalph and Vanellope\u2019s growth in the first film was what brought them together. Here, it\u2019s what might force them apart. In \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d they\u2019re attempting to hold on to one another while also trying to let go, and the film treats that struggle with sensitivity and care (along with some flatulence jokes). Both characters are so fully realized that, even in these often silly surroundings, the audience can feel what\u2019s at stake. For Ralph and Vanellope, friendship is anything but a game."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jason Samenow", "title": "Northeast U.S. faces most abnormally cold weather on the planet on Thanksgiving", "description": "Temperatures are set to plunge to the lowest levels seen on the holiday in over a century.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/20/northeast-us-faces-most-abnormally-cold-weather-planet-thanksgiving/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rNVmAY1HvQ2VcKDEoO2QcxadMTo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMRNYDCTP5BLVPJEBZNSIDNPA4.PNG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:47:23Z", "content": "Temperatures in the Northeast U.S. will drop to record lows on Thanksgiving as a punishing blast of Arctic air plunges south from Canada.

The politics of presidential nominations have changed dramatically, driven by the success of the last two presidents: Barack Obama proved that if you\u2019re compelling and charismatic enough you don\u2019t need to have a long tenure in office, and Donald Trump proved that pretty much anybody can get a party nomination given the right set of circumstances.\n\nThat has led dozens of Democrats to ask themselves, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d The latest potential candidate is Tom Steyer, who has made himself into the most important Democratic donor despite the fact that few Americans who aren\u2019t political junkies have ever heard of him:\n\nTom Steyer, the California billionaire best known for his campaign to impeach President Trump, is making a move toward a potential 2020 White House bid, launching town halls in key primary states on the platform of \u201cfive rights.\u201d Steyer announced the move Tuesday on his website and with a full-page ad in newspapers across the country. His \u201cfive rights\u201d focus on education, the environment, voting rights, the economy, and health care. \u2026 Tuesday\u2019s launch also includes a six-figure Web ad buy on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, Cavalier said.\n\nThe fundamental question the Democratic Party is going to be asking itself in 2020 is, \u201cWho are we?\u201d Or more specifically, \u201cWhich candidate best expresses who we are?\u201d This question lies underneath every presidential nominating campaign, but in some campaigns it\u2019s more important than in others. It was a key question in 2008, and Obama won because he was the answer to that question, or at least an aspirational version of that question. Democrats saw in Obama not only who they were but also who they wanted to be: sophisticated, urbane, intellectual, cosmopolitan, thoughtful, multiracial and charismatic. For once, they stopped asking themselves who was \u201celectable\u201d \u2014 i.e., which candidate would be attractive to other people \u2014 and asked which candidate they were most drawn to. It worked out pretty well.\n\nCould Steyer be that person in 2020? I\u2019ll admit that I start with a bias against billionaires who think they should be president. The super-rich tend to live in a bubble in which everyone is constantly telling them how brilliant they are, which helps to convince them that because they succeeded in one area they can succeed in any area. In case it wasn\u2019t clear before, Trump has shown that being president is extremely complicated and requires a range of skills and experience that you generally don\u2019t have if you haven\u2019t spent time in elected office.\n\nHaving said that, Steyer has shown a seriousness about his political project that most donors lack. He spent more than any other donor in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 election cycles \u2014 more than $226 million. But instead of just throwing money at a bunch of political consultants who waste it on pricey TV ads, he spent those years building a political machine. His two organizations, Need to Impeach and Next Gen America, are vehicles for engaging liberals, and just as important, assembling lists.\n\nWhatever you think about the impeachment question, they claim that 6.3 million people have signed on, which is a pretty healthy group of supporters to start with. Put together, the organizations have hundreds of staffers, have worked on the ground in states all over the country doing voter registration and advocacy, and have built partnerships with a host of other liberal groups.\n\nIn other words, Steyer isn\u2019t messing around. But we have no idea how he would perform as a candidate if he chose to give it a shot.\n\nA presidential candidacy is many things. It\u2019s a management challenge, building an organization that has to go from zero to light speed faster than any corporation ever has to. One day you can have a dozen staffers in a couple of ratty offices in Iowa, and a month later the enterprise has grown to hundreds of employees spread across a dozen states trying to coordinate their activities in an environment that changes every day. It\u2019s a strategic challenge, requiring one to devise a path through a complex electoral process and a message that will persuade voters. It\u2019s a personal challenge, testing the candidate\u2019s stamina, his ability to persuade and his capacity to weather the inevitable crises.\n\nAnd particularly when your party\u2019s voters are enraged by the current president and eager for a true champion \u2014 as Democrats were in 2008, as Republicans were in 2016 and as Democrats will be again in 2020 \u2014 it\u2019s an emotional challenge. The winner will have to connect with voters on a level that reaches down where their identities lie, to tap into their hopes, their fears, their desires and to embody everything they want their party to be.\n\nNone of us have any idea whether Tom Steyer can do that, any more than we know whether Elizabeth Warren can, or Kamala Harris can, or Cory Booker can, or Kirsten Gillibrand can, or any of the other 50 or 60 Democrats considering a run can. I do think that any white man is going to have an extra hurdle to overcome in saying \u201cI will be the embodiment of this party\u201d when the party is not only more diverse than ever but also sees that as its greatest strength in the future. But it\u2019s going to be a fascinating contest.\n\nRead more:\n\nKatrina vanden Heuvel: How Democrats can turn up the heat on Trump \u2014 and win the battle of ideas\n\nJohn Emshwiller: I thought Democrats would appreciate my first-ever donation.

(Yana Paskova)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Mark Spiegel begins some mornings contemplating Tesla\u2019s fate from the bathroom of his high-rise apartment, where two computer screens are perched near the bathtub for instant updates on his Twitter feed and stock prices.\n\nThe hedge fund manager spends much of his day at his dining room table, where he fires off tweets explaining his high-stakes bet that Tesla, a darling of Silicon Valley and a $60 billion behemoth, will eventually fail, sending its stock price tumbling.\n\nSo far, the bet has been mostly a loser, but Spiegel isn\u2019t ready to relent. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to kill me in the short term,\u201d he says as his eyes toggle between computer screens and a Pomeranian pleading for attention around his ankles.\n\nSpiegel\u2019s small hedge fund, Stanphyl Capital, is part of one of Wall Street\u2019s most aggressive bets against a single company in history. The $10 billion wager has set up a marathon battle between one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most outspoken leaders, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, and some of Wall Street\u2019s most notorious doomsayers.\n\nIt comes as many short sellers are struggling. The number of hedge funds focused on betting against companies has fallen by more than half as U.S. markets started a record upswing nearly a decade ago. Since 2013, short-seller campaigns against a company\u2019s stock have lost an average of about 0.5 percent, according to Activist Insight Shorts, a data provider.\n\nFor those betting against Tesla, the fight has been particularly tough. Musk wields his 23 million Twitter followers against his critics with rapid-fire tweets and commands a loyal group of believers that can frustrate his critics.\n\n\u201cThese people are much more concerned about profits than what\u2019s best for our children,\u201d Ross Gerber, a Los Angeles investor who backs Tesla, said of short sellers. \u201cMorally speaking, you can short Snapchat all you want. Go short Facebook. Tesla\u2019s whole purpose is to create an electric infrastructure so we can address the issue of climate change.\u201d\n\n[Tesla posts a profit after what Musk calls a \u2018historic quarter\u2019]\n\nThe fight has already claimed one casualty. Infamous short seller Andrew Left, who has been a vocal critic of Musk and Tesla for years, relented last month and switched from attacking the company to praising it. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the brain damage. Nobody can change the narrative on this thing,\u201d he said in an interview before announcing his decision.\n\nBut Spiegel, 57, and many others are still not ready to back down. \u201cI am very patient,\u201d he said.\n\nShort sellers are not new to criticism. They operate by borrowing shares in a company and then selling them in the hope of buying the same number of shares later at a lower price. If the stock\u2019s price falls, they make money by pocketing the difference; if it rises, they lose.\n\nBut this wager on gloom has often unnerved chief executives who view their stock price as a daily report card and are fearful that short sellers are manipulating the market for profit. The growing use of computer algorithms that scan Twitter and other social media sites to make trading decisions is exacerbating the problem, some critics say. If short sellers spread false or negative information about them online, it can unfairly shift the momentum of their stock, they say.\n\nNasdaq has called for new rules requiring short sellers to disclose more information about the positions they hold against companies to even the playing field. \u201cInvestors with short positions can pursue strategies designed to invisibly drive down share prices \u2026 intending to profit from the uncertainty created,\u201d Nasdaq said in a package of proposals to revitalize the capital markets.\n\nPressure on short investors is also building abroad. Earlier this year, securities regulators in Canada sought an emergency order to stop longtime short seller Marc Cohodes, known as the \u201cscourge of Wall Street,\u201d from trading and allegedly providing misleading information about a Calgary-based company. In June, Cohodes accused the firm of illegally dumping toxic substances. Cohodes made \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d that he knew would affect the company\u2019s stock price, the Alberta Securities Commission argued.\n\n\u201cThey tried to shut me up,\u201d said Cohodes of the regulator\u2019s petition, which was ultimately denied. \u201cI would argue that shorts make the world a better place. Most people like to talk about things going up. But there are people who cheat. And that is the role of the shorts.\u201d\n\nShort sellers worry that they are being unfairly hammered and that efforts to push new regulations could hand the companies they target an unfair advantage. Their critics are ignoring the good they do, including identifying potentially fraudulent companies such as Enron, which they say helps mom and pop investors.\n\nFahmi Quadir, founder and chief investment officer at Safkhet Capital, has been heralded as one of the first short sellers to target Valeant Pharmaceuticals. After reaching more than $250 a share, the company\u2019s stock price tumbled amid accusations of a massive fraud.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, it\u2019s much harder now,\u201d Quadir said. \u201cInvestors care less about the overall fundamentals even if these companies are engaged in potentially fraudulent activities.\u201d\n\nQuadir said that she disclosed her bet against Tesla to show solidarity with other short investors. \u201cI need to support the value short sellers play in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cShort sellers are like our first line of defense. They will be asking the questions that others won\u2019t be to get to the truth.\u201d\n\nMusk has not always hated them. In a January 2012 tweet, the billionaire said that while \u201cthey cause me grief, I would defend the rights of shorts to exist.\u201d\n\nBut his grudging support has since turned to apparent disdain. \u201cThe last several years have taught me that they [short sellers] are reasonably maligned,\u201d he said in an October tweet. \u201cWhat they do should be illegal.\u201d His office did not return calls asking for an explanation of Musk\u2019s change of heart.\n\nMusk has even turned against BlackRock, the global investment firm with more than $6 trillion in assets, which acts as an intermediary for short sellers borrowing stocks. \u201cIndex managers like BlackRock pocket \u2026 excessive profit from short lending,\u201d he said in October. BlackRock says it is helping investors.\n\nMusk has attracted some formidable opponents, including Jim Chanos, who bet against energy giant Enron before its collapse, and Steve Eisman, who made millions betting against the housing market before the global financial crisis. Both have said they are shorting Tesla\u2019s stock.\n\nTheir arguments against Tesla range from competitive \u2014 that it will eventually be eclipsed by more-experienced carmakers \u2014 to allegations that the company is exaggerating its production figures. Some are skeptical that the company will be able to pay off or refinance more than $1 billion in bond payments coming due over the next year.\n\n[Tesla names a new chair to replace Elon Musk]\n\nHedge fund manager David Einhorn recently compared Tesla to Lehman Brothers, which his firm, Greenlight Capital, bet against before its 2008 collapse. \u201cLike Lehman, we think the deception is about to catch up to TSLA,\u201d Greenlight said in a quarterly investor letter. \u201cElon Musk\u2019s erratic behavior suggests that he sees it the same way.\u201d\n\nThe battle reached a peak in August when Musk tweeted that he had funding \u201csecured\u201d to take Tesla private, sending the company\u2019s stock price soaring. Two weeks later, Musk backed away from the plan and in October reached a $20 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that he had lied to investors about the probability of such a deal. (A week later, Musk taunted the agency as the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\")\n\nShort sellers saw Musk\u2019s tweet about taking Tesla private as a maneuver aimed at harming them, noting that the chief executive had warned online that they should prepare for a big burn. The company\u2019s stock price would eventually fall again, but not before they had been forced to cover steep losses. Left, the short seller, sued, claiming Musk had \u201cartificially manipulated\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock price with the tweet in order to \u201cburn\u201d short sellers.\"\n\nSpiegel, meanwhile, is still convinced that Tesla will eventually run out of steam. His $8 million, seven-year-old hedge fund is down about 15 percent so far this year, mostly because of the bet against Tesla. The fund has other investments that have worked out better, including positive bets on a telecommunications company and in the agriculture sector. A wager that U.S. stocks will drop overall has also recently been profitable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually making really good money today because the market is tanking and we\u2019re in that short,\u201d he said a day in October when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 fell nearly 2 percent.\n\nBut whenever Tesla\u2019s stock price moves too high, as it did after Musk\u2019s tweet about taking the company private, Spiegel must adjust. \u201cYou wind up essentially getting whipsawed many times,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have realized a lot of losses there.\u201d\n\nHe spends hours every day retweeting Tesla\u2019s skeptics and critics. On Election Day, he retweeted a picture of Musk with an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker altered to say \u201cI\u2019m a fraud.\u201d When Tesla recently reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, he remained skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s all downhill from here,\u201d Spiegel said.\n\nIt may take longer before he is proved right, Spiegel says. But in the meantime, he remains hopeful for the worse. \u201cPart of my job is to make sure it doesn\u2019t crush me before it collapses,\u201d he says."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The four key questions that could decide the College Football Playoff field - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post The four key questions that could decide the College Football Playoff field Washington Post And then there were four... uncertainties.

(Rick Osentoski/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAnd then there were four ... uncertainties. We\u2019re down to seven teams with a serious chance at making one of the playoff berths that will be slotted in two weeks. Who makes it depends on just a handful of games. Lots of things can happen, even with two weeks left, but we boil it down to four key questions.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a look at our latest projections for what we expect to see when the playoff committee unveils its latest rankings Tuesday night:\n\nWill Alabama beat Georgia? (73 percent likely)\n\nThe SEC title rematch, which would be played Dec. 1, is something we\u2019ve anticipated since August to be the single biggest event to scramble the 2018 playoff. As dominant as Alabama has looked, they\u2019ve not faced anything close to the Bulldogs (we\u2019d make Georgia at least a 10-point favorite over LSU). Georgia has a comparable defense to LSU but an offense much closer to Alabama\u2019s.\n\n[Arkansas players suspended after reportedly flirting with opposing cheerleaders]\n\nA Georgia win would clearly propel them into the playoff. In fact our committee model shows a one-loss Georgia passing all but undefeated Clemson. What about a one-loss Alabama? As long as they win the SEC title game, we don\u2019t think an Auburn loss would hurt them much. But losing to Georgia would force the committee to choose between them, potential Big Ten champion Michigan and potentially undefeated Notre Dame. It would be an epic controversy, and the committee is a messy, human process. In that situation our model of the committee has the Tide on the outside looking in, if only slightly.\n\nWill Michigan beat Ohio State? (58 percent)\n\nMichigan faces the toughest remaining task of the top four teams. They are favorites to beat Ohio State this weekend for the first time since 2011, and the first time on the road since 2000. Given how dreadful Ohio State has looked since September, the modest 4-point betting line might be a surprise. But we still make the Buckeyes No. 6 in the country, with an offense good enough to keep them in almost any game. The question is whether they can do it against a top-3 defense.\n\n[Les Miles resumes his career at Kansas]\n\nThe winner of this game has a second hurdle in the Big Ten title game. Given that they will play No. 50 (!) Northwestern, a team we still refuse to buy into, the East winner is 90 percent likely to take the title. Would winning out get Ohio State into the playoff? We don\u2019t see them getting past Alabama or Clemson, even if those teams dropped a game. And clearly they wouldn\u2019t get past an undefeated Notre Dame. A one-loss Oklahoma, finishing with wins against West Virginia and Texas, would be very close. Again, it\u2019s a noisy process, but our model of the committee gives the Sooners a slight edge. If so, Ohio State needs to win out and hope either Notre Dame or Oklahoma loses. If Georgia manages to upend Alabama, grabbing one of the four spots for themselves, the Buckeyes would need both the Irish and the Sooners to lose.\n\nWill Notre Dame beat USC? (75 percent)\n\nNotre Dame finally looked like a legitimate Top-10 team this week. Their 36-3 shellacking of a decent Syracuse team was the third-best performance of the weekend and harked back to the form the Irish showed in Weeks 4 and 5 against Wake Forest and Stanford. Granted, none of these opponents are world beaters, but you like to see your playoff teams do what they\u2019re supposed to against lesser competition. Maybe Yankee Stadium\u2019s not a bad place to go if you\u2019re looking to recapture a playoff vibe.\n\nThe Irish can clinch a playoff spot in another famous stadium on the other coast this weekend. USC\u2019s disappointing season reached a new low with their loss last weekend to a two-win UCLA team. How will the Trojans respond in what is likely Clay Helton\u2019s last game? Everything about this game seems inevitable. Just a friendly reminder: 75 percent is not inevitable.\n\nWill Oklahoma win out? (49 percent)\n\nAt this point the last team out of the playoff conversation, other than Georgia, is Oklahoma. Despite that proximity we give the Sooners just a 24-percent chance of making the playoff. Not only is their fate in others\u2019 hands, they have, at best, two of their season\u2019s toughest matchups in the next two weeks. They travel to Morgantown Friday to play one of the few teams that can (almost) match them blow-for-blow offensively. The Mountaineers bring the country\u2019s No. 6 offense to the regular season finale, some distance from OU\u2019s No. 1 but, given the Sooners\u2019 No. 67 defense, dangerous enough.\n\nIf Oklahoma survives West Virginia this weekend it would meet in the Big 12 title game either Texas, a team that has already shown it can beat the Sooners this year, or West Virginia for the second time in two weeks. We would give OU about a 75-percent chance to best the Longhorns at Jerry\u2019s World, and a bit less against the Mountaineers. Given our understanding of the committee, this is all for naught (other than conference bragging rights and a New Year\u2019s Six bowl) unless Michigan or Notre Dame trips up.\n\nNow, here\u2019s a look at some other scenarios as we\u2019ve projected them out:\n\nYes, if things break just so a Washington State (1 percent) or even LSU (< 1 percent) could find themselves in the top-four. While fun to unpack we don\u2019t recommend investing too much, intellectually or emotionally, in those possibilities. Similarly, Clemson must win at least one more game, but that\u2019s a rare certainty in college football.\n\nIt\u2019s been a chalky football season. If all continues to form, we\u2019re looking at a Alabama-Clemson-Notre Dame-Michigan playoff bracket in the least eventful second-half of a college football season in the playoff era. We\u2019re contrarians here, putting only 30 percent odds on that happening. These four big uncertainties still have to be navigated and, eventually, probabilities are going to do probability things.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s how we see things going down this weekend:\n\n\n\nMassey Peabody\n\nRead more on college football:\n\nThe Flacco brothers have a lot in common. Could jobs as NFL quarterbacks be next?\n\nWashington State win a prolific precursor to college football\u2019s jampacked week ahead\n\nMonths after cancer diagnosis, Kentucky football player makes first start of the season\n\nCade Massey (a Wharton professor) and Rufus Peabody (a professional sports bettor) are co-founders of Massey-Peabody Analytics, which produces proprietary quantitative college football ratings.

Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speaker in the face of protests and complaints that his effort smacks of ageism and sexism.\n\nMoulton, one of the leaders of the opposition to Pelosi, encountered a standing-room-only crowd of about 175 on Monday night at a town hall, where he asserted that the Democratic Party needs new leadership.\n\nAmong those in the crowd chastising Moulton was Lynda Christian, 80, of Burlington, Mass.\n\n\u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m targeted. I\u2019m old and I\u2019m a woman,\u201d said Christian, who added that she lobbied for abortion rights during the 1970s. \u201cNancy Pelosi, I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s done a fantastic job. Who fires somebody who does something well?\u201d\n\nPelosi, 78, raised millions of dollars and campaigned for Democrats, who delivered on her guarantee that the party would win the House in the midterm elections. Democrats gained 37 seats and could add to their majority with four races still unresolved.\n\n[Fight for House speaker explodes into national political campaign]\n\nPelosi, the first female speaker, has said her experience and skills make her eminently qualified to reclaim the gavel when the full House votes Jan. 3. But she faces opposition from Moulton and more than a dozen other Democrats, who pose a significant threat to her bid.\n\nBefore Moulton\u2019s town hall, 20 protesters gathered in the hallway. The women, mostly over retirement age, held signs that read, \u201cI Stand with Nancy,\u201d and encouraged anyone entering the event to sign a clipboard to show their support for the House minority leader.\n\nAt one point, Moulton compared the effort to challenge Pelosi to the ouster of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, according to a video posted on Twitter by an attendee.\n\n\u201c[Thatcher] went to the floor, and she twisted arms, and she didn\u2019t have the votes,\u201d Moulton said of the woman dubbed the \u201cIron Lady.\u201d \u201cAnd then they elected a new prime minister. And everything went on, and people were excited about the new prime minister. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Moulton told the crowd that if House Democrats react to their victory in this month\u2019s midterm elections \u201cby reinstalling the same status quo leadership team that we\u2019ve had in place since 2006, then we\u2019re failing the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a new Democratic energy in this country that is so exciting and so important. And my job is to try to bring some of that to Washington for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington isn\u2019t working, and we need a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\n[Democratic Rep. Moulton draws fire for campaign to deny Pelosi speaker\u2019s job]\n\nMoulton has taken heat in recent days for leading the challenge to Pelosi, with some liberal activists openly floating a primary challenge to the two-term congressman.\n\nAt the town hall, Pelosi\u2019s age was very much an issue for some. Mark Wojcik of Amesbury, a 56-year-old IT professional, leaned against a table at the perimeter of the room wearing a Harley Davidson hat.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s too old and too connected to Wall Street and all the big money,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see someone younger.\u201d\n\nFrank Czar, 50, of Amesbury, is a self-employed business owner who said he respects Pelosi\u2019s leadership but spoke of the need for a change.\n\n\u201cI would like her to take on the role of the elder statesperson. I would like to see her groom new people, younger people, but I would like to see a younger face, a more dynamic face,\u201d he said.\n\n[Sixteen dissident Democrats vow to oppose Pelosi as next speaker]\n\nOthers saw the opposition to Pelosi as a gender issue.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a sexist ploy,\u201d said Sharon Jordan, 65, of Lunenburg, Mass. \u201cI have a lot of confidence that Pelosi has made commitments to progressives who are coming in who we really need to help them grow into leadership positions. That\u2019s what I want to have happen.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, some Pelosi supporters have contended that it\u2019s in the party\u2019s best interest to avoid a drawn-out fight over the speakership. Some attendees at Monday\u2019s town hall agreed.\n\nMaria Flint, a 40-year-old adjunct professor at North Shore Community College in Danvers, drove to the meeting with her 3-year-old daughter. \u201cIt seems like a poor time to be bringing this for a fight,\u201d Flint said, balancing her daughter on her knee. \u201cIt seems to me that it is best to present a united front.\u201d\n\nChaffee Monell, a 75-year-old retired early childhood educator from Amesbury, voiced confidence in Pelosi\u2019s leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of whether you\u2019re old or young. It\u2019s how effective you can mobilize that body of legislators, and are you good at it?\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly let\u2019s not have things like we need new blood or something like that, something vague. If this is a criticism of her, it needs to be specific.\u201d\n\n[How the opposition to Pelosi as speaker compares to the rest of the Democratic caucus]\n\nOthers were exasperated with the fact that Moulton has not identified a new leader to replace Pelosi. Linda Vieira, a 65-year-old piano teacher from Acton, drove 60 miles to attend the town hall. Vieira sees Pelosi as \u201ca skilled statesperson. She\u2019s done this before.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be against somebody if you don\u2019t have anybody to replace her,\u201d she added.\n\nSome of the attendees were undecided. Katelyn Brannelly, 17, a student at Amesbury High School, knocked on more than 600 doors for Moulton\u2019s campaign. She wondered whether Pelosi could adequately understand the fears of students her age in an era in which school shootings are the new normal.\n\n\u201cI go to school every day and I fear that today might be the day. I need someone in Congress that\u2019s going to understand what that is like,\u201d Brannelly said.\n\n\u201cI want you, first of all, to look at Congress and feel like you\u2019re represented as well, that you have a voice, that you have people who get your concerns,\u201d Moulton told the attendees. He argued that another representative would do this better than Pelosi.\n\nSonmez reported from Washington."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "The unraveling is just beginning", "description": "President Trump is likely to react more irrationally and unpredictably as the crises pile up.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/20/the-unraveling-is-just-beginning/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WMSIXshCbWDLJB4t-iAXOQooopY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YSJVVLBR3M3YZDXOQP6BI3MKVU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:00:26Z", "content": "Post-midterm election, President Trumps tenure seems rockier than ever.

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPost-midterm election, President Trump\u2019s tenure seems rockier than ever. Consider:\n\nHis much-criticized deployment of troops to handle the nonexistent border crisis proved to be as unnecessary and politically motivated as critics claimed. With the election behind him, Trump is now drawing down the troops.\n\nHis relationship with the military hasn\u2019t been helped by his conduct in France, or his weird decision to pick a fight with a national hero \u2014 retired Adm. William H. McRaven.\n\nHis defense of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been roundly criticized, and will be challenged by a bipartisan coalition in Congress.\n\nHis attack on the press was thwarted by CNN and other media companies; the White House retreated and reissued Jim Acosta\u2019s permanent press pass.\n\nIvanka Trump seems to have her own email scandal. The Post reports: \u201cIvanka Trump sent hundreds of emails last year to White House aides, Cabinet officials and her assistants using a personal account, many of them in violation of federal records rules, according to people familiar with a White House examination of her correspondence. . . .The discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s practices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton, an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker has drawn bipartisan criticism and a lawsuit.\n\nAll this occurs before the Democrats take control of the House and before they can start issuing subpoenas or holding hearings. When that happens, things will get really dicey for Trump as his personal finances come under scrutiny.\n\nAll of this should surprise no one. A president entirely unfit for his office (temperamentally, intellectually, and in every other imaginable way) \u2014 who has cycled through advisers and banished independent voices \u2014 gets worse with time. The facade of functionality at the White House started crumbling some time ago: Mistakes and bad hires (including his daughter and son-in-law) have caught up with him over time; the quality of each new addition to the administration is nearly certain to be worse than the person being replaced, while qualified and ethical public servants want no part of this train wreck.\n\nMoreover, we\u2019ve yet to see the results of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, which very likely will lay out the elements of an obstruction of justice charge. James A. Baker, a former general counsel of the FBI, and Lawfare author Sarah Grant take us through the recently released Watergate roadmap, with obvious parallels to the current administration:\n\nAs a result, the road map\u2019s references to President [Richard M.] Nixon\u2019s interactions with [then assistant attorney general Henry E.] Petersen \u2014 the person who was heading the investigation \u2014 take on a different and more nefarious meaning. Those interactions must be understood within the larger context of the president\u2019s knowledge of the facts regarding Watergate at the time that he was in contact with Petersen. In other words, when the president sought information from Petersen, provided his views to Petersen on the various matters that they discussed, and discussed Petersen\u2019s future, he was not merely exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution to supervise the executive branch and trying to get the facts necessary to do so; the president of the United States was also acting as a criminal co-conspirator trying to obstruct lawful investigative activities of the Justice Department.\n\nNixon was forced to leave office to escape impeachment, and was later pardoned. But the episode now serves as a roadmap to legal and political disaster for Trump.\n\nIn sum, Trump\u2019s presidency is in a downward spiral. He is likely to react more irrationally and unpredictably as the crises pile up. In other words, the first two years likely will be looked upon as the glory days of the Trump presidency.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nDriving toward 2020, a pile-up in the left lane\n\nThe Republican Party isn\u2019t \u2018grand,\u2019 and its old ideas are making it irrelevant\n\nA critical lawsuit over the acting attorney general\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t want to be called racists \u2026\n\nStacey Abrams has it right about election rhetoric"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Poland latest country to withdraw from global migration pact", "description": "The Polish government says that it will not support a global compact seeking international cooperation on migration, citing national sovereignty as it joins countries including Hungary, Austria and the United States in rejecting it", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/poland-latest-country-to-withdraw-from-global-migration-pact/2018/11/20/74d3fcda-ece5-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:58:09Z", "content": "WARSAW, Poland The Polish government said Tuesday that it will not support a global compact seeking international cooperation on migration, citing national sovereignty as it joins countries including Hungary, Austria and the United States in rejecting it.

Now we find out that not only did Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, do it, but so did his daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey broke that story Monday night. Those speaking for Ivanka Trump insist that she didn\u2019t transmit any classified information and simply wasn\u2019t properly told to avoid any use of private email for government business.\n\nBut that\u2019s also kind of the point: If this was such an enormous betrayal of the public trust for Clinton, how was it not a massive point of emphasis for the Trump White House? And what\u2019s more, how on Earth did Ivanka Trump not realize how problematic this would be after what happened in 2016?\n\nThe situations aren\u2019t exactly apples to apples. Clinton was routinely dealing with sensitive information as secretary of state and actually set up a private server; Ivanka Trump\u2019s use seemed to involve transmitting her personal schedule and smaller-scale things.\n\nBut the whole episode adds to a laundry list of things the Trump White House has done that look a whole lot like the things it excoriated its predecessor (Barack Obama) and its 2016 opponent (Clinton) for.\n\nHere are the big ones.\n\nEmails and information security\n\nWhat President Trump said: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of state, hide and delete her emails ... \u201d\n\n\"We can\u2019t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\u201d\n\nWhat he has done: Before Ivanka Trump, it was Kushner who used private email in an apparent violation of federal records laws. But that\u2019s not all. President Trump has reportedly shunned security concerns by continuing to use his personal cellphone. He has done this even as he has been told that China and Russia are monitoring the phone \u2014 exactly what he worried about when it came to such countries potentially hacking Clinton\u2019s server.\n\nAt the least, you\u2019d think a guy who was so concerned about records laws and cybersecurity would take more care.\n\nForeign governments allegedly buying access\n\nWhat Trump said: \u201cHillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund. It\u2019s hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins. Access and favors were sold for cash. It\u2019s called pay-for-play. Over and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation or who gave money to Bill Clinton got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department.\u201d\n\nWhat he has done: Another of Trump\u2019s favorite knocks on Clinton was the idea that foreign governments were buying access to and favors from the Clintons via donations to the Clinton Foundation. But since he has become president, foreign dignitaries and anxious would-be influencers have frequented Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington \u2014 apparently in hopes of currying favor. The foreign clientele is at the center of an emoluments lawsuit that has proceeded apace.\n\nIntelligence briefings\n\nWhat Trump said: \u201cFact \u2014 Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess!\u201d\n\n\u201cObama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings. But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers.\u201d\n\nWhat he has done: Trump\u2019s criticism was always overcooked. Obama didn\u2019t always get an in-person briefing, but he often read the his daily briefing instead. Trump doesn\u2019t even do that. He has taken the briefing about once a week or less and often deputized Vice President Pence to receive it. He reportedly doesn\u2019t read it. \u201cI get it when I need it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m, like, a smart person. I don\u2019t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years.\u201d\n\nDivulging classified information\n\nWhat Trump said: \u201cWe can\u2019t have someone in the Oval Office who doesn\u2019t understand the meaning of the word \u2018confidential\u2019 or \u2018classified.\u2019\"\n\n\u201cLike the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nWhat he has done: In an Oval Office meeting last year with officials from our Cold War opponent, Russia, Trump divulged highly classified information about a valuable stream of intelligence in the Middle East. As president, Trump is able to declassify anything he wants, but the intelligence community fretted that the information would tip the Russians off to what the program entailed and who was involved, which was a closely guarded secret.\n\nExecutive orders to change the law\n\nWhat Trump said: \u201cRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy contract calls for the appointment of judges who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Hillary wants to go even further than Obama on illegal executive action. I will terminate every single illegal Obama executive order and will restore the constitutional rule of law.\u201d\n\nWhat he has done: Trump has used executive orders to institute, among other things, a ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries and attempts to ban those arriving at the Southern border from receiving asylum. He has often had those orders halted by the courts. And this month, Trump even floated the idea of getting rid of birthright citizenship via executive action, which most experts regard as illegally trying to change the Constitution with the stroke of a pen.\n\nGolf\n\nWhat Trump said: I\u2019ll let this tweet sum it up.\n\nTrump today made his 6th trip to the golf course in 30 days as president.\n\n\n\nHere are his previous tweets about presidents and golf: pic.twitter.com/66361Bgk3b \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 19, 2017\n\nWhat he has done: Trump has golfed far more often than Obama ever did."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "It's Mariah Carey season, and 'Caution' is perfectly timed - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post It's Mariah Carey season, and 'Caution' is perfectly timed Washington Post Should you choose to enlist in a pop diva's stan army, your duties will be endless.

Mariah Carey\u2019s fans, known collectively as the Lambily, recently sent \u201cGlitter\u201d to the top of the iTunes chart, the result of a viral #JusticeForGlitter campaign.\n\nCarey, making the press rounds to promote her new album, \u201cCaution,\u201d seemed underwhelmed by the soundtrack\u2019s \u201cPet Sematary\u201d-like reemergence.\n\nAfter all, \u201cGlitter\u201d \u2014 released on Sept. 11, 2001, and a companion piece to a famously panned film that also starred Carey \u2014 was supposed to kick off her second act. Before \u201cGlitter\u201d tanked, Carey was a glamorous, elastic-voiced star who introduced hip-hop features to pop music, sold tens of millions of albums and could do little wrong.\n\nAfter \u201cGlitter,\u201d she struggled. Her albums followed the same formula they always had, mixing whispery bedroom tracks, catchy up-tempo hip-hop-meets-pop songs featuring guest turns from increasingly less dangerous rappers, and ballads that showcased her increasingly unreliable upper register. Sometimes (like 2005\u2019s \u201cThe Emancipation of Mimi\u201d), it was as if the disaster that was \u201cGlitter\u201d never happened. Other times (like 2014\u2019s \u201cMe. I Am Mariah . . . the Elusive Chanteuse\u201d) only the Lambily stayed loyal.\n\nIn the 17 years post-\u201cGlitter,\u201d despite marrying, birthing twins and divorcing, Carey has publicly remained almost exactly, comfortingly the same. She is still a tottering presence in Lycra and platform heels. She still resists things normies have resigned themselves to, like fluorescent lighting (Mariah brings her own lighting team with her), and sitting upright. She still has the personal life of a plucky Lifetime TV movie heroine. She is right where you left her.\n\n\u201cCaution\u201d is on track to be Carey\u2019s biggest hit in years. It\u2019s not an undeniable work of art (it\u2019s pretty good, though), but it comes at just the right time: Everyone loves Mariah Carey in November, and Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cFantasy\u201d-era cosplay only makes us appreciate Carey more. We\u2019ve returned to her for the same reason people watch reruns of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d: because we miss the people we imagined we were and the harmless things we used to like. We miss worrying about the Clinton impeachment, or the cast of \u201cFriends,\u201d or whether O.D.B. would straighten himself out eventually.\n\n\u201cCaution\u201d acknowledges, and only slightly panders to, this hunger for \u201990s nostalgia. It avoids things Carey may no longer be able to do (skyward-stretching, melismatic ballads), or want to do (bangers) but otherwise retraces recognizable patterns. There are collaborations with 18-months-behind-the-curve hitmakers (Hi, Skrillex), who revisit the \u201990s with Mariah because she is not going to 2016 with them. The Skrillex track, \u201cThe Distance,\u201d is an R&B ballad with an electro-pop coating and a Ty Dolla $ign feature that sounds new but old. The Blood Orange/Slick Rick collaboration \u201cGiving Me Life\u201d is like-minded, but clumsier, one of several songs that uses meme-speak to sound current but will sound dated in three months. The record opening \u201cGTFO\u201d (which means what you think it means) is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d reimagined for 1 Percenters. Instead of leaving her boyfriend\u2019s things at the curb, Carey offers to call his valet.

Bulochnikov is almost certainly immortalized in \u201cPortrait,\u201d the album\u2019s closing piano ballad. \u201cPortrait\u201d has everything; arch wordplay, childhood nostalgia, pointed insults, tremulous bravery (\u201cSomewhat desensitized/Still the same hopeful child/. . .

In his video, Iraziev condemns nightclubs for \u201calcohol like a river, depraved women and in the end there are shootings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Nurmagomedov has voiced disapproval of other people\u2019s nightlife choices.\n\n\u201cAll alcoholics will have the same end,\u201d he wrote after a news conference ahead of the fight against McGregor, who had lambasted him for refusing an offer of whiskey.\n\nIn August, Nurmagomedov posted a video of a largely-female crowd singing along at a hip-hop concert with the comment: \u201cModern Dagestan. Is this really what our revered ancestors left us to inherit?\u201d\n\nThe Muslim peoples of Russia\u2019s North Caucasus are often marginalized economically and socially in Russia, with higher levels of poverty than the national average and generally conservative views on issues such as women in the workforce. The region\u2019s passion for combat sports offers young men a path to fame \u2014 and an audience for their views.\n\nNurmagomedov has repeatedly met with the authoritarian ruler of the neighboring region of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. Authorities in Chechnya heavily restrict the sale of alcohol, promote an Islamic dress code for women and have been accused of human rights abuses including torture of gay men.\n\nNurmagomedov\u2019s stance on nightclubs has been echoed by Olympic wrestling champion Abdulrashid Sadulaev, nicknamed the \u201cRussian Tank\u201d for his strength in the ring.\n\n\u201cMy dear brothers and countrymen,\u201d Sadulaev wrote to his Instagram audience of 650,000 after Sunday\u2019s shooting, which authorities have blamed on suspects including a former martial arts champion. \u201cWe are mountain men who call ourselves Muslims. There is nothing in these seedy places (nightclubs) for us except harm ... For us, there is no place for these clubs.\u201d\n\nSo far, there\u2019s no sign of a crackdown on nightlife. Regional youth minister Kamil Saidov told the Govorit Moskva radio station that Sunday\u2019s shooting was \u201can everyday conflict\u201d and said there should be better security, not closures.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have places for young people to relax (they\u2019ll leave Dagestan),\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As of Tuesday, that blaze had burned more than 151,000 acres and was 70 percent contained. At least 79 people have died in the fire, and hundreds are missing. Nearly 13,000 homes have been destroyed, mostly in Paradise and Magalia, since the fire started on Nov. 8.\n\nSmoke from the fires has been festering over California for days, but recently it was picked up by upper-level winds heading east.

Fine particulate concentrations were high on Monday, and black carbon, which Boyle said is a good tracer for smoke, was also high during the morning and early afternoon.\n\nOn top of that, high pressure over the region is forcing some of the smoke particles toward the ground, which is leading to higher pollution levels. The air quality index is moderate over parts of Northern Virginia and Maryland on Tuesday.\n\nThe smoke is also enhancing sunrises and sunsets. Smoke is made up of tiny particles from wildfires, which can provide more points for light to bounce off and scatter. This leads to the enhancement of the red and orange hues you see. A deck of clouds near the horizon also has this effect, allowing the sun\u2019s rays to reflect off the clouds and to our eyes.\n\nThe smoke will probably linger in the area until Wednesday night, when a strong cold front comes through.

The drug, used to treat people with HIV, also helps prevent the virus from infecting healthy people. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nAn influential panel of medical experts recommended for the first time Tuesday that physicians offer preventive medication to anyone at high risk of acquiring HIV.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force estimated that 1.2 million people are eligible for the daily drug regimen, which is very effective at preventing HIV infection, but that only 78,360 took the medication in 2016. About 40,000 people were newly diagnosed with HIV that year.\n\nJohn Epling, a member of the task force and a professor of community medicine at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and the Carilion Clinic, said routine discussion of the medication has not permeated primary care. He said he suspects that some doctors are not having conversations with patients who should be considered high-risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things that haven\u2019t diffused all the way through primary care yet,\u201d Epling said in an interview. \u201cThe more familiar territory is in using condoms and avoiding multiple sexual partners.\u201d\n\nThe task force\u2019s draft recommendations are aimed at persuading more doctors to bring up the subject of preventive drugs with their patients, he said.\n\n[Is HIV prevention pill right for you? CDC outlines how to tell whether you should be on the medication]\n\nIf the recommendations become final, most insurance companies would be required by law to cover the medication without imposing a co-payment on patients.\n\nPre-exposure prophylaxis, known as PrEP, is a combination of two drugs \u2014 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine \u2014 made by Gilead Sciences and marketed as Truvada. Taken daily in a single pill, the \u00adFDA-approved medication greatly reduces the chance of acquiring HIV, according to research cited by the task force. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that PrEP cuts the risk of contracting HIV through sex by more than 90 percent and reduces the risk for intravenous drug users by more than 70 percent.\n\nSide effects \u2014 mainly nausea and mild, reversible kidney problems \u2014 are minor, but patient adherence to the drug program varied between 30 percent and 100 percent in research considered by the task force, an independent panel of experts on preventive medicine.\n\nThe drug also is very expensive \u2014 according to Gilead, nearly $1,676 for a 30-day supply. Most insurance covers the drugs, but critics have cited out-of-pocket costs as perhaps the biggest obstacle to staying on the medication.\n\nIn a statement, a Gilead spokesman disagreed, adding that \u201cthe CDC estimates that less than one percent of people who are indicated for Truvada for PrEP have an unmet need for financial assistance. . . . Beginning September 1 of this year, we increased our patient support programs by raising the annual co-pay assistance from $4,800 to $7,200 and doubling patient eligibility for the Medication Assistance Program from six months to 12 months.\u201d\n\nThe AIDS research foundation amfARcalled the new recommendation \u201cencouraging,\u201d saying the organization welcomes \u201cany effort to increase its uptake among populations at high risk for HIV. . . . Today is a good day for HIV science and prevention.\u201d\n\nGrowth in the use of PrEP has been rapid, according to a 2018 study led by epidemiologists at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. Its use rose from 3.3 people per 100,000 population in 2012 to 36.7 people in 2017.\n\nBut use of the medication is more than twice as frequent in the Northeast than it is in the South, the researchers found, even though a disproportionate number of new HIV diagnoses occur in Southern states.\n\n[Pathways to Progress: Combating the HIV/AIDS Epidemic]\n\nThe development of effective therapies and better prevention have changed HIV from a death sentence to a manageable disease that people can live with for decades. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million people in the United States are infected with HIV, an estimated 15 percent of whom don\u2019t know they have it, the task force reported.\n\nAccording to the CDC, new HIV diagnoses are disproportionately concentrated among injection drug users and black and Latino men who have sex with other men.\n\nThe task force delineated four groups of people it considers to be at high risk for HIV:\n\n\u25cfMen who have sex with other men and have a partner with HIV, a recent sexually transmitted infection or inconsistently use condoms;\n\n\u25cfHeterosexuals who have a partner with HIV, a recent sexually transmitted infection or inconsistent condom use with a partner whose HIV status is unknown and is at high risk for contracting the virus;\n\n\u25cfInjection drug users who share needles or are at risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity.\n\n\u25cfSex workers or people trafficked for sex.\n\nAs it did in 2013, the task force also recommended that all people ages 15 to 65 and all pregnant women be screened for HIV.\n\nThe proposed recommendations are open for public comment until Dec. 26.\n\nRead more\n\nMedical experts say people with undetectable viral loads cannot transmit HIV\n\nThe graying of HIV: One in six new diagnoses are people over 50"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Banksy exhibit opens in Milan on heels of auction stunt", "description": "The MUDEC museum in Milan is hosting the first exhibit of street-artist Banksy's works in an Italian public museum, just weeks after the artist grabbed international attention by partially shredding one of his works at a London auction", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/banksy-exhibit-opens-in-milan-on-heels-of-auction-stunt/2018/11/20/76108d00-ecdd-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:00:56Z", "content": "MILAN The MUDEC museum in Milan is hosting the first exhibit of street-artist Banksys works in an Italian public museum, just weeks after the artist grabbed international attention by partially shredding one of his works at a London auction.

(Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nFood reporter/columnist\n\nI find it nearly impossible to wander into 16th Street Heights \u2014 or Brightwood or Brightwood Park, whichever the heck neighborhood claims the real estate around the intersection of 14th Street NW and Colorado Avenue \u2014 and not think about the late Colorado Kitchen, the most dictatorial restaurant I ever loved.\n\nGillian Clark was the Colorado\u2019s chef and owner, and she ran the place as if every customer were a threat to her sovereignty. She scolded diners who tried to chat with her, or even compliment her, via a window looking into the kitchen. She positioned a Kleenex box near the entrance so you could help yourself to a tissue for your gum because she assumed you\u2019d use the underside of a table instead. She even once created a display, something like a shadow box with an MRE packet tucked inside, with the admonition that your wait for a table was nothing compared to the suffering of our men and women in uniform.\n\n[If you\u2019re wondering what a neighborhood restaurant looks like, here it is]\n\nColorado Kitchen was a shame show \u2014 with terrific comfort food.\n\nTony Kowaleski, co-owner of Moreland\u2019s Tavern, just across the street from the ghost of Colorado Kitchen, has heard the stories of Clark\u2019s famous/infamous restaurant, which closed more than a decade ago. Colorado Kitchen still serves as a cautionary tale in the neighborhood, and Kowaleski is quick to note that he and his business partner, Matt Croke, are veterans of the restaurant business. Kowaleski is a partner in DC Reynolds in Park View, while Croke, co-owner of Boundary Stone Public House in Bloomingdale, is the son of a man who managed hotels for his entire career.\n\n\n\nOwners Matt Croke, left, Tony Kowaleski, right, and chef Emily Baran, center. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\n\u201cOur family is hospitality, and hospitality is first in our restaurants,\u201d says Croke. \u201cIt\u2019s something that gets lost\u201d in the mad rush to open yet another restaurant in Washington.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get lost at Moreland\u2019s. The tavern occupies two floors and a patio, and there\u2019s not a square inch of the place where someone doesn\u2019t dote over you like an adoring aunt. The first time I set foot in Moreland\u2019s, the ground floor was jammed tighter than a New York subway. My wife and I were directed upstairs to what I expected to be a server-starved purgatory. What we found instead was a bartender attuned to our every need. We also spotted a friend at a nearby table, surrounded by his neighbors, who were all apparently regulars.\n\nIt quickly became clear that Moreland\u2019s Tavern is a rare beast: a neighborhood restaurant that understands the needs of its neighborhood, including the need for locals to feel spoiled, not like spoiled kids in need of discipline.\n\n[When your favorite neighborhood restaurant closes, the grief is real]\n\nLike Boundary Stone, Moreland\u2019s Tavern is built for comfort. The menu is a single page, specializing in the familiar, vaguely cross-cultural fare that has been absorbed into the DNA of every restaurant that caters to mainstream American tastes. Tacos, sliders, pasta, fried fish, maybe a roast chicken to show off the kitchen\u2019s facility with the dish. Nothing on chef and partner Emily Baran\u2019s menu is designed to intimidate, though one or three may impress with their modest ambitions.\n\n\n\nMoreland's Tavern, near the intersection of 14th Street and Colorado Avenue NW. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nRugby players from Catholic University in the upstairs bar at Moreland's Tavern. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nThe dish described as \u201csteak frites\u201d didn\u2019t feature a tender, more American-friendly cut of beef. No, this plate came with two charred lengths of hanger steak, the ropy, slightly kidney-tasting cut beloved by butchers and Francophiles alike. The hanger oozed dark-red juices, its center as raw as tartare and its exterior dark and crusty. This was textbook grill work, and it didn\u2019t need a lick of the herbed compound butter, with its pronounced garlic nose. The skin-on fries were thicker than classic frites, but I devoured them all the same. (Note: The hanger now comes with fingerling potatoes for the winter season, but you can still sub them out for fries.)\n\nIf everything else I sampled had matched the simple pleasures of that steak and fries, I would have taken to the streets, bullhorn strapped to my car a la \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d and sung Moreland Tavern\u2019s praises to anyone who\u2019d listen. But several dishes fell flat during my visits, often on days when you\u2019d expect the B-team to be running the kitchen. One early weekday evening, I sat at the bar, watching the hapless New York Giants on Monday Night Football and thinking that my tough, overcooked chicken sandwich was just as lifeless. A couple of weeks later, on a quiet Sunday night, I was served a fried catfish that looked blackened and seemed to have absorbed half a fryer\u2019s worth of oil.\n\n[A steakhouse chain makes the cut with its tasty new burger joint]\n\nMoreland\u2019s strikes me as a place whose aspirations exceed ever so much its available talent, a common problem in a city with unprecedented restaurant growth and without the experienced help necessary to keep it humming. Some dishes were on the verge of greatness, like the succulent roast chicken, whose skin was more taut than crisp. The yogurt and Brussels sprouts combo might have worked better if the former hadn\u2019t curdled from the heat of the tiny charred cabbages. Sometimes substitutions were made but not announced, like a standard burger bun subbed for the advertised challah.\n\n\n\nVegetarian tacos. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)\n\nThe bread switcheroo wasn\u2019t the double-meat burger\u2019s only fault, either. It was missing its pimento cheese, too. Normally, in my rules of the reviewing game, these two strikes would have constituted an out, but the burger still had enough in reserve to knock a solid double. Credit the quality beef, nice and juicy, supplemented with a tomato relish for a sweet kick of acid. The pretzel bread appetizer performed much the same: Its saltless hide was not ideal but proved its worth once slathered with the now-you-see-it, now-you-don\u2019t pimento cheese.\n\nGiven my little snipes, you might be wondering why I like Moreland\u2019s as much as I do. I like it because the place is modern and cozy \u2014 with brick walls and enough Edison bulbs to keep a hardware store alive for years \u2014 without being too full of itself. I like it because the kitchen serves up a trio of colorful vegetarian tacos that will test your spice tolerance. I like it because the tavern takes its name from a historic Brightwood landmark that once housed Union officers who helped defend Fort Stevens.\n\nBut mostly I like it because, every time I visited, I had the sense every employee cared that I was occupying a seat.

My track record of evaluating the likelihood of success for presidential candidates isn\u2019t particularly great. I assumed, as did others, that the Republican Party\u2019s internal mechanics would ensure that the party\u2019s 2016 candidate would be a Jeb Bush-type person, not a Donald Trump-type one. The party had fairly successfully fended off its emotional base in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and I assumed it would do so again in 2016. It did not, for a variety of reasons, including a fractured field that allowed Trump to consolidate support from a fervent group of supporters that propelled him to the nomination.\n\nBut that\u2019s also why a Steyeresque candidate seems so unlikely for the Democrats in 2020.\n\nSteyer isn\u2019t the only Steyeresque candidate humming around in the background. There\u2019s also former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg (who did some heavy midterm spending of his own) and former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz. Each comes from a similar background: used to running things and spending to effect change and, one might assume, rarely facing insurmountable opposition.\n\nIt also seems, to some extent, as though they see the Democratic Party as the sole refuge for business-friendly centrism. To be fair, the party has always had a welcoming nook for such candidates, but with the increasing consolidation of the Republican Party by Trump and Trump loyalists, even more conservative candidates like Bloomberg appear to see the Democratic Party, to a large extent, as the Not-Republican Party. Bloomberg, whose party identification has long been flexible, was toying with a run as an independent in 2016. That the GOP was tugged further from the middle during that campaign and after seems to signal to Bloomberg and other Trump opponents of varying stripes that they necessarily have a welcoming home on the left.\n\nThat misreads the simultaneous change in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2016, the party establishment almost saw its second open-nomination loss in a row as Hillary Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders recognized that running for president as an independent meant having to create his own runway toward liftoff. Running as a Democrat, the party with which he\u2019d long caucused, gave him prominence and infrastructure that he\u2019d otherwise lack. Trump, intentionally or not, benefited from the same parasitism on the Republican side, and people like Bloomberg and Steyer no doubt recognize that the chance of becoming president increases significantly by routing through a party than by attacking from the outside.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019s bid was almost successful because he captured two sentiments for which Bloomberg and Steyer are not natural fits. The first was a rejection of the establishment and the second a focus on issues of economic inequality. Sanders leveraged the establishment to run against it, making a pitch that was focused on the antithesis of Bloomberg, Steyer and Schultz: Too much wealth concentrated at the top was unfair and, in some ways, dangerous.\n\nWe have noted repeatedly that Sanders benefited from an underrecognized shift in the ideology of Democratic voters. While Republicans have been overwhelmingly conservative for years, a plurality of Democrats identified as moderate as recently as 2000, with only slightly more Democrats identifying as liberal as conservative. By 2017, half of Democrats identified as liberal.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nA wealthy, socially liberal business executive would have certainly felt at home in the party at the end of the Clinton administration. At this point, that\u2019s less the case, as 2016 should have demonstrated. Sanders ran against Clinton specifically by saying that she was too close to Wall Street. Is the party, four years later, going to nominate a chief executive, a hedge-funder or a Bloomberg?\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the wealth that\u2019s problematic. It\u2019s also the demographics.\n\nPew Research Center data show that women have increasingly identified as Democrats since 2015, in part, as a response to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe party is also much more diverse than it used to be. While 83 percent of Republicans are white, according to Pew, only 59 percent of Democrats are.\n\nThe effects of that shift are tangible in the midterm election results. Including the leaders in still-uncalled House races as of Monday evening, the incoming Democratic caucus will be far more diverse than the Republican caucus. A plurality will be white men, but a majority of the House caucus will be made up of nonwhite representatives and women.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut those numbers include incumbents. Will Jordan of GlobalStrategyGroup looked at House seats that flipped from Republicans to Democrats in 2018 as opposed to 2006. Twelve years ago, more than 8 in 10 Democrats who won Republican-held seats were white men. This year, less than a quarter were (as of a few days ago).\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat\u2019s critical to remember, though, is what I missed in 2016: This midterm election saw a surge in turnout from an energized Democratic Party, both in the general and in the primaries. That surge in the primaries is why there were more diverse candidates in the general. The Democratic base turned out and voted for candidates who mostly weren\u2019t white men. The energy in the party is distinctly away from moderates who look like Steyer and Bloomberg.\n\nIn what will likely be a crowded Democratic field, lots of things can happen. Spending a lot of money in politics has uncertain effects, and the lesson of the past two years is to be wary in making pronouncements that are too certain.\n\nBut if you want to make a bet on whether a billionaire white man will be the nominee, I\u2019d be happy to discuss the odds I\u2019ll give you."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Felicia Sonmez and Dino Grandoni, The Washington Post", "title": "California billionaire Tom Steyer inches closer to 2020 White House bid - SFGate", "description": "Tom Steyer, the California billionaire best known for his campaign to impeach President Donald Trump, is making a move toward a potential 2020 White House bid, launching town halls in key primary states on the platform of \"five rights.\"\nSteyer announced the m\u2026", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tom-steyer-inches-closer-to-2020-white-house-bid/2018/11/20/05a647de-ecbb-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/77/04/30/16533025/3/rawImage.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:46:00Z", "content": "Tom Steyer, co-founder of NextGen Climate Action Committee, speaks during the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco on Sept. 14, 2018.

But he took a pass on running for office in 2018, instead launching a nationwide TV ad campaign urging lawmakers to impeach Trump.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in his San Francisco office in September, Steyer demurred when asked whether he plans to run for president. But he did suggest the next president need not be a current or former senator or governor.\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing is going to be to have somebody who [has] thought really deeply on these issues in terms of understanding both how the process works and how that policy works,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real hurdle for everybody . . .

It\u2019s crazy, man. Everybody\u2019s out there battling, in the heat of the battle, and you\u2019re gonna make that play be the [deciding factor]? To me, I think that right there lost the game. Because now you\u2019re dealing in a situation where you\u2019re losing your timeouts, and [it\u2019s] the worst-case scenario for that whole incident. If we don\u2019t get that penalty, they\u2019re punting the ball to us.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the penalty resulted in an automatic first down, forcing the Redskins to burn their final two timeouts on the Texans\u2019 next two plays and allowing Houston to run the clock down to less than a minute before attempting a long field goal. Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn\u2019s attempt was no good, but there were only 52 seconds on the clock when Washington took over.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 final desperation drive wasn\u2019t without controversy, this time as a result of a no call. Facing third-and-10 from the Houston 45-yard line with 16 seconds remaining and no timeouts, Colt McCoy threw a deep pass intended for Josh Doctson. Houston\u2019s Justin Reid and Kareem Jackson were in coverage, and despite the fact that Reid appeared to initiate contact with Doctson before the ball arrived, there was no penalty called. Two plays later, Dustin Hopkins missed a potential game-winning 63-yard field goal.\n\nCouple people asked to see if there was a potential defensive pass interference on the deep ball to Josh Doctson on 3rd down. Here's the clip. #Redskins pic.twitter.com/wkelVov7xc \u2014 Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) November 18, 2018\n\n\u201cIt was interference, man,\u201d Moss said. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nDukes pointed out that Moss, as a former receiver, was biased, and would always be looking for a pass interference penalty to be called in that situation. \u201cBut how do you call one and not the other?\u201d Dukes asked.\n\n\"I talk about the refs time and time again,\u201d Moss said. \u201cWhen games are close, they\u2019re not going our way when it comes to them deciding it for us. No, they\u2019re not giving that to us. And that\u2019s just been something about Redskins and the refs. Like, when we\u2019re in the game and have a chance to really claw our way and make something of it, the ref\u2019s not giving it to us. I saw two plays when it could have easily went with us, and then one of them wasn\u2019t called at all; the other one was called against us. It\u2019s just a shame, man, that we have to be dealt [with] that way.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins are averaging seven penalties per game, 11th most in the NFL. It\u2019s worth noting that Washington won an important game earlier this year thanks in large part to a controversial and rarely seen snap infraction penalty against the Cowboys.\n\nMoss acknowledged Monday that questionable officiating wasn\u2019t the only reason Washington lost to the Texans.\n\n\u201cWe still had a chance to win the game,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that third-down play before the fourth-down, 63-yard attempt . . . was one of those pivotal moments, where, if we could\u2019ve got just some kind of yardage out of that play, now we\u2019re seeing fourth-and-short.

What does life look like after a partner dies?\n\nHere are some of the stories behind those numbers.\n\nBans \u2014 and growing disapproval \u2014 aren\u2019t stopping female genital mutilation\n\nFor millions of girls, one of the first serious threats they will encounter in their lives is female genital mutilation. Typically carried out by community leaders or midwives, the practice is often seen as a rite of passage for young girls and is most prevalent in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But it can be deadly, or lead to serious health complications, including chronic kidney infections, painful sex and difficulties in childbirth.\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as any procedure that involves the \u201cpartial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\u201d Despite having no medical benefits, the practice has been inflicted upon at least 200 million women and girls across the world.\n\nMomentum has grown to ban FGM, which also violates a number of U.N. human-rights conventions, and some countries have passed laws making it illegal. Such laws have the potential to be effective \u2014 if cases lead to prosecution. But in many places where FGM is banned, it is still pervasive because of the lack of accountability and inadequate outreach in rural areas where the practice is most common.\n\nBurkina Faso, for instance, banned FGM in 1996 and threatened those found guilty of performing it with up to three years in prison. While data organized by UNICEF shows that the rates of FGM decreased after the ban, girls there are still at risk. In September, around 50 girls ended up hospitalized in the country\u2019s northeast after their procedures went badly.\n\nIn most countries where FGM is still practiced, a majority of girls and women do not support it Majority support Majority do not support 25 50% do not support FGM 75 100 Togo 99% Ghana 98 Benin 97 United Republic of Tanzania 97 Iraq 95 Kenya 94 Niger 94 93 Cameroon Burkina Faso 91 Uganda 91 Central African Republic 89 Eritrea 88 Guinea-Bissau 87 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 86 Senegal 83 Ethiopia 82 Yemen 81 Nigeria 78 Chad 71 Mauritania 64 Djibouti 63 Liberia 61 Sudan 59 Egypt 46 Gambia 35 Somalia 35 Guinea 33 Sierra Leone 32 Mali 25 Note: Charts shows percentage of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who have heard about FGM and think the practice should be ended.

In some areas where the ban has been effective, it has led to the introduction of alternative coming-of-age ceremonies, including dances and other celebrations. The government initially seemed committed to investigating cases of FGM, prosecuting dozens of cases after the law was passed.\n\nBut in the country\u2019s northeast, the practice is still widespread. Many people there live in rural or pastoralist communities where centuries of tradition, and unofficial legal structures, still trump national law. Activists worry that FGM remains normalized and that certain community leaders are unwilling to report cases even when they hear about them.\n\nEarlier this year, a Kenyan doctor even petitioned a court to legalize FGM for adults, claiming women should be able to decide for themselves if they want to go through with it, alarming those who see the medicalization of the procedure as an effort to normalize it.\n\n\u2014 Siobh\u00e1n O\u2019Grady\n\nThe fight to get girls in school is stalling in some regions\n\nOver the past couple of years, there has been some good news in the global fight to give women access to education. Girls and women have traditionally been kept out of school at much higher rates than their male counterparts. But that gap has slowly been closing, and it has virtually disappeared as of 2016 for children older than 11, according to statistics from UNESCO.\n\nBut the worldwide numbers do not tell the whole story. In some regions, there is still a gender imbalance in who is kept out of school, and it is still women and girls who suffer the most from exclusion.\n\nThere are any number of reasons, including wars and poverty, that contribute. But perhaps the most important factors are cultural. The expectation that women should be mothers and wives, not students, remains the largest obstacle to getting girls in school.\n\nThe problem is particularly acute across sub-Saharan Africa. There, according to UNESCO, girls of every age group are more likely to be excluded from learning than boys. For every 100 boys who are kept out of primary school, the organization said, \u201cthere are 123 girls who are denied the right to education.\u201d\n\nThe gap in education access is slowly closing, but the difference in access for girls and boys remains larger in low-income countries Out of school 30% 0 10 20 35.8% Low-income countries 29.9% 3.4% High-income countries 4.1% 18.5% World 17.2% Note: Chart shows out-of-school percentage rates for girls vs. boys, combining the primary, lower secondary and upper secondary age groups.

In more than a dozen sub-Saharan countries, at least 30 percent of girls give birth before the age of 18, according to the U.N. Population Fund.\n\nAnd young women in school are sometimes forced out when they get pregnant. In 2017, Human Rights Watch found that in Tanzania and Sierra Leone, school policies kept young mothers and pregnant women out of the classroom. In Tanzania, officials conducted pregnancy tests in schools and kicked out those with positive results.\n\nOther countries, including Cameroon and South Africa, have enacted policies that allow young mothers to return to school after giving birth. But cultural stigmas remain; Human Rights Watch found school officials sometimes refuse to welcome such students back.\n\nSome societies may see girls as better wives and mothers than as students, but studies show if countries invest in girls\u2019 education, they will reap the benefits. The World Bank estimates that girls who receive an education can lift their households, communities and countries out of poverty. Indeed, the countries where education is the worst for girls \u2014 such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic \u2014 are often the countries where poverty is the most extreme.\n\nEven a slight increase in enrollment can cause immense change. In 2014, the U.S. Agency for International Development said if 1 percent more girls were enrolled in secondary school in India, the country\u2019s GDP would rise by $5.5 billion. If all girls were enrolled in school in sub-Saharan Africa, the region\u2019s agricultural output would increase by 25 percent. It has even been suggested that promoting girls\u2019 education can help fight climate change.\n\n\u2014 Ruby Mellen\n\nLow rates of sexual violence are masking serious dangers to women\n\nBy the numbers, Japan is one of the safest places on Earth to be a woman. It has low rates of reported domestic violence and sexual violence, according to United Nations data.\n\nBut those numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. Take it from Shiori Ito.\n\nIto was an aspiring journalist in her 20s when one of Japan\u2019s best-known television journalists, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, invited her out for a drink. While out with him, she began to feel dizzy and fainted in the bathroom of a restaurant. When she woke up, she was naked. Yamaguchi was on top of her, she said, and he had raped her while she was unconscious.\n\nIto waited five days to go to the police. She was too ashamed to go right away, she said, but she eventually reported the assault: \u201cI know if I didn\u2019t talk about it, this horrible climate of sexual assault will never change,\u201d she told the New York Times.\n\nThe police did not want to pursue the case, but Ito pushed them to investigate. Even after they gathered security footage and eyewitness testimony that helped her case, they declined to make an arrest.\n\nIto\u2019s story demonstrates one of the major challenges in understanding the global landscape of sexual violence: Scholars believe there is a significant gap between the number of crimes committed and the number of allegations reported to authorities \u2014 and another one between the number of allegations and actual prosecutions.\n\nDoes this country have legislation ...

Just 4 percent went to the police.\n\nJapan is not an anomaly. More and more countries recognize sexual violence as an epidemic. But few have figured out how to change their laws, legal system and culture to make women safer.\n\nTo fix this, experts says changes are needed at every level. Schools must do a better job defining consent and teaching both women and men what constitutes rape. Police and legal professionals must investigate claims thoroughly and pursue assailants. And the legal definition of rape must be broad enough to capture sexual violence as women actually experience it.\n\nSweden, for example, appears to have much higher official rates of sexual violence. But experts say the country has simply done a better job of educating women and encouraging accountability. A new law, for example, defines rape broadly and puts the burden of proof on the defendant to show he or she obtained consent.\n\nIn most countries, including the United States, the plaintiff must show her rights were violated. Sweden\u2019s investigative legal system also leads to much higher rates of conviction than in other countries.\n\nOther countries, like France and Germany, require police to pass all rape allegations on to prosecutors who can bring a case against the alleged attackers. This means police officers cannot decide whether a victim can bring a legal case, like they did in Ito\u2019s case.\n\n\u2014 Amanda Erickson\n\nPutting more women in power requires a push\n\nIt is fair to say men make the majority of political decisions around the world. Only a handful of governments around the world are led by women, and, according to the World Bank, less than a quarter of members of parliament around the world are female.\n\nThere is one country, however, where female parliamentarians easily outnumber their male counterparts: Rwanda, a small, landlocked nation in central Africa still mostly known for the genocide that took place there in 1994.\n\nAfter elections in September, 49 of the seats in Rwanda\u2019s 80-seat Chamber of Deputies now belong to women. This means 61 percent of the country\u2019s most powerful legislative body is female.\n\nFor comparison, only 20 percent of the U.S. Congress is female \u2014 a record, incidentally. Rwanda has a higher proportion of female lawmakers than Iceland \u2014 called the world\u2019s most gender-equal country by the World Economic Forum \u2014 where 48 percent of lower-house parliamentarians are female.\n\nRwanda has the highest proportion of women in parliament in the world % of seats in national parliaments held by women Rwanda 61.3% 60 Iceland 47.6 40 United Kingdom 32 China 24.2 World 23.7 20 United States 19.4 0 2002 2017 Sources: The World Bank; Inter-Parliamentary Union.

United Kingdom 32 China 24.2 World average 23.7 20 United States 19.4 0 2002 2017 Sources: The World Bank; Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\nSo how did Rwanda get here?\n\nThe genocide, which left up to a million dead and many more displaced, is one major factor: After the mass killings, 70 percent of the country\u2019s population was female. But many countries have more women than men. What also matters is how Rwanda changed its laws in response to the genocide to encourage female participation in politics.\n\nDrude Dahleup, a professor at Stockholm University and the author of \u201cHas Democracy Failed Women?,\u201d said Rwanda\u2019s path to a female majority began after the country implemented a constitution that set a quota of 30 percent women in \u201cdecision-making organs.\u201d\n\nThe first election under that constitution, in 2003, was also the first since the 1994 genocide. The percentage of women in parliament jumped from just under 26 percent to almost 49 percent thanks to the new electoral rules. It would reach a peak of 63.8 percent in 2013.\n\nTo an American audience, the idea of a gender quota for Congress may be hard to imagine. But it is an increasingly popular trend around the world. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance says more than half of all countries now apply some sort of gender quota to their parliaments.\n\nOf course, not all countries have seen such a dramatic shift in representation because of quotas. Some countries, such as Somalia, have actually missed their targets in elections. The results, Dahleup said, depend heavily on how the quotas are constructed.\n\nAnd even when quotas are implemented successfully, some worry female politicians can end up with little influence. In Rwanda, critics have called the high number of female parliamentarians a \u201csmokescreen\u201d that hides the political domination of President Paul Kagame.\n\nStudies have shown quotas do increase the number of women in high-level elected offices. And once in office, female lawmakers tend to raise issues important to women. In Rwanda, regardless of anything else, that has certainly mattered: The WEF now ranks Rwanda fourth in the world for gender equality.\n\n\u2014 Adam Taylor\n\nMany elderly women are finding the freedom they once lacked\n\nIn almost every country in the world, women outlive men \u2014 often by a decade or more.\n\nThat is true in both normal times \u2014 men are more likely to die of chronic diseases or suffer from illnesses related to smoking and alcohol \u2014 and in emergencies. One 2017 study found women outlive men even during famines and epidemics.\n\nAs a result, there are an estimated 258.5 million widows worldwide, according to Reuters. Almost a third of them live in India and China.\n\nLife for widows can be challenging. One in seven widows lives in extreme poverty (numbers that echo the rates of women in extreme poverty more generally). In several countries, women are unable to inherit land after their husbands\u2019 deaths. And in some places, widow \u201ccleansing\u201d rituals \u2014 like forcing a widow to drink the water in which her husband\u2019s dead body was cleaned \u2014 can leave women vulnerable to disease.\n\nWidowed women are also sometimes shunned. A 2015 study commissioned by the Loomba Foundation found 70 percent of Turks surveyed said widows are treated worse than other women because they are seen as a threat to other people\u2019s marriages.\n\nThe data on widowhood also reveals something interesting: While being a widow is an immense challenge in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, in other places it actually offers women more freedom and opportunities. Some research suggests women are happiest in old age and after their partner has died.\n\nWomen outlive men in all but one country \u2014 Bhutan Number of years women are expected to live longer than men 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Syria 13 Lithuania 11 Seychelles 10 Belarus 10 Russia 10 El Salvador 9 Poland 8 Brazil 7 Thailand 7 Puerto Rico 6 Japan 6 Spain 6 United States 5 Mexico 5 France 5 Canada 4 Iraq 4 United Kingdom 4 Ethiopia 3 India 3 China 3 Iceland 3 Ghana 2 Iran 2 Algeria 1 Burkina Faso 1 Nigeria 1 Sierra Leone 1 Nepal 1 Bhutan 0 Note: Chart shows difference between average life expectancy at birth for women and men.

Trevisan followed thousands of men and women for four years to understand how losing a partner affects their happiness.\n\nShe found men typically struggled after their wives died. But women reported feeling more content and less stressed. \u201cSince women generally have a longer life span than men, married women may also suffer from the effects of caregiver burden, since they often devote themselves to caring for their husband in later life,\u201d she said.\n\nA study from Britain\u2019s National Health Service found something similar. The NHS surveyed nearly 8,000 people and concluded British women are more unhappy than men at nearly every stage of their lives \u2014 as teens, young adults and in middle age.\n\nBy the end of their lives, there is a shift: After 85, women say they are just as happy as men and often happier. There are fewer responsibilities and less housework, researchers point out. They are also more likely to be widowed, a fact that adds to their happiness.\n\nIt is yet more evidence that the unpaid labor women do \u2014 running households, caring for partners and children, tending to parents and grandkids \u2014 is a burden that adds up over a lifetime, both for the women and society. As Brigid Schulte of the think tank New America told CNN Money, \u201cThat\u2019s robbing women of the ability to be innovators, for economics and companies and societies to take full advantage of women\u2019s talents.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Amanda Erickson\n\nCredits Illustrations by Dola Sun.

In case you doubt that this whole exercise was a campaign stunt, note that since the election, Trump himself has gone oddly quiet about what he previously claimed was a national emergency.\n\nBut make no mistake: The legal battle over the fates of those generally seeking asylum here is very much alive, and the long-term stakes are very high.\n\nA new court ruling released early Tuesday underscores those stakes. Buried in the ruling is a warning from the judge: He flatly asserts that Trump is claiming the authority to close down the southern border to asylum claims entirely.\n\nThe decision, by Jon S. Tigar of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, temporarily blocks Trump\u2019s recent executive action barring people from seeking asylum if they did not cross at an official port of entry.\n\nThis attempted ban \u2014 which was delivered in a presidential proclamation that explicitly invokes the migrants and claims a border \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2014 is pernicious on its face. As it is, applying for asylum in the United States is perfectly legal. With this proclamation, Trump is simply trying to restrict the ways people can do this. People fleeing violence, persecution or other severe threats don\u2019t always have the opportunity to carefully plan their migration.\n\nThe new court decision declares that this order runs afoul of federal law that \u201chas clearly commanded that immigrants be eligible for asylum regardless of where they enter,\u201d noting that the law explicitly says aliens can apply for asylum \u201cwhether or not\u201d they entered \u201cat a designated port of arrival.\u201d For a full explainer on what the law says, see this Lawfare piece.\n\nBut for our purposes here, there\u2019s something remarkable buried deep in the decision: The judge warns that Trump\u2019s proclamation and the interim rule that went with it actually claim for Trump the authority to shut down the southern border to any and all asylum-seeking.\n\n\u201cThe rule itself actually gives the President the ability to issue even more restrictive proclamations\u201d later, the judge\u2019s decision says. \u201cThe rule gives the President plenary authority to halt asylum claims entirely along the southern border.\u201d\n\nTrump could go even further later\n\nHow does Trump\u2019s action do this? According to immigration lawyers I spoke to, this is a reference to a line in the rule that holds out the possibility of \u201cadditional\u201d limitations on asylum later. That line says such limitations might be implemented pursuant to the provision of law that says the president can \u201csuspend the entry\u201d of \u201cany class of aliens\u201d if the president decrees that this would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to our interests.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s the same provision that Trump used to implement his thinly veiled Muslim ban, which has now been upheld by the Supreme Court. Immigration lawyers say the judge is suggesting that Trump is claiming the authority to use this same provision to suspend all asylum claims at the southern border if he so wishes.\n\n\u201cThe judge is warning that even more restrictive proclamations could be coming, including halting asylum claims altogether, even those filed by people waiting patiently at ports of entry in Mexico,\u201d Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer who has written several books on immigration law, told me.\n\n\u201cThe judge has sounded a constitutional alarm bell, warning that Trump is claiming unlimited power to bar asylum applications across the entire southern border,\u201d added immigration attorney David Leopold.\n\n\u201cClose the whole thing!\u201d\n\nIs this far-fetched? No, it isn\u2019t. The Post recently reported that Trump was in such a rage about the recent spike in migrant families crossing the border that he privately proposed sealing the border entirely. He exclaimed: \u201cClose the whole thing!\u201d\n\nTrump has also reduced the cap on refugees to its lowest level since the Refugee Act of 1980. And the administration has employed all manner of bureaucratic maneuvering to restrict the number of refugees admitted even further than official limits.\n\nThere are all kinds of good reasons for allowing in asylum seekers and refugees. It reaffirms our commitment to international human rights and to providing a safe refuge to those fleeing international horrors. And as a recent Niskanen Center report outlined, refugees tend to assimilate successfully and make positive contributions to the economy. As for Trump\u2019s frequent claim that asylum seekers are evading court hearings and melting into the interior illegally, that, too, is vastly overblown. A flat-out ban on asylum seekers at the southern border would be a humanitarian and diplomatic disaster.\n\nTrump could win this one\n\nIt\u2019s true that the courts have blocked many of Trump\u2019s more draconian immigration initiatives. But the Supreme Court did uphold the travel ban. Even though Trump repeatedly revealed the ban\u2019s roots in anti-Muslim animus, the court affirmed Trump\u2019s broad powers to suspend entry to classes of aliens by declaring them detrimental to U.S. interests in a superficially neutral way, regardless of his openly advertised bigoted motives.\n\nIn the case of Trump\u2019s asylum restrictions, the law does appear more clear cut, in that it clearly states that people can apply regardless of where they enter, which the new ruling reaffirms. But this is only a temporary restraining order, and Trump appears to be testing how far he can go.\n\n\u201cThe district court warned that the President might seek to shut off all asylum applications on the southern border,\u201d national security law expert Peter Margulies told me. \u201cThat would mean the end of asylum as we know it.\u201d\n\nMargulies noted that this latest ruling did reaffirm that \u201cthe asylum law\u2019s text and structure prevent the president from asserting such boundless power.\u201d However, he added: \u201cBut the Supreme Court read the president\u2019s power broadly in the travel ban case. The asylum ban case will show if the Supreme Court regards the statute\u2019s text and structure as imposing any substantial limits on presidential power.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump may not go this far, and if he does, he may fail. But given what we\u2019ve seen, does anyone want to bet that he won\u2019t try?\n\nRead more:\n\nDana Milbank: While Trump feasts on Thanksgiving, troops on the border eat rations and await Pancho Villa\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s latest anti-immigrant gambit: Family separation 2.0\n\nCatherine Rampell: The Trump administration is also punishing legal immigrants.

(Bullit Marquez/Associated Press)\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping said Tuesday negotiations between Beijing and Southeast Asian nations on a nonaggression pact to prevent clashes in the disputed South China Sea could be concluded in three years and promised that any differences will be dealt with peacefully.\n\nXi made the assurances after holding talks with President Rodrigo Duterte and other officials on a visit to the Philippines aimed at deepening relations with the American treaty ally.\n\nXi\u2019s overnight visit to the Philippine capital, Manila, was his last stop on a three-nation swing through Asia, where he has offered infrastructure loans and aid and championed free trade amid a rivalry for regional influence with the United States.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to manage contentious issues and promote maritime cooperation through friendly consultation,\u201d Xi said. He said China aims to conclude the talks on the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d in the disputed waters with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations within three years.\n\nFour members of the 10-nation bloc \u2014 Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam \u2014 along with China and Taiwan have overlapping claims in the South China Sea. Many fear the long-simmering disputes could spark an armed conflict that could shatter Asia\u2019s bustling economies.\n\nAhead of Xi\u2019s visit, China and the Philippines tried to negotiate an agreement allowing joint oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters, but apparently did not reach a consensus. They signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding on cooperation on oil and gas development\u201d on Tuesday but officials provided few details.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cooperation to find ways to find a solution,\u201d Philippine Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said of the agreement.\n\nChina has sought a \u201cmaritime and air liaison mechanism,\u201d an arrangement for forces of the two countries to coordinate their naval and aircraft movements to prevent incidents in the contested waters, but the proposal has been opposed by Philippine defense officials, two Philippine officials told The Associated Press.\n\nThere was no mention of the pact after Tuesday\u2019s meetings.\n\nFilipino nationalists have warned that any agreement that can undermine the Philippines\u2019 internationally recognized exclusive rights to fish and exploit resources within 200 nautical miles of the country\u2019s coast would violate the Philippine Constitution.\n\nBeijing\u2019s relations with Manila deteriorated over the territorial rifts until Duterte won the presidency in mid-2016 and sought to rebuild ties with China while criticizing U.S. security policies in a dramatic pivot. The administration of Duterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had brought the territorial disputes with China to international arbitration and won, but China has ignored the outcome.\n\nDuterte has refused to immediately demand Chinese compliance with the ruling, which invalidated China\u2019s sweeping claims to the waters, where Beijing has transformed a string of disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases.\n\nDuterte\u2019s rapprochement has fostered a new era of warmer relations with the Asian economic powerhouse, from which he has sought trade and investment, infrastructure financing and weapons to fight insurgents. While Western governments have sharply criticized Duterte\u2019s brutal crackdown on illegal drugs, China has not. Both Xi and Duterte have often been in the crosshairs of human rights groups.\n\nXi said he and Duterte \u201cagreed to elevate our relationship into one of comprehensive, strategic cooperation,\u201d adding, \u201cit sends a strong message to the world that our two countries are partners in seeking common development.\u201d\n\nXi\u2019s visit to the Philippines is the first by a Chinese president in 13 years.\n\nMore than 300 protesters with placards reading \u201cHands off our land and seas\u201d rallied in front of the Chinese Consulate in Manila. Another group of protesters later burned mock Chinese flags near the presidential palace, where Xi and Duterte met.\n\nDuterte said Philippine participation in Beijing\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d was discussed and Xi invited the Philippine leader to attend the infrastructure loan program\u2019s second international forum in China next year.\n\nThe ambitious program has been criticized by the United States as enticing poor nations into debt bondage and has warned it could compromise their independence. Xi has denied that Chinese loans could lead to a \u201cdebt trap.\u201d\n\nAside from their trade disputes, China and the United States have wrestled over Beijing\u2019s assertive claims to the South China Sea. Chinese officials have asked Washington to back off from what they say is a purely Asian dispute, but the U.S. has vowed to maintain a presence in the waters, where it has no claims but has pledged to promote freedom of navigation and overflight.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows and our national interests demand; harassment will only strengthen our resolve. We will not change course,\u201d U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said at a meeting last week in Papua New Guinea that was attended by leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, including Xi.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at a rally in Columbia, S.C., on Oct. 20. (Meg Kinnard/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe latest hot commodity in the 2020 field of potential Democratic candidates for president is, unsurprisingly, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.). Normally, the guy who lost to a guy who lost to the incumbent president is not going to set the world on fire. But O\u2019Rourke is no ordinary politician. His charisma, appeal to unity and ability to mobilize young people and Hispanics \u2014 even during a midterm election \u2014 make him unique among many of his peers considering a run against President Trump.\n\nPolitico reported:\n\nSparked by his narrow defeat in a Texas Senate race, Beto O\u2019Rourke is scrambling the 2020 presidential primary field, freezing Democratic donors and potential campaign staffers in place as they await word of his plans. Even prior to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s meteoric rise, many Democratic fundraisers had approached the large number of 2020 contenders with apprehension, fearful of committing early to one candidate. But the prospect of a presidential bid by O\u2019Rourke, whose charismatic Senate candidacy captured the party\u2019s imagination, has suddenly rewired the race.\n\nConcerns one might have had about his thin experience seem inapt in the era of Trump \u2014 and when possible competitors include freshmen senators and non-politicians with equal or less political experience. The bigger questions for O\u2019Rourke and others revolve around whether he can win back the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest, which Democrats lost in 2016, hold onto the moderate voters in suburbs (many of whom tested the waters by voting Democratic for the first time in 2018), and withstand the pummeling Trump is going to deliver.\n\nTaking a step back, a Democrat looking at the potential field of candidates sees a logjam of progressives senators from blue states \u2014 Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Also on the progressive wing of the party are possible candidates such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and billionaire Tom Steyer. Not all will run; some will fade early. However, competition will be stiff as each tries to stand out in a crowd (maybe inevitably running further and further to the left).\n\nThe opening, if there is one, seems to be in another lane: the centrist Democrat category. If former vice president Joe Biden decides to run, he\u2019ll be the man to beat. If he doesn\u2019t, however, the moderate lane opens up considerably. There are a few mulling a race \u2014 Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu and Govs. Steve Bullock of Montana and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, for example \u2014 but they are less numerous and seem less determined than the pack running in the progressive lane. Perhaps this is a sign that the party\u2019s energy is on the left. However, if Biden opts out, it\u2019s also an opportunity for an ambitious Democrat who has some crossover appeal and an actual track record of enacting Democratic policies.\n\nModerate Democrats looking at the 2018 results, where Democrats gained ground in the suburbs and won back states critical to earning an electoral-college majority, are understandably nervous that the party will fail to learn the biggest lesson of 2018: Exciting progressives came close, but moderates won.\n\nJust after the election, Jim Kessler and Lanae Erickson of the moderate group Third Way wrote, \u201cSo 2020 hopefuls beware: Medicare-for-all failed the Hippocratic Oath. It did harm. And when you face powerful forces intent on making it a litmus test in the primary, proceed with caution.\u201d Another reason to worry if the Democrats go far left would be a centrist independent such as Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio), who may enter the race and vacuum up voters between the two extreme major-party candidates.\n\nAs noted, there is some room to run for a center-left candidate with some appeal both with progressives and moderates \u2014 e.g., Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Biden \u2014 but the lessons of 2016 should also be heeded: Get a dynamic candidate who emotionally bonds with voters; can stand up to Trump (not simply complain about him); has a vision (not a stack of white papers); and has potential to unify not only the party, but the country as a whole. Find that kind of candidate, and the ideology may become secondary.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nThe Republican Party isn\u2019t \u2018grand,\u2019 and its old ideas are making it irrelevant\n\nA critical lawsuit over the acting attorney general\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t want to be called racists \u2026\n\nStacey Abrams has it right about election rhetoric\n\nRepublicans sound like they haven\u2019t learned a thing"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Karoun Demirjian", "title": "Schumer to Justice inspector general: Investigate Whitaker\u2019s contact with White House", "description": "The Senate minority leader asked the DOJ\u2019s watchdog to review the acting attorney general\u2019s contacts with the president and others to find out if he has been planning to compromise the Russia probe.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/schumer-to-justice-inspector-general-investigate-whitakers-contact-with-white-house/2018/11/20/27e45ade-eccf-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vXBiRGXBLFQqx-2DK_zqFocjAcY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NUHXEZXM2MI6RFWUBUR7FKVNBE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:00:01Z", "content": "The Senates top Democrat has asked the Justice Departments inspector general to investigate acting attorney general Matthew G.

Mueller III\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether anyone in Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with those efforts.\n\nIn a letter to inspector general Michael E.

Many have called for Whitaker to recuse himself, while some sued this week to challenge his appointment as unlawful.\n\nBut the decision of whether to scrutinize Whitaker will be Horowitz\u2019s, as the inspector general is under no obligation to launch a probe just because one lawmaker requests it.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Whitaker last week, Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema (D) will be Arizona\u2019s first female senator. The lawmaker is not new to making history, especially when considering the very conservative state that launched her political career, but identity was not a dominant narrative of her historic campaign.\n\nThe former Mormon was the first person sent to Congress to claim no religion. After winning her congressional seat in 2012, she was sworn in on the Constitution, forgoing the Bible chosen by Christians \u2014 the dominant religion for members of Congress, especially those from Arizona.\n\nSinema was also the first openly bisexual person elected to Congress and carries that first with her to the Senate. This was significant given the frequent criticism that gay men (often white and affluent ones) are the dominant face of the LGBTQ community, a fact that likely shapes which policies and issues get the bulk of attention.\n\nBut during an election cycle where some candidates openly touted their desire to be a first, breaking barriers was not the focal point of the Sinema campaign.\n\nJustin Unga, who oversaw the Arizona effort for the Human Rights Campaign, told The Fix that focusing on one\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t always been the most effective way to connect with Arizona\u2019s voters. And there is also a concern among gay voters that they are being pandered to when candidates overemphasize identity.\n\n\u201cArizona\u2019s strong independent streak has always meant that we elect people on their merit,\u201d he said. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve sent openly LGBTQ leaders into every level of government. Folks like Kyrsten, [former Tempe mayor] Neil Guiliano, and [state Rep.] Daniel Hernandez Jr. served and were reelected based on their ability to represent their constituents.\u201d\n\n\u201cArizona is an example of bringing people together of different stripes to lift up common values. That\u2019s what we did this year,\u201d he added.\n\nNick Fish, president of American Atheists, a nonprofit focused on maintaining the separation of church and state, told The Fix that issues that were once viewed as dealbreakers for some candidates appear to no longer be major issues.\n\n\u201cThe fact that candidates' sexual orientation and religious beliefs \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 are becoming less weaponized is certainly a step in the right direction. Candidates should run on the issues and show their constituents exactly how they\u2019ll represent them. But we shouldn\u2019t pretend that a candidate\u2019s religion is a nonissue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf more politicians, even religious candidates, embraced that secular approach to governance, we\u2019d be in a far better place. It\u2019s been my experience that our community votes on the issues, not on the labels, and that\u2019s how it should be.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Sinema tried to downplay her identity during her campaign. During a year where the gay community was looking for more representation in Washington and beyond, Unga said the groups that supported Sinema were looking for an ally in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Human Rights Campaign made Arizona a main focus of our 2018 electoral efforts because we had a chance to double LGBTQ representation in the Senate and because of Kyrsten\u2019s record of fighting for every Arizonan, including LGBTQ families,\u201d Unga said. \u201cWe activated hundreds of volunteers and thousands of voters who saw themselves in the political process with a candidate like Kyrsten.\u201d\n\nDuring a time when conservative Christians \u2014 white evangelicals in particular \u2014 appear to have more political clout than ever, discussing one\u2019s religious identity in the current political climate can sometimes feel like navigating an obstacle course.\n\nAnd while focusing on one\u2019s faith may not be a winning campaign strategy in some places, avoiding discussions about it should not be the default approach based on how many Americans likely view the world similarly, Fish said. Almost 40 percent of young people are nonreligious, and a quarter of all Americans are.\n\n\u201cYou can run as an open atheist or nonbeliever and still focus on the issues. But candidates shouldn\u2019t have to hide an important part of their identity to avoid offending voters. Unfortunately, running as an open atheist can still be difficult for candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that could be changing. Sinema is attracting national attention for many reasons, not the least of which is whether there is a path for centrist politicians in our highly divisive times. But the role of identity in a politician\u2019s life \u2014 and its degree of prominence \u2014 will be a common topic of conversation as voters head into the 2020 election looking for leaders who can unite an increasingly diversifying country."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Germany\u2019s disappointing year finally comes to an end", "description": "Finally, the year is over for Germany", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/germanys-disappointing-year-finally-comes-to-an-end/2018/11/20/79bbc87a-ecd3-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:49:26Z", "content": "GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany Finally, the year is over for Germany.

We need to cross off 2018 and do everything better next year.\u201d\n\nGermany started the year hoping to defend its World Cup title.

The problem so far has been refining that pool of players into a coherent team.\n\nAt times on Monday, Germany looked like its old self, with the forward trio of Werner, Sane and Serge Gnabry combining for both goals. However, Loew used all three of his substitutions to replace them with Mueller, Marco Reus and Leon Goretzka.\n\nWithout any fresh legs at the back, the defense failed to mark Dutch scorers Quincy Promes and Virgil van Dijk.\n\nLoew said he still hasn\u2019t found his preferred lineup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long process. I\u2019m also no clairvoyant and don\u2019t know what will happen in March (when European Championship qualifying begins),\u201d Loew said in comments published on the German soccer federation website. \u201cWe have a lot of potential and that gives you a lot of courage for next year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The FBI probe found that she had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d but that there was no intention to violate laws on handling classified information.\n\nThe White House has been bracing for the new revelation to spur a deeper investigation next year by House Democrats of Ivanka Trump\u2019s correspondence in her personal, official and business life.\n\nBehind the scenes, White House officials urged supporters and allies to defend Ivanka Trump and make the case publicly that her personal email use was different from that of Clinton, according to two people familiar with the administration\u2019s talking points.\n\nThe core of their argument: the volume of private emails she sent was much smaller, the messages did not contain classified material, and she did not delete them, they said. The White House is urging surrogates to make the case that it would be Democratic overreach to investigate her, the people added.\n\nA few Trump allies had spoken out on her behalf by Tuesday afternoon, including Rep.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump declared Tuesday he would not further punish Saudi Arabia for the murder of U.S.-based columnist Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 making clear in an exclamation-filled statement that the benefits of good relations with the kingdom outweigh the possibility its crown prince ordered the killing.\n\nThe president condemned the brutal slaying of Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a \u201chorrible crime ... that our country does not condone.\u201d But he rejected calls by many in Congress, including members of his own party, for a tougher response, and also dismissed reports from U.S. intelligence agencies that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman must have at least known about such an audacious and intricate plot.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\u201d the president said. \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the statement captured Trump\u2019s view of the world and foreign policy, grounded in economic necessity. It began with the words \u201cAmerica First!\u201d followed by \u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d\n\nIt came after weeks of debate over whether the president would or should come down hard on the Saudis and the crown prince in response to the killing of the Saudi columnist for The Washington Post who had criticized the royal family.\n\nThe U.S. earlier sanctioned 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the Oct. 2 killing, but members of Congress have called for harsher actions, including canceling arms sales.\n\nTrump said \u201cfoolishly canceling these contracts\u201d worth billions of dollars would only benefit Russia and China, which would be next in line to supply the weapons. Critics denounced Trump\u2019s statement saying he ignored human rights and granted Saudi Arabia a pass for economic reasons.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he was saying that human rights are too expensive to fight for, he responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not saying that at all.\u201d But then he switched the subject to the \u201cterrorist nation\u201d of Iran rather than any actions by Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe U.S. needs a \u201ccounterbalance\u201d to Iran, \u201cand Israel needs help, too,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake.\u201d\n\nThe mistake was Trump\u2019s, said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, contending the administration has \u201cblinders on\u201d in comparing Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of weakness not to stand up to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Paul said in an interview. \u201cSometimes when you have two evils, maybe you don\u2019t support either side.\u201d\n\nRepublican Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator who is close to Trump, also disagreed with the president\u2019s statement, saying America must not lose its \u201cmoral voice\u201d on the international stage.\n\n\u201cIt is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Graham said.\n\nLikewise, Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said that to suggest that U.S. silence can be bought with arms sales \u201cundermines respect for the office of the presidency, the credibility of our intelligence community and America\u2019s standing as a champion of human rights.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s statement, issued just before he pardoned the Thanksgiving turkey at the White House and left for the long holiday weekend in Florida, underscored his world view of putting U.S. interests \u2014 both financial and geopolitical \u2014 above all else.\n\nHe told reporters on the South Lawn that oil prices would \u201cskyrocket\u201d if the U.S. broke with the Saudis, and he was not going to \u201cdestroy\u201d the world\u2019s economy by being \u201cfoolish with Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nAsked about any personal financial involvement, he said, \u201cSaudi Arabia has nothing to do with me. What does have to do with me is putting America first.\u201d\n\nTrump said that King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed both \u201cvigorously deny\u201d any knowledge of the planning or execution of the killing. He also said the CIA has not made a conclusive determination about whether the crown prince ordered it.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with the case told The Associated Press last week that intelligence officials had concluded that the crown prince, the kingdom\u2019s de facto leader, did order the killing. Others familiar with the case, however, have cautioned that while it\u2019s likely the crown prince had a role there continue to be questions about the degree.\n\n\u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\u201d\n\nSaudi prosecutors say a 15-man team sent to Istanbul exceeded its authority when the lead negotiator in the team decided to kill Khashoggi for refusing orders to return. The Saudis say the agents dismembered his body, which has not been found.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill called on the CIA and other top intelligence agencies to publicly report what it has learned about the killing.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the president\u2019s statement. However, former Director John Brennan, a frequent Trump critics, tweeted:\n\n\u201cSince Mr. Trump excels in dishonesty, it is now up to members of Congress to obtain & declassify the CIA findings on Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death. No one in Saudi Arabia \u2014 most especially the Crown Prince \u2014should escape accountability for such a heinous act.\u201d\n\nTrump said he knew some members of Congress would disagree with his decision. He said he would listen to their ideas, but only if they were focused on U.S. national security.\n\nLate last week, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation that calls for suspending weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, for sanctions on people who block humanitarian access in Yemen or support the Houthi rebels, and mandatory sanctions on those responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nDemocrats harshly criticized Trump\u2019s decision Tuesday and called on Congress to cut off arm sales to Saudi Arabia and end support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen, which is facing a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cStanding with Saudi Arabia is not \u2018America First!\u2019\u201d said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia where Khashoggi lived. \u201cPresident Trump has sided with a murderous regime over patriotic American intelligence officials.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Dianne Feinstein of California, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said Khashoggi was killed by agents of the Saudi government in a \u201cpremeditated murder, plain and simple,\u201d and she said she would introduce legislation requiring intelligence agencies to release an unclassified public assessment.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump\u2019s decision, saying, \u201cWe are determined to ensure that we continue to make sure that we take care of the American people in all of the strategic decisions we make about with whom we work with around the world.\u201d\n\nThe president opened his eight-paragraph statement chastising Iran for its proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, its activities in Iraq, its backing of the Syrian government of Bashar Assad and its support of militant groups, which Riyadh has pledged billions to fight.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(David Maung/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nProbably the most obvious example of President Trump\u2019s clumsy attempts to leverage the power of the presidency to benefit his party before the midterm election was his declaration to reporters in late October that he would cut taxes for the middle class before Election Day.\n\nIn short order, people noted that passing a massive piece of legislation in the span of 15 days seemed impractical in the best of times, but much more so when Congress wasn\u2019t in session and hundreds of lawmakers needed to be on the campaign trail. Within days, Trump kicked out the timeline, saying that some sort of resolution about a plan to cut taxes would happen before the election, even if the vote itself didn\u2019t. On Halloween, Trump and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) released a joint statement announcing that Republicans planned to cut taxes further \u2014 and that was it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to have helped Republicans much in the midterms. The party lost well more than 30 seats in the House and a number of governorships. The GOP picked up some Senate seats \u2014 but largely in heavily red states. No mention has been made of tax cuts since, save National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow saying that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink the chances of that are very high,\u201d given the change in House leadership. He reiterated on Tuesday that it wouldn\u2019t happen in the lame-duck session before January, either.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that at the outset of this article, we identified the vaporware tax cut proposal as probably the most obvious example of Trump trying to leverage the presidency to benefit his party. Another contender for that title, of course, is the deployment of the military to the border with Mexico to defend against a caravan of migrants headed north from Central America.\n\nThere were just a few problems with that deployment. First, the troops arrived at the border weeks before any migrants from the caravans did. Second, there was never any serious suggestion that the migrants posed a real threat to the United States, with their plan apparently being to seek asylum upon arriving. A previous caravan had arrived at the border near Tijuana and its members waited to present themselves to authorities at the San Ysidro border crossing. As migrants began arriving at the border in recent days \u2014 well after the election \u2014 that\u2019s also where they arrived. Hundreds of miles from the bulk of the troops, most of whom were deployed to Texas and Arizona.\n\nIn a tweet Monday, Trump undercut his own rhetoric on the need for troops at the border.\n\nThe Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence. This is what it really looks like - no climbers anymore under our Administration! pic.twitter.com/CD4ltRePML \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018\n\nThat\u2019s an image of a section of wall that existed before Trump became president, topped with concertina wire, apparently added this week only as the number of migrants in Tijuana began to grow. In other places, the military installed the deterrent wire (which Trump described as \u201cbeautiful\u201d during a campaign rally), including farther east in California. As you may have noticed, based on the uniform of the man in the photo, the wire above was reportedly installed by members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nImmediately after the election, the Defense Department dropped the existing name for its deployment \u2014 \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot\u201d \u2014 without offering a reason. On Monday, Politico reported that troops sent to the border would start being pulled back, with all of the troops removed from the border by mid-December.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many members of the military might have seen any members of a migrant caravan.\n\nLower on the list of abandoned efforts to goose Republican enthusiasm was the discussion of ending birthright citizenship by executive order. That emerged during an interview with Axios in October, when the outlet\u2019s Jonathan Swan questioned Trump about a rumor he\u2019d been hearing. Trump, however sincerely, expressed surprise at the subject having been brought up.\n\nIn short order, the news media was swamped with discussion of the subject and \u2014 specifically \u2014 the overwhelming opinion from legal experts that Trump had no such power to unilaterally eliminate the granting of citizenship to those born in the United States, save an eventual (and remarkably generous) rubber-stamp from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president wasted little time in making birthright citizenship part of his speeches at campaign rallies, telling a crowd in Missouri that \u201cthe Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien \u2014 even if they\u2019ve been on our soil for a mere matter of seconds.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence that any significant number of American citizens were born following such an effort by a pregnant woman in labor.\n\nAs for the executive order, The Post reported this week that \u201cthe White House is not actively pursuing the executive order the president said he would sign,\u201d administration officials said.\n\nObviously, Trump was hoping that his party would fare better in the midterm election and, equally obviously, he pulled what cards he could from his sleeve to make that happen. There\u2019s no indication that his ploys worked, with some evidence suggesting that the emphasis on immigration in particular may have turned off some independent voters.\n\nIt was fairly obvious at the time that the troop deployment and the announcement about tax cuts were election ploys. Among those finding the ploys obvious, perhaps, were voters."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Afghan official: Suicide bomber strikes gathering of religious scholars in Kabul; at least 50 killed and wounded", "description": "Afghan official: Suicide bomber strikes gathering of religious scholars in Kabul; at least 50 killed and wounded", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghan-official-suicide-bomber-strikes-gathering-of-religious-scholars-in-kabul-at-least-50-killed-and-wounded/2018/11/20/43266f3a-eccf-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:19:17Z", "content": "KABUL, Afghanistan Afghan official: Suicide bomber strikes gathering of religious scholars in Kabul; at least 50 killed and wounded.

(Hannah McKay/Reuters)\n\nWith Joanie Greve\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: An 1879 act of Congress enshrined confidentiality as a fundamental part of the census. Every household in the country is surveyed every 10 years, and policymakers want people to fill out the forms honestly since so much is at stake, from congressional apportionment to the allocation of federal spending. Congress took the confidentiality of the decennial count, mandated by the Constitution, so seriously that another law in 1954 made it a serious crime for anyone at the Commerce Department to share the data with other government agencies or even the courts. Violators are subject to up to five years in federal prison and up to $250,000 in fines.\n\nFor the Trump administration, however, this apparently is not a settled issue. The government was forced to turn over documents Friday night as part of the discovery process in one of six pending lawsuits against the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census form. One email reveals private discussions among President Trump\u2019s appointees at the Justice Department about the possibility of sharing future census information with law enforcement, which could help the government round up undocumented immigrants for deportation.\n\n\u201cAfter a congressional hearing in May about the citizenship question, Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) submitted a written query about whether the Justice Department agreed with a memo it had issued in 2010 saying the USA Patriot Act could not override the confidentiality of the census,\u201d Tara Bahrampour reports. \u201cIn a June 12 email, department officials discussed among themselves how to answer Gomez\u2019s question in a way that left the answer open. Justice Department attorney Ben Aguinaga suggested to acting assistant attorney general John Gore that they not say \u2018too much\u2019 in response to Gomez\u2019s question, in case the issue were to \u2018come up later for renewed debate.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe message could emerge as important evidence in a case that\u2019s set to go to trial in January. The Justice Department declined to comment last night on the email or whether census confidentiality is still up for debate. The mere fact these discussions are taking place will have a chilling effect that could scare off many people from filling out the forms.\n\nThe disclosure of the startling internal email is one of several fresh reminders of just how far Trump is trying to push the envelope on immigration and test the limits of the law, even if it means likely defeat in the courtroom.\n\nCentral American migrants traveling in a caravan leave a shelter Monday and walk toward the downtown area of Mexicali in Baja California, which is a state of Mexico. (Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- A federal judge issued a temporary nationwide restraining order last night to block Trump from denying asylum to migrants who cross the southern border into the United States, saying the policy unveiled by the president on Nov. 9 likely violates federal law.\n\n\u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\u201d Judge Jon Tigar of the U.S. District Court of San Francisco writes in a stinging 37-page order. \u201cAnd if what [Justice Department lawyers] intend to say is that the President by proclamation can override Congress\u2019s clearly expressed legislative intent, simply because a statute conflicts with the President\u2019s policy goals, the Court rejects that argument also.\u201d\n\nThe administration will likely appeal the order by Tigar, who was appointed to the bench by Barack Obama in 2012. It\u2019s the latest setback for Trump\u2019s immigration agenda in the courts. Judges appointed by presidents of both parties have blocked his efforts to defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors. The Supreme Court upheld Trump\u2019s revised travel ban on a 5-to-4 vote in June, and Brett Kavanaugh may provide the pivotal vote as some of these cases end up before the justices.\n\n-- Meanwhile, the Army general in charge of Trump\u2019s border deployment wants to start sending some of the troops back to their home bases. \u201cThe shift would come as the military seeks to adjust to realities on the ground, where soldiers have spent days stringing miles of barbed concertina wire and some have said that they spent days waiting for assignments,\u201d Dan Lamothe reports. \u201cLt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan said in an interview with Politico on Monday that he would probably focus first on redeploying some soldiers focused on logistics. They constitute the majority of the border force and have focused both on installing concertina wire and other barriers to slow down any rush of migrants and building temporary camps in which U.S. soldiers can live nearby.\u201d\n\n-- Immigration authorities have taken several steps to \u201charden\u201d the southern border as more members of the migrant caravan arrived in Tijuana. \u201cHomeland Security officials said Monday they have further restricted vehicle traffic at the San Ysidro border crossing, the nation\u2019s busiest, after receiving reports that crowds of migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, might attempt to overrun their checkpoints,\u201d Nick Miroff reports. \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection closed the entire San Ysidro crossing in San Diego for several hours before dawn, installing additional layers of razor wire and concrete barriers. It reopened with 10 of the port\u2019s 26 vehicle lanes closed.\u201d\n\n-- Against this backdrop: Trump continues to threaten to force a partial shutdown of the federal government on Dec. 7 if Congress doesn\u2019t fully fund his border wall, something Democrats have no appetite to do. (Sixty votes are needed to pass a spending bill through the Senate, so nine Democrats would need to defect during the lame-duck session.) \u201cThis would be a very good time to do a shutdown,\u201d the president said on Saturday as he flew to California to tour fire damage.\n\nCentral American migrants in the caravan wait to receive dinner in Mexicali, Mexico, on Monday night. The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers. (Rodrigo Abd/AP)\n\n-- Personnel is policy: Rather than being fired, the Trump appointee at HHS who has been widely blamed internally and externally for making the family separation crisis worse simply got reassigned to another senior job at the agency. \u201cScott Lloyd, who has come under fire for his oversight of migrant children in federal custody, is being moved to the HHS Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, where he'll be a senior adviser,\u201d Politico\u2019s Rachana Pradhan reports. \u201cDemocrats have long sought Lloyd's ouster over his efforts to block unaccompanied teens in federal custody from obtaining abortions. Lloyd, a longtime anti-abortion advocate, is writing a book about his views on abortion.\n\n\u201cLloyd was effectively removed as refugee director this summer after his office struggled to care for and reunite thousands of migrant children who were separated from their families under the Trump administration's now-defunct \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 border policy,\u201d Pradhan adds. \u201cA top HHS official has been reviewing the department's handling of the migrant crisis, and senior officials believe Lloyd mismanaged aspects of the response. For instance, Lloyd told staff to stop keeping a spreadsheet tracking separated families. At one point during the height of the crisis, HHS Secretary Alex Azar personally stepped in to review case files after he learned Lloyd's office had yet to review hundreds. \u2026 Prior to joining the Trump administration, Lloyd had little experience in helping refugees. He was previously an attorney for the Knights of Columbus\u2026\u201d\n\n-- Another D.C. lawyer with no formal diplomatic experience, Christopher Landau, is now under serious consideration to become Trump\u2019s ambassador to Mexico. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Zoe Tillman and Emily Tamkin report: \u201cAccording to one DC lawyer with firsthand knowledge, Landau, a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, is undergoing background checks, a sign that he\u2019s far along in the vetting process. \u2026 It\u2019s not unusual to have ambassadors with no diplomatic experience, but the US \u2014 Mexico relationship is a critical one, and not only because of trade between the two countries, which came to an estimated $615.9 billion last year. \u2026 The next ambassador will also need to manage relations with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who will be sworn in as president of Mexico next month. L\u00f3pez Obrador is an avowed leftist who published a book called \u2018Listen up, Trump\u2019 criticizing the US president\u2019s approach to immigration and Mexico.\u201d\n\nLandau was considered, but passed over, for Kavanaugh\u2019s vacant seat on the D.C. Circuit. He is a partner at the same firm as Bill Burck, a close friend of Kavanaugh\u2019s who oversaw document production for the George W. Bush library during the confirmation process. Landau clerked for Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. \u201cThe ambassador post in Mexico has been vacant since Roberta Jacobson left the position in May 2018,\u201d per BuzzFeed. \u201cJacobson, unlike Landau, had decades of diplomatic experience and was assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs before becoming ambassador.\u201d\n\nOfficers from the Special Response Team of U.S. Customs and Border Protection stand guard on Monday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after the land border crossing was temporarily closed to traffic from Tijuana, Mexico. (Adrees Latif/Reuters)\n\n-- Ron Vitiello, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has written that the Democratic Party should be renamed the \u201cLiberalcratic party or the NeoKlanist party.\u201d He expressed regret for the 2015 Twitter post during his confirmation hearing last Thursday to get the job permanently. \u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d the 55-year-old told the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \u201cIt was a momentary lapse of judgment, and I apologize. It was meant as a joke.\u201d\n\nBut his incendiary rhetoric was overshadowed by his refusal to rule out that he and the Trump administration might once again separate migrant parents from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border, despite the national furor when they tried it over the summer. \u201cThat option and that discussion is underway,\u201d said Vitiello. \u201cWe\u2019ll get less people bringing their children.

Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cWhite House ethics officials learned of Trump\u2019s repeated use of personal email when reviewing emails gathered last fall by five Cabinet agencies to respond to a public records lawsuit. That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner. [It's called \u201cijkfamily.com.\"] The discovery alarmed some advisers to [the president], who feared that his daughter\u2019s practices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton \u2026\n\n\u201cSome aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules ... The White House referred requests for comment to Ivanka Trump\u2019s attorney and ethics counsel, Abbe Lowell. In a statement, Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Lowell, acknowledged that the president\u2019s daughter occasionally used her private email before she was briefed on the rules, but he said none of her messages contained classified information. [That's what the Clinton lawyers said initially, too.]\n\n\u201cAfter discovering the extent of her email use in September 2017, White House lawyers relied on Lowell ... to help review her personal emails to determine which were personal and which were official business \u2026 The White House Counsel\u2019s Office did not have access to her personal account and could not review it without invading her privacy and possibly violating privileged communications with her attorneys, people familiar with the review said. After his review, Lowell forwarded emails that he had determined were related to official business to Ivanka Trump\u2019s government account, a move he viewed as rectifying any violations of the records law \u2026 Lowell\u2019s review found fewer than 1,000 personal emails in which Trump shared her official schedule and travel plans with herself and her personal assistants, according to two people familiar with the review. Separately, there were fewer than 100 emails in which Trump used her personal account to discuss official business with other administration officials.\u201d\n\nHypocrisy alert: \u201cDuring the campaign, Donald Trump \u2026 called her personal email use \u2018bigger than Watergate.\u2019 Trump supporters still chant \u2018Lock her up!\u2019 at his rallies, and the president, nearly two years into his administration, continues to tweet about Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\nKey quote: \u201cShe was the worst offender in the White House,\u201d said a former senior U.S. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics.

The number of missing people decreased by 294 from a day earlier, and a local sheriff warned that the list may include repeated or misspelled names. The blaze was 70 percent contained as of last night, and expected rain will likely help. (KCRA)\n\n-- Camp Fire evacuees who were already facing overcrowding and disease in temporary shelters are now being threatened by possible flooding. Frances Stead Sellers, Scott Wilson and Tim Craig report: \u201cThe most devastating fire in California history began in the Sierra foothills in the morning hours of Nov. 8, prompting a hectic evacuation that has left at least 52,000 people in hotels, relatives\u2019 homes, parking lots and makeshift shelters such as this one in Yuba City. More than 10 days later, those temporary accommodations are being overwhelmed by overcrowding and disease. As heavy rain moves into the area for the first time since the fire began, those living in tents face the threat of flooding, too. More than 120 people have been taken to hospitals in recent days with stomach ailments that resemble the symptoms of norovirus, a highly contagious infection. The symptoms include severe vomiting and diarrhea and, like many such infections, fall hardest on children.\u201d\n\n-- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed the devastation of the fire on \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d who supposedly prevent forest management. The LA Times\u2019s Alejandra Reyes-Velarde and Joseph Serna report: \u201cIn an interview with Breitbart News, Zinke said he agrees with Trump\u2019s comments about the fires being a result of poor forest management, and repeatedly said radical environmentalists were responsible for the destruction caused by the fires. \u2018It's not time for finger-pointing,\u2019 Zinke said. \u2018We know the problem. It\u2019s been years of neglect, and in many cases it\u2019s been these radical environmentalists that want nature to take its course.\u2026You know what?

Josh Dawsey and Paul Sonne report: \u201cTrump has so far declined to visit those combat regions, saying he does not want to associate himself with wars he views as failures, according to current and former advisers \u2026 Current advisers said Trump is not expected to visit a war zone during the Thanksgiving break, which he will spend at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida. \u2026 In meetings about a potential visit, he has described the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan as \u2018a total shame,\u2019 according to the advisers. He also cited the long flights and potential security risks as reasons he has avoided combat-zone visits.\u201d\n\n-- One of Trump's regional EPA administrators has resigned after being indicted on ethics charges. Scott Pruitt had tapped him for the role. Brady Dennis reports: \u201cTrey Glenn, who oversaw eight states in the Southeast as the EPA\u2019s Region 4 leader, faces charges of using his office for personal gain and soliciting or receiving a \u2018thing of value\u2019 from a principal or lobbyist, according to the Alabama Ethics Commission.

Paul Farhi and Meagan Flynn report: \u201cThe White House\u2019s move to restore Acosta\u2019s pass, announced in a letter to the news network, appeared to be a capitulation to CNN in its brief legal fight against the administration. \u2026 [press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff Bill Shine] said they had made a \u2018final determination\u2019 that Acosta\u2019s pass would be restored permanently as long as he followed new rules guiding reporters\u2019 conduct at White House news conferences. \u2026 Among the rules: Reporters must ask only one question of the president at news conferences, but they can follow up with another if the president consents. A reporter must then \u2018yield the floor,\u2019 including giving up a microphone. Failure to abide by these rules, the White House letter said, will result in revocation of a journalist\u2019s White House pass.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leaves a news conference at the Capitol. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTHE LEADERSHIP FIGHT:\n\n-- Sixteen Democratic House members signed a letter saying they would oppose Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership bid on the floor. Mike DeBonis and Robert Costa report: \u201cThe insurrection against Pelosi stands as the only official obstacle to unity in the top leadership ranks, after Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) on Monday withdrew her challenge for the No. 3 job held by Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), and Pelosi endorsed her leadership team. \u2026 Two Democratic aides said Pelosi inquired with at least one incoming member about whether they would be willing to vote present \u2014 a move that would lower the threshold for becoming speaker while also allowing Pelosi\u2019s critics to keep their word in opposing her. ... In her conversations with individual members, Pelosi has started inquiring about their policy priorities and committee assignment preferences. The Democratic Caucus gives its top leader wide leeway to make those decisions, crucial to a lawmaker\u2019s legislative career.\u201d\n\nOne of Pelosi\u2019s main opponents, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), was confronted by pro-Pelosi protesters at a town hall: \u201cAt a town hall meeting in Amesbury, Mass., Monday night, Moulton heard an earful from Pelosi supporters \u2014 including about 20 organized protesters who held signs reading \u2018I Stand With Nancy.\u2019 Many of them saw sexism and ageism in the push to oust Pelosi. \u2018I almost feel like I\u2019m targeted \u2014 I\u2019m old and I\u2019m a woman,\u2019 said Lynda Christian, 80, of nearby Burlington, Mass. \u2018Nancy Pelosi, I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s done a fantastic job. Who fires somebody who does something well?\u2019 Addressing the sometimes testy crowd, Moulton said it would be \u2018failing the American people\u2019 to keep Pelosi in place after 16 years in charge.\u201d\n\nPelosi can afford to lose 16 Democratic votes on the floor, but there are a handful of Democrats who have promised to oppose her and did not sign the letter: \u201cTwo of the 16 signers, Anthony Brindisi (New York) and Ben McAdams (Utah), have yet to be declared winners. Also signing the letter were Reps. Jim Cooper (Tenn.), Bill Foster (Ill.), Seth Moulton (Mass.), Brian Higgins (N.Y.), Stephen F. Lynch (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Kathleen Rice (N.Y.), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Linda T.

Conor Lamb (Pa.) and Reps.-elect Jason Crow (Colo.), Jared Golden (Maine), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.) \u2014 have made firm statements saying they would not vote for Pelosi but did not sign the letter. Representatives for Crow, Lamb and Spanberger each said Monday that their positions on Pelosi had not changed and that they intend to vote against her in the January floor vote.\"\n\n-- Pelosi's rivals have revived questions over whether her form of dealmaking is incompatible with Trump\u2019s presidency. The New York Times Magazine\u2019s Robert Draper reports: \u201cPelosi told me that she and the House Democrats had every intention of working with [Trump] on things like lowering prescription-drug costs, rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure and protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. \u2026 There were a lot of Democrats, I suggested, who believed that bipartisanship had been rendered antique in the Trump era. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 Pelosi replied, smirking, \u2018and I have those who want to be for impeachment and for abolishing ICE\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Two really winning issues for us, right? In the districts we have to win? I don\u2019t even think they\u2019re the right thing to do. If the evidence from Mueller is compelling, it should be compelling for Republicans as well, and that may be a moment of truth. But that\u2019s not where we are.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- A new poll found Democratic voters are divided on whether Pelosi should retake the speakership. Forty-nine percent of Democrats said they would like to see Pelosi become speaker again, while 40 percent preferred another Democrat. (CBS News)\n\nRep.

Doug Ducey (R) to appoint Martha McSally to replace Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). CNN\u2019s Devan Cole and John King report: \u201cMcSally, a Republican congresswoman who once worked for Kyl, lost her Senate bid two weeks ago to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. Kyl, who was picked by the governor in September to fill the seat vacated by the late Sen. John McCain, [said] last week he has decided whether to leave office before his term ends at the end of next year. He wouldn't reveal his decision, but said he will talk to Ducey about it. CNN has since learned that McConnell and other national Republican powerhouses are asking Ducey to name McSally as Kyl's replacement, according to several Republican sources familiar with the conversations. If chosen, McSally would fill the position through the end of 2020, at which point the state would hold a special election to fill the remaining two years of McCain's term.\u201d\n\n-- Democrat Ben McAdams declared victory over Rep. Mia Love in Utah, but the Republican incumbent has not yet conceded. The Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s Lee Davidson reports: \u201c[McAdams] gained a 739-vote lead in ballot updates from Utah and Salt Lake counties. Love did not yet concede, and a few votes still remain uncounted in the two big counties before their vote canvasses Tuesday formally conclude two weeks of tallying ballots. But McAdams said even his small lead is insurmountable with the few ballots remaining to be counted.\u201d\n\n-- Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones conceded to Rep.

The Dallas Morning News\u2019s James Barrag\u00e1n reports: \u201cHurd, who declared victory the day after the election, even as Jones contended that the 689 votes that separated them made the race too close to call, again asserted his win Friday after a majority of the provisional ballots had been counted in the district saying the people of \u2018the 23rd Congressional District of Texas made their voices heard and clearly chose Will Hurd.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Marijuana lobbyist Nikki Fried appears to have won the race for Florida agriculture commissioner following a recount. Lori Rozsa reports: \u201cThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Fried was ahead of [Republican Matt] Caldwell by 6,753 votes out of more than 8 million cast. \u2026 [T]he race between Fried and Caldwell also was the subject of the historic statewide recount.

The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Ben Casselman report: \u201cHouse Republicans suffered heavy Election Day losses in districts where large concentrations of taxpayers claim a popular tax break \u2014 the state and local tax deduction \u2014 which the law capped at $10,000 per household. The new limit resulted in an effective tax increase for high-earning residents of high-tax states who claim more than $10,000 per year in SALT. Democrats swept four Republican-held districts in Orange County, Calif., where at least 40 percent of taxpayers claim the SALT tax break \u2026 The SALT cap may not have been the primary motivation for voters in choosing Democratic candidates. But a review of polling data over the past year suggests that the limit has some key Republican constituencies feeling bittersweet about the new law \u2014 and more willing to back Democrats in House elections.\u201d\n\n-- Democratic strategist Steve Schale writes that Republican Ron DeSantis was able to defeat Democrat Andrew Gillum in Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race by replicating Trump\u2019s success in the state: \u201c[J]ust like [Hillary] Clinton, Gillum ran up new high-water mark margins in the urban areas, particularly around Orlando. In total, Gillum won the urban counties of I-4 by 120,000 more votes than [former Democratic governor Charlie] Crist did \u2026 However, where Crist lost the suburban and exurban counties around I-4 by about 157K votes, Gillum lost them by 355K. Or more simply: the counties around the urban I-4 counties delivered DeSantis with more of an increased margin than the Miami media market delivered for Gillum. In a race where most everything else stayed the same \u2013 that made the difference.\u201d\n\n-- A new wave of progressive district attorneys is pushing liberal changes to the U.S. criminal justice system. Justin Jouvenal reports: \u201cThey are freezing the use of the death penalty, decriminalizing marijuana possession, diverting low-level offenders to classes and treatment instead of jail, seeking less severe sentences and vowing to aggressively prosecute police-involved shootings. In a field that is 95 percent white and overwhelmingly male, many are minorities, women or gays and hail from unlikely backgrounds, such as civil rights work or the public defender\u2019s office. \u2026 They had notable successes in Boston, Dallas and San Antonio, as well as in the race for Delaware attorney general, an office that handles criminal cases.\u201d\n\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The AP\u2019s Steve Peoples reports: \u201cDemocrats on the ground expect a rush of presidential announcements soon after New Year\u2019s. That could include as many as five high-profile candidates from neighboring states, a historically large contingent of New Englanders led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both have quietly begun courting potential staff, top activists and elected officials. At the same time, outsiders like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker are fighting for a foothold in the state \u2026 \u201d\n\n-- The election results in Wisconsin have elevated its status as a top battleground state for 2020. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Craig Gilbert reports: \u201cThe state swung back to Democrats for governor and U.S. Senate after [Trump] carried Wisconsin for president two years ago. But Democrats failed to dent the GOP\u2019s stranglehold on the state Legislature, and they won the governor\u2019s race by scarcely more than a percentage point. Taken together, the razor-thin battles for president in 2016 and governor in 2018 have underscored this state\u2019s essentially \u2018swingy\u2019 character. They have also laid bare the limits of each party\u2019s appeal and the challenges both sides face in the Great Lakes battlegrounds that could easily tip the 2020 election.\u201d\n\n-- Texas Democrats believe they have a chance to flip more congressional seats and possibly even the statehouse in 2020. The Texas Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek reports: \u201cDemocrats picked up two seats on Nov. 6, dislodging Republican U.S. Reps. John Culberson of Houston and Pete Sessions of Dallas. But they also came surprisingly close in several districts that were once considered far out of reach, and the Democratic nominees in those races emerged as local rock stars who are already being encouraged to try again in 2020. \u2026 Farther down the ballot, Democrats are already setting their sights on capturing the state House majority in 2020 \u2014 a huge prize ahead of the next redistricting round.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller departs Capitol Hill following a closed-door meeting in Washington.

Marimow reports: \u201cThe special counsel\u2019s office was responding to an inquiry from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a case brought by Andrew Miller, an associate of Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to [Trump]. The case challenges the constitutionality of Mueller\u2019s position and centers on who is doing what job at [Justice] and oversight of the 18-month-long probe. After oral argument this month, a three-judge panel asked Mueller and Miller to address implications for the case of the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions as attorney general \u2014 and the president\u2019s selection of [Matt] Whitaker to succeed him until a permanent attorney general is chosen. \u2026 \u2018The designation has no effect on the case,\u2019 Mueller\u2019s team said of Whitaker\u2019s new position. \u2018The validity of the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment\u2019 in May 2017 \u2018cannot be retroactively affected by a change in the official who is serving as the Acting Attorney General.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump is expected to hand over written answers to questions from Mueller\u2019s team as early as today.

The complaint asks the court to declare Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker as unconstitutional and to block him from his current role. \u2026 Others, including the trio of senators who filed Monday\u2019s lawsuit, have argued that Whitaker\u2019s appointment violates the Constitution because Whitaker, who worked as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, is not a Senate-confirmed official.\u201d\n\n-- The Kremlin said it is supporting a veteran Russian Interior Ministry official to become Interpol\u2019s next president. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ann M. Simmons reports: \u201cThe potential appointment of Maj. Gen.

This has taken a number of forms, including death threats and plans for illegal renditions. But one of the most pernicious has been Moscow\u2019s repeated attempts to misuse Interpol to try to have me arrested and extradited back to Russia, where they will likely torture and kill me. \u2026 In total, Russia has tried to use Interpol seven times to have me arrested.

(Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images)\n\nWe\u2019re down to just one last bye week, with only two NFL teams left to sit out. Of course, that pair of squads, the Chiefs and Rams, happen to feature many of the heaviest hitters in fantasy, including Todd Gurley, Kareem Hunt, Tyreek Hill, Brandin Cooks, Travis Kelce, Robert Woods, Patrick Mahomes and Jared Goff.\n\nSo there will be some fake-football teams in desperate need of fill-ins, and the good news is that there do seem to be some interesting waiver-wire options, such as a slew of talented rookie WRs, available in most leagues. Injuries, while always unfortunate in real life and usually so in fantasy, have also created some opportunities for owners to bolster their rosters.\n\nIn the meantime, the Chiefs and Rams have more than earned their respite, not to mention the enduring appreciation of anyone lucky/smart enough to have invested in those offenses. Before going on break, they gave us one heck of a show on Monday night, a ridiculous back-and-forth that set scoreboards ablaze, and we\u2019re all just going have to find a way to make it through this week without 'em. (Heavy doses of turkey, stuffing and pecan pie should help.)\n\n[The Rams and Chiefs was 'the new NFL' in its most spectacular form yet]\n\nNote that The Washington Post defaults to PPR scoring, and that the rankings will update throughout the week, so please check back frequently. Here are this week\u2019s top movers and players of note.\n\nOn a bye this week: Chiefs, Rams.\n\nQuarterbacks: The last time the Saints and Falcons met, in Week 3, Drew Brees and Matt Ryan each accounted for five TDs and at least 374 yards passing. So, regarding their ranks this week, any questions? . . . The Colts' new and vastly improved offensive line has prevented Andrew Luck from getting sacked in any of his past five games, and he is working on a seven-game streak of throwing for three or more TDs. . . . Jameis Winston is back in the saddle for the Buccaneers. There\u2019s no telling how long it\u2019ll last before he continues his game of starting-job hot potato with Ryan Fitzpatrick, but he should be able to do well against the 49ers. . . . The Vikings' Kirk Cousins hasn\u2019t thrown for over three TDs since Week 4. . . . The Texans' Deshaun Watson hasn\u2019t thrown for over 240 yards since Week 5. . . . Lamar Jackson will have to mix in some TD passes for the Ravens if he wants to enter the QB1 ranks, but man, all that rushing plays very well in fantasy. . . . The Giants' offense is starting to click, just in time for Eli Manning to feast on a depleted Eagles secondary. . . . Colt McCoy takes over for the Redskins in the wake of Alex Smith\u2019s awful injury, and for what it\u2019s worth, he should be able to do a decent impression of the man he was backing up. . . . Keep an eye on the health of Marcus Mariota, or better yet, plan on not using any Titans QB this week.\n\nRunning backs: Sean Payton reminded us last week that one of the many nice things about owning Saints players such as Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram is that New Orleans is not at all shy about running up the score, or to put it another way, concerned about being perceived as having done so. . . . With 11 combined rushing and receiving TDs, the Chargers' Melvin Gordon already has just one less than the career-high mark he posted in each of the past two seasons. . . . The low in any game thus far for the Giants' Saquon Barkley, in terms of yards from scrimmage, is 94. . . . The Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott has at least six catches and 180 total yards in each of his past two games. . . . By contrast, James Conner has had a disappointing two-game stretch, but the Steelers' offense is too good to expect that to continue, even at Denver. . . . When last seen in Week 10, the Browns' Nick Chubb was rumbling for 176 yards and now gets a very accommodating Bengals run defense. . . . Leonard Fournette is getting an RB1 workload but is struggling for every inch in the Jaguars' offense. . . . Now that we\u2019ve all had a chance to figure out just who the heck Gus Edwards is, he checks in on the RB2 periphery, with a great chance to get in the end zone against the Raiders. . . . If the Eagles can get a nice lead on the Giants \u2014 and unfortunately for Philly fans, that is an if \u2014 we may finally see Josh Adams get fully unleashed. . . . In the expected absence of Kerryon Johnson, Theo Riddick gets a bump, all the more so because the Lions will likely have to throw to make up for LeGarrette Blount\u2019s 2.3 yards-per-carry average.\n\nWide receivers: The Saints' Michael Thomas has been targeted 91 times, and the results have included just nine incompletions. That\u2019s [insert breathlessly hyperbolic phrase of choice here]. . . . That\u2019s now three straight games with a TD for the Falcons' Julio Jones, and five straight over 100 yards. . . . The Jaguars' resurgent pass defense held the Steelers' Antonio Brown to just five catches on 13 targets, but he set a season high with 117 yards and scored for the ninth time in 10 games. . . . The Vikings' Adam Thielen has just 88 yards over his past two games, but the Packers present a perfect opportunity to get back on track, while teammate Stefon Diggs is clearly over his rib issues. . . . With Marvin Jones (knee) unlikely to be ready for the early Thanksgiving game, the Lions' Kenny Golladay should be a target magnet yet again. . . . With the Patriots emerging from their bye, it will be interesting to see if they continue to feature Josh Gordon as heavily as they did in the previous two weeks. . . . After uncharacteristic early-season usage as a possession receiver, T.Y. Hilton is back to being a dangerous downfield weapon for the Colts. . . . Sure to be a hot waiver-wire pickup this week, the Saints' Tre\u2019quan Smith is likely to have week-to-week inconsistency, but this sure sets up to be another good week. . . . As alluded to earlier, the crop of WR3 candidates is laden with intriguing rookies, including the Broncos' Courtland Sutton, the Bears' Anthony Miller, the Packers' Marquez Valdes-Scantling, the Panthers' D.J. Moore, the Texans' Keke Coutee and the Cardinals' Christian Kirk. . . . Golden Tate has yet to find his footing with the Eagles, and can\u2019t be considered more than a shaky flex play until he does. . . . The Ravens' move to a massively run-heavy attack under Lamar Jackson has left John Brown in WR4 territory.\n\nTight ends: With Travis Kelce on bye, the Eagles' Zach Ertz takes over the top spot, even after a lousy outing (2-15-0) against the Saints. . . . Among all NFL players, the 49ers' George Kittle is second only to Saquon Barkley in yards after the catch. ... The Patriots' Rob Gronkowski has had a week off to get healthy and is way overdue for a TD, although the Jets are tough on TEs. . . . The Bucs' O.J. Howard picked up an ankle injury Sunday but otherwise was back to being effective. . . . Have to think that being by far the Colts' most heavily used TE will result in a big game for Jack Doyle sometime soon. . . . It\u2019s entirely possible that the Redskins' Jordan Reed could benefit from Colt McCoy replacing the injured Alex Smith. . . . The Chargers' Antonio Gates turned back the clock Sunday with a 5-80-1 line. . . . Jonnu Smith is finally becoming a consistent factor, if not a huge one, for the Titans.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nPredicting winners for each of the NFL\u2019s closest playoff races\n\nDid Marshal Yanda spit at Vontaze Burfict?

The measure, which won support from President Trump last week, is thought to be among just a few tasks lawmakers might undertake on a bipartisan basis during the lame-duck session.\n\nThe main point of the bill, which easily passed the House in May and has been revised in the Senate, is to get nonviolent offenders out of prison faster and help them stay out. A large share of the U.S. prison population, which is already much bigger than in other countries, is made up of nonviolent offenders charged with drug crimes.\n\nBut the measure also contains a nod to the particular challenges women prisoners can face, especially if they\u2019re pregnant. Incarcerated women are routinely shackled during pregnancy and childbirth in the 32 states that don\u2019t have any limits on the practice, prompting calls from medical organizations and civil-rights group to ban what they term an inhumane practice.\n\nBeing shackled, for example, can make it more likely for pregnant women to trip and fall, potentially causing harm to the fetus. Women have also been shackled to beds while delivering their babies, even though having one\u2019s movements restricted can make labor pains even worse. (It also strikes your Health 202 author \u2014 who has undergone childbirth three times \u2014 as a pretty impossible time to cut and run.)\n\n\u201cShackling pregnant prisoners endangers the health and safety of both the mother and the fetus, and is almost never justified by the need for safety and security for medical staff, the public or correctional officers,\u201d says a fact sheet from the American Civil Liberties Union, which backs the bill.\n\nThe First Step Act bans prison guards from shackling prisoners from the time they are determined to be pregnant until they have completed a period of postpartum recovery.

(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nFor most NFL teams in playoff contention, losing their starting quarterback to a season-ending injury would be a significant blow to their postseason hopes. The Redskins aren\u2019t most NFL teams.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend for one second that everybody in this stadium is not excited to see Colt McCoy step back out on that field,\u201d Chris Cooley said during the second half of Sunday\u2019s radio broadcast on The Team 980, shortly after Alex Smith was carted off the field with what turned out to be a broken tibia and fibula. \u201cNot to take anything away from Alex, but I think Colt McCoy has gained a lot of fans here in the last five years as the backup quarterback.\u201d\n\nMcCoy has gained a lot of knowledge, too, and his familiarity with Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s playbook is perhaps the main reason that most pundits expect the Redskins\u2019 offense to be just fine, if not better, in his hands, despite the fact that he hasn\u2019t started a game since 2014. (The Redskins\u2019 19.7 points per game ranks 27th in the league, so the offense can\u2019t get much worse.)\n\n\u201cI actually see this offense getting more explosive with Colt at the helm,\u201d former Redskins running back Clinton Portis told Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cIf your defense continues to play the way that it\u2019s been playing, you can take some of those chances. High risk, high reward. . . . Colt can go out and make a couple throws that get you a little more points in games.\u201d\n\nPortis stopped short of saying the Redskins are a better team with McCoy under center, but he suggested McCoy\u2019s presence could provide a jolt.\n\n\u201cThe team has to come together,\u201d said Portis, who would\u2019ve attempted to sign Jay Cutler, not Mark Sanchez, as McCoy\u2019s backup were he running the team. \u201cThis isn\u2019t all on Colt McCoy. This isn\u2019t, \u2018Oh, Colt has to come in and do everything.\u2019 Everyone else has to step up. Everyone has to elevate their game and pick it up a level.\u201d\n\n[With Alex Smith out and Dallas on deck, Redskins try their best to move on]\n\nDeAngelo Hall also raved about McCoy\u2019s ability to run Gruden\u2019s offense after Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cJust on a positive note, watching Colt McCoy operate this offense, I think these fans can look forward to what\u2019s to come,\u201d Hall said on NBC Sports Washington\u2019s postgame show. \u201cI think Colt, having been in this system for as long as he\u2019s been here, is going to be able to operate this offense pretty effectively. We kind of saw that when he got in the game and got a chance to play.\u201d\n\nMcCoy was 6 for 12 for 54 yards and a touchdown against the Texans.\n\nDuring his weekly appearance with the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan on Monday, Hall predicted that McCoy will take more chances than Smith, and that his aggressiveness will lead to more points.\n\n\u201cColt McCoy is a very capable quarterback,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHe can make every throw. People say he\u2019ll throw the ball downfield more. He will. Colt seems to take a little bit more chances, because he wants to give his guys an opportunity to make a play. If it\u2019s a 50-50 ball, Colt, unlike Alex, will throw that kind of ball and hope his guy goes up and makes a play. . . . He\u2019s a guy who\u2019s got moxie and he\u2019s played in some big games and he understands what it takes to be a good quarterback in this league.\u201d\n\n[Alex Smith wasn't carrying the Redskins.

They trust Colt McCoy, so before I go on to say, \u2018Oh, the Redskins are done,\u2019 let\u2019s not discredit what Colt McCoy did [Sunday]. In a game Alex Smith was losing by multiple scores and the Redskins came all the way back. Is he Patrick Mahomes? No. Is he even Carson Wentz or Eli [Manning]? No. But with a game lead in the standings. and they have a couple games in the division left, Colt McCoy can do this.

Colt [has] been here for [five] years. He knows everybody. And the great part is, he\u2019s the one practicing with [rookie wide receiver Trey] Quinn and the rest of those guys. He already knows the older guys, but he even got a rapport with the younger guys. So I think there\u2019s going to be a trickle-down effect.\u201d\n\nSmoot, who called McCoy a \u201ccrafty quarterback,\u201d echoed what everyone else seems to say about the University of Texas star, which is that the Redskins\u2019 locker room loves him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get behind Colt,\u201d Smoot said. \u201cI think everybody on this team wanted Colt to have a fair chance, but I don\u2019t think coach wanted to take on the media backlash if he won the job from somebody. I think the team believes in Colt. That\u2019s all he needs. He don\u2019t need us to believe anything. All he needs is those guys in that locker room to know that he can play.\u201d\n\n[NFL Week 11 power rankings: Redskins fall after losing game and QB]\n\nMeanwhile, Shannon Sharpe, LaDainian Tomlinson and Deion Sanders shared their thoughts on Washington\u2019s ability to maintain its surprising lead atop the NFC East on NFL Network\u2019s \u201cGameday Prime.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther guys really got to pick up the slack,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAdrian Peterson needs to pick up the slack.

Perhaps most importantly, it would seek to accelerate growth by ensuring that tax, spending and regulatory reforms promote a competitive, not crony, capitalism.\n\nI would add the following: Imagine a modernized Republican Party that takes wealth inequality seriously, as an impediment to social and political cohesion; seeks to unify the country with a re-commitment to our founding creed (\u201cAll men were created equal . . .\u201d); accepts that no party or significant faction of the country wants \u201csmall government,\u201d so that the great challenge is creating a government that works \u2014 and works for those most in need; embraces scientific reality and returns to its roots as a conservation party; expands the franchise (as its founder Abraham Lincoln did) with modernized voting reform; values and supports work; promotes economic and geographic mobility; and understands the country\u2019s role as leader of the free world, which requires military power and defense of universal ideas.\n\nStrangely, there are a bunch of things for which Trump and his ilk seem to have no nostalgia. It is those things we could use more of these days \u2014 a revival of public service, public morality, reverence for the institutions of democracy, character in our public officials and a reaffirmation of our country as a place that welcomes immigrants. (It is odd that Trump\u2019s nostalgia only allows for those traits in our past that bolster his parochial, xenophobic and misogynistic views.)\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m skeptical of the GOP\u2019s ability to clean house and regain its footing as a decent and useful national party. However, I very much agree that we need something or someone to get into the problem-solving mode. \u201cAmerica will not stop changing,\u201d Pethokoukis warns. \u201cAnd if the Democrats continue to edge leftward, and the Republicans get more Trumpy, space may open for a new movement. It would understand the [United States\u2019] new economic realities but look forward for solutions \u2014 to dynamic market economics joined with social policy that makes sure workers are not left behind.\u201d He argues, \u201cAmerica does not need a politics that fights over competing retrograde visions. It needs one that transcends them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it really is time for a third party or independent candidate. If Democrats don\u2019t get their act together, we\u2019ll desperately need a sane, governing vision.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nDriving toward 2020, a pile-up in the left lane\n\nA critical lawsuit over the acting attorney general\n\nIf Republicans don\u2019t want to be called racists \u2026\n\nStacey Abrams has it right about election rhetoric\n\nRepublicans sound like they haven\u2019t learned a thing"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Sonny Bunch", "title": "\u2018Widows\u2019 is an okay heist flick, but an amazing critique of corrupt local politics", "description": "Steve McQueen's \"Widows\" insists that there's no bigger scam than politics.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/11/20/widows-is-an-okay-heist-flick-but-an-amazing-critique-of-corrupt-local-politics/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:00:11Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nViola Davis stars in \u201cWidows.\u201d Photo by Merrick Morton/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nThis post will discuss plot points for \u201cWidows.\u201d As such, modest spoilers ahead.\n\n\u201cWidows\u201d is a twisty and tense heist flick. It\u2019s a thriller with an amazing cast and expert direction from Steve McQueen, the Oscar-winning helmer of \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating character study of a group of women who must make their way through the world of their criminal husbands without any help. Most interestingly, though, \u201cWidows\u201d is an intensely cynical examination of the failure of local institutions and the corruption that manifests wherever and whenever public funds are disbursed.\n\nThe setup is simple enough: Veronica (Viola Davis), Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) and Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) are made widows as the film begins, their husbands dying in a fiery explosion after a heist gone bad. The owner of the lifted cash, Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), wants his $2 million returned, and he\u2019s willing to let his mad-dog brother Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya) get it back however he can \u2014 after the elections, of course. Jamal is running for alderman in Chicago, you see, hoping to become the first African American to win his ward. The $2 million was meant to fund his campaign.\n\nWhy does Jamal Manning want to defeat Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), whose father, Tom (Robert Duvall), stepped down from the city council after a heart attack? Is it to improve the lives of his fellow African American Chicagoans? To make a difference for them, to fight for them?\n\nNah. It\u2019s because alderman is a better scam than the one he\u2019s running. Manning is a criminal, his war chest amassed through misdeeds and murder. As alderman, he can make his scams semi-legit, handing out contracts to family members and friends, earning a kickback on each one along the way. Similarly, Jack is running for his dad\u2019s seat not because he wants to serve the people of his ward but because he knows nothing else; this is the family business, and the family business involves socking away overages on subway expansions to fund a cushy retirement for the pater familias.\n\nThe benefits of this line of work are not to be sneered at. McQueen shows us just how lucrative it can be when Jack and his handler, Siobahn (Molly Kunz), get into an SUV and travel from a campaign event promoting \u201cMinority Women-Owned Work\u201d (\u201cCan I get an M-WOW?\u201d) back to his massive home located on the fringes of the ward. We hear Siobahn tell Jack that he needs to man up and knock the stuffing out of Jamal, that no other line of work will be as remunerative as his effort to grift his way up to mayor.\n\nBut the camera stays outside the car. And as they discuss Jack\u2019s wavering in the face of scandal and Jamal\u2019s increasingly difficult challenge, we see just why she wants him to maintain the family seat of power: The car travels from a blighted area filled with empty lots and Section 8 housing to leafy, almost suburban environs. A few short blocks seen through McQueen\u2019s camera runs us through a whole cycle of gentrification: from blight to all right to political might. By the time we get to the Mulligans\u2019 iron gates, the camera has shown us just what\u2019s at stake.\n\nThis dyspeptic consideration of local politics manifests itself in ways large and small. One example: McQueen, who co-wrote the script with Gillian Flynn, has made Veronica a bigwig with the local teachers union, which helps explain why no one bats an eye at her luxe condo or personal driver. The position also ensures her an audience with Jack: When Tom \u2014 who has just finished ranting about the changing face of their district and the need to keep power out of the hands of the black voters \u2014 hears his son try to dismiss Veronica when she requests a meeting, he scolds the younger man. She represents a union! A public sector union, at that. Which means she has money and votes and foot soldiers. Crooks know where their power lies: with institutions that they can manipulate and massage.\n\nEvery institution in \u201cWidows\u201d has been compromised, from the jobs program to the police station to the public transportation board to the city council. And McQueen\u2019s film is at its best not when it\u2019s cooking up absurd twists but when these corruptions serve as a mirror for the difficult choices our trio of new thieves must make. As a heist flick, it\u2019s fine. But as a profile of a city in distress, \u201cWidows\u201d has few rivals."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Michael O'Sullivan", "title": "Willem Dafoe is an impassioned van Gogh in this fascinating yet frustrating biopic", "description": "\u2018At Eternity\u2019s Gate\u2019 is at its best when it shows, not tells, what the world looks like through the artist\u2019s eyes.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/willem-dafoe-is-an-impassioned-van-gogh-in-this-fascinating-yet-frustrating-biopic/2018/11/19/1e439162-e85f-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vDflBZUBxjMn_moYxBHAu-xSy4E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MLP6GHHJC4I6RO63OL637HKP5U.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T14:00:00Z", "content": "Rating: Julian Schnabels fascinating and at times frustrating new drama about Vincent van Gogh, At Eternitys Gate, exists, as its title suggests, in a liminal space.

Much like the painter, who died without the recognition he deserved, the movie approaches greatness without quite achieving it.\n\nSet in the final 2\u00bd years of van Gogh\u2019s life \u2014 beginning with his meeting the painter Paul Gauguin in late 1887, and ending with the artist\u2019s death in the summer of 1890 \u2014 the film, which stars an uncannily convincing Willem Dafoe, is at its best when it shows rather than tells. Despite being 25 years older than van Gogh was when he died, Dafoe delivers an impassioned and believable performance, his deeply lined face capturing the mix of agony and ecstasy \u2014 to borrow a phrase from another artistic biopic \u2014 that this tortured artist must have felt.\n\n[Willem Dafoe talks about playing van Gogh in \u2018At Eternity\u2019s Gate\u2019]\n\nIn often wordless scenes, cinematographer Beno\u00eet Delhomme\u2019s handheld camera seems to alternate between dancing with Dafoe in some scenes and then attacking him in others, running alongside the actor here, and then swirling around him lyrically there. When Schnabel, a painter himself, turns his attention to the act of mark-making \u2014 with close-ups of rapid ink sketches or thick, impasto brushstrokes being laid on a sketch pad or canvas \u2014 van Gogh\u2019s creative process feels palpably alive.\n\nThe paintings seem to come from some uncontrollable, primal impulse.\n\nBut the film marries these effective if self-consciously impressionistic visuals \u2014 including an overreliance on a partly blurred lens that soon starts to feel like an intrusive affectation \u2014 with an all too on-the-nose screenplay (co-written by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, Louise Kugelberg and Schnabel). No one would call \u201cAt Eternity\u2019s Gate\u201d a talky film, but when it does focus on the words over pictures, it\u2019s less than eloquent.\n\n\u201cMaybe God made me a painter for people who aren\u2019t born yet,\u201d says van Gogh. That\u2019s a beautiful (if slightly egotistical) sentiment, but it doesn\u2019t sound quite right coming from the mouth of a man plagued by self-doubt and depression. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of destruction and failure at the door of a successful picture,\u201d he tells us in another scene. That\u2019s a better and more plausible bit of insight.\n\nSo is his lament: \u201cI have a menacing spirit around me.\u201d\n\n\n\nOscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Emmanuelle Seigner as Madame Ginoux in \u201cAt Eternity\u2019s Gate.\u201d (Lily Gavin/CBS Films)\n\nMuch of the talking, when it occurs, takes place in the context of conversations, arguments and entreaties between van Gogh and his friend Gauguin (Oscar Isaac), his doctor (Mathieu Amalric) and his brother (Rupert Friend), or in voice-over narration. It\u2019s necessary, but doesn\u2019t always ring true. At its worst, it can be as exciting as listening to people talk about drying paint.\n\n[A portrait of Vincent van Gogh as a tormented soul]\n\n\u201cAt Eternity\u2019s Gate\u201d takes its name from a canvas of an old man, made in the final months of van Gogh\u2019s life, that thrums with a foreboding of the subject\u2019s mortality. In that picture, the subject sits with his balding head bowed, his face buried in his fists, as if he can\u2019t bear to face his own demise.\n\nIn the context of the film, those three words \u2014 and the old man\u2019s inability to look at the world square on \u2014 take on another meaning. \u201cI see eternity in a flat landscape,\u201d van Gogh says. \u201cAm I the only one?\u201d Here, he isn\u2019t talking about squeamishness before death, but a feeling of being out of step with the world, at least as most people see it.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Nov. 13, one week after Election Day, dozens of environmental protesters occupied the office of Nancy Pelosi. They were there \u2014 uninvited \u2014 to demand that the Democratic speaker-in-waiting take up a progressive climate agenda once she again holds the House gavel.\n\nElsewhere on Capitol Hill that same day, however, hundreds more activists were visiting other congressional offices, asking them to address climate change but with a notably softer touch.\n\nThese activists had scheduled their meetings ahead of time. Many of them brought handwritten notes.\n\nOver 600 volunteers from a group called the Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby (CCL) came to Capitol Hill last Tuesday in a bid to unite Democrats and Republicans on an issue that has turned bitterly partisan over the past decade.\n\nThe environmental group, whose lower-profile work was unrelated to the Pelosi protest, scheduled 423 meetings last Tuesday with members of Congress or their staffs from both parties and both chambers.\n\nTheir long-term aim: To convince members to back plan to place a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and periodically cut taxpayers a check with the revenue.\n\nEventually, that is. CCL counts a conversation with a conservative lawmaker that does not veer into outright hostility as a success.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make climate a wedge, make it a bridge issue,\u201d said Don Kraus, a retiree from Asheville, N.C. and CCL volunteer.\n\nMany economists say a fee-and-dividend plan is the most effective way of reducing the buildup of planet-warming gases in the atmosphere. In recent years a handful of senior Republican statesmen, like former secretaries of state George P. Shultz and James A. Baker, have advocated for such a plan.\n\nBut activists pushing that proposal are not your typical Washington energy and environmental lobbyists.. Many of them, like Janet Petri of Northfield, Minn. are often constituents of the lawmakers they're visiting.\n\nThe activists hope the fact they're from a members' home district will aid their cause. In the past, Petri, for example, took to her congressman\u2019s office a printout with photographs of recent, record-breaking floods in her town, about 40 miles south of Minneapolis, juxtaposed with a picture of her granddaughter, Esme.\n\n\u201cThat's what everybody always says: We want a better world for our grandchildren,\u201d Petri said in the hallways of the Hart Senate Office Building, where dozens of other lobbyists-for-the-day were milling about the cavernous atrium there with blue-and-white nametags.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, CCL volunteers congregated in the cafeteria of the Rayburn House Office Building to take lunch and trade notes between meetings.\n\nSamantha Panch\u00e8vre, a Georgetown University student from San Antonio, said one staffer told her they pay more attention to handwritten letters.\n\n\u201cIt might even make it to the desk of the representative,\u201d Panchevre said while eating with her mother, Maricela, who came in from Texas to lobby. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was so much power in a handwritten constituent letter.\u201d\n\nThe CCL has been perfecting tips like that since just 25 of its volunteers started meeting with members of Congress in 2010. In the process, the organization has collected reams of data on members in an effort to find the best way to appeal to each of them.\n\nAfter every biannual \u201ccongressional education day\u201d \u2014 one in June and another in November \u2014 Daniel Richter, the organization\u2019s vice president, reads and analyzes hundreds of the volunteers\u2019 notes to see what messages work, and with whom.\n\nThe details he offers get very granular, very quickly. The effects of climate change on farmers, for example, comes up more often during Senate meetings than House meetings, Richter told CCL volunteers during a video webinar about two weeks before the November meeting.\n\n\u201cI do want to highlight: Nobody else has this information in the world,\u201d Richter claimed, referring to the small details his group's volunteers get at individual meetings.\n\nFor Republicans, the message is often about the military. The Pentagon remains one of the few parts of the federal government under President Trump seriously studying how to adapt its operations to a warmer world. It cannot plan upgrades to coastal bases, for example, without thinking about rising seas.\n\n\u201cFor conservatives, it\u2019s more relatable,\u201d said Drew Eyerly, a former U.S. Army medic from the suburbs of Augusta, Ga. who talked to the offices of defense-minded Republicans. \u201cThey want to know more about the national security implications.\u201d\n\nThe organization says its own internal data suggests Republicans have grown more receptive to the idea of putting a price on carbon. But a lot of House Republicans who previously told CCL they were serious about climate change lost their reelection bids this month. Among them are many members of the bipartisan 90-member Climate Solutions Caucus, which CCL helped organize.\n\nAt the same time, other environmental groups, which endorsed a slate of nearly all Democrats in 2018, are emboldened by the midterm election results to try to win back the Senate and White House in 2020. They don't want to compromise with Republicans.\n\nMany prominent environmentalists like Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, see the caucus as providing undue political cover to Republicans who vote in favor of building the Keystone XL pipeline or of opening 1.5 million acres of Arctic wilderness in Alaska to oil and gas drilling. Some GOP members of the caucus voted in favor of a resolution saying the sort of carbon tax CCL is pushing would be \u201cdetrimental to the United States economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have climate action in name only,\u201d Brune said at a post-election news conference. \u201cWhat we need to see is stronger action, not just a few good speeches given once a year.\u201d\n\nEven with the House flipping, CCL is sticking to its bipartisan approach. Volunteers repeating that \u201cbridge\u201d-vs.-\u201cwedge\u201d line as their mantra. They say they are realists.\n\n\u201cNow that Democrats control the House, we can have all kinds of bills proposed,\u201d said Kelli Lewis, a volunteer from Minnesota. \u201cBut if they don't have a chance of making it through the Senate, it is a waste of time.\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAYS\n\nThis booking image provided by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office in Birmingham, Ala, shows Trey Glenn, the Trump administration\u2019s top environmental official for the Southeast.(Jefferson County Sheriff via AP)\n\n\u2014 EPA regional administrator out: Trey Glenn, the Environmental Protection Agency official overseeing the Southeast, resigned after being indicted on ethics charges last week.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLUGANO, Switzerland \u2014 With four years to go before the next World Cup opens in Qatar, the small gulf country\u2019s national soccer team is on the rise but still has a long, long way to go.\n\nQatar surprisingly won the right to host the 2022 tournament eight years ago, when it was ranked 113th in the world by FIFA. On Wednesday, exactly four years before the next World Cup is scheduled to open at Lusail Stadium outside Doha, the country still will be only No. 96.\n\nThere are positives, however, including Qatar\u2019s 1-0 victory over Switzerland last week in a friendly match \u2014 an eye-opening result against a team that reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for us especially (because) a lot of people don\u2019t know us,\u201d Qatar midfielder Assim Madibo said. \u201cI think they will know us more after this game ... Now we are only focusing on playing big games so we will get respect and people will know us.\u201d\n\nRespect has been hard to come by for Qatar\u2019s national team and the country\u2019s hosting of the tournament in general. The team\u2019s ranking has fluctuated between No. 78 and No. 112 since the December 2010 vote, and concerns about labor conditions for migrant workers has been an ongoing issue.\n\nThe win over Switzerland and subsequent 2-2 draw against Iceland were good signs, though a far cry from the progress Iceland has made in the same eight years, rising from No. 110 in the FIFA rankings to No. 36 following a quarterfinal run at the 2016 European Championship.\n\nStill, the team is improving under coach Felix Sanchez, who spent a decade as a youth coach at Barcelona before becoming Qatar\u2019s ninth coach in eight years.\n\nAgainst the Swiss, the Qataris defended well and played their way out of danger rather than kicking long balls out from the back. The passing was crisp and accurate and it was from one of the frequent attempts at a breakaway that Akram Afif scored the game\u2019s only goal in the 86th minute.\n\nThey\u2019re not quite Barcelona, but they\u2019re not too bad, either.\n\n\u201cI was working there for 10 years,\u201d Sanchez said of his time at Barcelona. \u201cWhen you go to work in a different place you need to adapt your philosophy. There are many things that we tried to keep and there are games where we can show more.\n\n\u201cThere are games where we cannot do 100 percent what we have to do and of course you have the opposition in front ... we need to do more things that we\u2019re not used to do but it\u2019s the way to compete.\u201d\n\nMost of the players who traveled to Europe for the two friendlies are young and all are based in Qatar \u2014 90 percent of them having graduated from the state-of-the-art Aspire training academy. But with an average age of 24, many will be hitting their peak in 2022.\n\nQatar has also beaten Iraq, China, Palestine and Ecuador this year, but sterner competition is expected next year at both the Asian Cup and the Copa America, where the country is competing as a guest nation and could end up facing Brazil and Argentina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s steps we have to do to arrive in 2022 ready to compete,\u201d said Sanchez, who knows his players well after working with most of them on under-age teams and at Aspire.\n\n\u201cOf course, for the players it\u2019s a big motivation to play against such teams and start to feel what is the real pressure in official competition against one of the top national teams in the world like Brazil, Argentina or one of those.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sanchez seems like the perfect fit because of his years of experience in Qatar, there is no guarantee he will still have his job in four years. Especially with high-profile possibilities like Pep Guardiola and Xavi Hernandez, both with experience playing in Qatar, being mentioned as potential future candidates.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s contract as manager at Manchester City expires in 2021, while Xavi \u2014 who plays for Qatari club Al Sadd \u2014 has said he would like to someday move into coaching.\n\n\u201cOf course it will be a dream to be there but four years in football is ... you cannot say,\u201d Sanchez said, smiling wryly. \u201cHopefully.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

And just as it was reported Monday that some of those soldiers may be ordered back from the border in the coming days ahead of most migrants\u2019 arrival there, Trump escalated a separate spat that may further infuriate advocates of a politically independent military.\n\nOver the weekend, the commander in chief took aim at retired Adm. William H. McRaven \u2014 one of the military\u2019s most revered Navy SEAL and Special Operations commanders who oversaw the killing of Osama bin Laden and the capture of Saddam Hussein.\n\nDeriding him as an \u201cObama backer,\u201d Trump told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that? Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d\n\nUndeterred by the criticism that ensued after his verbal attack, Trump doubled down in several tweets Monday in which he lashed out at Pakistan, where bin Laden hid for years. \u201cOf course we should have captured Osama bin Laden long before we did,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOf course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2018\n\nBin Laden was killed in a U.S. military operation in 2011, a couple of years before another man was getting ready to claim his role as leader of the world\u2019s most feared terrorist group: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, self-declared caliph of the Islamic State. Baghdadi\u2019s death has been reported multiple times since the Islamic State\u2019s territorial retreat sped up in 2016, but audio recordings suggest that he is still alive.\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s attacks on his predecessors and U.S. military leaders over bin Laden, there is one question Trump has not publicly asked since assuming office: Where is Baghdadi, and why hasn\u2019t he been captured?\n\nSome of the most recent intelligence by U.S.-allied partners in the region suggests that any answer would involve the painstaking and years-long work that is almost always needed to track down top militant commanders such as bin Laden or Baghdadi.\n\nA senior commander with Iraq\u2019s elite U.S.-trained Counter Terrorism Service, the nation\u2019s most effective group fighting the Islamic State, said in an interview with The Washington Post last week that Baghdadi is probably suffering from injuries sustained over the past four years and is limited in his movements. The commander said Iraq\u2019s latest intelligence indicates the militant leader is moving between the sparsely populated desert regions that straddle Syria and Iraq\u2019s borders in areas that have yet to be secured by Iraqi or Syrian forces.\n\nDespite losing the territory it controlled in Iraq by December 2017, the Islamic State still maintains pockets of influence along the lengthy border with Syria and in villages inside Iraq\u2019s Sunni heartland. The group has recently mounted low-level terrorist attacks in places from which it has been evicted, such as Mosul, Ramadi and Tikrit.\n\nBoth bin Laden and Baghdadi have succeeded in erasing most of their traces. While bin Laden was involved in the day-to-day operations of his al-Qaeda group before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the subsequent U.S. focus on capturing or killing him forced him to become a more subdued and symbolic figure. Keeping a low profile, bin Laden worked on a broad strategy for the group. Baghdadi has kept an even lower profile, with only one public appearance even before a U.S.-led coalition intervened in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe intervention \u2014 which has mostly consisted of airstrikes and some U.S. ground forces operations inside Syria and Iraq \u2014 was launched under President Barack Obama and continued by Trump. While Trump has publicly pondered withdrawing ground troops, he has not followed through, heeding the advice of top military commanders.\n\nHuman rights organizations have cautioned that the U.S.-led operation, which has been celebrated in the United States as a military success, \u201ctook a horrendous toll on civilians\u201d in formerly Islamic State-controlled cities such as Raqqa in northern Syria. Although it helped local forces win back about 95 percent of territory previously held by the Islamic State, some of the group\u2019s top leaders remain at large.\n\nWith the Islamic State turning into a more guerrilla-style terrorist group, tracking the militants down may not become easier. American and allied Syrian and Iraqi forces have been slow to transition from combat to the more intensive intelligence operations needed to target the clandestine Islamic State remnants.\n\nThe last time the Islamic State claimed to have released an audio message by Baghdadi was in August, to mark the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday and to urge the group\u2019s sympathizers to keep up the fight. The Islamic State leader had been silent for almost a year before the 54-minute August address.\n\n\u201cThe scale of victory or defeat . . . is not tied to a city or village,\u201d he said in August.\n\nAmid U.S. and U.N. estimates that up to 30,000 Islamic State supporters could still be in Iraq and Syria, his message likely also applies to U.S. efforts to locate the city, village or remote stretch of land where Baghdadi may be hiding.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nBrexit could make Ireland a \u2018special friend\u2019 to the United States, Irish ambassador says\n\nChina\u2019s road to global leadership gets bumpy\n\nA top bridal magazine refused to feature gay couples.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell recently suggested that economic conditions may be \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d A new report from Goldman Sachs suggests he was on to something.\n\nThe bank is projecting economic growth will slow \u201csignificantly\u201d in the second half of 2019 as the twin jolts from tax cuts and a bump in federal spending fade while the Fed continues raising interest rates. More precisely, it expects this year\u2019s heady pace of 3 percent-plus growth will sink to 1.75 percent by the end of next year.\n\nThe picture Goldman paints isn\u2019t entirely gloomy. Indeed, the bank expects the Fed will keep hiking interest rates in part to keep a humming expansion from overheating.. The report, which Goldman sent to clients on Sunday but isn't publicly available, predicts the unemployment rate will continue to drop, falling to 3 percent by 2020, while wage growth edges up as high as 3.5 percent. And it sees no disaster lurking: \u201cThe expansion is on course to become the longest in US history next year, and even in subsequent years recession is not our base case.\u201d\n\nThat places Goldman on the sunnier side of the Wall Street consensus: More than a third of top forecasters believe the U.S. economy will enter a recession in 2020; and a new Reuters poll of economists found they think the probability of a recession in the next two years is rising, to a median 35 percent. (The Fed projects GDP will slow to 2.5 percent next year, a 2 percent in 2020, before slipping to 1.8 percent in the longer run.)\n\nSuch a slowdown could have dramatic political repercussions for the Trump administration and the broader Republican Party, which remain invested in a roaring economy offering an effective argument heading into the 2020 election. That proved a losing bet in the midterms, in which House Democrats scored their biggest midterm pickups since the post-Watergate election of 1974. More troubling for the GOP, the Democrats\u2019 performance was arguably the best in history for an out-of-power party amid such strong economic conditions. If the economy hits a skid, Republican losses in the next election could get even worse.\n\nWorkers assemble Ford trucks at a plant in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Timothy D.

But I think we will.\u201d Business investment underwhelmed in the third quarter; Goldman says it will be solid if unremarkable for the next few years.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other risks that could menace the expansion \u2014 including a misstep by monetary policymakers, as Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Partners argues:\n\nEvery #recession since 1970 was caused by the #Fed tightening monetary policy too far in response to a decline in the unemployment rate to a level below full employment.

So we'll be bringing you an abbreviated newsletter this week and be fully back up to speed following the holidays.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington. (Photo by Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nIncreased scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s activities after a New York Times investigation into the company's damage-control tactics following the 2016 election is expected to spark more calls on Capitol Hill for tighter regulation of the tech giant as well as its chief competitors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\" Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee that probed Russian influence in 2016, told me in an email. \u201c I think it took them too long to realize that. It\u2019s clear that Congress can\u2019t simply trust [Facebook] to address these issues on their own.\"\n\nLast week, Senate Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) responded to the Times piece by sending a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation into potential campaign finance violations by Facebook. Another group of Senate Democrats, also led by Klobuchar, sent a letter to the company, pressing it on the reports.\n\nThe senators slammed Facebook\u2019s relationship with the GOP firm Definers Public Affairs, which was exposed by the Times and performs opposition research on its clients' foes and then deploys the information in much the same way as a political campaign. The company severed its ties with Definers after the report.\n\n\u201cWe are gravely concerned by recent reports indicating that your company used contractors to retaliate against or spread intentionally inflammatory information about your critics,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter to Facebook.\n\nThings may only get worse for Facebook -- and other tech companies -- when Democrats take control of the House come January.\n\nThere is growing bipartisan clamor for privacy legislation that would knit together a patchwork of state rules in the wake of new and strict European privacy rules aimed at protecting consumer information known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Earlier this year, Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna (D) introduced an \"Internet Bill of Rights,\" which shares some tenets with GDPR.\n\nSo far, Washington has been hesitant to slap major regulations on the tech industry -- and there will be limits on what is likely to get done because Republicans still control the Senate. But the Times report, as well as a slew of not-so-positive press for Facebook especially, is likely to increase calls from lawmakers in both parties to do something to protect consumer privacy and to mitigate the possibility of foreign political interference on their platforms.\n\nRobert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said the recent reports about Facebook\u2019s political tactics and executive turmoil are leading to an \u201can inquisition in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a feeding frenzy that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just keeps building upon itself.\u201d.\n\nAtkinson said the question isn't if there will be privacy legislation, it's whether legislation will be \u201clight-touch\u201d or a \u201cwhole-hog draconian\u201d bill similar to the rules created by the European Union. Facebook's recent controversies could add pressure for lawmakers to lean in on tougher rules like GDPR.\n\n\u201cThis will provide some motivation for comprehensive privacy legislation,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nAttempts to rein the companies in -- such as political ad transparency legislation -- have so far stalled in Congress. Privacy regulation is expected to be a major priority for the next Congress, and Facebook's bargaining power may be hindered by the damage recent reports have dealt to its reputation in Washington.\n\nIt also remains to be seen whether the big tech companies will work together or against each other in shaping such policy.\n\nAlready, Apple chief executive Tim Cook has tried to shield his company from concerns about Silicon Valley\u2019s growing power by coming out as a strong advocate for privacy legislation. Apple's business model relies more on selling ads and less on customer data, so it can advocate for tougher privacy rules without necessarily hurting its bottom line.\n\nThe Times reported that Cook\u2019s attacks on other companies\u2019 approach to privacy enraged Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who ordered his top lieutenants to instead use Android phones. Facebook later said it does encourage its employees to use Android -- but only because it is the most popular operating system in the world.\n\nFacebook itself engaged in finger-pointing tactics, the Times found. When top tech executives appeared before lawmakers in September, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg lobbied for a Google executive of similar stature to testify along with her. When Google failed to provide a senior enough executive, lawmakers left an empty chair for a Google executive \u2014 taking some of the public-relations glare off Facebook in the process.\n\nThe infighting among companies is one of the ways the technology industry significantly diverges from other industries such as pharmaceuticals or the auto industry when it comes to lobbying, Atkinson said. Because the tech companies have such different business models, there is rarely uniformity of views. Each company works in its own interests, and to harm competitors, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re using the opportunity for legislation and regulation as a strategic weapon against their competitors,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the name of the European data protection rules. It is the General Data Protection Regulation, not Global Data Protection Regulation.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\nPolitics Ivanka Trump used a personal email account to send hundreds of emails about government business last year The discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s practices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton.

While some bars put up lights or a tree, Martin\u2019s Tavern goes all out: There are snowy scenes from Christmas villages in the front windows, festive ribbons wrapped around dining room columns and, behind the bar, stockings amid fake pine branches and white lights and red velvet bows. (Everything that stands still, including the mounted fish on the wall, eventually gets decorated.) Paired with something warm and soothing \u2014 a bowl of French onion soup or the rich and cheesy Welsh rarebit \u2014 it\u2019s the perfect seasonal destination.

Since 2011, Pizzeria Paradiso has hosted a fundraiser for local charity Martha\u2019s Table called Give a Can, Get a Can. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: Bring a canned good that\u2019s on the organization\u2019s wishlist, such as pasta sauce or low-sodium vegetables, and you can trade it to a bartender for a can of selected craft beer. Bring two cans of food, and you\u2019ll get two cans of beer. Helping others never tasted so good.

(John Minchillo/AP)\n\nThis November\u2019s elections set a voter turnout record: 49 percent of the voter-eligible population showed up at the polls, the highest midterm turnout seen since 1914. Why?\n\nMost commentators have concluded it was because voters thought the stakes were sky-high. With congressional control in the balance at a time when politics is highly polarized, many Democrats and Republicans thought the outcome was all but life-or-death for democracy. Pre-election polls found that about two-thirds of Americans believed this election was the most important midterm in their lifetimes; 93 percent of voters in battleground districts said their vote mattered just as much as in a presidential election; and enthusiasm about voting was at its highest level in any midterm in more than two decades.\n\nThat interpretation is consistent with the findings in our new book, \u201cWhy Bother? Rethinking Participation in Elections and Protests,\u201d due out in January. Although political scientists have often emphasized that many people do not turn out because of the \u201ccosts\u201d of voting (time, effort and so forth), we focus on the costs that people pay by not voting \u2014 especially when they believe much is at stake. Seen through that lens, the high turnout this year is hardly surprising.\n\nWe find that while voting is indeed costly, abstaining can impose costs as well. Many people suffer subjective and psychological costs if they don\u2019t vote, which we call costs of abstention. These costs are in the form of a psychic tension, or dissonance, when people fail (or think they\u2019ll fail) to take part \u2014 but that\u2019s true only when they care a lot about the outcome. When they care a lot and also see the race as close, these moods intensify, pushing them still more strongly to go to the polls. This same logic applies to other forms of collective political participation, like protesting, as we found in major protests in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nTo understand how costs of abstention influence voting, we conducted a series of experiments. One was with 1,020 U.S. citizens recruited through Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk platform in spring 2016. We randomly assigned participants into four groups. Participants in each group read one of four hypothetical gubernatorial election scenarios.\n\nTwo of the scenarios\u2019 introductions illustrated how the governor can significantly affect our daily lives. These two explained a governor\u2019s powerful capacities and asked respondents to imagine having a clear preference for one candidate over the other, without mentioning any other characteristics. The other two scenarios didn\u2019t mention governors\u2019 functions and asked respondents to imagine that both candidates would do an equally good job in office.\n\n[The blue wave was big \u2014 and significant \u2014 in state legislatures]\n\nIn each of those four scenarios, we gave respondents a different idea of how close the result would be. In two, we told them that reliable polls indicated that the race was very close; in the other two, it was pretty clear which candidate was going to win.\n\nThen we then asked them, on a scale of 1 to 5 \u2014 in which 1 indicates little emotion and 5, intense emotion \u2014 how they would feel if they knew they would not vote in that election. Participants reported significantly more distress, upset and guilt when considering not voting in an important election than in an unimportant one. On average, they reported 0.4-points, or about 20 percent, higher levels of distress and upset. This was amplified when the election outcome was supposed to be close. Respondents were also more likely to state that they were going to vote when the election was important, regardless of whether the result was expected to be close or lopsided. Close elections boosted turnout, but only when the election was also depicted as important.\n\n[Eight white-majority districts elected black members of Congress this year. That\u2019s a breakthrough.]\n\nWe also looked at surveys with \u201cverified\u201d turnout \u2014 the researchers checked respondents\u2019 claims to have voted or abstained against public voting records. In the wake of the \u201ccredit crunch\u201d in the United Kingdom, for example, Britons who reported being angry about the economy during the 2010 general elections voted in greater numbers, even after accounting for an array of known boosts to turnout \u2014 being highly educated or married or a union member, for example. Anger increased turnout especially among those who saw the economy as the most pressing problem facing the country.\n\nBelieving there\u2019s a duty to vote kicks in when someone thinks an election is especially important\n\nDecades ago, political scientists noticed that many people feel a duty to vote, and those who do are more likely to turn out. Scholars saw this as a stable trait that people pick up from their families or in school. This helps explain why people vote at all, despite the costs and inconvenience. But duty as a personal conviction doesn\u2019t explain why turnout is higher in some elections than others.\n\nThe answer is that when someone thinks an election is extremely important, that sense of duty kicks in more forcefully \u2014 and they\u2019re more likely to vote. In another experiment conducted ahead of 2014 U.S. gubernatorial elections, we recruited 504 U.S. citizens again through the Mechanical Turk, and manipulated respondents\u2019 perception of the importance of the upcoming election (again by reminding them the powerful capacities of the governor) and the salience of a duty to vote.\n\nSubjects who were primed to see the election as important felt a heightened sense of civic duty, even though the treatment said nothing about duty. Only the subjects who were primed to see the election as high stakes were more likely to vote than those in the control group. These results suggest that the duty to vote, in fact, is one component of costs of abstention.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nAlthough this month\u2019s elections saw record-high spending, that is almost surely not the reason turnout was so high. Consider the fact that though presidential campaigns spend the vast majority of time and money in battleground states and ignore safe ones, the difference in turnout between battlegrounds and safe states is surprisingly small \u2014 usually a few percentage points.\n\nRather, turnout in presidential elections likely surges because most people see those contests as crucial \u2014 high stakes \u2014 for the country. That gets them to the polls. Unusually, that\u2019s how many citizens felt this year. For many people staying home this year would have been too psychologically costly.\n\nErdem Ayta\u00e7 is assistant professor of political science at Ko\u00e7 University in Istanbul.\n\nSusan Stokes is Blake Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago, director of the Chicago Center on Democracy, and a co-founder of Bright Line Watch."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Global stocks slide as futures point to Wall Street drop", "description": "World stocks are down and Wall Street is expected to drop again amid concerns about the tech sector.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/global-stocks-slide-as-futures-point-to-wall-street-drop/2018/11/20/221e6f84-ecc2-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T12:45:18Z", "content": "BEIJING World stocks slid Tuesday and Wall Street was expected to drop again amid concerns about the tech sector dragged down U.S. indexes the day before.

(Richard Drew, File/Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks dropped again Tuesday as losses mounted for the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Retailers also fell, and energy companies plunged with oil prices as the market sank back into the red for the year.\n\nOil prices tumbled another 6.6 percent as Wall Street reacted to rising oil supplies and concerns that global economic growth will slow down, a worry that\u2019s intensified because of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. U.S. crude has plunged 30 percent since early October.\n\nTechnology companies were hit after the Trump administration proposed new national security regulations that could limit exports of high-tech products in fields such as quantum computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nRetailers also skidded. Target\u2019s profit disappointed investors as it spends more money to revamp its stores and its website, while Ross Stores, TJX and Kohl\u2019s also fell on disappointing forecasts.\n\nThe S&P 500 index lost 48.84 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,641.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 551.80 points, or 2.2 percent, to 24,465.64.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 119.65 points, or 1.7 percent, to 6,908.82. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed 27.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,469.01.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 3.7 percent in the last two days, and the S&P 500 is off 3.4 percent. The Nasdaq, heavily populated with technology stocks, is off 4.7 percent. The S&P 500 index has fallen 9.9 percent from the record high it set exactly two months ago.\n\nInvestors are measuring a number of headwinds and increasingly playing it safe. The global economy is showing signs of weakening, with the United States, China and Europe all facing the rising threat of a slowdown, which can hurt demand for commodities such as oil and pose a threat to company profits. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China appear to be getting worse instead of improving, contributing to the sell-off in tech stocks and multinational industrial companies.\n\nFor much of this year, investors were hopeful the U.S. and China would easily resolve their differences on trade. That hope has faded in the last two months. Later this month U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are expected to meet at a gathering of the Group of 20 major economies, and for investors, the newly proposed limits on tech exports were one more hint the leaders probably won\u2019t reach a deal.\n\n\u201cA resolution doesn\u2019t seem to be coming in the short term,\u201d said Katie Nixon, the chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. \u201cA lot of the companies that are front and center (like) Alphabet, Apple, IBM ... could be significantly limited in the way they export their technology.\u201d\n\nApple fell 4.8 percent to $176.98 and is down 23.7 percent from the peak it reached October 3, though it\u2019s still up almost 5 percent this year. Microsoft lost 2.8 percent to $101.71 and IBM fell 2.6 percent to $117.20.\n\nAs the tech giants swoon, investors have lately turned to safer bets such as utilities, real estate companies and makers of household goods. They\u2019ve also sought the safety of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nThe price of oil has been falling sharply in recent weeks and is now down 30 percent since October 3.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other countries started producing more oil earlier this year after the Trump administration announced renewed sanctions on Iran, Nixon noted. The administration then granted waivers to several countries allowing them to continue importing Iranian oil, creating a supply glut that pushed prices dramatically lower.\n\nNixon said OPEC countries will probably cut back on oil production, but some investors are worried that the buildup in crude stockpiles is a sign the global economy isn\u2019t doing as well as expected.\n\nEarnings from retailers didn\u2019t help investors\u2019 mood. Target plunged skidded 10.5 percent to $69.03 after reporting earnings that missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates due to higher expenses. Ross Stores, TJX and Kohl\u2019s also fell on disappointing forecasts.\n\nTech stocks were among the biggest losers in Europe, too. Nokia and Ericsson, two top suppliers of telecom networks, each fell about 3 percent.

There was just one catch: His team scored 51 points and lost. (Kelvin Kuo/Associated Press)\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams, Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints are taking the NFL kicking and screaming into the future, a bright, shiny, giddy place in which defense is an afterthought, 1,000 yards of offense is routine and it\u2019s just a matter of time, really, until a quarterback\u2019s arm falls off on the field.\n\nTwo of those teams, the Chiefs and Rams, met in a wildly entertaining \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game and, honestly, we wish it had never ended. With 1,001 yards total offense and 105 points, what\u2019s not to love in a game in which viewers took bathroom breaks at their own peril? Well, Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs\u2019 quarterback, wasn\u2019t too pleased despite throwing for 478 yards and six touchdowns. That\u2019s because he also had five \u2014 five! \u2014 turnovers that, he admitted, \u201cjust changed the game.\u201d Five turnovers will do that. Just ask Jay Cutler.\n\n\u201cI think I gave them 21 points, pretty much, through turnovers,\u201d he told reporters after the Chiefs\u2019 second loss of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just like at the New England game [the other loss], you can\u2019t give good teams points turning the ball over.\u201d\n\n[Analysis: Rams-Chiefs was the 'new NFL' in its most spectacular form yet]\n\nMahomes, who admitted \u201cit sucks right now,\u201d was on the other side of one of these games in college, when his Texas Tech team lost to Oklahoma and Baker Mayfield in a 66-59 thriller. \u201cSomeone asked me that earlier,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really, for the most part. I mean if I don\u2019t give them the 21 points the score isn\u2019t as high probably either way. So just little mistakes that I made is just stuff you can\u2019t do.\u201d On Monday night, the game book shows that he lost two fumbles, was intercepted three times and sacked three times.\n\nDespite that, the Chiefs had a chance with 50 seconds left. And Mahomes was intercepted by Lamarcus Joyner with 13 seconds left.\n\n\u201cListen, he\u2019s made enough of these that you have full trust in him doing it,\u201d Chiefs Coach Andy Reid told reporters. \u201cBut again, he\u2019ll learn from that. Take a peek at it. We\u2019ll study it. And see what he could\u2019ve done better. The great thing about Patrick is that\u2019s what he does. He\u2019ll check every play out and evaluate it.\u201d\n\nStill, don\u2019t lose track of Mahomes\u2019s accomplishments. He has twice passed for six touchdowns in his first 12 career games and the NFL\u2019s Media Research Department points out that, since 1950, only Ben Roethlisberger in 2014 and Y.A. Tittle in 1962 have had two games with six or more touchdown passes in a single season. Mahomes is, however, only 23 and maybe that showed a little at the end. Rams linebacker Dante Fowler said Mahomes\u2019s study of the game will show that he \u201cwas a little rattled\u201d especially over the final five minutes as the teams went wild in the fourth quarter, scoring 35 points.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in situations like that, him being, I\u2019ll say a rookie [in his first full year as the starter], in his first year in situations like that it\u2019s kind of hard. We put the pressure on him and we did a good job.\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say that the game, like the NFL, was totally devoid of defense. The Rams' Aaron Donald was stellar again, as Mahomes found out.\n\nAaron Donald this season, with a quarter remaining in Week 11:\n\n\n\n\u2022 14.5 sacks (Most in NFL)\n\n\u2022 28 QB hits (Most in NFL)\n\n\u2022 16 tackles for loss (Most in NFL)#Rams @RamsNFL @AaronDonald97 \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) November 20, 2018\n\n\u201cA whole bunch of track stars on their team,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cBut we were able to hold them down and get stop them and get to the quarterback. I feel like that was a big thing. AD [Aaron Donald] got two sack-fumbles and we got two touchdowns on defense. Those things matter the most.

(Darko Bandic, file/Associated Press)\n\nROME \u2014 Italian prosecutors have ordered the seizure of a migrant rescue ship and accused the aid group Doctors Without Borders of illegally disposing of 24 metric tons (26.5 tons) of medical and contaminated waste accumulated during nearly 50 rescues.\n\nProsecutors in Catania, Sicily said Tuesday that 24 people were under investigation, including the aid group\u2019s Italy personnel and the crew of the Aquarius. Prosecutors accused them of working with a Sicily-based shipping company to mix medical and \u201ccontaminated\u201d waste, like migrants\u2019 clothing, with other garbage to save money.\n\nProsecutors ordered the sequester of the Aquarius, which is currently moored in Marseille, France, as well as the seizure of 460,000 euros ($526,000), which prosecutors said was the amount saved by the group by not properly disposing of the material.\n\nDoctors Without Borders called the accusation \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and another attempt to criminalize migrant rescues. The group, known by its French acronym MSF, said its waste disposal followed all approved \u201cstandard procedures.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, however, MSF allowed that there may have been lapses, especially among port authorities with whom MSF worked, acknowledging prosecutor video showing latex gloves and what appeared to be a syringe mixed in with regular garbage.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to clarify the facts and respond about the procedures we followed, but we strongly reaffirm the legitimacy and the legality of our humanitarian activities,\u201d said MSF Italia\u2019s director general, Gabriele Eminente.\n\nAt a news conference, MSF officials expressed shock at the prosecutors\u2019 claim that migrants\u2019 clothing alone could spread infectious disease, saying it showed ignorance about public health and was more an attempt to tarnish MSF\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Aquarius, a 77-meter (252.62-foot) -long former fishery protection vessel, is perhaps best known for having become a pawn in the European battle over migration in June after Italy\u2019s new populist government refused to let it dock in an Italian port.\n\nAfter a weeklong standoff at sea that returned the migration debate to the world stage, Spain agreed to let the Aquarius dock with its 630 migrants who, along with tens of thousands of other migrants before them, had set off from Libya aboard smugglers boats.\n\nThe same Sicily prosecutors\u2019 office behind the new investigation made headlines in 2017 when it publicly accused rescue groups of aiding illegal migration by being in contact with Libyan-based human traffickers as they plucked migrants from the sea off Libya\u2019s coast. To date, the investigation hasn\u2019t produced any indictments.\n\nIn the new probe, dubbed \u201cOperation Borderless,\u201d prosecutors alleged that between Jan. 1, 2017, and May 2018, MSF and the Sicily-based Mediterranean Shipping Agency knowingly avoided the \u201crigid treatment\u201d required for \u201cdangerous waste,\u201d including food containers and medical equipment used on board the ship to treat sick migrants.\n\nProsecutors produced documentation filled out by the suspects that certified that no medical waste or contagious or infections substances were being thrown away. Prosecutors also provided wiretaps of communications between MSF personnel and the shipping agency about how to classify the material.\n\nA statement from prosecutors noted cases of scabies, HIV, tuberculosis and meningitis among newly arrived migrants and said their \u201ccontaminated clothing\u201d risked spreading infection.\n\nThey accused the suspects of \u201corganized activity trafficking in illegal waste.\u201d\n\nAnother aid group that works with MSF aboard the Aquarius, SOS Mediterranee, denounced the ship\u2019s sequester as a \u201cpolitically driven attack\u201d and urged French authorities to \u201cshow restraint\u201d as they weigh the seizure order from Italian prosecutors.\n\nItaly\u2019s hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who drove the June crackdown on the Aquarius and other aid groups, praised the Catania prosecutors for the new investigation, which also involved another rescue ship the Vos Prudence.\n\n\u201cI did the right thing by blocking the NGO ships, for not only stopping the traffic of clandestine migrants but also, apparently, the traffic in toxic waste,\u201d he tweeted with the hashtag #portsclosed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He laid a wreath at a monument to a Philippine nationalist martyr before signing dozens of agreements, including a significant oil and gas exploration deal in the contested South China Sea.\n\nXi\u2019s visit to the Philippines \u2014 once an unshakable U.S. ally with deep historical and cultural ties to the United States \u2014 encapsulates how Southeast Asia and the Pacific have become ground zero in the accelerating contest for global influence between Beijing and Washington.\n\n\u201cChina and the Philippines are close neighbors with a thousand-year history of exchange, good-neighborliness, friendship,\u201d Xi said at the opening of bilateral meetings Tuesday, \u201cand cooperation is our only correct choice.\u201d\n\n\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, center back, and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte wave to the news media after a welcome ceremony at the Malacanang Palace in Manila on Nov. 20. (Bullit Marquez/AP)\n\nThe stakes are high in Manila, where Xi is seeking this week to win over President Rodrigo Duterte with generous investments while having to contend with a Philippine military that remains close to the United States and eager to nurture relations with Washington.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines is potentially Xi\u2019s crown jewel in his foreign policy balance sheet,\u201d said Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based defense and security analyst. \u201cNo other Chinese president has come this close to eradicating the Philippines from the U.S. sphere of influence, in terms of optics.\u201d Heydarian described the Southeast Asian country as a crucial \u201cswing state\u201d in Asian geopolitics.\n\nWhen Xi and Duterte announced a deal Tuesday that will pave the way for joint exploration for oil and gas in the South China Sea, it represented the culmination of a turnaround for two countries that were locked in bitter territorial disputes for years before Duterte took power in 2016.\n\nThe Philippine strongman first visited Beijing that year, stunning the world by turning his ire toward the United States and promising to find in Xi a new, steady partner who could provide billions of dollars in investments. He has doubled down on that rhetoric, promising to shelve a landmark ruling on the South China Sea between the two countries that negates China\u2019s historical claims to the waters.\n\nOn the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Singapore, he accused the United States of stoking tensions with ongoing war games and naval drills in the waters of Southeast Asia. The U.S. Navy conducted drills last week in the Philippine Sea, in international waters east of the Philippines.\n\nChina is \u201calready in possession\u201d of the contested South China Sea waters, Duterte told reporters. \u201cChina is there. That\u2019s a reality, and America and everybody should realize that they are there.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte, second left, welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping during a guest book signing at the Malacanang Palace on Nov. 20. (Mark R. Cristino/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe trade-off, Duterte hopes, will be cash. Of the more than two dozen agreements signed between the two countries Tuesday, many related to infrastructure, including in Davao City, where Duterte was mayor before becoming president.\n\nMany Philippine officials say they have no choice but to take Chinese investment. They are puzzled by why so few countries \u2014 including, crucially, the United States \u2014 have been willing to help in the way that China has in a country that badly needs infrastructure improvements.\n\nThere has been Chinese, Japanese and Indian investment in airports, subways and the telecommunications sector. But Philippine Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that American bidders have not come forward.\n\n\u201cSo maybe they have no interest. If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf they want to look inward, that\u2019s their sovereign right.\u201d\n\nThe Philippines\u2019 sense of being left out pointed to a basic dilemma for the Trump administration: how to square its \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine with its effort to keep allies in its orbit \u2014 and out of China\u2019s.\n\nAlthough Xi unveiled his Belt and Road Initiative roughly five years ago to disburse as much as $1 trillion in Chinese funding across Eurasia, Washington has begun to take notice only recently and make countermoves in the past few months.\n\n\n\nSchoolchildren wave Chinese and Philippine flags along the route of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s convoy at the Malacanang Palace grounds in Manila on Nov. 20. (Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs Pence and U.S. envoys swept through Asia this month, U.S. officials said they talked up what the Trump administration is pitching as a possible alternative to Chinese investment: a new federal agency created last month under the Build Act that could disburse $60 billion in infrastructure investments to developing countries.\n\nAlthough the dollar amount may be dwarfed by Chinese initiatives, the new program offers \u201ctransparency and built-in tools to counter against corruption and make sure no countries are saddled with debt,\u201d said W. Patrick Murphy, the top U.S. diplomat for the East Asia and Pacific region. \u201cThis is not a policy about China or trying to contain China, but there are elements in our approach that offer alternative ways for countries to meet their infrastructure needs.\u201d\n\nAnd mere weeks after he outlined U.S. grievances toward Beijing in a significant speech in Washington, Pence again delivered a blistering attack on China last week as he told Asian audiences that the United States provided a \u201cbetter option.\u201d He unveiled initiatives including a $1.7 billion utility grid for Papua New Guinea, the poorest country in the region.\n\n\u201cIf Pence\u2019s speech at the Hudson Institute was a starting gun in a new phase of realpolitik, then the Asia summits were confirmation that this is the new normal for the U.S.: There\u2019s going to be a well-organized attempt to push back on China,\u201d said Nick Bisley of La Trobe University in Australia.\n\nSo far, it is unclear whether countries have fully bought into China\u2019s largesse, even if it far surpasses U.S. offers. Several Asian governments newly taking power, in countries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, have questioned murky deals that previous governments struck with China\n\nThe latest backlash came from the Maldives, an island archipelago off the west coast of India known for its idyllic beaches. The country\u2019s new president took office Saturday and said that state finances had been \u201clooted\u201d by the previous administration, which oversaw an expansion of ties with China in the form of major debt-funded infrastructure projects.\n\n\n\nSecurity personnel line up as protesters march and chant anti-China slogans Nov. 20 in Manila\u2019s business district of Makati.

(Henry Griffin/AP)\n\nLet\u2019s talk turkey.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump granted pardons to two turkeys -- Peas and Carrots -- in the White House Rose Garden during an annual ceremony. Just how the Thanksgiving tradition of presidents pardoning poultry began is still a matter of debate.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln is credited as being the first to free a turkey after it was sent to the White House in late 1863. Lincoln\u2019s young son Tad named the turkey Jack, adopted it as a pet and begged his father to spare the bird. Lincoln did, but Jack was intended as a Christmas turkey, not a Thanksgiving one.\n\nHorace Vose, a poultry farmer in Rhode Island, began the tradition of giving presidents Thanksgiving turkeys in 1873 when he sent a 38-pound gobbler to President Ulysses S. Grant. Vose, known as the Turkey King, continued to send prize Thanksgiving turkeys to presidents through Woodrow Wilson in 1913.\n\n[Five myths about turkeys]\n\nThe only hitch came in 1904 when the Boston Herald reported that President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s children had chased the gift turkey \u201call over the White House grounds, plucking at it and teasing it, and yelling and laughing, until the bird was well nigh exhausted, while the President looked on and laughed.\u201d Roosevelt\u2019s secretary, William S. Loeb Jr., fired back that the story was fake because the Vose turkey was delivered dead, dressed and ready to be roasted for Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAfter Vose died in late 1913, others rushed to gobble up the turkey publicity. In 1922, the girls\u2019 club of Morris & Co., a Chicago meat packing company, for the third straight year sent a dressed turkey, named Supreme III, to President Warren G. Harding. Carrying this turkey was a General Motors truck that set a record for truck travel going nonstop from Chicago to the White House in 37 hours and 34 minutes.\n\n\n\nFirst lady Grace Coolidge holding a pet raccoon, Rebecca.\n\nAfter Harding died in office in August 1923, President Calvin Coolidge tried to discourage the turkey-giving that Thanksgiving, saying he would buy his own bird. But in later years Coolidge gave in after the White House was flooded with Thanksgiving offerings of everything from turkeys and ducks to deer and even a live raccoon. Coolidge opted for turkey and kept the raccoon as a pet named Rebecca.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman often is wrongly credited with being the first president to pardon a Thanksgiving turkey in 1947. Actually he was the first to receive a live turkey from the National Turkey Federation, an industry group that has presented the presidential bird ever since. Truman didn\u2019t pardon the \u201cNational Turkey\u201d; he ate it. As did presidents through Lyndon B. Johnson, except for John F. Kennedy.\n\nAt a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Nov. 19, 1963, Kennedy received a 55-pound live turkey with a sign around its neck reading: \u201cGood Eating, Mr. President!\u201d But JFK said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just let this one grow.\u201d He never said the bird was pardoned, though some newspaper reports did. Kennedy was assassinated three days later in Dallas.\n\nPresident Richard M. Nixon began the practice of freeing the presidential turkey to petting farms. Nixon also didn\u2019t mention the word pardon. That word was used later by his successor, President Gerald R. Ford, when he pardoned Nixon after Nixon resigned in 1974 during the Watergate scandal.\n\nPresidents have continued to send the Thanksgiving turkeys to various petting farms, including those at Frying Pan Farm in Reston, Va.; Disneyland; and Mount Vernon. Most of the freed turkeys are so fattened for eating that they die a year or so after being freed.\n\n\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy with the 40-pound turkey presented to him Nov. 19, 1963, at the White House. Attending the ceremony, from left: Mildred Smith of Ellicott City, Md., wife of turkey farmer Morris G. Smith; Robert M. McPherrin of Sunnymead, Calif., president of the National Turkey Federation; and Sen. Everett Dirksen (R-Ill.). (Harvey Georges/AP)\n\nRonald Reagan was the first president to use the word \u201cpardon\u201d at the annual turkey presentation. But he was joking after reporters asked whether he planned to pardon aides Oliver North and Robert Poindexter, who were involved in the Iran-contra scandal. Reagan gestured at Charlie the turkey and quipped, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll pardon him.\u201d\n\nIt was President George H.W. Bush who officially started the turkey pardoning in 1989. As animal rights protesters shouted from behind the White House fence, Bush declared: \u201cLet me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone\u2019s dinner table, not this guy \u2014 he\u2019s granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\u201d\n\nA tradition was born.\n\nThe turkey pardon is an annual photo op for presidents and the turkey industry. Actually, presidents pardon two turkeys because, as with the Miss America beauty pageant, a runner-up is picked in case the winner can\u2019t perform its duties. President Barack Obama made lots of jokes not only about the turkeys but also about the ceremony itself. \u201cIn the office of the presidency,\u201d he said in 2013, \u201cthe most powerful position in the world brings many awesome and solemn responsibilities \u2014 this is not one of them.\u201d PETA has called the presidential pardoning a \u201csorely outdated event\u201d that \u201cmakes light of the mass slaughter of some 45 million gentle, intelligent birds.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump picked up the tradition with gusto last year, pardoning Drumstick and Wishbone. This year\u2019s chosen turkeys, which come from South Dakota, were picked from \u201cthe Presidential Flock\u201d of turkeys that were acclimated from a young age to \u201csounds of a crowd\u201d and \u201cbright camera lights,\u201d the Turkey Federation says.\n\nUpon arrival in Washington, Peas and Carrots were put up at the Willard InterContinental Hotel. They now will live out their short lives at Gobbler\u2019s Rest at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va.\n\nIt could be worse. By then many of their feathered friends back in South Dakota will have become turkey sandwiches.\n\nRonald G.

And so she dragooned the young, well-tressed Disney women, representing eight decades of animated studio history, to quiz the new kid by asking her whether she meets any of the criteria of a stock Disney princess, such as being the victim of a poisoning or doomed parentage.\n\nBut then came the true twist: Vanellope\u2019s story detour not only got a green light, but the princesses\u2019 meta-meetup also became one of the film\u2019s best scenes. Despite the long history of Disney-princess parodies, memes and YouTube spoofage by outsider comedians at the gate, the Magic Kingdom itself has just topped \u2018em all. As Cinder-satire goes, it\u2019s game over \u2014 winner, Team \u201cRalph.\u201d\n\nAll because Ribon, the writer, performer and comic-book writer (\u201cMy Boyfriend Is a Bear\u201d) with the peripatetic upbringing \u2014 her many childhood homes included a stint in Germantown, Md. \u2014 adored the Internet-hopping Vanellope enough that she believed the big-hearted girl was worthy of being coronated as Disney royalty.\n\nEarly on in the making of \u201cMoana,\u201d Ribon tells The Washington Post\u2019s Comic Riffs, the writers were wondering about their island heroine: \u201cWill she be a princess? What does that mean?\u201d\n\nThat conversation carried over to the early story stages of the \u201cRalph\u201d sequel. \u201cI thought: \u2018Gosh, why isn't Vanellope canon?\u2019 \u201c Ribon says. \u201cTo me, she's my kind of princess \u2014 in a hoodie.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first we were joking about Vanellope photobombing the [seven] dwarfs,\u201d Ribon says. That brainstorming evolved into having Vanellope \u2014 who goes AWOL from her Sugar Rush game \u2014 come upon the Oh My Disney area of the Internet.\n\n\u201cWhat if they\u2019re trying to determine whether or not she\u2019s canon \u2014 whatever that thing [is] that they decide at Disneyland that allows some of them to get their coronation,\u201d Ribon says of having the princesses grill Vanellope on her potentially royal r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cAnd so I took it from there.\u201d\n\nBut while executing her idea, Ribon says, she began to have a \u201ctrue panic attack,\u201d so she contacted a friend \u2014 a walking Wikipedia of Disney facts \u2014 and told her: \u201cI have all these tropes and I just want to make sure I have the right princesses. Which ones were kidnapped? Which ones have daddy issues?\n\n\u201cShe was like: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhat Ribon was doing was steering into a type of scene she has long gravitated toward. Nearly two decades ago, she put together a stage show based on actress Anne Heche\u2019s soul-baring 2001 memoir \u2014 as more than a dozen performers read from parts of the book.\n\n\u201cI realize what a direct line there is from the Anne Heche monologue show to the princess scene,\u201d says Ribon, who studied drama at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cI did that show because I wanted my female friends to have a showcase, and when I read [her] book, I kept hearing their voices in my head and I thought: \u2018I think these are monologues for you guys to audition with.\u2019 And then that became the stage show.\u201d\n\nFor \u201cRalph\u2019s\u201d princess-lounge hangout, Ribon began to hear the voices of many of the actresses who originated the roles. So the film brought in many of them to reprise their characters, including Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Mandy Moore from \u201cTangled\u201d and Kelly Macdonald from \u201cBrave.\u201d\n\nFinally, with almost no expectations, she ran the idea past the directors, Rich Moore and Phil Johnston (\u201cZootopia\u201d), and producers, all the while thinking: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let me do this Ariel joke.\u201d\n\nInstead came Moore\u2019s encouraging response. \u201cThe idea of satirizing Disney,\u201d he tells The Post, \u201cis the greatest gift we have been given.\u201d\n\nPlus, Johnston says, they reasoned that because the film\u2019s setting is \u201cthe Internet, you can do anything \u2014 you can go anywhere. So why can\u2019t Vanellope show up at a website where there are the Disney princesses?\u201d\n\nAs the princess encounter evolved, the writers played off the fact that not only do Disney princesses often get kidnapped, but that they are forever gazing into \u201cimportant waters.\u201d (In their attention to detail, one princess fan at the studio noted to Ribon that Mulan does not look into a puddle, but rather a horse trough. Robin\u2019s enthusiastic response: \u201cEven better!\u201d) The scene also skewers the reliance on a lumbering hunk to solve a damsel\u2019s thorny problem.\n\nRibon recorded all the princess scratch tracks (the placeholder recordings of voices used during development) so the filmmakers could hear how the full scene would play out.\n\nThe producers secured other past princess vocal actors, including Irene Bedard (\u201cPocahontas\u201d), Jodi Benson (\u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d), Auli\u2019i Cravalho (\u201cMoana\u201d), Paige O\u2019Hara (\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d), Linda Larkin (\u201cAladdin\u201d), Anika Noni Rose (\u201cThe Princess and the Frog\u201d) and Ming-Na Wen (\u201cMulan\u201d) \u2014 and Ribon remained as the voice of Snow White. (Adriana Caselotti, who voiced the title princess in 1937\u2019s \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d died in 1997.)\n\nAnd all the actresses, Ribon says, clearly relished lampooning their characters with affectionate respect, the filmmakers say \u2014 including how the princesses let their hair down and speak with heightened awareness about their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when I make fun of my dad,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cYes, I can do that \u2014 I love my dad and I love his foibles.

(Nic Bothma/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nInternational election observers aim to detect and deter electoral fraud \u2014 and build public confidence in the election process. This makes credibility a valuable commodity and explains why international observers take pains to present themselves as objective and impartial actors.\n\nThe importance of observer credibility was on display in the wake of Cameroon\u2019s Oct. 7 presidential election. After the election, state-owned Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) broadcast interviews with individuals it described as observers from Transparency International. Despite the fact that many citizens had been too scared to vote, these \u201cobservers\u201d declared the election had been \u201cextremely good.\u201d\n\nBut Transparency International, a nongovernmental organization that campaigns against corruption, swiftly pointed out it had not, in fact, sent an observation mission to Cameroon. The group concluded this was \u201ca deliberate attempt to impersonate Transparency International,\u201d apparently an attempt to exploit the corruption watchdog\u2019s credibility to bolster the legitimacy of the election result.\n\n[Cameroon\u2019s election still isn\u2019t decided. What happens next?]\n\n\u201cEveryone says\u2026\u201d \u2014 and sometimes they\u2019re right\n\nFor election observers working in Africa, maintaining credibility has become increasingly difficult, and not just because of stories like this. According to leading scholars of African elections, many people believe that international observers \u201cpull their punches\u201d in the region, tolerating levels of fraud that would be called out elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. In late 2017, international election observers cautiously endorsed Kenya\u2019s contentious election, but the country\u2019s Supreme Court then invalidated the presidential poll on the basis that it had not been sufficiently transparent or verifiable. This led experts to call for the reform of international election observation. Disillusioned Kenyan voters tweeted at John Kerry, former U.S. secretary of state and leader of the Carter Center observation mission, telling him not to bother coming back for the next election.\n\nDo international observers apply lower standards in Africa?\n\nAnecdotal evidence of observers accepting low-quality elections in Africa is easy to find. Yet systematic, empirical evidence has been absent \u2014 until now. My research shows that a double standard does exist: Western election observers are less likely to allege that significant fraud has occurred in an election in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with an election of the same quality held elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s how I did my research: I completed a statistical analysis of all national elections observed by Western election observers (that is, those from Western countries \u2014 identified by Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development membership \u2014 or Western international organizations) between 1991 and 2012. No election is perfect, so in my analysis of more than 600 elections in 138 countries, I focused on allegations of major electoral fraud rather than minor irregularities. I also looked specifically at allegations made by Western election observers (not, for example, opposition parties). Why? Because if anyone is applying a \u201cdouble standard,\u201d it is them.\n\n[Even after Mugabe, Zimbabwe\u2019s elections do not appear free or fair]\n\nMy results show that a regional double standard exists, one that is surprisingly difficult to explain. The double standard persists even considering other factors already known to bias the behavior of international observers, such as the tendency to tolerate a flawed election if it was better than the last one. An added concern is that this willingness to overlook election irregularities continues in recent years \u2014 despite high-profile efforts to improve the quality of election observation in this period.\n\nWhat could help improve election observation?\n\nMy analysis showed that one predictor of whether Western election observers will make an allegation of fraud in a given election is whether they made such an allegation at the last election. In short, precedent matters. Having failed to call out fraud in African elections in the past, Western observers seem less likely to do so in the future. This suggests that international observers could monitor their practices to avoid developing a habitual response to elections in a given country, accepting a lower standard simply because that was the case in earlier elections.\n\nThere are trade-offs to consider \u2014 international election observers may feel their approval can mitigate the short-term risk of election violence, even if it costs them in terms of credibility. Observers aren\u2019t necessarily wrong to fear that critical statements might trigger violence. They may, however, be operating under the mistaken assumption that this risk is much greater in Africa than elsewhere. African elections are commonly portrayed as violent events, a tendency satirized by the Tanzanian cartoonist Gado. Yet on the whole, Africa is becoming more peaceful, and electoral violence \u2014 while real \u2014 is not a uniquely African problem.\n\nElectoral violence clearly remains a fraught issue for observers of African elections. In the wake of Zimbabwe\u2019s elections in July of this year, international observers were put in a difficult spot. There was a clear risk that electoral violence would escalate, but there were also doubts about the fairness of the election. International observers appeared to focus primarily on the risk of violence in the days immediately after the election, issuing a joint statement that called for calm. They may well have made the right call, but there was a price to be paid \u2014 in credibility \u2014 despite final observation reports from some observers that presented a more critical (but less widely reported) take on the election.\n\nCredibility matters\n\nIn sacrificing credibility, international election observers play into the hands of those with an interest in holding less than free and fair elections. This seems to be the case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where much-delayed elections are now scheduled for Dec. 23. Church leaders \u2014 who have played an important role in making elections happen \u2014 have emphasized that the presence of election observers will be \u201ccritical\u201d for the success of the process. But the incumbent regime has countered that international observers are not impartial and lack credibility \u2014 suggesting that observers might be \u201cpersona non grata\u201d at the polls.\n\nA number of leading international observers are actively looking for ways to improve their work. As they do so, finding ways to protect their credibility will probably emerge as a top priority. This means ensuring international observers judge African elections against the same standards as elections held elsewhere, and ensuring the world sees they do so.\n\nSusan Dodsworth is a research fellow in the International Development Department at the University of Birmingham.

Ghosn was instrumental in helping forge an alliance among the three companies.\n\nThe French government has a 15 percent stake in Renault, and the news from Japan seemed to catch Paris off guard.\n\nNissan said Ghosn\u2019s arrest stemmed from a whistleblower\u2019s report, but questions swirled about whether he was the victim of political maneuverings within Nissan or had simply created too many enemies by getting too big for his own boots.\n\n[Nissan says chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested over alleged financial misconduct]\n\nWhile Renault\u2019s most senior executives were reported to have pledged their full support to Ghosn, and Lebanon\u2019s government said it stood by him, the French government was effectively forced to acknowledge that Ghosn could not continue as head of Renault for now.\n\n\u201cCarlos Ghosn is no longer in a state to lead the group,\u201d said Le Maire, speaking Tuesday morning on France Info television.\n\nBut the French finance minister added that he was calling for answers, not necessarily for Ghosn\u2019s resignation. He said the government began examining Ghosn\u2019s financial activities in France once the Nissan news broke in Japan, but that, for now, \u201cthere is nothing special to report on the tax situation of Mr. Ghosn in France.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, Le Maire said, the French government would not be demanding Ghosn\u2019s departure from Renault\u2019s board because \u201cwe have no proof\u201d that he engaged in financial wrongdoing in France.\n\nIndustry watchdogs are waiting for news from Renault on a possible interim leadership change. A Renault spokesman said the company\u2019s board was to meet Tuesday evening in Paris.\n\nLe Maire and Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko spoke by telephone Tuesday and \u201creaffirmed the strong support\u201d of both governments to the alliance between Renault and Nissan, \u201cand their shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation,\u201d describing it in a joint statement as one of the greatest examples of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.\n\nThe news of Ghosn\u2019s arrest sparked a defensive reaction in Lebanon, where his heritage is a source of pride.\n\nLebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in a statement that he has instructed the Lebanese ambassador in Tokyo to follow the case and ensure that Ghosn gets fair treatment, according to the Associated Press.\n\nGhosn represents \u201ca model of Lebanese success abroad, and the Lebanese Foreign Ministry will stand by him in his crisis to make sure he gets a fair trial,\u201d Bassil said.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Renault\u2019s chief operating officer, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, sent a note to employees late Monday stating management\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d for Ghosn and calling the alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi an \u201cindustrial gem that must be protected and nurtured.\u201d\n\nIn Japan, Ghosn had been one of the most admired and well-paid executives. His sudden fall from grace dominated headlines, with details of the accusations against him leaking to the media.\n\nNational broadcaster NHK said Nissan had paid \u201chuge sums\u201d to buy and maintain luxury residences for Ghosn in Beirut, Paris, Amsterdam and Rio de Janeiro that were not for legitimate business reasons.\n\nThe purchases were not declared in stock market filings, while Ghosn was underpaying or not paying rent, NHK alleged, citing unidentified sources.\n\nThe Nikkei newspaper, again citing anonymous sources, alleged that nearly $18 million had been funneled through a Dutch subsidiary of Nissan to purchase a condominium on Rio\u2019s Copacabana strip and a luxury home in Beirut.\n\nNHK also alleged that Ghosn, who was in charge of paying Nissan\u2019s top 13 executives, had secretly siphoned off some of that money for himself.\n\nPublic prosecutors have confirmed that Ghosn was arrested on suspicion of failing to declare around $44 million in income on Nissan\u2019s official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011. Nissan representative director Greg Kelly also has been arrested.\n\nGhosn had won many admirers during his long career as one of the world\u2019s leading auto executives. His ruthless cost-cutting and vision to promote electric vehicles and low-cost vehicles had helped rescue both Renault and Nissan. His high salary and that same ruthlessness had also attracted many critics.\n\nExperts said one reason that he may have underreported his compensation may have been to avoid more criticism: The French government had long opposed his salary package, and Renault\u2019s shareholders had voted down his pay in 2016, although the vote was nonbinding. Only by agreeing to a pay cut did Ghosn get shareholders\u2019 approval at an annual meeting in Paris in June.\n\nIn an extraordinary news conference Monday night, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa denied that there had been a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d at Nissan but nevertheless spoke openly about his \u201cindignation\u201d at allegations against Ghosn, suggesting that his long reign and concentration of power had undermined corporate governance.\n\nUnder pressure from the French government, Ghosn had been exploring an even closer tie-up between Renault and Nissan, something that had raised hackles in the Japanese company.\n\nOn Monday, Saikawa said structural issues, including the fact that 43 percent of Nissan is held by Renault and that Ghosn held key roles in both companies, was \u201cone of the factors or drivers\u201d for the governance problems.\n\nNevertheless, auto industry experts say the alliance has proved so valuable for both companies that it is unlikely to unravel.\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, there were questions about whether Ghosn was being treated in the same way that a Japanese executive might be treated in similar circumstances.\n\nJapanese prosecutors have been criticized in the past for going soft on politicians and corporate executives accused of wrongdoing \u2014 not bringing charges against Toshiba executives accused of financial fraud in 2016, for example \u2014 but it seems there was no appetite to spare Ghosn, a rare foreigner at the top of the business ladder there.\n\nNobuo Gohara, the head of a law firm specializing in compliance, said he had not heard of a previous case in which a false statement regarding directors\u2019 compensation in a securities report had resulted in such a punishment.\n\n\u201cThere is a question whether this case should be charged as a criminal one,\u201d Gohara wrote in a blog post.\n\n\n\nNissan shares fell more than 5 percent in Tokyo trading Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely regrettable,\u201d Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. \u201cWe will watch developments closely.\u201d\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo contributed to this report.

Watt converged on Smith, sacking him for a big loss.\n\n\u201cHere comes the blitz,\u201d said CBS announcer Greg Gumbel, \u201cAnd there goes Alex Smith, down at the 40-yard line.\u201d\n\nIt was a routine play \u2014 until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe camera flashed to a flexing Jackson before locating Smith laid out on the ground. As the camera zoomed in on the fallen quarterback, Smith took off his helmet.\n\n[\u2018Say your prayers and get ready for the next play\u2019: Alex Smith injury shows game\u2019s dark side comes in a blink]\n\n\u201cAlex Smith is down,\u201d analyst Trent Green said.\n\nSmith grabbed his shoulder pads at his collar. He put face in his hands. He pulled his jersey over his face.\n\n\u201cAlex Smith is in a lot of pain,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe telecast then showed a replay \u2014 \u201cHere is what happened to Alex Smith . . .\u201d Gumbel said \u2014 and the CBS audience watched as Jackson and Watt sacked Smith and Smith\u2019s right leg wrenched at an awkward angle. After the game, the Redskins announced Smith had broken his tibia and fibula on the play.\n\nBREAKING NEWS \ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nQB Alex Smith suffers a horrible right leg injury (GRAPHIC \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb)\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/Lxe0n2GRKV \u2014 PickswiseNFL (@PickswiseNFL) November 18, 2018\n\nCBS then immediately cut to commercial, and the broadcast did not show another replay of the gruesome injury.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to show you the replay again,\u201d Green said as Tress Way punted the ball on fourth down. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad lower-leg injury, and you can understand why Alex was in the type of pain he was in.\u201d\n\nHarold Bryant, senior vice president of production at CBS, was in New York watching from the control room when the injury occurred. He discussed the play with his team \u2014 most of whom were on-site in Landover, in the production truck \u2014 and said they collectively reached the decision not to show another replay. They relayed that decision to Gumbel and Green, who voiced no disagreement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a philosophy thing,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrific injury, and we described it in-depth and documented it, and as a group we felt that was enough. We made a judgment call and felt it was documented properly. You could see the anguish on his face and on the players\u2019 faces.\u201d\n\nThe CBS production team has discussions ahead of the season about how to handle difficult injuries, like the one Smith sustained. The moment Sunday was similar, Bryant said, to when Louisville guard Kevin Ware broke his leg during an NCAA tournament game in 2013 that was aired on CBS. Ware leaped to block a shot and then landed awkwardly, his leg buckling under his weight.\n\nBryant was executive producing that game as well, and the broadcast showed two quick replays \u2014 the injury wasn\u2019t shown live \u2014 and then not again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we have discussions about,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cHow we\u2019re going to cover these moments, and on Sunday, the preparation kicked into action \u2014 unfortunately.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf people want to go find video of something like that, they can find it.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s injury was reminiscent of a similar moment 33 years ago to the day, when Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann suffered a broken leg on a sack by Giants star Lawrence Taylor. During that telecast on ABC, Theismann\u2019s injury only became apparent after Taylor gestured wildly for medical attention.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe Lawrence Taylor would have reacted that way unless Theismann was really hurt,\u201d said announcer Frank Gifford on the broadcast.\n\n[Exactly 33 years since his own gruesome injury, Joe Theismann \u2018just so upset\u2019 for Alex Smith]\n\nAs the camera showed Theismann on the turf, ABC\u2019s production team watched the video and decided that the best view of the play came from a new advancement in TV: the reverse angle, as Bob Goodrich, the game\u2019s producer later explained to Washingtonian.\n\n\u201cThe director and I thought the reverse angle was the best way to describe what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played it for ourselves two or three times, and we played it for the announcers to make sure we all agreed. They said, \u2018Make it a little slower so we can show it and analyze it.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at our reverse angle camera,\u201d Gifford said on the broadcast as the replay rolled.\n\nThe slow-motion replay showed Theismann\u2019s leg bend grotesquely, and the other announcers in the booth \u2014 Joe Namath and O.J. Simpson \u2014 can be heard reacting to the horrific sight.\n\nAfter a commercial, ABC showed a second replay with Gifford commenting, \u201cIf your stomach is weak, I suggest you don\u2019t watch.\u201d\n\nIt was 20 years before Theismann, who on Sunday said he had to turn away when he saw Smith go down injured, could watch replay of his own frightening injury. He said in a radio interview six years ago that he was glad high-definition TVs weren\u2019t in homes in 1985.\n\nMy injury \u201cwas somewhat unique and I really feel like it changed the course of the way we view injuries today,\u201d Theismann said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see so often when there\u2019s somebody really hurt on the field, they\u2019ll immediately go to commercial, and they don\u2019t show the reverse angles.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nPredicting winners for each of the NFL\u2019s closest playoff races\n\nKate Fagan is leaving ESPN\n\nAaron Donald, \u2018285 pounds of dynamite,\u2019 is NFL\u2019s ultimate outlier in an offense-heavy season\n\nThat huge Kirk Cousins contract is not looking like money well spent by the Vikings\n\nLeBron James: Cavs\u2019 Kyrie Irving trade was \u2018the beginning of the end for everything\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Colby Itkowitz", "title": "These are the undecided races two weeks after Election Day", "description": "The marquee races have been decided, but there are still a handful where there is no winner yet.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/20/these-are-undecided-races-two-weeks-after-election-day/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:30:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate Mike Espy and Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi. (EPA-EFE/Shutterstock/AP)\n\nThis story will be updated as new results are known.\n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since Election Day, and while the matchups that captured national intrigue are officially over, there remain a handful of outstanding races yet to be called.\n\nFirst, a quick primer on what has been resolved:\n\nDemocrats in the most high-profile, too-close-to-call races effectively all admitted defeat over the weekend. In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams did not officially concede, but she acknowledged that her GOP opponent, Brian Kemp, would be the winner of the state\u2019s gubernatorial election, though she refused to say his win was legitimate after widespread accusations of voter suppression. In Florida, Andrew Gillum, who conceded on election night and then retracted it when the closeness of the gubernatorial race triggered a machine recount, didn\u2019t get near close enough to overcoming Republican Ron DeSantis\u2019s lead. And the Senate contest in Florida, which had the best, although still unlikely, chance of flipping, narrowed only slightly after a manual recount and so, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson admitted defeat to GOP Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nThe tight races that were called in the days after Nov. 6 were all breaking for Democrats until Monday, when Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones conceded to GOP Rep. Will Hurd in the 23rd District of Texas, a race that was decided by just under 700 votes. Until this week, Jones was so committed to contesting the results that she even attended last week\u2019s orientation for new members in Washington.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Utah 4th Congressional District race was called for Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams over incumbent Mia Love, the only African American Republican woman in the House. Love was considered among the most vulnerable Republicans this year and, like many in her situation, tried to separate herself from Trump.\n\n[Graphic: The balance of power in the House]\n\nThat puts the Democrats at 233 House seats, a pick up of 38, to Republicans' 199, with four undecided and one previously declared that could flip. In the Senate, the Democrats have 47 seats and the Republicans have 52, with one still undecided.\n\nIn each of the yet-to-be determined races, the Republican incumbent is defending the seat.\n\nSenate in Mississippi\n\nThere\u2019s only one Senate race yet to be decided, and that\u2019s in Mississippi, where none of the candidates secured 50 percent of the vote, so the highest vote-getters, Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, will face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 27. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to replace Sen. Thad Cochran last spring, will likely emerge victorious next week in a deep-red state that President Trump won by nearly 18 points. Hyde-Smith bested Espy by only one point, but would have won easily had she not lost 16 percent of the votes to conservative Chris McDaniel.\n\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t taking anything for granted. The runoff may be closer than they are comfortable with, considering they already face a slim majority in the Senate. Democrats are hoping for a large turnout of black voters \u2014 Espy is black, as is more than one-third of the state\u2019s population. Potential Democratic presidential contenders Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) went down this week to campaign for him. And Trump is planning to hold a rally for Hyde-Smith next week. The star power descending on the state suggests Republicans are not confident and Democrats see an opening.\n\nNew York\u2019s 22nd District\n\nDemocrat Anthony Brindisi has declared victory over GOP Rep. Claudia Tenney. There are still absentee ballots to be counted, but Tenney would need to win most of them to overcome Brindisi\u2019s lead. Unlike many vulnerable Republicans who distanced themselves from the president, Tenney embraced Trump, who even came to the district in October to raise money for her. Though Trump lost New York handily in 2016, he won the district by double digits.\n\nNew York\u2019s 27th District\n\nGOP Rep. Chris Collins is holding on to his lead over Nate McMurray, but absentee ballots are still being counted. Collins was indicted in August on insider-trading charges, but that did not deter voters. Though McMurray is a long shot, he still came to Washington last week for freshman orientation.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s 7th District\n\nAs of late last week, GOP Rep. Rob Woodall had won reelection by less than 500 votes over Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux, but because the margin of victory is less than 1 percent, Bourdeaux has asked for a recount. It\u2019s unlikely to change the results, but it still means this race is not quite over.\n\nAlso to watch: California\u2019s 21st District\n\nRepublican Rep. David Valadao was projected the winner on Election Night, but his lead here is shrinking with more provisional ballots still to be counted. Democrat TJ Cox is now trailing by under 1,000 votes in a district that went for Hillary Clinton by double digits."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Russian challenge to chemical weapons watchdog rejected", "description": "The U.S. and Western powers on Monday staved off a challenge by Russia and others questioning whether the global chemical weapons watchdog could start apportioning blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/russian-challenge-to-chemical-weapons-watchdog-rejected/2018/11/20/48c28ffe-ecb7-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:27:38Z", "content": "BRUSSELS The U.S. and Western powers have staved off a challenge by Russia and China questioning whether the global chemical weapons watchdog could start apportioning blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks.

At a heated session of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u2019 annual conference, on Monday Nov. 19, 2018, western powers clashed with Russia over a decision to set up a new investigative team which could name the perpetrators of chemical attacks. (Peter Dejong, FILE/Associated Press)\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 The global chemical weapons watchdog\u2019s initiative to apportion blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks survived two institutional challenges from Russia on Tuesday and is set to become operational next year.\n\nThe U.S. and other Western powers at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons staved off a challenge by Russia and China to a June decision to set up an investigative team with the power to name perpetrators of chemical attacks.\n\nIt means a major change in the rules of the group, which has often been considered as toothless because it could never pinpoint who was behind a chemical attack even if it proved it had happened.\n\nFollowing a heated session at the OPCW\u2019s annual conference, members voted 82-30 to reject a reassessment of the June decision.\n\nRussia and China had argued that the decision should be reviewed to ensure it didn\u2019t go beyond the OPCW mandate.\n\nLater, a Russian-Iranian move to reject the annual budget, which would have starved the new investigative team of funds, was also defeated.\n\nBritain\u2019s ambassador, Peter Wilson, called it in a Twitter message \u201can overwhelming result, which clearly says #NoToChemicalWeapons.\u201d\n\nSweden was also among the Western bloc that backed the establishment of the new team to apportion blame.\n\n\u201cClear and strong support for the organization and its new responsibilities. No impunity for chemical weapons use,\u201d Annika Markovic, Sweden\u2019s envoy to the meeting tweeted.\n\nAt the meeting, the U.S. ambassador to the watchdog, Kenneth Ward, complained on Monday that \u201ca tsunami of chemical weapons\u201d had been used this year, especially in Syria, an ally of Russia, and called Moscow\u2019s attempts to undo the decision \u201cpungent hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nBritain and its allies also have accused Moscow of using a Soviet-era nerve agent in an attempted assassination of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury earlier this year. Russia denies the allegation.\n\nLast June, an 82-24 vote among OPCW members provided more than the necessary two-thirds majority to give the group the mandate to name the parties it found responsible for chemical attacks.\n\nThe squad, expected to comprise of about 10 to 12 investigators supported by experts and chemical inspectors who already work at the OPCW, will be able to look back at attacks for which the previous UN-OPCW team did not apportion blame.\n\nOne case still being investigated by weapons inspectors is the suspected chemical attack in April in the Syrian town of Douma. An interim report said that weapons inspectors found \u201cvarious chlorinated organic chemicals\u201d at the site.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They say the divorce deal she has agreed with the European Union will leave Britain tied to the bloc\u2019s rules without any say in making them.\n\nThe group said they were confident of getting the 48 letters \u2014 from 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers \u2014 needed to spark a leadership challenge.\n\nRees-Mogg said Tuesday that it remained to be seen whether the threshold would be reached.\n\nHe said that \u201cpatience is a virtue. ...We shall see whether letters come in due time.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nThe Bank of England is to publish its assessment of Prime Minster Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal with the European Union next week in the run-up to a vote in Parliament.\n\nIt will also on Nov. 29 publish an assessment of what would happen to the British economy if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal and without a transition.

(Butch Dill/Associated Press)\n\nEach week, national NFL writer Mark Maske ranks the league\u2019s 32 teams. This week, the Saints are a clear No. 1 after their dismantling of the Eagles. The Cowboys and Colts sneak into the top 10, despite their modest 5-5 records, on the strength of their recently improved play. The Vikings, Panthers and Redskins drop after their losses and, in the Redskins\u2019 case, the season-ending injury to their quarterback, Alex Smith. The Raiders move out of the cellar thanks to their win over the Cardinals, returning the 49ers to the bottom spot.\n\n1. New Orleans Saints (9-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 1\n\nThe dismantling of the Eagles was so thorough it seemed cruel. And that was against the defending Super Bowl champion. This offense is functioning at an unimaginably high level, and the defense is doing its part. Drew Brees is the league MVP front-runner.\n\n[Eagles\u2019 Malcolm Jenkins gave Sean Payton the finger after late Saints TD]\n\n2. Los Angeles Rams (10-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 3\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that the Rams didn\u2019t play any defense in Monday night\u2019s scoring-fest against the Chiefs. They won in part because their defense forced turnovers and scored points on its own. But the offense, of course, had the starring role. A rematch certainly would make for an entertaining Super Bowl.\n\n3. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 5\n\nIt took the Steelers most of the game to get their offense moving Sunday in Jacksonville. But they pulled out a win against a team that has been a nemesis. That\u2019s meaningful.\n\n[Rams-Chiefs was the new NFL in its most spectacular form]\n\n4. Kansas City Chiefs (9-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 2\n\nThere were a few too many mistakes and a few too many turnovers by QB Patrick Mahomes and the offense Monday night in L.A. But it was a memorably great game, and the Chiefs can play with anyone in this NFL season of revved-up offenses.\n\n5. New England Patriots (7-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 6\n\nThe Patriots return from their bye for a less-than-demanding road game against the Jets. The biggest issue will be the health and availability of TE Rob Gronkowski. The Patriots probably need him at something resembling his best the rest of the way to get back to another Super Bowl.\n\n6. Houston Texans (7-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 7\n\nThe injury to the Redskins\u2019 Alex Smith overshadowed everything else that happened Sunday at FedEx Field, but the Texans\u2019 victory pushed their record to 7-0 since their 0-3 start. It\u2019s still difficult to envision them as a viable Super Bowl contender.\n\n7. Chicago Bears (7-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 8\n\nThe Packers have Aaron Rodgers. The Vikings added Kirk Cousins to a team that reached the NFC title game last season. But it is the Bears who are the NFC North\u2019s best team at the moment. The defense overwhelmed Cousins and the Vikings on Sunday night until Cousins managed late to make his numbers look respectable. Mitchell Trubisky is developing into a QB who\u2019s plenty good enough. This is a very dangerous team, and the Saints and Rams had better be wary.\n\n\n\nBears pass rushers Khalil Mack (52) and Akiem Hicks (96) made life miserable for Kirk Cousins and the Vikings. (Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press)\n\n8. Los Angeles Chargers (7-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 4\n\nJust when you start to trust the Chargers, they go and do something like lose to the Broncos.\n\n9. Dallas Cowboys (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 15\n\nThings change quickly in the topsy-turvy NFC East. Only a few weeks ago, the Cowboys\u2019 season seemed all but over. Two road victories later, they will host the Redskins on Thanksgiving Day with a chance to grab a share of first place and establish themselves as the division\u2019s team to beat headed down the stretch.\n\n10. Indianapolis Colts (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 14\n\nThe Colts might have gotten lucky, as it turns out, to have gotten Frank Reich instead of Josh McDaniels as their coach. Reich is doing a terrific job, and the Colts\u2019 return to respectability is on fast-forward. Andrew Luck looks like a franchise QB again, and the team around him is performing surprisingly well.\n\n\n\nThings are looking up for Andrew Luck and the Colts. (Michael Conroy/Associated Press)\n\n11. Baltimore Ravens (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 19\n\nThe way the Ravens played in Sunday\u2019s triumph over the Bengals, with rookie QB Lamar Jackson getting 27 carries in his first NFL start, is not sustainable for Jackson and might not be effective against the league\u2019s better teams. But it gave the Ravens a win they needed badly. Jackson gets at least one more start, with Joe Flacco expected to remain sidelined this week, and then Coach John Harbaugh will have an interesting QB decision to make.\n\n[Lamar Jackson runs Ravens back into the playoff race, and maybe Joe Flacco out of a job]\n\n12. Seattle Seahawks (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 20\n\nIt\u2019s surprising that the Seahawks are managing to remain in playoff contention in such a transitional season. Their game Sunday at Carolina against the suddenly reeling Panthers is significant for positioning in the NFC wild-card chase.\n\n13. Minnesota Vikings (5-4-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 11\n\nNo one is saying it\u2019s all Kirk Cousins\u2019s fault. But he was signed to be the final piece of a Super Bowl puzzle in Minnesota. And it\u2019s not working out so far.\n\n[That huge Kirk Cousins contract is not looking like money well spent by the Vikings]\n\n14. Green Bay Packers (4-5-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 13\n\nAaron Rodgers\u2019s greatness is not saving the Packers this time, at least not so far. They\u2019re 0-5 on the road, and the scrutiny on Coach Mike McCarthy is intensifying. The Packers\u2019 meeting with the Vikings on Sunday night at Minnesota isn\u2019t a playoff elimination game, but it sort of feels like one.\n\n[The Packers appear well on their way to wasting another year of Aaron Rodgers\u2019s prime]\n\n15. Detroit Lions (4-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 24\n\nThe Lions remain an inconsequential team, even after beating the Panthers. If they mange to win Thursday against the Bears, they might begin to merit attention.\n\n16. Carolina Panthers (6-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 12\n\nCoach Ron Rivera\u2019s decision to go for the two-point conversion and the win in regulation Sunday at Detroit wasn\u2019t wrong because it failed. It was wrong because when you believe you have the better team \u2014 and Rivera should have believed that Sunday \u2014 you should extend the game and avoid having it come down to a single play with a 50-50 outcome.\n\n17. Washington Redskins (6-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 9\n\nColt McCoy is a capable backup and he has a chance to keep the Redskins in the division race after taking over as the starter at QB for the injured Alex Smith. But Smith\u2019s prudence in avoiding turnovers and his athleticism while playing behind a depleted offensive line may have been overlooked and underestimated. He didn\u2019t have overwhelming numbers but he wasn\u2019t losing games for the Redskins. Will the same be said about McCoy?\n\n[Brewer: Alex Smith wasn\u2019t carrying the Redskins. Colt McCoy doesn\u2019t have to either.]\n\n\n\nAlex Smith is taken from the field Sunday. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\n18. Miami Dolphins (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 18\n\nRyan Tannehill could be nearing a return to the Dolphins\u2019 lineup. That is a good thing, right?\n\n19. Tennessee Titans (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 10\n\nSo much for that two-game winning streak and the notion that the Titans are fighting their way back into playoff contention. It all came undone Sunday in Indianapolis.\n\n20. Denver Broncos (4-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 25\n\nJust when you give up on the Broncos, they go and do something like beat the Chargers.\n\n21. Cleveland Browns (3-6-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 21\n\nThe Browns will be an interesting non-contender down the stretch. This season has been all about a return to respectability for them, and they still have a chance to achieve that if they play well and win a few more games.\n\n22. Philadelphia Eagles (4-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 16\n\nSo much for the idea that the Eagles might emerge from their bye to begin a second-half run that would put them in control of the NFC East. The loss to the Cowboys was puzzling. Sunday\u2019s defeat in New Orleans was alarmingly lopsided. The Eagles look nothing like a team less than a year removed from a Super Bowl. This is bordering on being a mess right now, and it\u2019s up to Coach Doug Pederson and QB Carson Wentz to clean things up.\n\n\n\nIt has been a struggle for Carson Wentz and the Eagles, especially against the Saints. (Bill Feig/Associated Press)\n\n23. Cincinnati Bengals (5-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 17\n\nHow bad is the Cincinnati defense these days? The Bengals surrendered 403 total yards to the Ravens in Sunday\u2019s loss, in which rookie QB Lamar Jackson was making his first NFL start for Baltimore. And THAT qualified as progress for the Bengals.\n\n24. New York Giants (3-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 28\n\nA two-game winning streak for the Giants? Eli Manning completing 17 of 18 passes in a game? Maybe things actually bottomed out a few weeks ago and the Giants will close the season on a comparatively high note. Maybe.\n\n25. Atlanta Falcons (4-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 22\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine the Falcons climbing back into playoff contention. Doing so would probably require them to win Thursday night at New Orleans. And how likely is that? Not very likely, given how the Saints are playing.\n\n26. Buffalo Bills (3-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 26\n\nRookie QB Josh Allen could return to the lineup Sunday to face the Jaguars and cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who called Allen \u201ctrash\u201d in an interview with GQ. So at least there\u2019s one reason to pay attention to a matchup of 3-7 teams.\n\n27. Jacksonville Jaguars (3-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 23\n\nIt\u2019s all but official now: The Jaguars aren\u2019t getting this fixed, not this season. And they will be one of the NFL\u2019s biggest disappointments of 2018.\n\n28. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 27\n\nIt\u2019s back to Jameis Winston as the starter at QB. That\u2019s the right move. The season is lost. Dirk Koetter probably will be out as the coach. All that\u2019s left is to figure out if Winston is or is not the long-term solution at QB.\n\n29. Oakland Raiders (2-8) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 32\n\nHow would it have been possible to lose to the Cardinals?\n\n30. Arizona Cardinals (2-8) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 29\n\nHow is it possible to lose to the Raiders?\n\n31. New York Jets (3-7) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 30\n\nThe Jets just had a bye week.

Their stunned expressions said it all.\n\nJust to recap...here\u2019s the look on every finalists face when @mrBobbyBones was announced winner of #DWTS... pic.twitter.com/7LpVNyARcz \u2014 Gary Andrew Stinson (@Gary_Andrew) November 20, 2018\n\nWas this the biggest upset in the 13-year history of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d? While there have certainly been shocking results before (remember Donny Osmond over M\u00fda or Donald Driver over Katherine Jenkins?), the judges\u2019 score discrepancy \u2014 and the skill level \u2014 between Bones and the other finalists loomed large. Bones\u2019s victory caused a stir online, as ecstatic messages from country music stars and his fans rolled in . . . while others were less than pleased with the results.\n\nBones, who had no prior dance experience going into the show, didn\u2019t earn higher than an 8 from any judge until the finale, when they each awarded him a perfect 10 for his final performance. His partner, Sharna Burgess, choreographed a freestyle dance to \u201cThe Greatest Show\u201d from \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d soundtrack. Because, as she explained, \u201cTo me, you are the greatest showman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thanks, I think,\u201d Bones said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge compliment!\u201d Burgess told him. \u201cNo one is better at entertaining than you, and that has been such a joy for me to watch the entire season.\u201d\n\n['Dancing With the Stars' finale: How Bobby Bones overcame last-place odds to make the finals]\n\nThe judges echoed Burgess\u2019s remarks nearly every episode, as they praised his infectious energy over his technical proficiency. Bones worked tirelessly to improve over the 10 weeks, but even when he made mistakes, it always looked as if he was having the time of his life on the dance floor.\n\nAfter the \u201cGreatest Show\u201d dance \u2014 a wild number that included flossing, a throwback to Bones\u2019s signature move \u2014 judge Bruno Tonioli called it \u201cthe perfect freestyle for a free spirit.\u201d Carrie Ann Inaba started to list criticisms before declaring: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. This is everybody\u2019s moment to shine. You shone so brightly, Bobby Bones.\u201d\n\nLen Goodman, the toughest judge, summed things up: \u201cBobby, you have not always been the judges' champion. But 100 percent, you've always been the people's champion. And I'm going to tell you, tonight, you've become my champion.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bones was a fan favorite. He talked often about his tough upbringing in rural Arkansas and cast himself as someone who was lucky to even be a part of the show. And as a syndicated country radio host who is broadcast to millions of listeners every morning, he has a dedicated fan base that gets particularly fired up when he\u2019s seen as the underdog.\n\n\u201cUnderdogs unite,\u201d Bones wrote on Instagram last week. \u201cWho would have thought someone with zero dance experience, nor a trained pro athlete would make it this far. . . . Thanks for letting me represent the normal folks. I\u2019m going to try to win it for you. The people. My people.\u201d\n\nGiven that DWTS results are a combination of judge scores and viewer votes, Bones\u2019s loyal fandom came through. Of course, that meant that quite a few viewers were still unhappy \u2014 just scroll through the replies to the DWTS account\u2019s tweet congratulating Bones. Lots of fans felt that Manheim, whom Inaba called \u201cthe one to beat,\u201d was unfairly passed over. (After the finale, ABC confirmed that Manheim landed in second place, followed by Lynch and then Ren.)\n\nBones, well aware of the fact that he\u2019s a polarizing figure, has been retweeting negative comments over the past few days. That only served to energize his fans. As Bones said earlier in the season, \u201cHopefully, people watching at home feel like they\u2019re part of our team.\u201d\n\nIt appears that came true. Host Tom Bergeron reminded him of this at the end of the show, as Bones and Burgess received the Mirror Ball Trophy. Bones seemed to be in shock, and he immediately dissolved into tears.\n\n\u201cYou are, in very true words, the people's champion, my friend,\u201d Bergeron said. \u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201d\n\nTrue to form, Bones expressed his gratitude: \u201cThank you to the people.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCountry radio host Bobby Bones reveals he spent $13,000 on a hoax to win over Nashville skeptics\n\nThe 20 types of celebrities that go on \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019\n\nMiranda Lambert is a superstar.

(Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRecently, former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci declared that President Trump is a \u201cblue-collar president\u201d \u2014 which some observers find curious, given his wealthy upbringing and boasts about being a billionaire. And in Sweden\u2019s general election in September, the far-right Sweden Democrats finished in third place with 18 percent of the vote, while the center-left Social Democrats had their worst electoral performance in more than a century.\n\nWhy? My research in Hungary and Poland suggests that the right-wing populism\u2019s rise and center-left parties\u2019 decline result from the same process: blue-collar supporters shifting away from the left to embrace the populist right.\n\nThe left and the populist right in Hungary\n\nIn Hungary, two populist right-wing parties \u2014 Fidesz and Jobbik \u2014 have been extraordinarily successful over the past decade. Fidesz, founded in 1988, secured a supermajority in the Hungarian parliament after its landslide victory in the 2010 elections, and retained it in 2014 and in 2018. Jobbik, founded in 2003, rose to popularity by 2009 and quickly became the most electorally successful radical-right party in Central and Eastern Europe. Jobbik\u2019s first electoral success came in the 2009 European Parliament election, in which the party received 14.8 percent of the Hungarian vote. In the parliamentary elections of 2010, 2014 and 2018, Jobbik received 16.7 percent, 20.2 percent and 19.1 percent of the vote, respectively. It is the only radical-right party in the region to mobilize more than 10 percent of voters in three consecutive elections.\n\nMy research shows that\u2019s because these parties managed to attract blue-collar voters who previously voted for Hungary\u2019s former communist Socialist Workers\u2019 Party. Starting in 1989, the Hungarian Socialist Party rejected the old Communist Party image and adopted a pro-European program, which combined a universalist welfare state and acceptance of the market economy.\n\n[Populists have one big thing right: Democracies are becoming less open.]\n\nThis approach originally worked very well. However, in June 2006, the then-ruling Socialist Party adopted austerity measures, the \u201cNew Balance Program,\u201d which dramatically increased gas and electricity prices, and some taxes. As a result, the Socialists\u2019 approval ratings dropped 10 percentage points by August 2006. In September 2006, Magyar Radio leaked the Socialist prime minister\u2019s comment that he had lied, minimizing the difficulties facing Hungary\u2019s economy. Hungarians rioted in several cities, and the Socialists lost popularity even more precipitously. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Socialist Party was essentially finished.\n\nThe populist Fidesz took advantage of this popularity nose-dive, launching a campaign arguing that only stopping the corrupt neoliberal policies of the former communist left could lead to strong growth again. The radical-right Jobbik accused the Socialists of misleading the country and causing devastating economic conditions during the transition from communism.\n\nIn the 2010 election, Fidesz won a landslide victory with a two-thirds majority in parliament; Jobbik secured 16.7 percent of vote and got into parliament. The Socialist Party has never been able to recover. New leftist parties emerged but have failed to gain substantial popular support. Dissatisfied voters consistently shifted to the right.\n\nIn my research, I found that over this period Hungarian blue-collar workers were less and less likely to vote for the Socialist Party and more and more likely to support Fidesz and Jobbik. Polls showed that Fidesz had the strongest support among blue-collar workers and lower-middle-class voters and the weakest support among managers, while the Socialist Party had the strongest following primarily among managers and middle-class professionals.\n\nFidesz and Jobbik were overrepresented in the blue-collar quarters of Budapest during the 2010 parliamentary elections. In in-depth interviews with workers at Hungary\u2019s factories, Eszter Bartha and Andras Toth found that the majority supported Fidesz and Jobbik, while only a small margin backed the Socialist Party. Some respondents even wondered why workers and trade unions should vote for the left. Many argued that while they, the workers, produced the profit, the owners and the technocrats profited \u2014 once the argument made by the left.\n\nSimilarly, in 2010, Jobbik won many of the counties in northeastern Hungary previously considered the bastions of the Socialist Party. A Hungarian Election Research Program survey discovered that about a third of Jobbik\u2019s 2010 voters had supported the Socialists in 2006. Overall, the populist right-wing parties\u2019 success in Hungary came from their ability to win over blue-collar voters.\n\n[Are voters enough to protect democracy?]\n\nPoland saw a similar trend\n\nSomething similar killed off the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), a Polish center-left party, which was the successor party of the Polish United Workers\u2019 Party. Participating in pro-market reforms and promoting strong support for European integration enabled SLD to portray itself as a modernized Western-style social democratic party and to distance itself from the communist past. To allow Poland to enter the European Union, an SLD-led government instituted economic changes that made business interests a priority, introduced a more flexible labor code, expanded support for entrepreneurship and proposed a flat income tax.\n\nOver the next years, substantial numbers of former SLD supporters turned to the Polish populist right-wing party Law and Justice (PiS), which promised to improve the conditions of Polish workers. PiS argued that what Poland needed was leaders dedicated to true Polish values, included banning abortion, purging former communists and distributing state property to all citizens. Political scientist David Ost argued that Polish workers voted for the populist right to punish the intelligentsia and the new neoliberal elite for the economic changes that impoverished many workers.\n\nWhen leftist parties survive\n\nIn some Central European countries, leftist parties preserved protectionist economic policies and kept their blue-collar voters, leaving fewer political openings for the populist right to exploit. For example, in Slovakia, one left-leaning party, SDL, supported its government\u2019s austerity program. In response, another Slovak left-wing party, Smer, campaigned on a traditional left platform, criticizing the Slovak center-right governments for ignoring Slovakia\u2019s growing disparities and catering to multinational corporations and financial interests. As a solution, Smer emphasized a return to the basic principles of solidarity and state involvement in the economy, offering changes in the labor code, pensions and education. Smer further pledged to increase public spending on health care, pensions and education and to introduce a second sales tax on basic goods. The SDL lost its supporters and disappeared. Smer-SD (since Smer absorbed the SDL in 2005) has won each parliamentary election since 2006.\n\nOverall, the experiences of Central European countries suggest that when left-leaning parties turn their backs on working people, other parties will willingly step up to channel their frustration.\n\nMaria Snegovaya is a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for International and Security Studies and an adjunct fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and the Free Russia Foundation."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Matt O'Brien", "title": "The two big reasons there really might be a recession in 2020", "description": "Rising interest rates and high levels of corporate debt could be a bad, bad mix.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/20/two-big-reasons-there-really-might-be-recession/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xeJRCUgpUWehxVEYLxgJgYcl1v4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XVP6VMWYQ4I6RA4EXTCUSL7PJE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:19Z", "content": "Maybe the best reason to think there wont be a recession in 2020 is that so many people are saying there will be.

Powell, then a nominee for chair of the Federal Reserve Board, speaks at the White House on Nov. 2, 2017. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nMaybe the best reason to think there won\u2019t be a recession in 2020 is that so many people are saying there will be.\n\nThe idea being that the more people are worried about something, the more they should do to try to avoid it \u2014 right? You\u2019d certainly think so, but not always. Consider the housing bubble: Economists including Paul Krugman and the Center for Economic and Policy Research\u2019s Dean Baker spent years warning about the impending danger, but it didn\u2019t matter. Policymakers didn\u2019t do anything, and everyone else was too busy trying to get in while the getting was good to concern themselves with whether it was sustainable.\n\nWhich brings us to our two big risks today. The first is that interest rates, though still low by pre-crisis standards, are starting to get a little high by our post-crisis ones. In fact, the best recession predictor we have \u2014 the difference between the government\u2019s 10-year and two-year borrowing costs \u2014 is beginning to flash yellow.\n\nWhy does that tell us so much? Well, it has to do with the economic story that\u2019s embedded within longer-term interest rates. Those, you see, show us what markets think short-term interest rates are going to average over that time, plus a little extra to make up for the risk that inflation ends up being higher than people thought it would. So when long-term rates are lower than short-term ones, what\u2019s known as an \u201cinverted yield curve,\u201d it\u2019s telling us that markets think the Federal Reserve is going to have to stop raising rates and start cutting them in the near future. And when would it do that? Easy: when it\u2019s trying to fight a recession.\n\nThe good news is that this hasn\u2019t happened yet, but the bad news is it probably won\u2019t be long until it does. Not when 10-year interest rates are a mere 0.25 percentage points above two-year ones. All it should take is another rate hike or two for it to invert, at which point, if history is any guide, we could expect a recession within the next year or so. Right around, you guessed it, 2020.\n\nSo far, so normal. Higher borrowing costs are always a threat to the economy. They slow down the housing market, which usually slows down consumer spending as well, and, as a result, hurts profits enough that companies either slow down their hiring or maybe start laying people off. What makes them an even bigger threat right now, though, is the other problem that\u2019s pretty plain to see: all the money that companies have borrowed over the past 10 years.\n\nIndeed, as Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s Noah Smith points out, nonfinancial corporate debt has just hit an all-time high as a share of the economy. And, as you would expect when so many loans are being made so quickly, a lot of it looks quite risky. Companies that already have a lot of debt have been some of the biggest borrowers recently in the so-called \u201cleveraged loan\u201d market \u2014 which is now up to a total of $1.3 trillion. Despite that, though, there\u2019s been so much competition among lenders to make these loans that they haven\u2019t been requiring a lot of protection for themselves if things go bad.\n\nIn a certain foreboding sense, that\u2019s understandable. That\u2019s because, by and large, they aren\u2019t holding onto these loans themselves but are rather bundling them together into securities known as \u201ccollateralized loan obligations\u201d (CLOs) to sell to investors. That, thanks to the magic of modern finance, lets them turn a big chunk of their BBB-rated corporate loans into AAA-rated bonds, since there should be safety in numbers: Any single borrower might default, but the chance that most of them would at the same time should be negligible. At least it is according to their mathematical models, which, as we know, are never . . . never mind.\n\nAll of this should sound uncomfortably familiar. After all, replace \u201cbusinesses\u201d with \u201chouseholds,\u201d and you\u2019d have a pretty good description of what went wrong in 2008. Just as before, lenders are stretching the definition of \u201ccreditworthy\u201d to include anyone who wants to borrow money in an attempt to make \u2014 and then sell \u2014 as many loans as possible. And also as before, it\u2019s not always banks but, rather, unregulated lenders like hedge funds and private equity firms that are the ones doing this. Which, if it weren\u2019t bad enough, just got worse, thanks to a new loophole courtesy of the conservative judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. As my colleague Steven Pearlstein points out, they decided to exempt the non-bank entities that slice and dice these loans together from the post-crisis rules that required them to hold on to at least 5 percent of them themselves as long as they weren\u2019t the ones who had made the loans in the first place.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that this will end as badly as things did in 2008, but it\u2019s not exactly the highest of bars to say that we\u2019ll avoid a repeat of the worst financial crisis in history. That still leaves plenty of extremely unpleasant possibilities for the corporate debt market, which the International Monetary Fund, former Fed chair Janet Yellen and even hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones have all been sounding the alarm over. What we can say is that companies will probably face higher debt payments right when they\u2019re dealing with lower profits \u2014 that is, when interest rates really are getting high \u2014 to the point that a few might end up defaulting. How bad would that be? That\u2019s hard to say, as it would depend in large part on who was bearing those losses, how well they were able to do so, and how important they were to the financial system as a whole. But at a minimum, these kind of corporate defaults would probably be enough to send an economy whose virtuous circle was looking a little wobbly into a vicious one instead.\n\nJust because a problem is obvious doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to get solved."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Portugal unaware of joint World Cup bid with Spain, Morocco", "description": "A Portuguese official says Spain has made no approach about the possibility of presenting a three-way bid to host the 2030 World Cup with Morocco", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/portugal-unaware-of-joint-world-cup-bid-with-spain-morocco/2018/11/20/76861540-ecb3-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T11:00:17Z", "content": "LISBON, Portugal A Portuguese official says Spain has made no approach about the possibility of presenting a three-way bid to host the 2030 World Cup with Morocco.

Fahrenthold/The Washington Post)\n\nLast year, 22 charities deserted President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. \u2014 canceling high-dollar events after Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d among violent white-nationalist protesters in Charlottesville.\n\nThis year, only two are coming back.\n\nA survey by The Washington Post could only find six groups planning big-money evening banquets this winter at the club, where Trump is scheduled to arrive Tuesday for Thanksgiving. Several are new clients, aligned with Trump\u2019s politics, including a group of young conservatives and a gathering of superfans called Trumpettes USA.\n\nBefore Charlottesville, the number of high-dollar events at Trump\u2019s club was as much as 22 in a single season of galas.\n\nTrump seems to have self-disrupted the banquet business at Mar-a-Lago, a part of his company that once seemed undisruptable. After all, he owned one of two major party venues on a small island whose super-rich residents love to party and hate to leave. How could that go wrong?\n\n\u201cIt may have been crippled, temporarily,\u201d said Shannon Donnelly, the society editor for the Palm Beach Daily News, talking about the banquet business at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump\u2019s problem is not that he\u2019s lost the support of Palm Beach\u2019s wealthy winter snowbirds: Donnelly said they still like him, by and large. The problem, as the past two years have shown, is that many of the island\u2019s biggest banquets are linked to national charities, who must schedule their galas months in advance.\n\nIf they went back to Mar-a-Lago, they would be linking their national reputations \u2014 again \u2014 to the words of an unpredictable president. Donnelly said she thought Trump could still win back their business: \u201cDepends on what Donald says next.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to questions about the special-events business at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSpecial events and ballroom rentals are not Mar-a-Lago\u2019s only source of income. It reported $25 million in revenue last year, which also includes members\u2019 dues and income from restaurants, guest rooms and wedding rentals.\n\nBut the ballroom rentals were previously a key part of the club\u2019s value. They didn\u2019t just bring in money. They brought in Palm Beach itself \u2014 allowing Trump to play host to the old-money crowd that once regarded him as a garish outsider.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nThat has changed.\n\nTo measure Mar-a-Lago\u2019s reduction in business, The Post examined public calendars of Palm Beach society events and interviews with Mar-a-Lago\u2019s current or former customers.\n\nThat tally found about 20 events planned between Halloween and Mother\u2019s Day, where outside groups had paid Trump\u2019s club to rent space, including the six galas.\n\nThose totals appeared lower than the figures for the same period in 2016 to 2017, when Trump was elected. That year, The Post counted 40 events, including 22 high-dollar galas.\n\nThis year, many of Trump\u2019s old customers are holding their events at his longtime rival, a Palm Beach resort called the Breakers. Its charity business increased 50 percent last year. And this year, Trump\u2019s loss is still their gain.\n\n\u201cAlmost all [the charities] are returning to The Breakers next year and we are very happy to have them back,\u201d said Paul Leone, CEO of Trump\u2019s rival, in a written statement.\n\nThe groups holding events at Mar-a-Lago include two charities that left last year and are now returning. One, an eye institute at the University of Miami, said they came back to Mar-a-Lago only when the Breakers \u2014 its first choice \u2014 didn\u2019t have availability.\n\nThe other, a group that helps adults with disabilities, said they came back for a simple reason: money.\n\n\u201cOur job is to raise money for the clients we serve,\u201d Glen Torcivia, a board member at the Palm Beach Habilitation Center, told the Palm Beach Post. When they moved their luncheon away from Mar-a-Lago last year, they raised less money.\n\nSo: \u201cWe\u2019re going back to Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Torcivia told the Palm Beach Post.\n\nAnother set of Mar-a-Lago customers this season are longtime clients who never left, even after Charlottesville.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Foundation \u2014 which once gave Trump an award after he donated $150,000 he had gotten from another family\u2019s charity \u2014 is coming back for a gala. The World Affairs Council of Palm Beach, which has hosted speakers at the club, is holding a talk by foreign-affairs expert Gordon Chang called \u201cTrump, China and North Korea: War or Peace?\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly did not choose the venue. They just invited me to speak,\u201d Chang said in a phone interview. He said that, if Trump were to drop by during Chang\u2019s remarks, the president may not like what he hears: Chang believes that Trump has allowed North Korea too much leeway to violate and evade sanctions this year, as Trump says he \u201cfell in love\u201d with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cIt would be extremely unlikely that the president would like what I\u2019ve said about his policies on North Korea,\u201d Chang said.\n\nOther events at the club will include two dinners put on by the Marriott Vacation Club, a timeshare business. The dinners, which Marriott owners can buy with \u201cpoints\u201d earned in Marriott\u2019s system, could mark the first time that dinner at a sitting president\u2019s home has been offered as a perk to timeshare owners.\n\nThere will be two car shows, which will use Mar-a-Lago\u2019s huge lawn to show off classic automobiles. One of them, the Palm Event, is coming back to Mar-a-Lago after a couple of years at another site.\n\nThe risk of political blowback \u201cscared the heck out of me. It really did. And I was trying as best I could not to take politics into consideration. And it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s at the president\u2019s house,\u201d said Scott Shrader, the Palm Event\u2019s president. But he said that, among his customers, there has been a lot of interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually surprised me. So far it\u2019s been a net positive,\u201d Shrader said.\n\nThen there are Trump\u2019s allies, the groups that rushed in when others rushed out.\n\nOne conservative group has already held an event at Mar-a-Lago this season: On Nov. 13, the state-focused organization GOPAC held a reception there for Republican state legislators.\n\nNext month, Turning Point USA \u2014 a group aimed at college Republicans and young conservatives \u2014 will hold its \u201cfirst annual Winter Gala\u201d at the club on Dec. 20. The tickets start at $2,500 each.\n\nAnd early next year, the club will host another gala put on by the Trumpettes USA. One of its leaders, Toni Holt Kramer, is a Mar-a-Lago member who decided to have a party to show Trump that his real supporters had not left him.\n\n\u201cThe message that I\u2019m sending to the president \u2014 that all of us, myself and everybody who\u2019s attending [is sending] \u2014 is how grateful, how absolutely grateful, how humbled we are to have him as the president,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHe is our only, our only, only chance to keep this country. To keep this country the way it should be.\u201d\n\nHer group, which held a raucous celebration at the club in January, will be back in February, at a party featuring singer Lee Greenwood, Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro and former game-show host Wink Martindale.\n\nShe expects 700 people, Trump fans from all over the country and the world. The main difference this time is that the ticket price has been raised, from $300 to $550.\n\nKramer said Trump\u2019s club wouldn\u2019t give them the same discount as before. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it again,\u201d she said they told her."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "European court orders Turkey to free ex-Kurdish party leader", "description": "The European Court of Human Rights has called on Turkey to release the former head of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition from pre-trial detention", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-court-orders-turkey-to-free-ex-kurdish-party-leader/2018/11/20/2b4549fc-ecb3-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:58:12Z", "content": "ANKARA, Turkey The European Court of Human Rights has called on Turkey to release the former head of Turkeys pro-Kurdish opposition from detention.

She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\u201d The other key quote: \u201cBoth Trump and Clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records.\u201d\n\nGlobal Power\n\nThe consequences of 'America First': A confluence of world events over the past few weeks highlights the uniquely transactional approach to foreign policy by the Trump White House, resulting in the prioritization of President Trump's brand of nationalism and economics over the promotion of American values and morality in a number of high-profile global situations.\n\nThe most prominent example of this dynamic is Saudi Arabia, where President Trump has refused to apply public pressure to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump is (yet again) skeptical of an assessment made by his own intelligence agencies that MBS was directly in involved in ordering Khashoggi's killing.\n\nKey idea: \u201cTrump has struggled to balance his interest in maintaining strong relations with the Saudi government with growing pressure in Congress and around the world to punish the Saudi regime. Trump has told aides that he wants Mohammed to stay in power and that he sees the Saudis as the best strategic check on Iran and as a vital source of oil,\u201d The Post reported over the weekend.\n\nNot going there: \u201cIf the president had his way, he would stay entirely out of the Middle East and all of the problems. This is a problem that he wants to go away,\u201d an adviser who talks to Trump told The Post.\n\nUnderstanding Trump: \u201cHuman rights isn\u2019t an issue he spends time on,\u201d a former Trump campaign official explained of the president's leadership \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 on human rights. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be on the hook \u2014 that\u2019s why he\u2019s refused to engage. It\u2019s all about cost,\u201d the source told Power Up.\n\nMembers of Trump's own party don't necessarily agree with the president's approach: \u201cI\u2019m open to having Congress sit down with the president if this all turns out to be true, and it looks like it is, \u2026 and saying, \u2018How can we express our condemnation without blowing up the Middle East?\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters in October regarding Khashoggi. \u201cOur foreign policy has to be anchored in values.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the emphasis on human rights as core to American values has been a bipartisan issue for nearly 70 years, according to Amy Lehr, the director of the Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the U.N. General Assembly was an initiative chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nThe tension between national security interests and human rights is something grappled with by every administration. Last night, for example, The Post reported the administration was set to list Venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism in what was billed as a \u201cdramatic escalation\u201d against its socialist government led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. And a federal judge ruled last night the Trump administration cannot block asylum claims by Central Americans who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nA few other examples of this push-pull dynamic:\n\nMyanmar: The Post's Shibani Mahtani and John Hudson reported last week that key players inside the State Department signed off on a memo concluding that Myanmar's military and its allies had committed \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d which would normally be \u201ca green light for a tough U.S. response to systematic slayings and mass expulsions against Myanmar\u2019s minority Rohingya Muslim population.\u201d But the report ultimately did not become policy and Congress is now seeking to obtain it to understand why Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u201cdid not follow the memo\u2019s recommendation for a crimes-against-humanity designation.\u201d\n\nYemen: One of Trump's first decisions was to resume arm sales to Saudi Arabia, a \u201csign of reinvigorated U.S. support for the kingdom\u2019s involvement in its neighbor\u2019s ongoing civil war\u201d and a break from the Obama administration's attempt to \u201climit civilian deaths in a conflict that has pushed Yemen to the brink of widespread famine.\u201d Following Khashoggi's death, the administration did halt the practice of refueling Saudi-coalition aircraft used in Yemen.\n\nNorth Korea: Gone are the days of name-calling \u2014 as of late, Trump has praised North Korea. He said that he and Kim Jong Un \u201cfell in love\u201d over \u201cbeautiful letters.\u201d This past summer, Trump expressed what one historian called \u201cdictator envy\u201d during an interview with Fox News, \u201cHe\u2019s the head of a country, and I mean he\u2019s the strong head. Don\u2019t let anyone think anything different. He speaks, and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same,\u201d Trump said. (He later claimed it was a joke.)\n\nHuman rights observers aren't laughing. \u201cWhen the President expresses positive emotions about authoritarian leaders, it emboldens them and could lead to really problematic impacts on people in those countries in the long run. Our allies \u2026 they are really confused by this change in U.S. policy,\u201d Lehr told us. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an understanding that human rights applies universally,\u201d said Sarah Margon, the D.C. director for Human Rights Watch.\n\nA former Human Rights Campaign-er readies for Congress: Power Up talked with Rep.-elect Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) about Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine. Malinowski is the rare diplomat who jumped into politics: the former assistant secretary of state for democracy at Obama's State Department and ex-chief advocate at the Human Rights Watch, unseated Republican incumbent Leonard Lance in the 2018s.\n\nMalinowski joins a crew of freshmen House Democrats with national security and diplomacy experience. Malinowsky says the administration has taken some actions in places like Burma, where it has imposed sanctions and it did end up using the Magnitsky Act against Russia, despite Trump's embrace of the Kremlin.\n\nHowever: \u201c The big problem is whether the State Department acts or doesn't act in a particular situation almost doesn't matter because the fight for human rights around the world is first and foremost a battle of ideas and the president \u2014 the way he talks about the press and independent judiciary and torture and other values that the U.S. has stood up for around the world is indistinguishable from how dictators talk about those things.\u201d\n\nBottom line: \u201cWe can\u2019t stand up for values around the world if the president actively and loudly rejects them in his domestic policies,\u201d Malinkowski told us. Trumps language \u201ccan be a death sentence for dissidents around the world who depend on human rights norms for protection.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk lashed out at critics, accusing them of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d the Russian candidate Alexander Prokopchuk. (Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Interpol is facing a pivotal \u2014 some say possibly fatal \u2014 moment in its history as members decide whether to hand its presidency to a man who represents Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nKremlin critics fear they could soon face arrest wherever they go. Western governments worry that Russia could use the post to undermine the rule of law.\n\nInterpol, which elects a new president Wednesday, has weathered many challenges in its 95 years. While Hollywood has portrayed it as a hive of swashbuckling agents, in reality it\u2019s an organization sometimes tangled in red tape and clashing geopolitical interests. Nazis took it over in the 1930s, and authoritarian governments have long tried to use it to hunt down fugitive dissenters.\n\nBut the latest storm of criticism comes at an exceptional time \u2014 just as Russia is trying to expand its global clout and as some powerful countries are questioning whether they need multilateral organizations like Interpol at all.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is choosing the agency\u2019s new president at a meeting in Dubai where the front-runner is Alexander Prokopchuk, a general in Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry who is currently an Interpol vice president. Interpol\u2019s interim president, South Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Yang, is also seeking the post.\n\nTwo prominent Kremlin critics warned Tuesday that electing a high-placed Russian would undermine the international law enforcement agency and politicize police cooperation across borders.\n\nBill Browder, who runs an investment fund that had once operated in Moscow, and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky told reporters in London that Putin has tried to use Interpol to hunt down critics such as themselves. Having a Russian lead the agency could intensify such efforts to silence dissent, they said.\n\nActivists argue that the organization needs to increase recent efforts at muscular reform, and this won\u2019t happen if Prokopchuk becomes president, because of his ties to Putin.\n\n\u201cIt was his government that organized a terrorist attack in the U.K. using chemical weapons in Salisbury. It was his government that shot down MH17, killing 298 innocent individuals. It was his government that cheated and hacked in elections in the United States and Europe,\u201d Browder said of Putin. \u201cTo put his representative in charge of the most important international crime-fighting organization is like putting the mafia in charge.\u201d\n\nTo Moscow, the complaints are all part of a Western-led campaign to weaken a resurgent Russia.\n\nRussia denies accusations of foreign interference and announced new charges against Browder this week in a long-running legal battle against him. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Irina Volk accused critics Tuesday of running a \u201ccampaign to discredit\u201d Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\n\nBrowder has pressed for sanctions against Russian officials charged with human rights abuses after his former lawyer died in custody. Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, spent a decade in prison after exhibiting political ambitions. Both said their notoriety would make them poor targets for abuse, adding that they were motivated to speak out because many other less-well-known campaigners would be silenced if governments are allowed to export repression.\n\nThe White House came out Tuesday against the election of Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying that \u201cthe Russian government abuses Interpol\u2019s processes to harass its political opponents.\u201d He said the U.S. \u201cstrongly endorses\u201d Kim.\n\nAdded U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: \u201cWe encourage all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world\u2019s most critical law enforcement bodies. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that.\u201d\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly is made up of its 192 member states, each of which has an equal vote.\n\nBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing \u201cred notices\u201d that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world\u2019s \u201cmost-wanted\u201d list.\n\nCritics argue that countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China have used the system to try to round up political opponents, journalists or activists.\n\nThe watchdog group Fair Trials International detailed in a report last month the strides Interpol has made in reducing political abuse of red notices. The group\u2019s chief, Jago Russell, said a Russian official as Interpol president could stall or reverse those reforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal moment for Interpol,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cEither countries back away from it and find other ways to cooperate, or Interpol fixes its system so that it can be trusted. ... Already there are noises about pulling out of Interpol\u201d and creating a separate agency just for democratic countries, he said.\n\nThe U.S. seems committed to Interpol for now, but has pulled out of UNESCO and international accords under President Donald Trump. Britain is pulling out of the European Union and has expressed concern about management of international bodies funded by taxpayers.\n\nInterpol itself won\u2019t comment on the upcoming vote. The Interpol presidency is more of an oversight position, compared with the hands-on leadership role of the secretary-general.\n\nInterpol\u2019s charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, and two years ago it introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out.\n\nBut the possibility of a Putin loyalist in such a prominent role has prompted concern among those critical of the Russian president\u2019s leadership. Four U.S. senators, including Marco Rubio, have urged the Trump administration to oppose the Prokopchuk candidacy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who on Monday stated that Russia was \u201crooting for the Russian candidate,\u201d said that amounted to meddling in the vote.\n\nFair Trials International warned that a Russian president of Interpol could try to limit the money spent on staff needed to vet red notices, for example, or get rid of a recent measure to protect refugees from unfair arrest.\n\nThis is far from the first time that Interpol\u2019s votes are causing controversy.\n\nHuman rights groups raised the alarm two years ago when Interpol\u2019s general assembly approved Meng Hongwei, a longtime senior Chinese security official, as president. Amnesty International criticized \u201cChina\u2019s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad.\u201d\n\nMeng is now under arrest in China as part of a possible domestic political purge \u2014 hence Wednesday\u2019s emergency vote to replace him.\n\nInterpol\u2019s general assembly also votes on membership, such as Tuesday when they rejected admitting Kosovo. Interpol members voted last year to admit Palestine as a member, creating an uproar in Israel.\n\n___\n\nCharlton reported from Paris.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nThe \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States has been a fixture of international politics for decades. Could Washington now also have a \u201cspecial friend\u201d in Ireland?\n\nDaniel Mulhall, Ireland\u2019s ambassador in Washington, thinks so. And he says it\u2019s largely because of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cBrexit is a game-changer for Ireland,\u201d Mulhall said to The Washington Post. \u201cWe become a bridge between the European Union and the United States both for investment but also for influence,\u201d he added.\n\nThose hopes even have a tangible symbol: This month, seeking to expand its diplomatic mission in Washington, the Irish government closed a deal to buy a 6,500-square-foot building once used by the Egyptian Embassy. It\u2019s still a far cry from Britain\u2019s gargantuan embassy compound, one of the biggest in Washington, but it\u2019s a signal of Dublin\u2019s intent.\n\nBefore he took up residence in Washington last year, Mulhall served as Ireland\u2019s ambassador to Britain. He personally campaigned against Britain\u2019s vote to leave the E.U. in 2016; after British voters approved Brexit, he later told a reporter, he felt \u201csadness\u201d that Britain\u2019s relationship with Ireland was being risked.\n\nNow he sees Brexit as a new opportunity for Ireland \u2014 one that could rival many Brexiteers' own hopes for an economic future that relies on greater trade with the United States and other nations outside of Europe.\n\n\u201cBritain is under a cloud of uncertainty as far as its future access to the European single market in concerned,\u201d Mulhall said. \u201cWe feel that any country that\u2019s looking at either expanding its presence in Europe or establishing a presence for the first time will look less favorably on Britain and more favorably on Ireland.\u201d\n\nAfter Brexit, British leaders have clung to the idea of an unbending Anglo-American bond. British Prime Minister Theresa May was the first world leader to visit President Trump after he took office last year. Both leaders praised the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d during that visit, with May saying it was based \u201con the bonds of history, of family, kinship and common interests.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, Britain\u2019s position as a member of the E.U. was one of its key selling points. \u201cWe are strong and active members of the European Union, the gateway to the world\u2019s largest single market,\u201d said May\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron, in a 2010 speech.\n\nWith Britain looking to leave the E.U., many other E.U. countries are now pledging to become Washington\u2019s new \u201cgateway to Europe.\u201d Ireland may be a particularly attractive base for American companies: Its common-law system is similar to the American legal structure, and it is known for being one of the most business-friendly countries in the E.U.\n\nAnd, of course, Ireland and the United States share a common language. \u201cWe will be the only English-speaking country left in the European Union,\u201d Mulhall pointed out.\n\nOutside experts agree that Ireland is well positioned to strengthen its ties to the United States. \u201cIreland\u2019s institutions have been calibrated toward attracting U.S. investment for decades, which places the country in a strong position to attract investment which may pivot away from the U.K. post-Brexit,\u201d said Neil Dooley, a politics lecturer at the University of Sussex.\n\nGiven that Ireland is a relatively small country \u2014 just 4.7 million people \u2014 even a small change could have profound effects on the economy. Irish firms are in the process of reforming their business plans for a post-Brexit future, according to Sean Davis, the regional director for Enterprise Ireland, a state economic agency that promotes new export sales.\n\nDavis said that 73 percent of Irish companies that work with Enterprise Ireland have taken some kind of action to deal with a post-Brexit future. That often means planning to steer their exports away from Britain. \u201cThe U.K. is going to become less attractive to Irish companies,\u201d Davis said.\n\nCompanies sponsored by Enterprise Ireland opened 59 offices in the United States last year, according to Davis. In total, there are more than 800 Irish-owned companies in the United States, with 100,000 people employed by Irish-origin companies.\n\nThat\u2019s a useful talking point given the Trump administration\u2019s focus on protecting American jobs, but there could be other issues down the line. The United States has a considerable trade deficit with the Ireland, and Trump has specifically called out the country as a \u201ctax haven.\u201d The tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017 appear to have hit U.S. investment in Ireland, according to Irish estimates.\n\nAnd with Trump, there\u2019s always the risk of unexpected feuds. The president is at odds with the Irish government on a variety of foreign policy issues; he has already canceled one trip to Ireland amid planned mass protests.\n\nAs such, any hopes for a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d with this president at least, may be premature. \u201cI don\u2019t think Ireland kids itself that it has a special, meaningful relationship with the U.S.,\u201d said Brian Lucey, a professor at Trinity Business School at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cParticularly with Trump, where there\u2019s a hard-nosed, mercantilist approach.\u201d\n\nBut Mulhall argued Ireland knows how quickly things can change. \u201cWe were by far the poorest E.U. country\u201d 40 years ago, he said. \u201cToday we\u2019re one of the richest ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is, I think, one of the most exciting projects of my 40-year career in the foreign service,\u201d he said of Ireland\u2019s new global ambition. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer a weak country trying to pull itself up by its bootstraps. We now have strengths and we need to deploy those strengths to advance our interest further in this changing and sometimes volatile international environment.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIreland, worried about peace process, considers recognition of a Palestinian state\n\nCan Brexit be stopped?

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThis month, the Trump presidency hit a new low in its already difficult relationship with American democratic norms. On Nov. 7, President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, apparently because he recused himself from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign, as the law requires. The next day, the president suspended the White House press credentials of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta for reporting on him critically and threatened to do the same for other journalists who do not \u201ctreat the White House with respect.\u201d And the day after that, Trump falsely accused Democrats of voter fraud in Arizona, Florida and Georgia, where his favored candidates appeared to be losing ground as ballot counting continued in closely contested races.\n\nAs a candidate and president, Trump has tested \u2014 and in some instances broken \u2014 established norms of democratic politics. He has expressed admiration for autocrats and reacted with indifference to violations of democratic principles abroad. Yet his approval ratings among Americans, while low when compared to other presidents, seem to have scarcely budged throughout his presidency.\n\nDo Americans value democracy enough to punish politicians who disregard democratic principles? And specifically, what fraction of the U.S. electorate is willing to prioritize democratic principles when the price of doing so is voting against their policy interests or partisan loyalties? Our research suggests the number is lower than you might think.\n\n[Populists have one big thing right: Democracies are becoming less open]\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nTo answer this question, we conducted the following experiment. Rather than asking about support for democracy directly, we presented a representative sample of 1,692 U.S. voters, recruited through LUCID and benchmarked against the American National Election survey, with a choice between two hypothetical candidates. Each was described by experimentally assigned attributes typically seen in elections, including their experience, policy proposals and partisan affiliation.\n\nCrucially, a randomly chosen subset of those candidates were also described as supporting measures that violated a fundamental democratic principle. These included violating civil liberties, such as prosecuting journalists who refuse to reveal sources, banning protests by far-right or left groups; encroaching on the separation of powers, such as ignoring unfavorable court rulings and governing by executive orders; and undermining fair electoral competition, such as gerrymandering or cutting the number of polling stations in areas that support the other party.\n\nFor the most part, these undemocratic proposals were modeled on practices that elected incumbents have recently used to undermine democracy around the world, as in Hungary, Turkey and Venezuela. Some of these practices, like gerrymandering and voter suppression, have shown up in the United States.\n\nWe then asked our respondents which candidate they would vote for. Based on the more than 21,000 candidate choices that our respondents made, we can answer a central question about the robustness of American democracy: Are voters willing to punish candidates who violate democratic principles when doing so requires voting against their political ideology, policy priorities or partisan loyalties?\n\n[Is democracy really in danger? The picture is not as dire as you think.]\n\nWe found a striking fragility in Americans\u2019 willingness to defend core democratic values\n\nOverall, candidates who proposed a policy that violated a key democratic principle lost 11 percent of voters who would have otherwise supported them.\n\nTo arrive at this figure, we compared two groups of respondents. Those in the control group were choosing between two \u201cgeneric\u201d candidates, both of whom held positions perfectly consistent with democratic principles. By contrast, one of the two candidates seen by respondents in the experimental group endorsed a measure that violates a fundamental democratic principle. All other candidate attributes, including policies and party, were randomly assigned and thus balanced across the two groups. The only systematic difference between the control and experimental groups was one candidate\u2019s endorsement of an undemocratic position. We can therefore interpret a decline in that candidate\u2019s vote share as the voters\u2019 punishment for that candidate\u2019s disregard for democratic principles.\n\nYes, that 11 percent might decide an election. But consider who did not abandon the undemocratic candidate. Respondents who felt strongly about policies or partisanship punished undemocratic candidates at lower rates than did those with more moderate political loyalties. These differences among voters increased when our hypothetical candidates proposed more extreme liberal and conservative policies. Polarization eroded the public\u2019s willingness to defend democracy.\n\nThis was amplified when our respondents identified as either a Democrat or a Republican. Only a fraction of our respondents \u2014 those who identified as independents but said they leaned toward one of the two parties \u2014 were willing to vote for the \u201cother\u201d party in large enough numbers to defeat an undemocratic candidate of their own party. Both Democrats and Republicans used a double standard, punishing undemocratic candidates more harshly when they belonged to the \u201cother\u201d party. Put differently, many Americans appear to be partisans first and small-d democrats only second.\n\nWhat does this mean for American democracy?\n\nWhen social scientists ask respondents around the world about their attitudes toward democracy, they typically use questions such as, \u201cDemocracy may have problems but it is the best system of government; do you agree?\u201d Americans systematically respond with some of the highest levels of support for democracy.\n\nBut our findings suggest that this conventional wisdom may rest on fragile foundations. Instead of asking about support for democracy directly, we inferred citizens\u2019 commitment to democratic principles from how they told us they would actually vote.\n\nWhat we found suggests that Americans may value democratic principles \u2014 but few will choose those over their partisan loyalties. And when voters place policy and partisanship above democratic principles, why wouldn\u2019t politicians?\n\nRecently, Republicans are the ones most often accused of undermining democratic principles for partisan gain. But this may be because Democrats have had few opportunities to do the same: Since 2010, Republicans have controlled most state legislatures and governorships, and few GOP politicians have objected to Trump\u2019s incursions against democratic norms.\n\nYet in our experiment, respondents who identified as Democrats were just as unwilling to abandon their party\u2019s candidates as were Republicans. And some Democrats have begun to advocate fighting fire with fire.\n\nSuch a strategy risks undermining the legitimacy of the democratic process. This month\u2019s events indicate that the toughest tests of America\u2019s democratic foundations under the Trump presidency may be ahead. When partisans on both sides believe they must disregard democratic principles because that\u2019s what the other side is doing, the norms that democracies depend on \u2014 including the respect for election results \u2014 may be in danger.\n\nMatthew Graham is a PhD candidate at Yale University.\n\nMilan Svolik is a professor of political science at Yale University and the author of \u201cThe Politics of Authoritarian Rule\u201d (Cambridge University Press, 2012)."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Matt Rogers", "title": "D.C.-area forecast: Temperatures get colder through Thanksgiving, then weekend rain", "description": "Travel plans are unimpeded going into the Thanksgiving holiday", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/20/dc-area-forecast-temperatures-get-colder-through-thanksgiving-then-weekend-rain/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oz-jEGx-3lwvvjOmbGT5qM_C4UY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNHZRVFVS5DYTAR5WZ3R2Q3NEQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:00:07Z", "content": "TODAYS DAILY DIGIT 7/10: Cant complain with no snow or rain, but still in the crisp, cool weather lane.

The 36-year-old mother of four was naked, her body sprawled on a roadside. She had been strangled.

The 21-year-old was last seen four nights earlier leaving a bar with a stranger in August 1982. She also had been strangled.\n\nNearly 700 miles west, Melissa Thomas turned up in a church cemetery in Opelousas, La. It was January 1996. Again, strangled.\n\nThe three cases \u2014 separated by hundreds of miles and spread over 18 years \u2014 each stumped local law enforcement. Eventually, the crimes slid into obscurity. The passing years chipped away at witnesses\u2019 memories. Evidence sat in storage, or was misplaced, or swallowed up by hurricanes. Family members mourned publicly, then sank into the private ritual of grieving for the victim of an unsolved crime. Over the years, cold case detectives would try to kick loose new information. A local television station might run a story to mark a grim anniversary.\n\nUnknown to anyone, there was an invisible thread running through each murder \u2014 and possibly many more. Authorities only learned about the link this summer, when a 78-year-old serial killer began talking in his Texas jail cell.\n\nIn September 2014, Samuel Little was convicted in Los Angeles of the cold-case murders of three women between 1987 and 1989. DNA evidence linked Little \u2014 also known as Samuel McDowell \u2014 to the slayings. He was given three life sentences, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut last summer, Little\u2019s DNA also connected him to the unsolved 1994 murder of an Odessa, Tex., woman named Denise Christie Brothers \u2014 another young woman strangled and dumped. In July, Little was indicted on a charge in the crime, and transferred to Texas. According to a release from the Ector County District Attorney\u2019s Office, a Texas Ranger named James Holland struck up a rapport with Little, and the elderly man began talking.\n\n\u201cPeople for years have been trying to get a confession out of him, and James Holland is the one who finally got him to give that information,\u201d Bobby Bland, the Ector County district attorney, told the Associated Press.\n\nHis words delivered a shock. Little claimed he was responsible for more than 90 murders nationwide between 1970 and 2013. If the those numbers prove true, the serial killer\u2019s run would be historic.\n\n\u201cIf all of these are confirmed, I mean, he\u2019ll be the most prolific serial killer, with confirmed killings, in American history,\u201d Bland said.\n\nSince Little\u2019s confession, he has already been linked to 30 unsolved crimes. Authorities have confirmed his role in at least nine cases, including Critchfield, Hill and Thomas. Right now, law enforcement officials from across the country continue to trek to his jail cell, hauling along their open case files, hoping the convicted killer can offer answers.\n\n\u201cSo far we don\u2019t have any false information coming from him,\u201d Bland told the Associated Press.\n\nLittle\u2019s 90 murders would rank him among the most deadly American killers. Ted Bundy is suspected of killing at least 30 victims. Randy Kraft claimed he killed as many as 65 people, but was convicted in 1989 of 16 deaths. Convicted of 49 murders, Gary Ridgway, the \u201cGreen River Killer,\u201d is thought to be the country\u2019s most prolific serial killer.\n\nNow hobbled by poor health and using a wheelchair, Little was once a towering 6-foot-3, tipping the scales at more than 200 pounds, the L.A. Times reported in 2014. Born in Georgia, he was raised by his grandmother in Ohio. By the time he was 16, Little was picked up on his first criminal charge for breaking and entering, the AP reported.\n\nJail would be the common denominator in his cross-country vagabond life. Between 1957 and 1975, he was arrested 26 times in 11 states on charges ranging from shoplifting and fraud to rape and aggravated assault on a police officer. As Little told California police in an interview, during his incarceration, he put his large hands to use boxing fellow inmates. \u201cI used to be a prizefighter,\u201d he told investigators, according to the AP.\n\nThose hands would be his weapon of choice as he turned to murder, prosecutors at his Los Angeles trial alleged. Little purposely preyed on troubled targets \u2014 drug addicts and prostitutes. He would knock them unconscious with the punches he had fine-tuned in jail, then strangle his victims while masturbating.\n\nThat violent streak first came to the attention of authorities in 1976, when a St. Louis drug addict named Pamela Kay Smith was found banging on a random house door for help. The AP reported she was naked below the waist and her hands were tied behind her back with electrical cord. The woman told police a man had picked her up, choked her, then beat and raped her before she escaped.\n\nPolice arrested Little in a car matching the victim\u2019s description. Smith\u2019s clothes were inside. \u201cI only beat her,\u201d he reportedly told police.\n\nRemarkably, Little only served three months in jail after being convicted of assault with the intent to ravish-rape in December 1976.\n\nThe Missouri conviction would set a pattern for Little for the next decade. A peripatetic loner with no fixed address, he was regularly arrested or suspected of violent attacks on women. But he always managed to squeeze free.\n\nIn 1982, the remains of a Pascagoula, Miss., woman named Melinda LaPree were discovered in a cemetery. She was last spotted with Little. As police investigated, two prostitutes came forward to allege Little had attacked them both. He was arrested for both LaPree\u2019s murder and the two assaults. But a grand jury failed to indict, the AP reported.\n\nThat same year, Little was charged with the murder of Patricia Ann Mount in Forest Grove, Fla. His January 1984 trial ended in acquittal.\n\nMonths later, in October 1984, Little was charged in San Diego for attacking a woman. The jury deadlocked in an attempted murder trial, and Little agreed to plead guilty to assault and false imprisonment. He served 2\u2153 years. After his release, Little relocated to Southern California.\n\nAccording to NBC Los Angeles, Carol Alford was found murdered in a South Los Angeles alley in 1987. Two years later, Audrey Nelson was found murdered in a downtown trash bin. Also in 1989, Guadalupe Apodaca\u2019s body turned up in an abandoned building. All three cases went cold until April 2012, when a detective put DNA evidence found on the bodies into a national database. The results linked to Little.\n\nIn 2014, he was finally put on trial and convicted. \u201cThis is a man \u2026 who believes he can take whatever he wants from women,\u201d prosecutor Beth Silverman told the Los Angeles jury, the Times reported.\n\nThe conviction put Little away for the rest of his life.\n\nBut as the killer\u2019s current confessions show, a much darker current of violence ran beneath his official criminal record.\n\nIn recent months, since Little began talking in Texas, law enforcement officials have linked him to nine murders in five states so far.\n\nAuthorities in Macon, Ga., say Little was behind two unsolved slayings there, the 1977 murder of a still-unidentified woman and the 1982 strangling of Fredonia Smith. According to the Macon Telegraph, Little \u201cgave investigators specific details and information which linked him to both.\u201d\n\nPolice in Mississippi say Little has admitted to two killings \u2014 LaPree in 1982 and Critchfield in 1978, WLOX reported.\n\nAuthorities in Russell County, Ala., now know Little was behind the 1979 murder of 23-year-old Brenda Alexander. In Texas, Little told investigators about picking the woman up at a local disco. \u201cHe wringed his hands together, smiled and said, \u2018I knew she was mine,'' an investigator told the Ledger-Enquirer.\n\nRosie Hill\u2019s 1982 murder in Florida has also been tied to the killer, WCJB reported.\n\nAccording to the Advocate, Little has confessed to three murders in Louisiana: the 1982 murder of 55-year-old Dorothy Richards; the 1996 death of 29-year-old Melissa Thomas; and the 1996 murder of 40-year-old Daisy McGuire.\n\nThese jurisdictions are facing the tricky question of whether to prosecute Little. He is already set to spend the rest of his life in prison.

(Ng Han Guan/Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 A Chinese university\u2019s plan to conduct a blanket search of student and staff electronic devices has come under fire, illustrating the limits of the population\u2019s tolerance for surveillance and raising the prospect that tactics used on Muslim minorities may be creeping into the rest of the country.\n\nThe Guilin University of Electronic Technology is reconsidering a search of cellphones, computers, external hard disks and USB drives after a copy of the order leaked online and triggered such an intense backlash that it drew rare criticism in state-run newspapers.\n\nSearches of electronics are common in Xinjiang in China\u2019s far west, a heavily Muslim region that has been turned into a virtual police state to tamp down unrest. They are unheard of in most other areas, including where the school is located in the southern Guangxi region, a popular tourist destination known for spectacular scenery, not violence or terrorism.\n\nThat\u2019s why the planned checks worry some.\n\n\u201cXinjiang has emerged as China\u2019s surveillance laboratory,\u201d said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic politics and national identity at La Trobe University in Australia. \u201cIt is unsurprising that some of the methods first pioneered in China\u2019s west are now being rolled out in other regions.\u201d\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, the government has in recent years tried to tighten controls over what the public sees and says online and stepped up political oversight of universities. Sometimes, these measures have run into a new generation of Chinese accustomed to greater freedoms, sparking public outcry and occasionally government retreat.\n\nThe leaked notice in Guilin warned that hostile domestic groups and foreign powers are \u201cwantonly spreading illicit and illegal videos\u201d through the internet. It said the search for violent, terrorist, reactionary and obscene content, which was to be conducted this month, was necessary to resist and combat extremist recordings that it called mentally harmful.\n\nThe order triggered a public uproar last week.\n\nPosts on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo site with hashtags on schools checking electronic devices were viewed nearly 80 million times. Users voiced privacy concerns, comparing the measure to computer chips inserted in brains and the George Orwell novel \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nThen came critical editorials in state-run publications saying the notice could violate Chinese constitutional protection of the right to communicate freely and have those communications remain confidential.\n\n\u201cIf colleges and universities check the phones, computers, and hard disks of teachers and students, they\u2019re suspected of infringing on communication freedom and privacy,\u201d said an editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily. \u201cThose responsible at the school should be held accountable, as they had a great negative impact on the school\u2019s image.\u201d\n\nAdministrators told another state-owned publication, \u201cThe Paper,\u201d that the search had not yet been carried out, and that they were considering reducing its scope. University and local education ministry officials referred questions to a media office, which did not answer repeated phone calls.\n\nWeibo, while not a government body, ran into hot water in April when it said it would censor content related to gay issues on its microblog. The company backpedaled under intense criticism, including from state-run publications.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the Guilin university\u2019s planned search. It could have been a trial run to see how the public would react or an overzealous local administrator, said Christopher Colley, a National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates assistant professor who has lectured at Chinese universities.\n\nEither way, he said, the backlash shows that though online censorship is common in China, physical searches of phones and laptops is an extreme measure that many will not accept.\n\n\u201cMost people in China are willing to tolerate Big Brother as long as it contributes to social stability, but for many, this is going too far,\u201d Colley said.\n\nSchools in Xinjiang have been conducting similar searches since the region\u2019s highest court in early 2014 issued a notice forbidding audio and video recordings promoting terrorism, religious extremism and ethnic division.\n\nTeachers and administrators at Xinjiang Normal University\u2019s College of Physics and Electronics searched electronic devices in every dormitory on campus on Nov. 9, 2014. A post about the search on the school\u2019s website says, \u201cThrough investigating violent and terroristic videos, religious extremism on campus has been weakened.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, China University of Petroleum\u2019s branch in Karamay, a city in oil country in Xinjiang\u2019s north, ordered various school departments to assign inspectors to search the computers of all teachers on campus.\n\nXinjiang is home to a large Uighur population, a Muslim ethnic group that has long harbored simmering resentment against rule from Beijing. A series of riots and attacks blamed on separatist Uighurs has prompted a sweeping crackdown on Muslims in the region.\n\nChina has rolled out one of the world\u2019s most aggressive surveillance and policing programs both in Xinjiang and neighboring Tibet.\n\nUighurs are regularly singled out and stopped at checkpoints to have their smartphones scanned for religious content. As The Associated Press reported in May, they risk being detained and sent to internment camps if police find songs or videos they deem suspicious or apps that are commonly used to contact people outside China, such as WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cXinjiang today appears to be the leading-edge of a highly intrusive and coercive surveillance society that the (Communist Party) is intent on constructing across China,\u201d Leibold said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Tigar of San Francisco issued a nationwide restraining order barring enforcement of the policy President Trump announced Nov. 8, which he billed as an urgent attempt to stop the flow of thousands of asylum-seeking families across the border each month.\n\nThe government had said it would allow only people who cross at legal checkpoints to request asylum. Those entering elsewhere could seek a temporary form of protection that is harder to win and doesn\u2019t yield full citizenship. The changes would amount to a transformation of long-established asylum procedures, codified both at the international level and by Congress.\n\n\u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\u201d wrote the judge, whom President Barack Obama nominated to the federal bench in 2012. Tigar reasoned that the \u201cfailure to comply with entry requirements such as arriving at a designated port of entry should bear little, if any, weight in the asylum process.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration said Tuesday it will continue to press the matter in court.\n\nSeveral thousand migrants are now waiting to cross a legal entry point at San Ysidro in San Diego, across from Tijuana. Many are from a caravan that drew Trump\u2019s wrath in the weeks leading up to the midterm election, when he made illegal immigration his closing argument and asserted without evidence that the caravan included \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nLabeling the movements of Central American migrants a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d Trump deployed thousands of active-duty troops and coils of concertina wire to the border. Military officials have indicated they are weighing whether to redeploy some of those troops.\n\nA U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Tuesday that the military was examining whether Tigar\u2019s order changes anything for their operations. However, U.S. troops already had been acting only in a support role to the Department of Homeland Security, with only incidental contact with migrants expected.\n\nTigar said the president could not shift asylum policy on his own. The judge\u2019s order will remain in effect until Dec. 19, at which point the court will consider arguments for a permanent block of the policy.\n\nThe Trump administration suggested the defeat could be temporary, alluding to a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court in June that upheld a revised version of Trump\u2019s travel ban, an effort to bar foreigners from certain majority-Muslim nations and other countries from the United States.\n\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court affirmed this summer, Congress has given the President broad authority to limit or even stop the entry of aliens into this country,\u201d the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security said in a joint statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch\u2019s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.\u201d\n\n\n\nCentral American migrants, as part of the Central American caravan trying to reach the United States, wait to receive a donated dinner in Mexicali, Mexico, on Nov. 19. (Rodrigo Abd/AP)\n\nTigar\u2019s 37-page ruling was the latest in a string of court decisions blocking the administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, including its efforts to crack down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and to rescind deportation protections for about 1 million undocumented immigrants who were either brought to the United States as children or given temporary protected status in this country because of national disasters and unrest in their homelands.\n\nThe government is appealing those rulings.\n\nThe challenge to the asylum ban was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups on behalf of East Bay Sanctuary Covenant. The order reflects the judge\u2019s view that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, and would suffer irreparable injury from the executive action.\n\nIn his proclamation, Trump said the changes were necessary to prepare for the caravan\u2019s arrival, arguing that asylum seekers had no \u201clawful basis for admission into our country.\u201d In justifying the policy, the administration relied on the same emergency authority invoked as grounds for the \u201ctravel ban.\"\n\nIn a hearing Monday, Scott Stewart, a lawyer for the Justice Department, spoke of a \u201ccrushing strain\u201d of migrants attempting to cross the border illegally. He alleged that most asylum claims were \u201cultimately meritless.\u201d\n\nBut the judge seemed skeptical, observing that border apprehensions are near historic lows and that, regardless, federal law says all people on U.S. soil can apply for asylum, no matter how they arrived.\n\n[Trump\u2019s ban on asylum for illegal border crossers challenged in court]\n\nTigar voiced concern for the fate of asylum seekers under the changes. The administration\u2019s rule, he observed, would force people \u201cto choose between violence at the border, violence at home, or giving up a pathway to refugee status.\u201d\n\nAnd in his decision, he wrote that the government\u2019s argument that the manner of entry can be the lone factor rendering a migrant ineligible for asylum \u201cstrains credulity.\"\n\n\u201cTo say that one may apply for something that one has no right to receive is to render the right to apply a dead letter,\u201d he argued. \u201cThere simply is no reasonable way to harmonize the two.\u201d\n\nThe judge pointedly denied the claim that the president, by fiat, could give the manner of entry added legal weight as a determinant of asylum. He reasoned that the \u201cinterpretive guide\u201d of United Nations compacts on asylum lent extra force to congressional requirements. The intent of Congress, Tigar wrote, was \u201cunambiguous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if what Defendants intend to say is that the President by proclamation can override Congress\u2019s clearly expressed legislative intent, simply because a statute conflicts with the President\u2019s policy goals, the Court rejects that argument also,\u201d the judge found.\n\nLee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who argued the case, welcomed the ruling in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban is illegal, will put people\u2019s lives in danger, and raises the alarm about President Trump\u2019s disregard for separation of powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no justifiable reason to flatly deny people the right to apply for asylum, and we cannot send them back to danger based on the manner of their entry. Congress has been clear on this point for decades.\u201d\n\nAs the hearing was underway Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the government had received reports that the migrant caravan was considering rushing the border and closed the travel lanes for a short period.

Hundreds of thousands have fled the country, also known as Burma, for neighboring Bangladesh. He urged her \u201cmultiple times\u201d to pardon the two reporters, a White House official told reporters.\n\n\u201cIn America, we believe in our democratic institutions and our ideals, including a free and independent press,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe arrest and jailing of two journalists last fall was deeply troubling to millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nWhen reporters pointed out that the Trump administration was in a high-profile fight with CNN over the revocation of a White House press pass for correspondent Jim Acosta, Pence rejected the connection: \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison whatsoever between disagreements over decorum at the White House and the imprisonment of the two reporters in Myanmar.\u201d\n\nPence said \u201cthe administration\u201d has stood for a free and independent press. What about the president? The story that unfolds is schizophrenic.\n\nThe Facts\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find examples of Pence publicly defending the media. Indeed, an aide notes that when he was in Congress, after the jailing of New York Times reporter Judith Miller, Pence wrote and co-sponsored reporter shield legislation that would protect journalists\u2019 ability to not reveal sources. In 2007, the Columbia Journalism Review called Pence \u201cjournalism\u2019s best ally in the fight to protect anonymous sources.\u201d\n\nAs vice president, Pence has often publicly reiterated his strong support of press freedom:\n\nIn an interview with Politico\u2019s \u201cPlaybook Live,\u201d Oct. 30: \u201cI do believe that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press. That was enshrined in our Bill of Rights, it was at the core of the American founding, and it\u2019s a core American principle.\u201d\n\nOn Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed by Saudi agents inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, Oct. 15: \u201cAny attack against an innocent individual should be offensive to any American. But an attack on a journalist is an offense to a free and independent press. \u2026 Violence against journalists across the globe is a threat to freedom of the press and human rights. The free world deserves answers.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, July 26: \u201cWhen religious liberty is denied or destroyed, we know that other freedoms \u2014 freedom of speech, of press, assembly, and even democratic institutions themselves \u2014 are imperiled.\u201d\n\nMoreover, on numerous occasions, Pence\u2019s staff pushed back against foreign governments that sought to limit press access for U.S. journalists, such as in Korea, Singapore and Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department provided the Fact Checker with an impressive list of more than 25 statements made by senior officials on press freedom.\n\n\u201cThe United States is a steadfast supporter of freedom of the press around the world. It is a cornerstone of democracy, and is essential to transparency and accountability. The media plays a critical role in promoting vibrant debate, informing citizens, and providing a forum to express differing points of view, particularly on behalf of individuals whose voices are not heard in society,\u201d said spokeswoman Heather Nauert, a former journalist.\n\n\u201cIn too many places around the world, the press courageously practice their profession in the face of great danger,\u201d she added. \u201cWe routinely speak out about the grave injustices reporters confront, and do not shy away from calling on foreign governments \u2014 both privately and publicly \u2014 to end excessive restrictions on press freedom; this work is continuous, even when our diplomatic efforts are not always in the headlines.\u201d\n\nNauert noted that the State Department assesses press freedom in countries in its annual human rights report and has worked to highlight the plight of Uighur journalists in China and the selective targeting of reporters in Russia and has called for the immediate release of the Reuters journalists detained in Myanmar.\n\nBut the tenor of an administration is set by the president. And the president\u2019s words \u2014 the phrases he utters and the tweets he makes \u2014 tell a different story, according to a comprehensive record maintained by factba.se. His commentary about the media is virtually all about how it affects him, especially if he thinks the news coverage is negative. One searches in vain for statements that mirror the language of Pence or State Department officials.\n\nThe tone was set by a tweet President Trump issued in the final months of the 2016 campaign: \u201cIt is not \u2018freedom of the press\u2019 when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\u201d\n\nActually, that\u2019s the core of the First Amendment. News organizations have a responsibility to get it right \u2014 and good ones correct their mistakes \u2014 but as the Supreme Court made clear in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), a public figure must be able to prove a news organization knew a statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether it was false before libel can be considered. The 9-0 ruling setting a standard of \u201cactual malice\u201d notably came in the context of the civil rights movement, as Southern officials repeatedly filed defamation suits to thwart coverage of civil rights.\n\nOnce he became president, Trump railed against \u201cfake news,\u201d which he has deemed the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d In a tweet nearly a month after taking office, Trump name-checked four television networks and the New York Times as \u201cfake news\u201d and the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201d These are all well-established, professional news organizations, with high standards and a commitment to correcting errors. But Trump has falsely said they make up sources.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that when he uses the term \u201cfake news,\u201d he is not decrying the news media at large, just what he appears to view as negative news stories.\n\n\u201cThey take \u2018fake\u2019 media off,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News in a Feb. 27, 2017, interview. \u201cThey say \u2018the media is the enemy of \u2014 well, they didn\u2019t say the \u2018fake media.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say the media is the enemy \u2014 I said the \u2018fake media.\u2019 They take the word \u2018fake\u2019 out and all of a sudden it\u2019s like I\u2019m against \u2014 there are some great reporters like you.\u201d\n\nOr, as Trump put it more recently, in a July interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News: \u201cWell, when I say enemy of the people, I\u2019m not talking about all of the media. I\u2019m talking about there is a big percentage of the media, when you look at CNN, how false their reports are. When you look at NBC and some of the others, when you read the New York Times, it\u2019s just a story after story after story that\u2019s just a negative spin.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that presidential words have consequences \u2014 and reverberate around the world. The nuances that Trump claims he is making appear to be misunderstood overseas. Now, all sorts of odious regimes use the expression \u2014 including Myanmar, where a government official said: \u201cThere are no such thing as Rohingya. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d In Libya, after a CNN report showed migrants being sold into slavery, Libyan officials used a tweet by Trump calling the network \u201cfake news\u201d in an attempt to discredit the story.\n\nUnlike President Barack Obama, Trump has not issued statements on World Press Freedom Day. (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley did.) Reporters without Borders, in its ranking of press freedoms, has downgraded the United States to 45th place, citing the president\u2019s rhetoric as undermining trust in journalists and subjecting them to verbal and physical abuse. In October, Trump even celebrated a lawmaker who pleaded guilty to assaulting a reporter as \u201cmy guy.\u201d\n\nIn August, when Ivanka Trump said that she did not believe the media is enemy of the people, Trump tweeted that a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of the media was fake news: \u201cThey asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening,\u201d said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. \u201cWe are getting away from core democratic practices and beliefs here.\u201d She said that Trump\u2019s attacks on the media have polarized the nation and that his \u201clanguage has emboldened people to behave badly\u201d in other countries.\n\nDalglish noted that Pence has long been a strong supporter of independent media and that other parts of the administration \u2014 such as in the State Department and other agencies \u2014 also continue to promote press freedoms. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly not going on in the Oval Office,\u201d she said.\n\nChris Wallace, in his \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview that aired Nov. 18, sought to pin Trump down on the fine line he appears to draw between \u201cfake news\u201d and the media. Trump asserted that \u201cnobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t mind getting bad news if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d When Wallace noted that \u201cleaders in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Venezuela now repress the media using your words,\u201d Trump rejected any connection and passed up the opportunity to reaffirm his belief in freedom of the press. \u201cI can\u2019t talk for other people, I can only talk for me,\u201d he said.\n\nBill McRaven, the former head of U.S. Special Operations who commanded the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, has stated that Trump\u2019s \u201cenemy of the people\u201d language was \u201cthe greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime.\u201d When Wallace quoted McRaven, Trump falsely responded that McRaven was a Hillary Clinton supporter and that \u201ceverybody in Pakistan knew he [bin Laden] was there.\u201d\n\nOn the rare occasions the president has spoken about freedom of the press, it is in reference to himself.\n\nOn Nov. 16, for instance, Trump dropped in the phrase in the context of reporters being polite to him: \u201cYou have to practice decorum. You were there; you understood, and you understand. We want total freedom of the press; that\u2019s very important to me. It\u2019s more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect. You\u2019re in the White House.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Pence has defended the president\u2019s tone, saying that Trump, too, believes that freedom of the press is a \u201ccore American principle\u201d and that he\u2019s only calling out reports that twist the truth. \u201cPresident Trump and I are deeply committed to a free and independent press,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cWe also are committed to the freedom of speech and the ability of public men and women to call out the press when we think that they\u2019re not calling it straight.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nPence is a part of the Trump administration, and his statements promoting press freedom, especially his comments on the Reuters reporters and Khashoggi, are noteworthy. The State Department also has highlighted press freedom.\n\nThat\u2019s one arm of the government. But it\u2019s impossible to ignore the elephant in the room \u2014 the man Pence and State Department officials work for. The president repeatedly uses phrasing that belittles and demeans the news media, so much so that \u201cfake news\u201d is now a tool used by autocrats and dictators.\n\nThe president from time to time drops in a reference to \u201cfreedom of the press,\u201d but it\u2019s when he is talking about how he is treated by the media. There\u2019s never been a stand-alone statement, fulsome and complete, like the statements that effortlessly are made by Pence, especially in foreign settings. No one has a bigger megaphone than the U.S. president, so the laudable efforts of the rest of the government often are smothered by the fury from the White House.\n\n[Update: The day this fact check was published, President Trump issued his statement on the Khashoggi murder, pledging to continue to work with Saudi Arabia. This was another missed opportunity for the president to make a statement about press freedom. He did not even mention that Khashoggi was a journalist -- or that killing journalists is not acceptable.]\n\nPence, speaking just for himself and the State Department, would earn a Geppetto. But speaking for the administration at large, his claim is worthy of Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Despite UN call for Yemen truce, new clashes around key port", "description": "Yemeni officials, witnesses: Fighting flares up again between Saudi-led coalition, Shiite rebels around port of Hodeida", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/despite-un-call-for-yemen-truce-new-clashes-around-key-port/2018/11/20/7ef6adfe-ec98-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T07:47:15Z", "content": "SANAA, Yemen Yemeni officials and witnesses say fighting between Saudi-led coalition forces and Shiite rebels has flared up again around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida despite U.N. calls for a cease-fire there.

(Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nSANAA, Yemen \u2014 Fighting between Saudi-led coalition forces and Yemen\u2019s Shiite rebels flared up again around the Red Sea port city of Hodeida despite U.N. calls for a cease-fire, Yemeni officials and witnesses said Tuesday.\n\nThe escalation, which followed a lull that had been in place since earlier this month, began late on Monday with coalition airstrikes hitting the rebels, known as Houthis, in and around Hodeida.\n\nThe renewed fighting undermines the latest U.N. efforts to end the three-year war. The U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition has been battling the rebels since March 2015 to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government to power. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed much of the country to the brink of starvation.\n\nIn Hodeida, fighting was also underway Tuesday in the main Khamsin Street in the city center and in al-Saleh district, officials and witnesses told The Associated Press. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters; the witnesses did so for fear for their safety.\n\nYemen\u2019s Information Minister Moammer al-Iryani said the Houthis shelled the city center and neighborhoods held by government forces. Meanwhile, the rebel-run Al Masirah TV said the rebels attacked government forces on a main road linking the capital, Sanaa, and Hodeida. Government forces had captured the road in September.\n\nEarlier, the rebels said they\u2019d fired a ballistic missile the previous night into Saudi Arabia in response to an attempted border incursion and another airstrike, and that they reserved the right to respond to attacks. The missile came hours after the rebels said they would halt all rocket fire into Saudi Arabia for the sake of peace efforts.\n\nThe coalition has been attempting to retake Hodeida from the rebels since last summer, with its forces now 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the port, Yemen\u2019s traditional lifeline.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged $500 million in aid to assist millions of Yemenis at risk of starvation.\n\nAbdullah al-Rabeeah of King Salman\u2019s Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center told reporters in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, that the new initiative aims to provide food assistance to some 12 million Yemenis.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after David Beasley, head of the U.N.

They later withdrew weapons and troops from 11 of their guard posts and decided to completely dismantle 10 of them by the end of November.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the dismantling of 10 North Korean guard posts on Tuesday. It said North Korean soldiers had used hammers to tear down parts of the guard posts ahead of Tuesday\u2019s near-simultaneous demolitions. A ministry statement said North Korea had informed the South of its plans in advance.\n\nThe ministry released photos showing parts of structures on what it said was the North Korean side of the central portion of the border, an explosion with black smoke at the site, and debris scattered around the area with no trace left of the structure.\n\nSouth Korea began dismantling 10 of its guard posts with dynamite and excavators last week. Ministry officials said Tuesday that they haven\u2019t completed the dismantling work yet.\n\nThe Korean border, the world\u2019s most heavily armed with an estimated 2 million land mines, has been the site of deadly fighting and bloodshed. Called the Demilitarized Zone, it was originally created as a buffer at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nSouth Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts. Once the dismantling is done, the two Koreas are to jointly verify their work by the end of December. They haven\u2019t decided when they will dismantle the rest of the guard posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas have also taken steps to disarm the shared border village of Panmunjom, halted live-fire drills along the border and have been removing mines at a front-line area to conduct their first joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korea and the United States early this year with a vague promise to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-North Korea talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program haven\u2019t produced much progress since Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump held the countries\u2019 first summit in Singapore in June.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Three of them are seriously hurt, according to the civil protection agency.\n\nSpanish railway operator spokesman Antonio Carmona told local media that heavy rain in the area over the past few days could have caused the landslide.\n\nRecent downpours have battered Spain. A woman died Sunday after a river flooded its banks in the northwestern Galicia region. And on Monday, huge waves swept away the balconies of a sea-side apartment building on the Canary island of Tenerife.\n\nThe heavy rains have also caused travel disruption and damage to farmland across the country.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. The r\u2026 [+2657 chars]", "fulltext": "[UPDATE: Judge\u2019s ruling means Trump administration must allow all border-crossers to seek asylum, including those who cross illegally]\n\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from denying asylum to migrants who crossed the southern border illegally, saying the president violated a \u201cclear command\u201d from Congress to allow them to apply.\n\nIn a ruling late Monday, U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar of San Francisco issued a nationwide restraining order barring enforcement of the policy President Trump announced Nov. 8, which he billed as an urgent attempt to stop the flow of thousands of asylum-seeking families across the border each month.\n\nThe government had said it would allow only people who cross at legal checkpoints to request asylum. Those entering elsewhere could seek a temporary form of protection that is harder to win and doesn\u2019t yield full citizenship. The changes would amount to a transformation of long-established asylum procedures, codified both at the international level and by Congress.\n\n\u201cWhatever the scope of the President\u2019s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,\u201d wrote the judge, whom President Barack Obama nominated to the federal bench in 2012. Tigar reasoned that the \u201cfailure to comply with entry requirements such as arriving at a designated port of entry should bear little, if any, weight in the asylum process.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration said Tuesday it will continue to press the matter in court.\n\nSeveral thousand migrants are now waiting to cross a legal entry point at San Ysidro in San Diego, across from Tijuana. Many are from a caravan that drew Trump\u2019s wrath in the weeks leading up to the midterm election, when he made illegal immigration his closing argument and asserted without evidence that the caravan included \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nLabeling the movements of Central American migrants a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d Trump deployed thousands of active-duty troops and coils of concertina wire to the border. Military officials have indicated they are weighing whether to redeploy some of those troops.\n\nA U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Tuesday that the military was examining whether Tigar\u2019s order changes anything for their operations. However, U.S. troops already had been acting only in a support role to the Department of Homeland Security, with only incidental contact with migrants expected.\n\nTigar said the president could not shift asylum policy on his own. The judge\u2019s order will remain in effect until Dec. 19, at which point the court will consider arguments for a permanent block of the policy.\n\nThe Trump administration suggested the defeat could be temporary, alluding to a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court in June that upheld a revised version of Trump\u2019s travel ban, an effort to bar foreigners from certain majority-Muslim nations and other countries from the United States.\n\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court affirmed this summer, Congress has given the President broad authority to limit or even stop the entry of aliens into this country,\u201d the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security said in a joint statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch\u2019s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.\u201d\n\n\n\nCentral American migrants, as part of the Central American caravan trying to reach the United States, wait to receive a donated dinner in Mexicali, Mexico, on Nov. 19. (Rodrigo Abd/AP)\n\nTigar\u2019s 37-page ruling was the latest in a string of court decisions blocking the administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, including its efforts to crack down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and to rescind deportation protections for about 1 million undocumented immigrants who were either brought to the United States as children or given temporary protected status in this country because of national disasters and unrest in their homelands.\n\nThe government is appealing those rulings.\n\nThe challenge to the asylum ban was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups on behalf of East Bay Sanctuary Covenant. The order reflects the judge\u2019s view that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, and would suffer irreparable injury from the executive action.\n\nIn his proclamation, Trump said the changes were necessary to prepare for the caravan\u2019s arrival, arguing that asylum seekers had no \u201clawful basis for admission into our country.\u201d In justifying the policy, the administration relied on the same emergency authority invoked as grounds for the \u201ctravel ban.\"\n\nIn a hearing Monday, Scott Stewart, a lawyer for the Justice Department, spoke of a \u201ccrushing strain\u201d of migrants attempting to cross the border illegally. He alleged that most asylum claims were \u201cultimately meritless.\u201d\n\nBut the judge seemed skeptical, observing that border apprehensions are near historic lows and that, regardless, federal law says all people on U.S. soil can apply for asylum, no matter how they arrived.\n\n[Trump\u2019s ban on asylum for illegal border crossers challenged in court]\n\nTigar voiced concern for the fate of asylum seekers under the changes. The administration\u2019s rule, he observed, would force people \u201cto choose between violence at the border, violence at home, or giving up a pathway to refugee status.\u201d\n\nAnd in his decision, he wrote that the government\u2019s argument that the manner of entry can be the lone factor rendering a migrant ineligible for asylum \u201cstrains credulity.\"\n\n\u201cTo say that one may apply for something that one has no right to receive is to render the right to apply a dead letter,\u201d he argued. \u201cThere simply is no reasonable way to harmonize the two.\u201d\n\nThe judge pointedly denied the claim that the president, by fiat, could give the manner of entry added legal weight as a determinant of asylum. He reasoned that the \u201cinterpretive guide\u201d of United Nations compacts on asylum lent extra force to congressional requirements. The intent of Congress, Tigar wrote, was \u201cunambiguous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if what Defendants intend to say is that the President by proclamation can override Congress\u2019s clearly expressed legislative intent, simply because a statute conflicts with the President\u2019s policy goals, the Court rejects that argument also,\u201d the judge found.\n\nLee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who argued the case, welcomed the ruling in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban is illegal, will put people\u2019s lives in danger, and raises the alarm about President Trump\u2019s disregard for separation of powers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no justifiable reason to flatly deny people the right to apply for asylum, and we cannot send them back to danger based on the manner of their entry. Congress has been clear on this point for decades.\u201d\n\nAs the hearing was underway Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the government had received reports that the migrant caravan was considering rushing the border and closed the travel lanes for a short period. Late last month, some in the caravan kicked and pushed their way through the Guatemala border into Mexico.\n\nBut a spokesman for the caravan said the Central Americans were waiting peacefully in Mexico and had no intention of forcing their way into the United States.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection closed the entire San Ysidro crossing in San Diego for several hours before dawn, installing additional layers of razor wire and concrete barriers, then reopened it with 10 of the port\u2019s 26 vehicle lanes closed.\n\nClashing with the U.S. government is a frightening prospect for migrants. In May, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Claudia Patricia G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, 19, a Guatemalan citizen who had crossed into the United States illegally hoping to reunite with her longtime boyfriend. At the time, the Border Patrol officials said the officer had been attacked with blunt objects.\n\nNick Miroff and Dan Lamothe in Washington and Elise Ackerman in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\nRead the full ruling in East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, et al. v.

Yet, like other desperate young men in Gaza who feel they have nothing left to lose, he has kept returning to the protests.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been on the front line of confrontations between Palestinians and Israel for generations. But the territory has been brought to its knees over the last decade by three punishing wars with Israel and an air, sea and land blockade.\n\nThe 11-year blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt, is aimed at weakening Hamas, the militant group that seized power in Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. But its impact is felt by all. Raw sewage flows directly onto once-scenic Mediterranean beaches, tap water is undrinkable, and electricity is available just a few hours a day. Over half the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel\u2019s siege, Israel views them as coordinated attacks and says it must defend itself.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see them as protests,\u201d said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. \u201cWe are confronting attacks, violent attacks along our security fence.\u201d\n\nSince they began on March 30, Israeli troops have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others. Thousands more have been wounded by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier was killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\nWhen Fayoumi arrived at one of five protest sites along the border just after 2:30 p.m., the area was largely empty. A few days earlier, he swore he would keep participating despite his wounds. But why?\n\n\u201cBecause I want to die,\u201d he said.\n\nYes, he hopes the blockade gets lifted so he can leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of living?\u201d\n\nBy 5 p.m., at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border, throwing rocks and burning tires. Ambulance sirens begin to howl soon after, signaling the start of the day\u2019s violence. At a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the frontier, they bring the wounded: a 22-year-old shot in the left leg, an 18-year-old struck by shrapnel, a 31-year-old shot in the chest.\n\n\u201cEvery Friday we wait for the injuries, and every Friday it\u2019s always the same,\u201d says one of the staff, Dr. Khalil Siam. \u201cThey always come.\u201d\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nAt the border, all hell is breaking loose. Protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. One man is hanging from the top, shaking it back and forth. The noise is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, waving Palestinian flags. Every time a gunshot rings out, they duck like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. A pair of nearby explosions sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. The Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after a soldier was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nThe last casualty arrives at the medical tent at 7:24 p.m. Siam says his team treated 25 people, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg.\n\nAlmost every Friday protest is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three, including one for an 11-year-old boy.\n\nOn Sunday, Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday\u2019s protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \u201cI would never have gone.\u201d\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of $200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.\n\nNow he has nothing. No work. No hope. And little else to lose.\n\nNext Friday, he says, he will return to the protests again.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Over half the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2 million people are unemployed, and most residents cannot leave what has become, in essence, a mass prison, even for medical reasons.\n\nThe blockade and growing anger over the harsh living conditions have put enormous pressure on Hamas, which is trying to redirect it toward Israel with relentless protests, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Gaza\u2019s al-Azhar University.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a very slippery slope,\u201d Abusada said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not going to stop until the siege is lifted \u2014 or there is another war.\u201d\n\nThat almost happened this month, when an Israeli raid into Gaza left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead. The raid prompted Hamas and other armed groups to fire hundreds of rockets and mortar shells into Israel, triggering a devastating wave of Israeli airstrikes in return \u2014 the heaviest fighting here since a 2014 war.\n\nBoth parties pulled back from the brink with a truce, and Hamas kept last Friday\u2019s protests restrained \u2014 though not enough to keep 40 Palestinians from being wounded.\n\nWhile most Gazans see the protests as the inevitable reaction to Israel\u2019s siege, Israel has a different view altogether.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see them as protests ... we\u2019re not seeing somebody exercising their democratic right to gather and voice their opinion,\u201d said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. \u201cWe are confronting attacks, violent attacks along our security fence from an entity, Gaza, that is controlled by a terrorist organization, Hamas.\u201d\n\nSince they began March 30, Israeli troops \u2014 using live ammunition against Palestinians mostly armed with rocks \u2014 have killed more than 170 people and shot nearly 6,000 others, among them scores of children. Thousands more have been wounded during the protests by tear gas or rubber-coated bullets. On the Israeli side, one soldier has been killed by a sniper and six others wounded.\n\nEvery Friday, there are more.\n\n___\n\nIt is 2:30 p.m. in Malaka, one of five protest sites along the border, and several boys are practicing for a fight.\n\nThey are flinging large rocks onto a barren field with homemade slingshots. One of them, 17-year-old Ahmed al-Burdaini, shows off a bucket filled with fragments of steel rebar he says he spent the week collecting from the rubble of homes destroyed in past Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\u201cWe want to use it against them,\u201d he says proudly.\n\nAnother boy points across the frontier and writes in a reporter\u2019s notebook: \u201cThis Is Our Land.\u201d It is a reference to another demand of the protests, that Palestinians be allowed to return to lands lost during the 1948 war that created the Jewish state \u2014 a demand Israel rejects outright.\n\nThe perimeter fence itself is a few hundred meters (yards) away. Israeli soldiers on the other side peer out from bunkers built atop pyramid-shaped berms along the fence.\n\nThe protest site is still largely empty, but people are trickling in. Among them is the amputee, Fayoumi, who says he was throwing rocks near the fence and was shot as he rushed to help a wounded friend. A few days earlier, speaking at a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, he swore he would keep participating in the protests despite his wounds. But why risk it?\n\n\u201cBecause I want to die,\u201d he said.\n\nHe would prefer for the blockade to be lifted so he could leave Gaza to get a new, prosthetic leg. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of living?\u201d\n\nThe sun is bearing down intensely when a couple dozen Palestinians roll a few tires toward the fence and set them on fire. The first gunshots ring out at 3:14 p.m., in the standard Israeli response to the start of the protests. An armored Israeli jeep at the edge of the fence fires a volley of tear gas canisters that leave white arcs trailing across the sky as they fall. The protesters are unfazed.\n\nAmong the growing crowds is an incongruous sight: five street vendors pushing dilapidated food carts hawking seeds, nuts, and frozen slushies. One is affixed with a cheap wooden speaker blaring traditional Bedouin music. It gives the protest the atmosphere of a country fair.\n\nVendor Adam Badwan, 17, has a simple explanation for coming: \u201cBusiness is good here, much better than in town.\u201d\n\nPlainclothes Hamas security agents appear. A local television crew arrives with flak jackets and helmets. A single ambulance pulls up.\n\nAfter Friday noon prayers, around 4 p.m., Hamas dispatches huge buses to many mosques to bring supporters to the border. But many more come on their own \u2014 on foot, in cars, motorcycles, bikes and wheelchairs. Within one hour, at least 13,000 people are gathered along the border.\n\n___\n\nDr. Khalil Siam is standing inside a medical triage tent about a kilometer (half a mile) from the border when the ambulance sirens begin to howl just after 5 p.m.\n\nThe first one to arrive drops off a 22-year-old man who was shot in the left leg. The second brings an 18-year-old, blood streaming from his bandaged face, who was struck by shrapnel.\n\nWhen the third comes shortly after, bearing a 31-year-old shot in the chest, there is shouting and panic \u2014 and no doubt the most dangerous phase of the protests has begun. The bullet has punctured the man\u2019s lung, and he is lowered gently onto a gurney as eight doctors and nurses gather round.\n\nOne of the doctors inserts a clear tube into the man\u2019s chest, and within seconds, blood and liquid is draining into a blue plastic bowl on the floor.\n\n\u201cKeep breathing!

Young men are standing on them, thrusting fists in the air, their faces hidden with scarves and white Guy Fawkes masks. It is the \u201cBurning Tire Unit\u201d \u2014 and soon it will fill a vast section of the frontier with a wall of fire and billowing sheets of smoke.\n\nA few dozen meters (yards) away, five men in checkered, black and white headscarves are performing a traditional folk dance with their arms crossed for a captivated crowd under a massive tent. Behind them, in the distance, the border fence looks like a war zone; the sky is completely black, burning tires are shooting flames into the air, and gunfire is ringing out every few minutes.\n\nBut nobody is looking toward the border, and few notice the steady stream of ambulances that are crisscrossing the adjacent road, non-stop. Here, vendors are selling corn on the cob and peanuts, and fathers are balancing children on their shoulders.\n\nIn the sky behind the stage, four kites flutter in the wind, several with flaming, incendiary trails; such kites have burned thousands of acres of Israeli farmland and set vehicles alight.\n\nColorful balloons also float overhead; Israel says they have found them on the other side of the fence, tied to small, homemade bombs.\n\nIt is 5:45 p.m. now, and the air is growing cooler. The dancers are soon replaced by a poet, then a play featuring two actors dressed as Israeli guards who shove a Palestinian prisoner to the ground. At one point, the prisoner tells the guard: \u201cResistance is not terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe crowd applauds.\n\n___\n\nBy 6 p.m., at the border, all hell is breaking loose.\n\nHundreds of hard-core protesters are swarming the 12-foot-high fence. The wall of smoke has allowed some, armed with wire cutters, to clip through the rolls of barbed wire. One man is hanging from the top of the fence, shaking it back and forth with the weight of his body. Another is hanging from the other side, and yet another is trying to melt the fence with a flaming tire.\n\nThe noise here is constant, like a waterfall. Men are blowing whistles. Others are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\n\u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d \u2014 God is greatest!\n\nMost are throwing rocks over the fence, thrusting their fists in the air, taking selfies, making the V sign for Victory. There are women too, wearing black and waving Palestinian flags. There is a man with a speaker on his back, playing Palestinian music to encourage them. Some boys pick up smoking tear gas canisters and smack them back over the fence with tennis rackets.\n\nEvery time a gunshot rings out, the crowds duck, like a school of fish darting in unison. Sometimes a man falls, and within seconds he is surrounded by medics in orange uniforms, who bandage him on the spot and rush him on a stretcher to the ambulances waiting in the rear.\n\nFurther back stands a vast sea of spectators. One, an older man named Khalil Ayesh, is sitting inside a light blue Subaru with his family, as if he has come to a drive-in movie. He was in the same spot last week, watching intently as an Israeli drone crisscrossed the sky like a black spider, dropping tear gas on the crowds from above.\n\n\u201cI bring them every week,\u201d Ayesh said of the three children in the back seat \u2014 his son and daughter, and his daughter\u2019s neighbor, \u201cso they can understand what this struggle is about.\u201d\n\nAfter the sun sets, the crowds dissipate rapidly as two black drones circle overhead. At 6:52 p.m., a huge blast a kilometer from the frontier sends shards of concrete and debris hurling into the air. Eight minutes later, it happens again. Later, in a statement, the Israeli army will say that aircraft and a tank struck two Hamas watchtowers after one of their soldiers was wounded by a pipe bomb.\n\nIt is time to go.\n\nAt the medical tent, it is now pitch dark, and the last casualty arrives at 7:24 p.m. It is a man, bleeding from the head, who has been hit by a tear gas canister.\n\nSiam says his team treated 25 people on this Friday, mostly for gunshot wounds. Half were shot in the leg, the others in the chest, stomach, back, pelvis. One doctor had to take leave when his nephew arrived, shot in the head.\n\n___\n\nAlmost every Friday protest in Gaza is followed by at least one funeral on Saturday. This week, there are three.\n\nOne, for an 11-year-old boy named Shady Abdel-al, is remarkable because it is quiet. Funeral processions here typically are accompanied by young men doing something they usually avoid at the border: firing Kalashnikov rifles into the sky.\n\nThough the Health Ministry initially reported Abdel-al was shot by Israeli fire, the Israeli army claimed he was accidentally struck by a rock thrown by protesters. Two Gaza rights groups say he died after being hit \u201cwith a solid object.\u201d\n\nDuring his funeral, Gaza\u2019s political complexity is laid bare. His body has been wrapped in a yellow flag with a grenade and automatic rifle on it; it belongs to Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and a bitter rival to Hamas.\n\nAbdel-al\u2019s mother, Isma, says she told the boy not to go, but he boarded a bus to the border organized by Hamas, whose supporters were teaching him the Quran.\n\nAs the boy\u2019s body is carried through the neighborhood, it is surrounded by a sea of yellow flags. But when it reaches the mosque, there is another huge group of teenagers waiting with the green flag of Hamas. Hassan Walli, a Fatah official, is with the family as the distraught father stands over his son, kissing him on the forehead.\n\n\u201cWe will never break the siege this way,\u201d Walli says, shaking his head. \u201cThe only way we can do it is with Palestinian unity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIt is Sunday in Gaza, and Atalla Fayoumi is sitting on the small bed in his small room, showing off pictures of himself at Friday\u2019s protest.\n\nHe is proud that he went. Proud that he stood up for the Palestinian cause. But when asked if having a job would have changed anything, his answer is clear: \u201cI would never have gone.\u201d\n\nAfter his injury, Fayoumi received a payment of US$200 from Hamas. It was spent long ago, he says, on medical bills.\n\nNow he has nothing. No work. No hope. And little else to lose.\n\nNext Friday, he says, he will return to the protests again.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nOn Sunday, an annual meeting of Pacific Rim countries ended with a clash between two behemoths. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, saw Chinese and American representatives continue their countries' battles over trade. For the first time in the bloc\u2019s history, there was no joint communique issued at the summit\u2019s end.\n\nThe impasse echoed the rancor at the Group of Seven summit in Quebec this summer, where a spat with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prompted President Trump to reject a joint statement agreed to by key U.S. allies. But this time, it wasn\u2019t the White House that was blamed for the breakdown.\n\nCiting an official from the American delegation, the Wall Street Journal reported China balked at a single proposed sentence in the communique: \u201cWe agreed to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.\u201d Beijing has refused to acknowledge one of Washington\u2019s main grievances \u2014 its alleged coercing of U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts \u2014 and believed the proposed wording was too direct a jab at China.\n\nThe Xi show by the sea shore.\n\nHundreds of red flags, China Aid signs and even a purpose-built pagoda: driving around the Papua New Guinea capital, you could be forgiven for thinking the Chinese president is hosting this week's APEC summithttps://t.co/Dg3tjQG6qL pic.twitter.com/NT1biCR1Sq \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) November 14, 2018\n\n\u201cChina wouldn\u2019t agree to that language, believing it amounted to a \u2018singling out\u2019 of Chinese trade practices,\u201d noted the Journal. \u201cOther APEC members favored including the language in the final communiqu\u00e9, the official said. Officials at the meeting from several nations said the fight wasn\u2019t only between the U.S. and China. Other APEC members also lined up against Beijing.\"\n\nAnother account from an Australian journalist suggested there was equal frustration with both countries. \u201cYou all know who the two big giants in the room were, so what can I say?\u201d Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill said to reporters.\n\nWhatever the case, things clearly were heated. \u201cEmotions were so high at the summit, dominated by disagreements between the United States and China, that Chinese officials demanding a meeting with Papua New Guinea\u2019s foreign minister, who was leading negotiations, forced their way into his office on Saturday and had to be escorted away by police after a confrontation,\u201d the Journal reported, citing two senior officials from the host country.\n\nChinese officials denied the report, but they couldn\u2019t dispel the dark clouds looming over the proceedings.\n\nFor President Xi Jinping, the APEC summit was supposed to highlight China\u2019s friendly face to the world. Instead, he faced off against Vice President Pence, who used the forum to decry China\u2019s global development projects as \u201copaque\u201d schemes that saddle weaker countries with \u201cstaggering debt.\u201d The United States launched a rival infrastructure initiative, backed by Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\n\u201cAs far as Beijing is concerned, the weekend was the time to showcase China\u2019s emergence as a benign superpower in the South Pacific. Instead, public distaste for and rebuke of its \u2018sharp power\u2019 was on show,\u201d wrote John Lee, an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. \u201cXi defended China\u2019s trade practices and denied that its Belt and Road Initiative contained hidden geo-political and other sinister motivations. And no matter how adamantly he did so, it was not a conversation that Xi intended to have when he first landed in Port Moresby.\u201d\n\nThe showdown illustrated a deepening political reality in Asia: Many countries are far more wary of an increasingly assertive China than the United States, the old guarantor of security in the Pacific.\n\n\u201cFew in East Asia want to live in the shadow of a hegemonic China. The fear of that prospect has long underpinned America\u2019s East Asian security architecture, which is based on bilateral alliances and forward deployment of the US military. And it sustains widespread support in East Asia for the US to act as a strategic counterweight in the region,\u201d wrote Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in the United States. \u201cTo be sure, most East Asian countries prefer not to choose a side outright. But if the US and China were to engage in direct strategic conflict \u2014 an increasingly likely prospect \u2014 it is the US that would gain the most support, especially from allies like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Malaysia and Singapore would probably also back the US.\u201d\n\nEvery nation gathered here at APEC has a place in @POTUS\u2019 vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Our vision excludes no one. We only ask that nations respect their neighbors\u2019 sovereignty, embrace free, fair, and reciprocal trade, and uphold individual rights. #APEC2018 pic.twitter.com/5R4AETEmi5 \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) November 18, 2018\n\nThat said, Washington can\u2019t rest on its laurels. Many governments in Asia are as perturbed by Trump\u2019s penchant for protectionism as they are by China\u2019s growing clout on the world stage. Beijing, for example, has made significant overtures to Japan, hoping to mend fences and capitalize on Trump\u2019s unpopularity.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics between the U.S. and China are also affecting how countries in the region interact with each other, and how they view regional and global institutions,\u201d wrote Merriden Varral of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \u201cThe apparent thaw in relations between China and Japan is a good example. Fears over deepening global trade tensions are further encouraging some countries, such as South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, to actively consider joining the revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d\n\nRory Medcalf, a prominent Australian commentator on security issues and international affairs, wrote that \u201cthe scene is now set for prolonged confrontation\u201d between the United States and China. He also pointed to an \u201caccelerating regional great game\u201d where countries such as Australia, Japan, Indonesia and India deepen cooperation and \u201cdefine alternatives\u201d to both a rising China and the waning Pax Americana.\n\nXi may not be quite as prepared for that game as it may seem. In a rare and provocative riposte to the country\u2019s central leadership, Beijing\u2019s former chief trade negotiator recently commented that China wasn\u2019t thinking \u201cdeeply enough\u201d during its current confrontation with Washington.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese still don\u2019t know how to handle Trump, and they don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trey McArver, founding partner of Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, said to The Washington Post\u2019s Finance 202 newsletter. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any new ideas. I think they\u2019re just spinning their wheels.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

He served as the chief security officer at Facebook until August.\n\nYup, Sheryl Sandberg yelled at me.\n\nIt was the day after I briefed Facebook\u2019s Board of Directors on an unprecedented and troubling finding on our platform. Combing through billions of accounts, my colleagues and I had discovered a web of fake personae that we could confidently tie to Russia. I told the board the difficult truth: I had no confidence that we\u2019d found out everything the Russians were up to, and it was quite possible that things would get worse before we built the teams and invented the technology necessary to stop it. Sandberg \u2014 as reported in this past week\u2019s New York Times investigation \u2014 felt blindsided by this. (She later apologized.)\n\nAt the time, technology companies were so enamored with the utility of our own products and so focused on sophisticated attacks from U.S. adversaries such as Russia and China that we overlooked less advanced but still effective propaganda operations. After the election, and having provided our detailed findings to the FBI and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Facebook stuck to a public-communications strategy of minimization and denial. It was finally jettisoned in early 2018, but the damage to trust has been massive and will take years to repair. To be clear, no one at the company ever told me not to examine Russian activity, nor did anyone attempt to lie about our findings, but Facebook should have responded to these threats much earlier and handled disclosure in a more transparent manner.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s shortcomings do not stand alone. The massive U.S. intelligence community failed to provide actionable intelligence on Russia\u2019s \u00adinformation-warfare goals and capabilities before the election and offered a dearth of assistance afterward. Technology companies can build tools and teams to look inward on their products, but they will never have true geostrategic insight or ability to penetrate hostile countries. This relationship has greatly improved in 2018, mostly due to the initiative of hard-working intelligence professionals. Our elected officials, however, can claim little credit. Lawmakers\u2019 public grandstanding at investigative hearings stands in stark contrast to their failure to establish facts, effectively oversee the executive branch and provide for the common defense.\n\nWe must also remember that in the summer of 2016, every major media outlet rewarded the hackers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) with thousands of collective stories drawn from the stolen emails of prominent Democrats. The sad truth is that blocking Russian propaganda would have required Facebook to ban stories from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and cable news \u2014 not to mention this very paper. Since the election of Donald Trump, print and television news organizations have staffed up and provided a critical service to Americans, but they have never adequately grappled with their culpability in empowering Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nIt is time for us to come together to protect our society from future information operations. While it appears Russia and other U.S. adversaries sat out the 2018 midterms, our good fortune is unlikely to extend through a contentious Democratic presidential primary season and raucous 2020 election.\n\nFirst, Congress needs to codify standards around political advertising. The current rules restricting the use of powerful online advertising platforms have been adopted voluntarily and by only a handful of companies. Congress needs to update Nixon-era laws to require transparency and limit the ability of all players, including legitimate domestic actors, to micro-target tiny segments of the population with divisive political narratives. It would be great to see Facebook, Google and Twitter propose helpful additions to legislation instead of quietly opposing it.\n\nSecond, we need to draw a thoughtful line between the responsibilities of government and the large technology companies. The latter group will always need to act in a quasi-governmental manner, making judgments on political speech and operating teams in parallel to the U.S. intelligence community, but we need more clarity on how these companies make decisions and what powers we want to reserve to our duly elected government. Many areas of cybersecurity demand cooperation between government and corporations, and our allies in France and Germany provide models of how competent defensive cybersecurity responsibility can be built in a democracy.\n\nWhile many of the individual reporters I have spoken to are now warier of manipulation, it is unclear whether the U.S. media would handle the strategic release of stolen emails any differently today. This might be a fundamental vulnerability in the free press, but it would be reassuring to see leading newsrooms publish their standards on how they might cover newsworthy data leaks without amplifying the messages of the United States\u2019 enemies.\n\nFinally, U.S. citizens must adjust to a media environment in which several dozen gatekeepers no longer control what is newsworthy. While the platforms that bring hundreds of new media outlets to your phone need to improve protections against abuse, in a free society we will always be vulnerable to the injection of narratives from the enemies of democracy, both foreign and domestic. The last line of defense will always be citizens who are willing to question what they see and hear, even when it means questioning our own beliefs."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Scientists work to save wild Puerto Rican parrot after Maria", "description": "Biologists are trying to save the last of the endangered Puerto Rican parrots after more than half the population of the bright green birds with turquoise-tipped wings disappeared when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/scientists-work-to-save-wild-puerto-rican-parrot-after-maria/2018/11/20/de4ce05c-ec84-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:32:36Z", "content": "EL YUNQUE, Puerto Rico Biologists are trying to save the last of the endangered Puerto Rican parrots after more than half the population of the bright green birds with turquoise-tipped wings disappeared when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and destroyed their\u2026 [+4449 chars]", "fulltext": "In this Nov. 6, 2018 photo, Puerto Rican parrots huddle in a flight cage at the Iguaca Aviary in El Yunque, Puerto Rico, where the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service runs a parrot recovery program in collaboration with the Forest Service and the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Biologists are trying to save the last of the endangered Puerto Rican parrots after more than half the population of birds disappeared when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and destroyed their habitat and food sources. (Carlos Giusti/Associated Press)\n\nEL YUNQUE, Puerto Rico \u2014 Biologists are trying to save the last of the endangered Puerto Rican parrots after more than half the population of the bright green birds with turquoise-tipped wings disappeared when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and destroyed their habitat and food sources.\n\nIn the tropical forest of El Yunque, only two of the 56 wild birds that once lived there survived the Category 4 storm that pummeled the U.S. territory in September 2017. Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating. After so many years of having worked on this project...,\u201d she stopped talking and sighed.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Amazon is Puerto Rico\u2019s only remaining native parrot and is one of roughly 30 species of Amazon parrots found in the Americas. The red-foreheaded birds grow to nearly a foot in length, are known for their secrecy and usually mate for life, reproducing once a year.\n\nMore than 460 birds remain captive at the breeding centers in El Yunque and Rio Abajo forests, but scientists have not released any of them since Hurricane Maria. A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico\u2019s damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them in the same cage as birds that will be released to the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\u201cOur priority now is not reproduction...it\u2019s to start releasing them,\u201d Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through. Ilse said that many of the large trees where parrots used to nest are now gone and noted that it took 14 months for El Yunque\u2019s canopy to close after Hurricane Hugo hit Puerto Rico in 1989 as a Category 3 storm.\n\nScientists also are now collecting new data on the number of predators at El Yunque, including el guaraguao, a red-tailed hawk that hunts Puerto Rico parrots. Without a canopy and proper camouflage, wild parrots have become an easy target.\n\nIlse said local and federal scientists plan to help the forest recover through planting. By the end of November, they expect to have a map detailing the most damaged areas in El Yunque and a list of tree species they can plant that are more resistant to hurricanes.\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking us, \u2018How long is it going to take?\u2019\u201d Ilse said.\n\nBut scientists don\u2019t know, she added.\n\n\u201cThe damage is more extensive than (hurricanes) Hugo and Georges...It\u2019s been a complete change to the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths said he is determined to take advantage of \u201cthe international attention and energy\u201d to move toward peace.\n\nThe draft resolution expresses \u201cunqualified support\u201d for efforts by Griffiths, who told the Security Council on Friday that the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government have agreed to attend talks \u201csoon\u201d in Sweden.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital of Sanaa by the Iranian-backed Houthis, which toppled the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and targeted vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nThe draft resolution condemns the targeting of civilians and civilian buildings, \u201cthe unlawful military use of civilian infrastructure\u201d and drone and missile attacks by the Houthis against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also expresses concern at reports of civilians being used as human shields.\n\nIt welcomes the coalition\u2019s recent de-escalation in Hodeida and calls on the Houthis \u201cto respond in kind in order to allow urgent deliveries of assistance and flows of lifesaving commercial imports.\u201d It also welcomes \u201cthe renewed commitment from the Yemeni parties to work on a political solution\u201d under Griffiths\u2019 leadership.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned the council on Oct. 23 that Yemen\u2019s economic crisis and escalating conflict had pushed the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation closer to famine than ever before, and on Friday he again urged its members to take action now.\n\nLowcock said the Security Council should urge the parties to negotiate an end to the conflict and the international community to boost aid. He also called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nThe draft resolution calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Hodeida governorate and to missile and drone attacks and for all bureaucratic roadblocks to the delivery of humanitarian aid to be removed within two weeks.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the U.N. World Food Program, visited Yemen last week and told the Security Council on Friday that as many as 12 million of the 28 million Yemenis \u201care just one step away from famine.\u201d\n\nTo avert that, Beasley said, the international community must combine increased humanitarian funding with \u201can all-out effort to restore the Yemeni economy,\u201d which has collapsed.\n\nThe draft resolution calls on Yemen\u2019s government with support of the international community \u201cto deliver a larger and faster injection of foreign currency into the economy\u201d and to expedite credit for traders and payments to pensioners and civil servants within one month. It asks Griffiths to explore ways for the government and the Houthis to cooperate on channeling revenue, including from Hodeida, to the Central Bank of Yemen.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ben Margot/Associated Press)\n\nBaseball\u2019s hot stove was just waiting to be ignited, and a very likely suspect was happy to do the honors. The New York Yankees, always in the mix for top players, made the first major move of MLB\u2019s offseason by acquiring pitcher James Paxton in a trade with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn return, New York sent its top prospect, pitcher Justus Sheffield, plus outfielder Dom Thompson-Williams and another young pitcher, Erik Swanson, to Seattle. The Yankees had a stated intention of bolstering their starting rotation, and they may not be done, with some free agent arms thought to be on their shopping list.\n\nThen, of course, there are those two position players, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, available for the right (i.e., exorbitant) price. Given the extended loss of shortstop Didi Gregorius to Tommy John surgery, and already with a well-stocked outfield, New York would figure to have a greater desire to add a slugging infielder such as Machado, but the allure of Harper\u2019s star power cannot be discounted.\n\nIn Paxton, the Yankees get a 30-year-old left-hander who comes with some injury concerns but also with an arsenal that can often be overpowering to opposing hitters. In 160.1 innings, a career high, for the Mariners last season, he notched a 3.76 ERA, with 208 strikeouts to just 42 walks and two complete games.\n\nPaxton earned an American League player of the week nod in May for a stretch in which he followed up a 16-strikeout performance, in just seven innings, with a 99-pitch no-hitter against the Blue Jays. The 6-4, 235-pound Canadian native, nicknamed \u201cThe Big Maple,\u201d called the Yankees \u201ca great fit\u201d Monday, saying (via the AP), \u201cThey seem very committed to winning, and so am I.\u201d\n\n\u201cI continue to try to work towards being healthy for an entire season,\u201d he added. \u201cAll the injuries that I\u2019ve had haven\u2019t reoccurred. I\u2019ve learned how to make sure those things don\u2019t happen again through exercise or whatever. . . . And I think that my best baseball is still to come.\u201d\n\nPaxton is set to slot into a rotation featuring right-handers Luis Severino and Masahiro Tanaka and another lefty, CC Sabathia. The Yankees might try to deal away Sonny Gray, who had a disappointing 2018 campaign, and add a top free agent pitcher such as Patrick Corbin, Dallas Keuchel or J.A. Happ.\n\nThe Mariners won 89 games last season, but that still left them well behind the Houston Astros (103 wins) and the Oakland Athletics (97) in the AL West, and team is looking to rebuild on the fly. \u201cClearly we\u2019ve opted 2019 be a year that we take a step back hoping to take two forward,\u201d Seattle General Manager Jerry Dipoto said.\n\nAs usual, the Yankees have their eye on winning it all, never more so than following a triumph in the World Series by the archrival Red Sox. After coming in for the first time under MLB\u2019s luxury tax threshold, it remains to be seen just how wide New York will now open its purse strings, but pursuits of both Harper and Machado are hardly out of the question, and it\u2019s likely that the acquisition of Paxton was just the first offseason salvo fired by the Bronx Bombers.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nMachado\u2019s comments on lack of hustle \u2018are troubling,\u2019 says Yankees\u2019 Hal Steinbrenner\n\nNationals reunite with veteran catcher Kurt Suzuki, agreeing to two-year deal\n\nRedskins sign Mark Sanchez to back up quarterback Colt McCoy\n\nAround the NBA, skepticism over whether Wizards would actually trade John Wall or Bradley Beal\n\nLeBron James: Cavs\u2019 Kyrie Irving trade was \u2018the beginning of the end for everything\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba Ali Rodriguez dies", "description": "Supporters of Venezuela's socialist government are mourning the death of onetime guerrilla fighter Ali Rodriguez", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelan-ambassador-to-cuba-ali-rodriguez-dies/2018/11/19/d59cbde0-ec7c-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T04:29:14Z", "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela Supporters of Venezuelas socialist government are mourning the death of onetime guerrilla fighter Ali Rodriguez.

(Fernando Vergara, File/Associated Press)\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Ali Rodriguez, an icon of Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution who went on to serve as a diplomat in top government posts, died on Monday.\n\nRodriguez had served as ambassador to Cuba since 2014. He passed away in Havana and was 81 years old, Venezuela\u2019s state TV network said.\n\nAmong stages of his storied career, Rodriguez oversaw the mass firing of thousands of workers at Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA. He also defended the sharply anti-American foreign policy of the socialist governments of late President Hugo Chavez and current President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\u201cHis experience and honesty were a school for all of us,\u201d Maduro said on Twitter, calling Rodriguez, \u201ca tireless fighter\u201d who was \u201cindispensable to the revolution.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1937 in Venezuela\u2019s central state of Lara, Rodriguez joined guerrilla fighters as a young man inspired by the Fidel Castro-led revolution in Cuba. He earned a reputation as an expert in explosives and was given the nickname of \u2018Comandante Fausto.\u2019\n\nThe revolutionary fervor in Venezuela, however, never captured mass appeal, and in the 1970s most rebel groups surrendered.\n\nAfter former Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera forged a peace pact with the rebels, Rodriguez and others were granted amnesty for crimes that included kidnappings, bomb attacks and bank robberies.\n\nIn the 1980s, Rodriguez joined the Causa R party. He eventually became a central figure in Fatherland for All \u2014 another political party that supported then-presidential candidate Chavez.\n\nLater elected to Venezuela\u2019s congress, Rodriguez made a reputation for himself as a negotiator and consensus seeker, although he was always a staunch opponent of opening up the oil sector to private investment in the 1990s.\n\nRodriguez, a lawyer who did postgraduate studies in economics, was an influence to Chavez and was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines at the beginning of Chavez\u2019s first term in 1999. A year later, he left the position to serve as secretary-general of OPEC.\n\nIn 2002, he was appointed president of PDVSA, where he failed to resolve the brooding internal conflict which led to a massive walkout. To break the strike, 18,000 employees were fired under Rodriguez\u2019s management \u2014 nearly half of the oil firm\u2019s payroll.\n\nIn the years that followed, PDVSA recuperated and became the world\u2019s fifth largest oil producer, producing more than 3 million barrels per day. But financial losses after the strike were steep, and the company never recovered its engineering talent. Production is now at its lowest point in decades.\n\nRodriguez served as president of PDVSA until November 2004, when Chavez made him foreign ambassador to Cuba.\n\nHe used the position to defend Venezuela\u2019s anti-American foreign policy amid two decades of socialist rule.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They also expressed unequivocally the arguments did not turn physical and that players hashed out their differences afterward and expressed regret for growing heated in the moment. Even so, the mounting anger and embarrassment felt among players during this 5-11 start to the season have reached a boiling point, leading to a rare team fine levied at Wall and the revelation of Beal\u2019s private frustrations directed at team management.\n\n\u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d a person familiar with the team said. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d\n\n[The Wizards are playing good individual defense. So why is the team defense so bad?]\n\nAfter the Wizards won a third consecutive game for the first time this season Wednesday, the team returned to its practice facility the next day. The practice was competitive but something about the atmosphere seemed off, which irked both players and coaches, who reminded everyone that little had been accomplished with the string of wins because the team was still under the .500 mark. That\u2019s when the practice derailed.\n\nWall, the five-time all-star, and Green got into it. Green, who has attempted to be a vocal leader within the Wizards locker room since signing with the team this past summer, challenged Wall, which led to the players exchanging words.\n\nWhen Brooks tried to mitigate the situation, Wall did not appreciate a coach\u2019s interference into a player-to-player talk. Brooks told Wall to get off the court, and Wall responded by yelling back that he was already off the court. Then, according to several people, Wall told his head coach, \u201cF--- you!\u201d\n\nThe team fined Wall an undisclosed amount for the explicit comment in what is believed to be one of the first times the Wizards have punished their franchise player in this manner. It wasn\u2019t the first incident in which Brooks has been the target of a player\u2019s profane ire, however.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, forward Kelly Oubre Jr. cursed out Brooks during a recent game. Although Oubre\u2019s tirade happened on the court, Brooks addressed his fourth-year player following the game in the locker room.\n\nThese outbursts, however, only scratch the surface of the Wizards' early-season meltdown. Beal spread his emotional explosion around for everyone to hear, including Grunfeld.\n\nIn a separate incident during the Thursday practice, Beal and Rivers also engaged in a verbal tiff. As the team scrimmaged, Rivers grew upset after he thought he was fouled but didn\u2019t get a call, according to several people who observed the practice. Though Beal was not the player Rivers had addressed as fouling him, Beal nevertheless took umbrage. Beal essentially told Rivers not to worry about getting foul calls, and that teammates complaining too much has been a problem during games. Play went on, and so did the words. Neither player allowed their lively talk to disintegrate into personal insults, but Rivers and Beal went back and forth verbally over the next several minutes.\n\nLater, Beal, still fired up, went off about the current culture within the organization. According to people who heard Beal\u2019s tirade, Beal yelled something to the effect of, \u201cI\u2019m sick of this s---.\u201d Beal also gestured toward Grunfeld, who was sitting on the far baseline, and said he has been dealing with it for seven years and that, \u201cIt starts at the top.\u201d\n\nDespite Beal\u2019s expression of dissatisfaction with the Wizards in the heated moment, he has not requested a trade, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe revelation of the recent unrest comes after ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday that Washington\u2019s management has signaled to other teams \u201can impression that every player on their roster\u201d could be available for trade discussions.\n\n[Around the NBA, skepticism over whether Wizards would actually trade John Wall or Bradley Beal]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be naive to it, you know,\u201d Beal said Monday after seeing the ESPN report. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those rumors weeks ago. Then, I didn\u2019t buy into them. Now, I\u2019m still not going to buy into them because if that\u2019s my main priority and focus, then I\u2019m going to be messed up on the floor.\u201d\n\nMultiple people in the league who have familiarity with the Wizards and how their front office operates believe the team has no plans to move on from either Wall or Beal. A Wizards spokesman, meanwhile, cited team policy when he responded to the ESPN report by saying Grunfeld \u201cdoesn\u2019t comment on rumors, so he won\u2019t comment on this one.\u201d\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s blowups, players cooled off. Wall, who hosted his foundation\u2019s annual turkey giveaway after the practice, is said to have made amends with Green on the spot after their disagreement. Wall also apologized to Brooks.\n\nRivers and Beal talked for at least 30 minutes after the practice, and both took responsibility for their part in the fiery exchanges.\n\nThe Wizards have lost two straight games to the Brooklyn Nets and Portland Trail Blazers following the practice altercations. People familiar with Monday\u2019s latest practice described it as the best one the team has had. However, with the disputes inside a closed-door session now becoming public, another chapter has been added to the narrative of a Wizards\u2019 season spiraling out of control.\n\n\u201cThey just need to blow the whole s--- up,\u201d one person connected to the team said. \"It\u2019s all bad.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nLeBron James: Cavs\u2019 Kyrie Irving trade was \u2018the beginning of the end for everything\u2019\n\nJimmy Butler is fitting into the 76ers' system seamlessly\n\nSteve Kerr and the Warriors awaken from their \u2018dream\u2019 run to face \u2018real adversity\u2019"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump administration proposal could target exports of the tech behind Siri, self-driving cars and supercomputers - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trump administration proposal could target exports of the tech behind Siri, self-driving cars and supercomputers Washington Post But its broad wording, along with the White House's long-running, high-stakes trade rift with Beijing, left some t\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/19/trump-administration-proposal-could-target-exports-tech-behind-siri-self-driving-cars-supercomputers/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YgVc3wndMQsMStI8OW-gq_CI_Bk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOBP25HGGEI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T03:56:15Z", "content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and their peers could be subject to new restrictions on how they export the technology behind voice-activated smartphones, self-driving cars and speedy supercomputers to China under a proposal floated Monday by the Trump administrat\u2026 [+4187 chars]", "fulltext": "Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and their peers could be subject to new restrictions on how they export the technology behind voice-activated smartphones, self-driving cars and speedy supercomputers to China under a proposal floated Monday by the Trump administration.\n\nFor the U.S. government, its pursuit of new regulations marks a heightened effort to ensure that emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, don\u2019t fall into the hands of countries or actors that might pose a national security threat.\n\nThe official request for public comment, published in the Federal Register, asks whether a long list of AI tools should be subject to stricter export-control rules. The Trump administration\u2019s potential targets include image-recognition software, ultrafast quantum computers, advanced computer chips, self-driving cars and robots. Companies that make those products and services might, for instance, have to obtain licenses before selling them to foreign governments or partnering with some researchers in certain countries.\n\nThe document is only an initial notice of rules to come, and the Commerce Department, which is leading the effort, is still deciding how to proceed. But its broad wording, along with the White House\u2019s long-running, high-stakes trade rift with Beijing, left some tech experts fearful that it could result in greater market barriers for companies doing business in China. They also worry that any rule could adversely affect U.S. investment and research in AI.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the range of products this potentially implicates, that\u2019s massive. This is either the opening of a big negotiation with the industry and the public or a bit of a cry for help in scoping these regulations,\u201d said R. David Edelman, the director of the Project on Technology, the Economy, & National Security at MIT.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the China trade war is a political football,\u201d said Edelman, a former top tech aide to President Barack Obama, adding: \u201cSurprises are not off the table here.\u201d\n\nThe Commerce Department explicitly said it hopes to protect national security without \u201champering the ability of the U.S. commercial sector to keep pace with international advances.\u201d The rules come at the request of Congress, which authorized them as part of a recently passed defense bill. On Thursday, the agency said it is \u201ccommitted to laying the proper foundation to ensure that those technologies critical to national security remain protected to ensure the safety of our country.\u201d\n\nSpokesmen for Apple, Google and IBM also did not respond to requests, and Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon.com founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nIn its proposal, the Trump administration said it is focused \u201cat a minimum\u201d on countries already subject to a U.S. arms embargo, a category that includes China. The potential limits on AI research and exports reflect a growing apprehension with Beijing\u2019s investment in that industry. In December 2017, for example, the White House\u2019s official National Security Strategy warned that \u201crisks to U.S. national security will grow as competitors integrate information derived from personal and commercial sources with intelligence collection and data analytic capabilities based on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nWhat the Trump administration is \u201ctrying to control is the flow of know-how or research or development that enables\" high-tech capabilities, said Melissa L. Duffy, an export-control expert and partner at the law firm Dechert.\n\nSome in the tech industry worry the regulations could widen an existing trade rift between Washington and Beijing. Many executives at big tech companies have bristled at White House-backed tariffs on China, fearing that Beijing\u2019s retaliation could result in higher costs for them \u2014 or higher prices on components for their products. Others simply don\u2019t want to anger Beijing, which controls one of the world\u2019s largest markets for tech devices.\n\nTo that end, Silicon Valley\u2019s lobbyists have been scrambling to digest what the new proposal would mean for their industry at a time when U.S. firms are racing their Chinese counterparts to dominate the market for AI.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a really important process that our industry is taking very seriously and plan to engage in, because the outcomes are of great consequence for us,\u201d said Christian Troncoso, a policy director at BSA, a Washington-based trade group for companies including Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Oracle."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Bears say quarterback Trubisky has right shoulder injury - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Bears say quarterback Trubisky has right shoulder injury Washington Post LAKE FOREST, Ill. \u2014 The Chicago Bears say quarterback Mitchell Trubisky hurt his right shoulder in their victory over the Minnesota Vikings.

The administration of Duterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, brought the disputes with China over the strategic waterway to international arbitration and won, but China has ignored the outcome.\n\nDuterte has refused to immediately demand Chinese compliance to the landmark ruling, which invalidated China\u2019s sweeping claims to the waters, where Beijing has transformed a string of disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases.\n\nDuterte\u2019s rapprochement has fostered a new era of warming relations with the Asian economic powerhouse, with which he has sought trade and investment, infrastructure financing and weapons to fight insurgents. While Western governments have sharply criticized Duterte\u2019s brutal crackdown against illegal drugs, China has not. Both Xi and Duterte have often been in the crosshairs of human rights groups.\n\nAfter a wreath-laying ceremony in the monument of Philippine national hero Jose Rizal in a Manila seaside park that was cordoned off by police, Xi and his entourage will meet Duterte and top Philippine officials later Tuesday at the nearby Malacanan presidential palace.\n\nTwo Philippine officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Duterte\u2019s administration would likely sign a memorandum of understanding to support Beijing\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an ambitious infrastructure loan program that has been criticized by the United States as endangering debtor nations to debt bondage.\n\nThe Philippine government won\u2019t likely immediately accede to proposals for oil and gas exploration in disputed waters but may sign an agreement \u201cto explore maritime cooperation\u201d and establish a committee and a task force to hasten talks that may lead to a decision for a joint hunt for undersea fuel deposits, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the touchy issue.\n\nChina has sought a so-called \u201cMaritime and Air Liaison Mechanism,\u201d an arrangement for forces of both countries to coordinate their naval and aircraft movement to prevent \u201cincidents\u201d in the contested waters, but the proposal has been opposed by Philippine defense officials, the officials said.\n\nFilipino nationalists have warned that any agreement that can undermine the Philippines\u2019 internationally recognized exclusive rights to fish and exploit resources within a 200-nautical-mile stretch of waters from the country\u2019s coast would violate the Philippine constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Philippines should not waive our sovereign rights as affirmed by the arbitral ruling,\u201d said Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, who has made extensive studies on the territorial conflicts.\n\nAside from their trade disputes, China and the United States have wrestled over the South China Sea. Chinese officials have asked Washington to back off from a purely Asian dispute, but the U.S. has vowed to maintain a presence in the waters, where it has no claims but has vowed to continue naval patrols to promote freedom of navigation and overflight.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Nelson Chenault/USA Today Sports)\n\nArkansas announced the suspensions of two players Monday, following reports that they were spotted flirting with Mississippi State cheerleaders before a loss Saturday to the Bulldogs.

Atkins in southwestern Washington, was issued as the office analyzed the dismissal of a deputy who was fired after her affiliation with a female offshoot of the group, Proud Boys' Girls, came to light.\n\n\u201cThe FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism,\u201d noted the report, which was acquired and published by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on government transparency. \u201cThe FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses.\u201d\n\nThe Proud Boys are one of many predominantly male, right-wing groups to come to the fore since President Trump\u2019s election. They describe themselves as a \u201cWestern chauvinist\u201d fraternal group that believes in ending welfare, closing the borders and adhering to traditional gender roles.\n\nBut critics point to other statements and behavior to argue that these aims are a subterfuge for racist and hateful beliefs.\n\n\u201cTheir disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions: rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists,\u201d the Southern Poverty Law Center, which considers the Proud Boys a hate group, wrote in a report. \u201cThey are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe group captured national media attention for its involvement in a fight that broke out on the streets of New York after it was invited to a Republican club in town. Police sought to charge nine people who were affiliated with the group after the incident.\n\nThe Proud Boys, who did not respond to a request for comment sent to their New York chapter, have pushed back on assertions like those made by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Founder Gavin McInnes, who was also a co-founder of Vice, has argued that his ideology is not motivated by racism.\n\n\u201cWhen pestered about their pedagoguery, the politically correct left insists they need to police our language because \u2018words are powerful\u2019 and \u2018words have meaning,\u2019\u201d he wrote in a 2011 essay. \u201cIt is not racist for white people to be unashamed of their race. Few people mind hearing \u2018Navajo Power,\u2019 but there\u2019s this implication that for whites to show any kind of pride means they want to extinguish other races. That\u2019s as absurd as saying a Dallas Cowboys fan wants all the other teams to die. To say black people are totally responsible for their lot in life now that it\u2019s 2011 is not racist.\"\n\nThe FBI\u2019s field office in Seattle referred inquiries about its designation to its headquarters in Washington. In a statement distributed by spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton, the FBI said it did not regulate political ideology or any other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cOur focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhen it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on criminal activity of individuals \u2014 regardless of group membership \u2014 which appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion. The FBI does not and will not police ideology.\u201d\n\nAs is its practice, the bureau declined to deny or confirm whether the group was the subject of an investigation.\n\nThe author of the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s report, Cmdr. Michael S. McCabe, told the Guardian, which first reported on the documents, that the FBI\u2019s classification was revealed in an FBI briefing in August.\n\nAs the Guardian reported:\n\nThe briefing included agency heads from local law enforcement, and in it the FBI said that they \u201chave been warning [local law enforcement] for a while\u201d about the Proud Boys, \u201cnot just in Washington, but around the nation.\u201d The briefing including the Proud Boys was delivered by an FBI analyst, according to information forwarded to the Guardian by McCabe.

Police are investigating at least three other hazing incidents, including another alleged sexual assault.\n\nThose arrested are young offenders and cannot be named.

Prosecutors also allege that the rapper was part of a group that agreed to shoot someone who had disrespected the gang, which resulted in a bystander getting shot in July.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, 6ix9ine\u2019s attorney Lance Lazzaro said that his client is \u201ccompletely innocent of all charges being brought against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn entertainer who portrays a \u2018gangster image\u2019 to promote his music does not make him a member of an enterprise,\u201d he said.

On Instagram last week, 6ix9ine informed fans that he had canceled all of his upcoming U.S. tour dates and fired \u201ceverybody\u201d on his team, including his former manager, Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan, who was indicted alongside the rapper Monday.\n\nIt was also last week that 6ix9ine pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a charge stemming from a May traffic stop. The rapper had initially faced a misdemeanor assault charge, as reported by TMZ, and was accused of squeezing a police officer\u2019s hand so hard he caused swelling. According to the site, the rapper\u2019s attorney said he risked jail time unless he stayed out of trouble for a year.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the rapper and his fellow defendants were ordered held without bail after appearing in court Monday evening. One of the charges 6ix9ine is facing carries a minimum sentence of 25 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence is life in prison.\n\n[Rapper 6ix9ine has lots of hits but just as much controversy. Expect more of both.]\n\n6ix9ine made headlines when he avoided jail time last month in connection with a 2015 case in which he pleaded guilty to use of a child in a sexual performance. The rapper signed a plea deal after the incident, which involved sexually explicit videos featuring a then-18-year-old 6ix9ine, another man and a 13-year-old girl. One condition of the plea deal was that he would stay out of legal trouble for the next two years.\n\nBut after two arrests this year \u2014 including the traffic stop and an altercation with a teenage fan in Houston \u2014 prosecutors argued that Hernandez had violated the agreement. According to the Times, prosecutors asked a New York State Supreme Court justice to sentence him to prison for one to three years. He was sentenced in October to four years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service.\n\nBefore his most recent arrest, 6ix9ine had been plugging his upcoming album, \u201cDummy Boy,\u201d which he said would be released Friday.

They give us a lot of business,\u201d Trump said Saturday when asked about the CIA\u2019s conclusion that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi leader, had ordered the killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cThey have truly been a spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,\u201d he said, referring primarily to Saudi arms purchases. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m president; I have to take a lot of things into consideration.\u201d\n\nTrump may not be focused on counterterrorism cooperation and support for U.S. strategic aims in the region \u2014 the basis of the U.S.-Saudi relationship under his two immediate predecessors \u2014 but others in his administration are clearly concerned.\n\nWhile the administration intends to \u201chold accountable\u201d those responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, it also needs to protect \u201cthe enormously important strategic interests the United States maintains\u201d with Riyadh, including the crucial Saudi role in changing the behavior of Iran, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month.\n\nEven as a growing bipartisan coalition in Congress has blamed Mohammed for Khashoggi\u2019s death and demanded harsh punishment, some current and former U.S. officials, along with experts in the region, say that shared interests and deep roots will ensure that key bonds survive.\n\n[Trump says he won\u2019t listen to Khashoggi \u2018suffering tape\u2019]\n\nIf the administration took \u201cserious action\u201d against the Saudis, Riyadh would \u201cfeel a need to somehow respond, but they\u2019d want to do it in a way that would not escalate,\u201d said a former senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive matter. \u201cMaybe they would not be as supportive in the oil market, or they might do a big arms purchase from the Russians or the Chinese. . . . We could live with that.\u201d\n\nIntelligence ties, the former official said, also would withstand the pressure. \u201cWhat \u00adhappens in almost every case I can think of, where a political \u00adrelationship goes into a rocky time, is the intelligence relationship remains untouched . . . it\u2019s too important to both countries.\u201d\n\nOthers say that even if a serious breach occurred, there would be little to lose because both the Saudi money and the strategic cooperation are less substantive than they may appear.\n\n\u201cOn the peace process, the administration wants the Saudis to deliver the Palestinians, through moral suasion or paying them off, or some combination,\u201d said Anne Patterson, a career diplomat with long experience in the region who was President Barack Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of state for the Middle East.\n\nJared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, White House adviser and point man on the peace plan, has cultivated a personal relationship with Mohammed in hopes that he will lead the Arab world toward a new rapprochement with Israel, at the possible expense of a viable Palestinian state. Trump has already made moves in that direction with his recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and withdrawal of U.S. aid to the Palestinians.\n\nBut other Arab leaders have long considered those hopes \u00adnaive, and they warn that any backing away from support for the Palestinians risks public outrage.\n\nWhile Mohammed\u2019s father, King Salman, may be content to allow his son to lead on most issues, he has repeatedly made his views on the peace process clear.\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian cause is our main concern and will remain so until our brothers, the Palestinian people, gain all their legitimate rights, especially the establishment of their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d Salman said Monday in his annual address to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shura Council.\n\nSome Saudi actions have arguably undermined U.S. objectives in the region.\n\nThe administration objected last year when Mohammed, seeking to undermine the strength of Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, summoned Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to the kingdom, then held him captive and forced him to issue a public statement resigning his office. After Hariri was released and reinstated under international pressure, Hezbollah emerged stronger than ever.\n\nOn Iran, which both the U.S. administration and the rulers in Riyadh consider the region\u2019s biggest threat, the Saudis \u201cwant to hold our coat while we fight,\u201d Patterson said. The United States protects sea lanes in the region, through which Saudi oil is exported. U.S. air and seaborne forces fighting to defeat the Islamic State and weaken the rule of Bashar al-Assad in Syria operate from American bases in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. A significant U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia ended in 2003, when the Saudis asked the Americans to leave.\n\nAdministration plans to further challenge Iran by bringing the Persian Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman together in a new political and security alliance have so far foundered on Saudi and Emirati refusal to re\u00adestablish relations with Qatar. Along with Egypt and Bahrain, they broke relations with Qatar in May 2017, just days after Trump visited Riyadh. A summit that the administration hopes to convene among them to join hands with Washington against Tehran has been repeatedly scheduled and postponed.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s conduct of its ongoing war in Yemen, in which Saudi airstrikes are blamed for causing thousands of civilian casualties and leading to a massive humanitarian disaster, have distracted attention from Iran\u2019s aid to Yemeni Houthi rebels on the other side of the conflict. U.S. logistical and intelligence assistance to the Saudi effort \u2014 directed by Mohammed, who also serves as defense minister \u2014 has inflamed public and congressional outrage in the United States, a fire to which the Khashoggi killing has only added fuel.\n\nReports of recent progress in United Nations attempts to negotiate an end to the war have led some to believe that increased U.S. pressure would give Mohammed an excuse he may be looking for to end the conflict.\n\n\u201cI think the Saudis would get out tomorrow if the Iranians did,\u201d the former senior intelligence official said. \u201cI actually think the Saudis want the U.S. pressure to get out of Yemen, so that they can kind of blame it on somebody else, that they walked away.\u201d\n\nAs for the money, a new report by William D. Hartung of the Center for International Policy, scheduled for release Tuesday, argues that the economic boost from arms sales that Trump has touted is a chimera. Although the president claimed to have signed deals for $110 billion worth of Saudi arms purchases during his visit to the kingdom last year, much of it was negotiated under the Obama administration, and many of the claimed deals were merely speculative. Final sales implemented during the Trump administration so far have totaled $14.5 billion.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cSaudi arms sales support at most tens of thousands of jobs in the United States,\u201d not the hundreds of thousands, or even a million, that Trump has variously claimed, reported Hartung, a researcher who has specialized in tracking the weapons trade.\n\nMany jobs created by Saudi purchases of U.S. weaponry will ultimately be located in the kingdom itself rather than in this country, he wrote. Under Mohammed\u2019s Vision 2030 economic diversification plan, all contracts must include 50 percent co-production clauses, with companies such as Raytheon and Boeing setting up manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Communities flee eruption at Guatemala's Volcano of Fire", "description": "About 4,000 residents have fled Guatemala's Volcano of Fire as red-hot rock and ash spewed into the sky and cascaded down the slopes toward an area devastated by a deadly eruption earlier this year", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/communities-flee-eruption-at-guatemalas-volcano-of-fire/2018/11/19/4c86880e-ec65-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:40:46Z", "content": "GUATEMALA CITY About 4,000 residents fled Guatemalas Volcano of Fire Monday as red-hot rock and ash spewed into the sky and cascaded down the slopes toward an area devastated by a deadly eruption earlier this year.

(Moises Castillo/Associated Press)\n\nGUATEMALA CITY \u2014 About 4,000 residents fled Guatemala\u2019s Volcano of Fire Monday as red-hot rock and ash spewed into the sky and cascaded down the slopes toward an area devastated by a deadly eruption earlier this year.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s volcanology unit said that explosions from the 12,300-foot (3,763-meter) high mountain shook homes with \u201cconstant sounds similar to a train locomotive.\u201d\n\nIncandescent material burst as high as 1,000 meters (3,200 feet) above the crater and flows of hot rock and ash extended nearly 2 miles (3 kilometers) down one flank of the volcano. Hot blasts of pyroclastic material pushed down canyons on the slopes, while a column of ash rose nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) above sea level and drifted toward Guatemala City to the east.\n\nHundreds of families heeded the call of disaster coordination authorities to evacuate 10 communities, piling into yellow school buses for trips to shelters. The national disaster commission said 3,925 people had been evacuated by early Monday. As the hours passed, however, the intensity of the volcano\u2019s activity decreased and many decided to return to their homes or seek shelter with friends or family.\n\nThe Volcano of Fire is one of the most active in Central America and an eruption in June killed 194 people. Another 234 are officially missing, although organizations supporting the communities have insisted there are thousands of missing persons.\n\nIt spewed more ash and hot rock in October, prompting warnings for the nearby communities.\n\nThe biggest danger from the volcano are lahars, a mixture of ash, rock, mud and debris, that can bury entire towns. On Monday, there had been no reports of such flows reaching populated areas, though authorities were taking no chances; they were harshly criticized for not calling for evacuations earlier in June.\n\nFour shelters have been set up for evacuees. Dora Caal, 26, and five members of her family took refuge under a nylon tent at a sports stadium in the nearby town of Escuintla.\n\n\u201cLast night we heard the volcano roar, you could see fire, we couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Caal, whose town of El Rodeo was largely evacuated.\n\n\u201cAt dawn we said we\u2019d better get out, we were afraid,\u201d Caal said as the sun beat down fiercely at the improvised shelter. People like Caal are still reeling from the effects of the June eruption.\n\n\u201cBack then I lost my job at a farm that was on the slopes of the volcano. They closed it and we can\u2019t work there anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nEnma Hernandez, 42, left her home in El Rodeo to evacuate, but her 20-year-old son stayed behind to protect the family home from looters. In fact, many men stayed behind in the town; there were mainly women and children at the shelter.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Thomas Watkins/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Army general in charge of the Trump administration\u2019s controversial border mission is interested in beginning to redeploy some of the U.S. troops who were dispatched several weeks ago to assist Customs and Border Protection, U.S. military officials said Monday.\n\nThe shift would come as the military seeks to adjust to realities on the ground, where soldiers have spent days stringing miles of barbed concertina wire and some have said that they spent days waiting for assignments. They were sent to the border in the days leading up to the Nov. 6 midterm election, as President Trump said he wanted to stop an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants who were traveling north in a caravan from Central America.\n\nLt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan said in an interview with Politico on Monday that he would probably focus first on redeploying some soldiers focused on logistics. They constitute the majority of the border force and have focused both on installing concertina wire and other barriers to slow down any rush of migrants, and building temporary camps in which U.S. soldiers can live nearby. U.S. military officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, confirmed the comment is accurate.\n\n\u201cNow that things are set down here, we don\u2019t need as many troops to actually build base camps and things like that, because the base camps are built,\" said Buchanan, who has headquarters in San Antonio.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s staff would not comment on the record about his comments afterward. On Tuesday morning, his headquarters at U.S. Army North released a statement that did not answer whether or not some troops will be sent home, or when.\n\n\u201cWe are continually assessing our resources and refining requirements in close coordination with [the Department of Homeland Security],\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe may shift some forces to other areas of the border to engineering support missions in California and other areas. No specific timeline for redeployment has been determined. We will provide more details as they become available.\u201d\n\nCritics of the operation, including some retired generals, have decried the effort as a cynical attempt by the president to rally his conservative base to vote. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other defense officials have defended it as legal, with Mattis saying that in the military, \u201cwe don\u2019t do stunts.\"\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how quickly the troops will begin returning home and whether any could be reassigned from Texas or Arizona to California, following a recent decision by members of the caravan to turn west and head to Tijuana, Mexico, just south of San Diego. The migrants began arriving in Tijuana last week.\n\nPresently, there are about 5,800 service members deployed to the border for the mission, including about 2,800 in Texas, 1,500 in California and 1,500 in Arizona. Buchanan said that the number of service members involved in the mission should fall quickly as soldiers finish their work, Politico reported.\n\nU.S. military officials have said repeatedly that they expect the entire mission to conclude by Dec. 15, with the caveat that circumstances could change. Prior to the election, Trump said that he could send as many 15,000 troops, but military officials subsequently said that is unlikely.\n\nIn South Texas, about 1,000 soldiers were sent to the border, some 1,500 miles away from where the migrants are now heading. When The Washington Post visited a base camp near the border in the town of Donna on Nov. 10, more than 100 soldiers could be seen relaxing inside a large tent about the size of a hockey rink, with some playing video games, others tossing around a football, and others reading.\n\nAmong the questions that soldiers have asked during the deployment is whether they themselves will be directed to eventually take down the miles of concertina wire they installed. On Wednesday, Mattis told a soldier who asked that question that the mission so far was to install the barriers and that \u201cwe\u2019ll let you know\u201d what the ultimate plan is.\n\nMattis has sought to characterize the mission as legal and routine in nature.\n\n\u201cWe determined that the mission was absolutely legal, and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPresident Trump has begun telling advisers that he may visit troops in a combat zone for the first time in his presidency, as he has come under increasing scrutiny for his treatment of military affairs and failure to visit service members deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nTrump has so far declined to visit those combat regions, saying he does not want to associate himself with wars he views as failures, according to current and former advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Current advisers said Trump is not expected to visit a war zone during the Thanksgiving break, which he will spend at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida.\n\nThe president has often cast himself as a champion of the Pentagon, invoking the strength and size of the military at his campaign rallies and on Twitter. At the same time, he has frequently criticized U.S. military missions and decisions while personally attacking some former military leaders, contributing to a complicated relationship with the armed forces he commands.\n\nAlthough he signed off on Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s requests to bolster the American military presence in Afghanistan and Syria and retain the footprint in Iraq, Trump isn\u2019t a fan of U.S. military operations there.\n\nIn meetings about a potential visit, he has described the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan as \u201ca total shame,\u201d according to the advisers. He also cited the long flights and potential security risks as reasons he has avoided combat-zone visits, they said.\n\n[\u2018Takes all of the oxygen out\u2019: Trump further divides political map for 2020]\n\nQuestioned last week about why he has not visited American troops deployed in overseas conflicts, Trump indicated during a Fox News interview that a trip was in the works.\n\n\u201cI think you will see that happen,\u201d Trump said in the interview with Chris Wallace that aired Sunday. \u201cThere are things that are being planned. We don\u2019t want to talk about it because of security reasons and everything else.\u201d\n\nThe president also repeated his erroneous contention that he was opposed to the Iraq War. The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker has found that Trump initially expressed support for the invasion and did not register public objections until more than a year after the war began.\n\n\u201cI think it was a tremendous mistake, should never have happened,\u201d Trump told Wallace.\n\n\u201cBut this is about the soldiers, sir,\u201d Wallace responded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s been more with the military than I have, as a president. In terms of funding, in terms of all of the things I\u2019ve been able to get them, including the vets.\u201d\n\nTrump has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life, according to a former senior White House official, who has discussed the issue with the president and spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about Trump\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been interested in going,\u201d the official said of Trump visiting troops in a combat zone, citing conversations with the president. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of those situations. He\u2019s afraid people want to kill him.\u201d\n\nPressure for Trump to make such a visit has been building for months. Eliot Cohen, a former George W. Bush administration official and Trump critic, has raised the issue regularly in public.\n\n\u201cThe point is American servicemen and women are on the ground in these places,\u201d Cohen said in an interview. \u201cThey are getting killed. I think any good leader would want to see something for themselves. And they would want to do something for the troops other than using them as props.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, about 60 American service members have died while deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, according to Pentagon statistics, including both \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cnonhostile\u201d deaths.\n\nPlans for a visit by Trump aren\u2019t firm, several advisers said, and the president has only begun saying in recent weeks that it may need to happen. A White House spokesman declined to comment on presidential visits, citing security concerns.\n\nThe president has come under increasing scrutiny for his behavior toward the military in recent weeks. He attacked the former head of U.S. Special Operations Command, retired Adm. William H. McRaven, on Sunday for his role in catching and killing Osama bin Laden, calling him a supporter of Hillary Clinton and saying that the al-Qaeda leader should have been caught sooner in Pakistan. McRaven responded in a statement saying he did not endorse Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n[Trump says \u2018of course\u2019 the U.S. should have caught bin Laden sooner]\n\nTrump recently skipped a cemetery service marking the end of World War I in France, citing poor weather. He also did not go to Arlington National Cemetery two days later on Veterans Day, later expressing rare regret for missing the occasion.\n\n\u201cI should have done that,\u201d he said in the Fox interview.\n\nTrump has sent thousands of troops to the border with Mexico in anticipation of a Central American migrant caravan in what his critics labeled a preelection stunt designed to shore up anti-immigration sentiment within his base. Mattis has described the mission as good training and necessary support for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe history of presidents visiting American troops on active deployments dates back decades and gives presidents a sense of what is happening on the ground \u2014 while sending a message to troops that the government at home appreciates their personal sacrifices.\n\nDuring the Korean War, Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s pledge to go to Korea helped propel him into the presidency over Adlai Stevenson. Eisenhower followed through with a visit in 1952.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson met with troops at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam in 1966, telling them he had come only to say how proud he was of what they were doing and the way they were doing it. He also visited forces there the next year.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush spent Thanksgiving with American troops in Saudi Arabia during Desert Shield in 1990 and New Year\u2019s with troops in Somalia in 1993. His successor, Bill Clinton, visited troops in Bosnia in 1996 and spent Thanksgiving with troops in Kosovo in 1999.\n\nGeorge W. Bush made a surprise Thanksgiving visit to troops in Iraq months after the invasion in 2003 and went to the country three additional times after that while president. At the time, the U.S. military footprint in the country was building, ultimately numbering about 170,000 troops in Iraq at the peak of a surge in 2007.\n\nMark Hertling, a retired three-star general, helped organize the surprise visit in 2003.\n\nAbout six officers knew Bush was coming, he said, recounting how the president flew into the international airport in the wee hours of the morning and stayed hidden until the troops were in a large mess hall. Bush later served turkey and received resounding applause.\n\n\u201cThe troops in the field need to know their efforts are not being wasted,\u201d Hertling said. \u201cIt shows [that] the government and the people have their back.\u201d\n\nThe troop presence in Afghanistan grew during the first half of the Obama administration, reaching a peak of about 100,000 in 2011. President Barack Obama visited the country four times as president, most recently in 2014, and made one trip to Iraq shortly after his first inauguration, meeting with American forces each time. He had previously visited the combat zones in both countries as a U.S. senator.\n\n[From dire warnings to happy talk: Trump changes his tune after the midterms]\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers say his lack of a visit does not represent a lack of interest in or disrespect for the military. There are military figures in his administration that he admires, his advisers say: Gen. Mark Milley, the chief of staff of the Army, and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a former White House adviser who now works for Vice President Pence.\n\nThe president was persuaded to sign a spending bill that he did not like by aides who brought him lists of military equipment the money would buy \u2014 even down to the specific planes and ships, current and former White House aides said.\n\nTrump frequently touts the strength of the U.S. military at his political rallies, having signed off on a $716 billion budget for the Pentagon this year that included the largest base budget in adjusted terms since World War II.\n\nCurrent and former aides said Trump is somber when making military decisions and has expressed concern about troops dying on his watch. They also note that Trump has visited domestic military bases and visited troops while overseas, such as a stop in Japan last fall, while also bringing military visitors into the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI have never heard him show any sort of disrespect toward the military in private,\u201d said one former senior administration official. \u201cAny time you go anywhere with him in the military, he is overwhelmingly popular.\u201d\n\nAccording to current and former aides, Trump was shaken after visiting Dover Air Force Base shortly after his inauguration to receive the remains of a Navy SEAL killed in Yemen, his first trip to meet a grieving family. He has not returned since.\n\nThe president, who attacked a Gold Star family on the campaign trail in 2016, has shown little interest in some of the minutiae of the military and regularly complains about the headaches involved in its entanglements around the world, aides said.\n\nFor most of Trump\u2019s tenure, a trip to Iraq or Afghanistan would have carried real security challenges and political complications, U.S. officials said.\n\nIraq was heading into elections during the president\u2019s first year in office, and a visit by Trump around the time of the controversy over Trump\u2019s travel ban affecting Muslim-majority countries could have further complicated efforts by the U.S.-backed prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, to secure reelection in May.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the security situation has deteriorated. In September 2017, Mattis was the target of a failed rocket attack at Kabul airport. A month later, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a secret visit to Afghanistan but didn\u2019t leave Bagram air base, in part owing to security concerns.\n\nStill, if the president wanted to visit American troops deployed to one of the countries, U.S. military officials would find a way to organize the trip as they have done in the past, according to officials familiar with the matter. He could easily stop at Bagram for a few hours as Tillerson did, they said.\n\nHertling said he remembered a visit by the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) to Iraq in the worst days of the conflict, and McCain wanted to go to Mosul despite heavy fighting. The military blanched.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to take him anywhere but Mosul,\u201d Hertling said. \u201cHe found out about it and wanted to go there. So we went.\u201d\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/des.bieler", "title": "LeBron James: Cavs' Kyrie Irving trade was 'the beginning of the end for everything' - Washington Post", "description": "Sports Illustrated LeBron James: Cavs' Kyrie Irving trade was 'the beginning of the end for everything' Washington Post When LeBron James returns to Cleveland on Wednesday to play for the first time as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, he'll find a Cavalier\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/20/lebron-james-cavs-kyrie-irving-trade-was-beginning-end-everything/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GhidBGN0uLdzU_z9l8-rMT76FMA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O5Y67ZDSBII6PDAXKM6FFMXQCQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:23:23Z", "content": "When LeBron James returns to Cleveland on Wednesday to play for the first time as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, hell find a Cavaliers team very far removed from its annual-contender status when he suited up for the Cavs. That rapid tumble can be traced \u2026 [+3654 chars]", "fulltext": "\n\nLeBron James, left, and Kyrie Irving, right, sit on the Cavaliers' bench during the 2017 NBA Finals. (Ben Margot/Associated Press)\n\nWhen LeBron James returns to Cleveland on Wednesday to play for the first time as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, he\u2019ll find a Cavaliers team very far removed from its annual-contender status when he suited up for the Cavs. That rapid tumble can be traced directly to his offseason departure, but according to James, the Cavs' reign atop the Eastern Conference really began to crumble in the summer of 2017.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that when Kyrie [Irving] got traded, it was the beginning of the end for everything. It\u2019s not a secret,\u201d James told Joe Vardon of the Athletic, in a story published Monday.\n\nIrving sent shock waves through the NBA when word leaked that he wanted out of Cleveland, even while James still was on the roster. The Cavs quickly acceded to his demand, shipping him to the Celtics for a package including Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and the Nets\u2019 2018 first-round pick.\n\nAccording to the Athletic, when then-Cavs coach Tyronn Lue learned that the Irving trade was about to happen, he drove to meet James and put the latter on the phone with Cleveland General Manager Koby Altman. James was described as \u201cadamant\u201d that Irving should not be dealt away, and Altman reportedly assured the four-time MVP that the trade would not occur.\n\nA few minutes later, it did, James discovered to his noticeable dismay. At an autograph-signing event in California, James \u201cdropped the pen and slumped in his chair,\u201d per Vardon.\n\nJames suggested that he felt he wasn\u2019t deceived by Altman so much as the GM may have been overruled by Cavs owner Dan Gilbert. James also implied that Gilbert, with whom he had a frosty relationship dating back at least to the owner\u2019s infamous \u201ccomic sans\u201d letter in 2010, had ousted former general manager David Griffin to gain more control over his team\u2019s personnel moves.\n\n\u201cTake nothing from Koby, because Koby [was just named GM], but at that point in time, you realize that Koby\u2019s not the only one running the team, as [Griffin] had done, and that\u2019s why Griff was let go, pretty much,\u201d James said.\n\nVardon reported that front-office officials for the Cavs disputed the claim that Altman told James the Irving trade was not going to happen. They also said that Altman asked James if he would sign a long-term deal with Cleveland if Irving were not traded and that James refused.\n\nJames preferred to sign one- or two-year deals with the Cavs that maintained his offseason flexibility, not to mention leverage with the organization, but the price was an atmosphere of uncertainty about how long the franchise\u2019s cornerstone would stick around. With rumors rampant in the summer of 2017 that James was eyeing a defection to Los Angeles in the following offseason, Irving decided to beat his all-star teammate out the door.\n\n\u201cLike, keep it real,\u201d Irving said last month. \u201cIf I was still in Cleveland, I would be . . . like, everything that was foreseen to happen, happened.\u201d\n\nIrving also was ready to move on from playing sidekick to James and lead his own team, a chance he has been given in Boston with a young and talented squad. Meanwhile, in a replay of what happened when James left Cleveland in 2010, that time for the Heat, the Cavs have fallen apart, heading into Monday with a league-worst 2-12 record.\n\nOne thing James expects to be different this time is a much milder reaction to his return to Quicken Loans Arena \u2014 where he helped deliver the Cavs' first championship banner in 2016 \u2014 as opposed to the vitriol that accompanied his first visit to Cleveland in a Miami uniform. Of the possibility that there might be an uncomfortably similar scene Wednesday, he told Vardon, \u201cIt better not be.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAround the NBA, skepticism over whether Wizards would actually trade John Wall or Bradley Beal\n\nJimmy Butler is fitting into the 76ers' system seamlessly\n\nHeat\u2019s Josh Richardson tosses his shoe into the stands, gets tossed\n\nRedskins sign Mark Sanchez to back up quarterback Colt McCoy"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/John.P.Hudson2, https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "title": "USA TO SLAP 'TERROR' LABEL ON VENEZUELA?", "description": "USA TO SLAP 'TERROR' LABEL ON VENEZUELA?

Marco Rubio (Fla.) have pushed for the designation, citing Venezuela\u2019s alleged ties to Lebanese Hezbollah, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and other groups.\n\nRepublicans have long accused Venezuela of having ties to terrorist organizations. But experts have played down the threat and strength of those connections. They warn that a designation that does not offer concrete evidence could weaken the legitimacy of the U.S. list, which critics say already is applied inconsistently.\n\n\u201cI suspect this will be based on hearsay and sources of questionable integrity,\u201d said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.\n\nU.S. officials declined to say whether a final decision had been made about the designation, but in recent days the State Department has asked for feedback on the proposed move from various agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is part of HHS, and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nA State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending decision, calling inquiries about the deliberations a \u201chypothetical question.\u201d\n\nRubio, a Cuban American who organized a letter in late September calling for the terrorism designation, has clamored for a tough U.S. posture toward Venezuela, a longtime backer of the Castro regime in Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed sanctions on a number of people in Maduro\u2019s inner circle, accusing the first lady, defense minister, vice president and other allies of helping the socialist leader \u201cplunder\u201d the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\nOfficials have long said that further measures are under consideration, including an embargo on Venezuelan oil. Despite sharply falling oil exports in recent years, Venezuela is the fourth-largest foreign supplier to the United States, which remains the largest purchaser of Venezuelan crude.\n\nAdam Isacson, a Latin America expert, said the terrorism designation might add momentum for any push for an oil boycott. Republicans in Texas and Louisiana, home to refineries set up for Venezuela\u2019s high-sulfur oil, have argued against such a boycott. \u201cA terrorist sponsor designation will make their lives more complicated,\u201d Isacson said.\n\nThe move could limit U.S. assistance to Venezuela and prohibit financial transactions as the country reels from hyperinflation and extreme food and medicine shortages that have sent millions fleeing to neighboring countries. Many Venezuelans blame Maduro for rampant corruption across the government and mishandling of the economy.\n\nThe country\u2019s health-care system has virtually broken down, allowing once-eradicated illnesses such as measles and diphtheria to reemerge.\n\nDeliberations on the potential U.S. move continued last week, when HHS officials were asked to assess the impact of a terrorism designation on \u201cHHS or CDC programming of funding being carried out by a third party in that country,\u201d according to emails sent among HHS officials.\n\nOfficials were asked to provide a response within 24 hours, something a senior HHS lawyer said was \u201cprobably not doable\u201d because of the issue\u2019s complexity, according to an official who saw the emails. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nThe emails did not specify the country, but a State Department desk officer identified the country as Venezuela in a telephone call last week with about 20 others from agencies that included HHS, CDC and USAID. The State Department officer, Elizabeth Williams, did not say when a decision on the terrorism designation would be made, \u201cshe just said they expect to make a decision soon,\u201d recalled an official who participated in the call. Williams said she was able to share only limited information on the nonsecure telephone line.\n\nExperts are divided on the wisdom of designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism, with some saying it could provide helpful pressure against the increasingly authoritarian Maduro regime, and others expressing concerns that it could play into Maduro\u2019s anti-U. S. messaging or be used as a pretext for a U.S. military intervention.\n\nPresident Trump, publicly and privately, has raised the possibility of U.S. military action in Venezuela, although aides have repeatedly dissuaded him.\n\nU.S. officials secretly met several times with Venezuelan military officers who said they were plotting a coup against Maduro, but the Trump administration ultimately rebuffed their requests for assistance, officials said.\n\nSmilde fears that the designation could \u201cportray Venezuela as a threat to U.S. national security to legitimize a military option.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany analysts in and around the U.S. government either think military intervention would be effective, or that a credible threat of force would get the Venezuelan government to buckle,\u201d he said.\n\nBut such threats \u201ccontribute to the unity and coherence of the Maduro government and undermine opposition organization and unity,\u201d he said. \u201cSince President Trump first suggested a military option in August 2017 the Venezuelan opposition has fallen apart.\u201d\n\nOthers expressed measured support for a harder line against Maduro, who came to power in 2013, jailed political opponents and took over virtually all legislative and judicial power in the country.\n\n\u201cThere are several other governments you could say are involved in more forms of terrorism that have much more impact,\u201d said William Brownfield, the former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut that is a justification for going after other governments, not a justification for saying don\u2019t go after Venezuela.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe case can be made that it\u2019s a positive step in terms of bringing greater pressure to bear on the Maduro regime,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic health experts have warned of sharp increases in malaria and tuberculosis cases and a nearly absolute unavailability of antiretroviral treatment for people with HIV in Venezuela. Increasing levels of malnutrition compound the health crisis, making Venezuelans both more susceptible to infectious diseases and more prone to complications when sick.\n\nA topic of the phone call between U.S. officials was Venezuela\u2019s growing outbreak of measles, an extremely contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus, which has spread to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n\nBrazil, which is grappling with more than 10,000 suspected infections in its massive Amazonas state alone, is considering sealing its border with Venezuela, according to the discussion.\n\nPrograms that could be affected by the terrorism designation include U.S. support for global HIV/AIDS prevention, emergency vaccines and training of public health personnel, according to the discussion. Most U.S. support is funded through the Pan American Health Organization, a U.N. body.\n\nBrownfield said the president could offset some of the negative humanitarian effects of the designation through waivers.\n\n\u201cI believe the law provides the president with authorities to exempt or waive provisions of the law to allow humanitarian assistance like food or medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe possible action against Venezuela came as a surprise to people on the call, the official said. \u201cThat was the first we had heard of it,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense. And then it was like, \u2018Oh, crap. What is this going to do to our ability to respond to the slow-moving health disaster that is coming out of Venezuela?\u2019 \u201d\n\nKaren DeYoung and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.\n\nRead more"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "16 expelled after clash at Venezuelan migrant camp in Bogota", "description": "Sixteen people have been expelled from a camp built for homeless Venezuelan migrants following a violent protest over food rations, Colombia officials said Monday", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/16-expelled-after-clash-at-venezuelan-migrant-camp-in-bogota/2018/11/19/08a1f4ec-ec61-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:10:14Z", "content": "BOGOTA, Colombia Sixteen people have been expelled from a camp built for homeless Venezuelan migrants following a violent protest over food rations, Colombia officials said Monday.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nA large study provides the strongest evidence that children and teenagers can be desensitized to peanut allergies through controlled, escalating exposure to a substance that could otherwise trigger a life-threatening reaction \u2014 an advance that specialists said was likely to herald the development of new food allergy drugs.\n\nAfter a year of treatment with an experimental drug made by Aimmune Therapeutics, 67 percent of children and teenagers with peanut allergies were able to safely ingest the equivalent of at least two peanuts, compared with 4 percent of those on placebo, according to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But that improvement came at a cost \u2014 nearly all of the study participants who received the drug, a pharmaceutical-grade preparation of peanut flour, suffered adverse events of some type, and 1 in 10 withdrew from the trial because of gastrointestinal, skin or respiratory problems or systemic allergic reactions.\n\nFor years, smaller studies have suggested that exposure to escalating amounts of peanut allergen could desensitize people to the potentially life-threatening effects of exposure, which can include anaphylactic shock, but several outside experts said that the large, systematic study of 550 people could lead to the first treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The majority of participants were ages 4 to 17, the group in which researchers found the drug to be effective.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re looking at going from right now where there\u2019s no approved treatment for food allergy, to a landscape where probably in a few years we\u2019ll have a couple of options to offer our patients,\u201d said Corinne Allison Keet, a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine not involved in the study and who said that would amount to a \u201csea change,\u201d given the dearth of options today. \u201cIn the short term, the products that may come to market are not cures, but I think there are a number of different approaches being explored \u2014 and overall, the goal is more of a curative treatment.\u201d\n\nAimmune, which funded the study, plans to submit an application for the drug to federal regulators next month and anticipates that it could launch in late 2019. It is unclear how much it would cost, how long patients would have to take it and whether it would be covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cFor now, the advice will be for ongoing treatment,\u201d said Wayne G. Shreffler, director of the Food Allergy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the study authors who has received trial funding and fees from Aimmune. \u201cFurther studies will be needed to address whether after some years, some people can alter regular dosing. The large majority of the study participants tolerated the treatment, and I expect the same will be true of its use in the real world when and if it\u2019s approved.\u201d\n\nThe treatment is not a cure, and the regimen may not appeal to everyone with food allergies. Patients came to a clinic every two weeks to have their dose gradually increased under supervision, over a period of six months. They also took the drug at home daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember what the goal of this treatment is \u2014 the goal is not to allow people to freely eat peanuts,\u201d said Daniel Adelman, chief medical officer of Aimmune. \u201cKids go out the door every morning, and their parents worry, this is the day they\u2019ll be exposed to peanuts and potentially have a life-threatening reaction. The goal of this treatment is to help protect people from those potentially life-threatening reactions.\u201d\n\nAimmune will expand the approach to other food allergies, testing whether a similar drug could work to desensitize children to egg allergies next year.\n\nExperts warned that this kind of regimen should not be started at home.\n\nThere are an estimated 6 million children with food allergies in the United States. In an accompanying editorial, Michael R. Perkin, from the Population Health Research Institute at St. George\u2019s, University of London, pointed out that the potential market for a therapy is billions of dollars. The Aimmune drug was a defatted peanut flour made through the rigorous manufacturing processes required of pharmaceutical products, which Adelman emphasized meant it was free from variability that can carry the danger of delivering the wrong dose.\n\nKeet said one concern is whether parents and children would understand the limits of the drug.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d still be asking patients to be reviewing labels and not ingest anything with peanut in them,\u201d Keet said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what people would end up doing with this partial protection \u2014 it may give people a false sense of security.\u201d\n\nAimmune stock closed down 11 percent Monday.\n\nRead More:\n\nFDA approves first generic version of EpiPen\n\nHow Mylan, the maker of EpiPen, became a virtual monopoly\n\n\u2018Rapid release\u2019 Tylenol gelcaps are slower to dissolve than cheaper tablets, study finds"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Death of young Thai kickboxer brings focus on dangers", "description": "The sight of two preteen boys pummeling each other with fists, elbows, knees and feet as a boisterous crowd shouts wagers is considered good, clean sport in Thailand, but a boy's recent death may bring changes", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/death-of-young-thai-kickboxer-brings-focus-on-dangers/2018/11/19/d13a2430-ec5f-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T01:01:32Z", "content": "BANGKOK The sight of two preteen boys pummeling each other with fists, elbows, knees and feet as a boisterous crowd shouts wagers at each other is considered good, clean sport in Thailand.

(Sakchai Lalit/Associated Press)\n\nBANGKOK \u2014 The sight of two preteen boys pummeling each other with fists, elbows, knees and feet as a boisterous crowd shouts wagers at each other is considered good, clean sport in Thailand.\n\nHowever, the death earlier this month of a 13-year-old Muay Thai contender may push forward changes to protect other youngsters in Thai kickboxing.\n\nAnucha Tasako died of a brain hemorrhage two days after he was knocked out in a bout on Nov. 10, his 174th match in a career that began at age 8.\n\nHis death was a fluke, said some of the sport\u2019s boosters. They said that the referee did not stop the fight soon enough, and that no doctor was available.\n\nBut even those boys who can carry on fighting are almost guaranteed serious long-term health damage, according to a new report by a Thai doctor.\n\nThai lawmakers recently suggested barring children younger than 12 from competitive boxing, but boxing enthusiasts strongly oppose the change. They say the sport is part of Thai culture and gives poor families the opportunity to raise a champion that will lift their economic circumstances.\n\nAnucha was born in the poor northeastern province of Kalasin and raised by his grandparents since his parents split up when he was 3. Anucha was already becoming his family\u2019s breadwinner when his uncle, a physical education teacher and boxing trainer, brought him to the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn around a year ago to pursue a big-time boxing career.\n\nAnucha\u2019s days started at 4:30 a.m. with a run and light training at the boxing gym. He attended school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. before heading back to the gym for more training until 8 p.m. Bedtime was 10 p.m.\n\nTapakorn Takimnok, 15, a fellow boxer and a friend of Anucha, said he woke up the younger boy every day and never once heard him complain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d spring right out of bed every time I woke him up,\u201d said Tapakorn. \u201cHe always trained hard and kept any emotions to himself.\u201d\n\nAnucha could occasionally earn as much as 10,000 to 40,000 baht ($300 to $1,200) for each fight he won, which he would give to his grandparents, siblings and uncles, Tapakorn said, adding that Anucha earned more than other young fighters because he fought often and was considered a gifted boxer. Young amateur boxers typically earn around 500 to 1,000 baht ($15 to 30) a fight.\n\n\u201cI told him to stop boxing,\u201d said Anucha\u2019s 75-year-old grandmother, Subin Tasako. \u201cHe told me: Grandma, what else can I do? I\u2019m young and I can\u2019t work. If I stop boxing, how would I earn money to pay for school or support you? That\u2019s what he said.\u201d Subin said she didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\nFootage of Anucha\u2019s fatal fight, posted online by Thai media outlets, show him briefly stumbling to the floor after taking a knee to his leg from his opponent. He picks himself back up, and the referee promptly allows the fight to resume, but Anucha appears to have had the fight knocked out of him.\n\nMoments later, he is staggering and defenseless against the ropes, as his opponent lands at least four hard punches to Anucha\u2019s head, leaving him dazed, and perhaps even unconscious before he hits the floor and bangs his head hard on the mat.\n\nDr. Witaya Sungkarat, a doctor from Ramathibodi Hospital in Bangkok, spent five years conducting a study published last month that compared brain development between young boxers and children not involved with the sport.\n\nThe study\u2019s results clearly show that boxing causes irreparable damage to a young child\u2019s developing brain, he said, adding that the longer each participant had boxed, the worse their condition became.\n\n\u201cIf we keep letting children box and injure their brains without implementing measures to protect them, their futures are predictable,\u201d Witaya said.\n\nWitaya understands part of the sport\u2019s appeal. \u201cPeople like to watch children box because they don\u2019t lose on purpose and they genuinely fight each other,\u201d he said, referring to the common perception that many professional boxing matches are fixed to accommodate bookies.\n\nBut Anucha\u2019s case, he said, shows how inadequate oversight in the Thai boxing industry had led young boxers to be overworked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the system that abused him. The system allowed him to fight this much and this often at such a young age,\u201d Witaya said. \u201cThere\u2019s a loophole in the system that allowed him to become a professional fighter without any preventive measures.\u201d\n\nWitaya referenced a provision allowing children to be paid \u201crewards\u201d rather than being paid compensation for work. And while professional Muay Thai titles are only open to competitors age 15 or older and two major Bangkok stadiums have weight minimums, children can fight in unofficial matches outside the World Muay Thai Council supervision with a guardian\u2019s permission.\n\nSukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing camps, said the recently proposed legislation to regulate the sport was conceived by outsiders who do not understand it.\n\nHe cited the success of former Thai boxing Olympic gold medalists such as Somluck Kamsing, who began his boxing career at the tender age of 7. Like many top-tier Muay Thai boxers, he made a transition to more lucrative conventional boxing, and became the first Thai athlete to win an Olympic gold medal, in the featherweight boxing competition in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIf these guys did not start fighting at a young age would they be world champions today?\u201d Sukrit said, adding his opinion that allowing children to box is not dangerous because the blows are not as forceful.\n\nAt the Jitmuangnon Gym in Bangkok, 10-year-old Chaichana Saengngern rises every day at around 4 a.m. to train before going to school, then returning to work out some more. He has 20 bouts under his belt since first stepping into the ring at the age of 8.\n\n\u201cHe needs to fight in real matches to be a good fighter,\u201d said Chaichana\u2019s uncle, Suthep Saengngern, speaking days after Anucha\u2019s death. \u201cHe can\u2019t just dance around in the gym.\u201d\n\nSuthep said he doesn\u2019t support banning children from boxing because it would rob many poor Thai families of the chance for their offspring to become professional athletes.\n\n\u201cEvery family\u2019s economic background is different. People with money send their kids to play golf, tennis, swimming or shooting. But poor people can\u2019t do that. We can only do boxing. This is our option,\u201d Suthep said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Explaining his disagreement with scientists on climate change, Trump told the Associated Press: \u201cMy uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years. Dr. John Trump. And I didn\u2019t talk to him about this particular subject, but I have a natural instinct for science.\u201d\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s natural scientific instinct, you don\u2019t need a B.S. from Trump University to know how frustrating it must be to be contradicted repeatedly by \u201cexperts\u201d \u2014 some in his own administration!\n\nThe intelligence community unanimously believes that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but Trump\u2019s instinct says there\u2019s no reason to disbelieve Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials.\n\nSatellite imagery shows that North Korea has enhanced its ability to launch missiles, but Trump says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nThe scientific consensus supports the theory of climate change, but Trump says \u201cit could very well go back\u201d to cooling.\n\nTrump\u2019s instinct has led him to a number of scientific discoveries over time:\n\n\u201cThe worst hurricanes were 50 years ago.\u201d\n\nVaccines cause autism in \u201cmany\u201d healthy children.\n\nThe flu shot is \u201ctotally ineffective.\u201d\n\nExercise is unhealthy.\n\nCoal is \u201cindestructible.\u201d\n\nWindmills are a \u201ckilling field\u201d for birds and can make people who live near turbines \u201cgo crazy after a couple of years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s okay to look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse.\n\nCalifornia is \u201cshoving\u201d water out to sea \u201cto protect a certain kind of three-inch fish.\u201d\n\nWith such a high level of technical expertise, Trump waited 19 months into his presidency to name a White House science adviser.

There are other issues and other concerns, but a significant part of the question of Democratic leadership hinges on the same sort of dissatisfaction with the establishment that completely reshaped the Republican Party from 2010 to 2016.\n\nThat is not necessarily, though, the way that the fight is shaping up among those in the caucus who will actually be voting on who will serve as House speaker.\n\nOn Monday, a group of Democrats published a letter expressing their opposition to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) serving in the position. Signed by 14 elected members of the Democratic caucus in the upcoming congress and two candidates whose race has not been called (one of whom \u2014 Ben McAdams in Utah \u2014 seems unlikely to win), the letter marks the most significant obstacle to Pelosi\u2019s election as speaker \u2014 though not an insurmountable one. Add in those elected members who are included in The Washington Post\u2019s tally of opposition to Pelosi, though, and there are 22 opponents to her assuming the position. That could potentially be enough to block her election.\n\nSo who are these opponents? For the most part, they represent more moderate House districts than the average Democrat, even excluding McAdams' 4th District in Utah. (As of writing, McAdams is trailing, so he is excluded from the analysis.) Using Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voting Index, a measure of how House districts voted in prior presidential elections, the average Democratic district gets a score of D+12, meaning Democrats have a 12-point partisan advantage. Among the 22 members on The Post\u2019s list of Pelosi opponents, the average PVI score is D+4 \u2014 closer to the midpoint.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents also differ from the rest of the caucus in other ways.\n\nThe incoming Democratic caucus is much more diverse than the Republican caucus, with white men making up 89 percent of the Republicans elected to the 116th Congress and making up only 38 percent of the Democrats who won this month.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAmong those who oppose Pelosi, though, most are white men \u2014 more than two-thirds. White men are the largest demographic group in the Democratic caucus, and the most likely to have offered opposition to her assuming the speakership.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next largest group is white women \u2014 though most of the Pelosi opponents in that group didn\u2019t sign the letter.\n\nMuch of the debate about party leadership is framed in the context of age. Age is, after all, a handy guide to duration of political service and, therefore, to the party. Pelosi, born in 1940, is older than most of those who will join her in the House Democratic caucus next year \u2014 but the median birth year of those who oppose her taking the gavel is substantially lower than the caucus on the whole.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAs we noted at the outset, the reasons for opposing Pelosi\u2019s assuming the speakership are myriad, even if they often stem from an interest in reflecting the new energy in the Democratic Party.\n\nMost of those who signed the letter or who have expressed opposition to Pelosi have already served in the House with her. Those newly elected members, several of whom \u2014 like Max Rose (D-N.Y.) or Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.) \u2014 expressed opposition to Pelosi specifically to improve their chances in more moderate districts, will soon find themselves in a whole different world of political pressure.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing at which Pelosi has proven adept, it\u2019s cajoling reticent Democrats."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Two dead and two more wounded, including a police officer, in shooting at Chicago hospital - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Two dead and two more wounded, including a police officer, in shooting at Chicago hospital Washington Post CHICAGO \u2014 Two people are dead, including the gunman, and two others, including a police officer, were injured Monday afternoon when a ma\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/19/shooter-chicago-hospital-wounds-multiple-people-including-police-officer/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1AuiJyyn_wAKbmcHDPp0KezXaSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P6BP7OVHAII6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:22:30Z", "content": "CHICAGO A man showed up to Mercy Hospital and opened fire on a woman believed to be his former fiancee before turning the gun on others, leaving two people, including the gunman, dead, and two others, including a police officer, injured Monday afternoon.

Tensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road, and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Migrants camped in Tijuana after traveling in a caravan to reach the U.S were weighing their options Tuesday after a U.S. court blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s asylum ban for illegal border crossers.\n\nMany said they have no intention of breaking the law, but were feeling pressure after anti-migrant protests in this Mexican border city and claims by Trump and the Tijuana mayor that the caravan harbors gang members and criminals, something they strongly deny.\n\nKeven Paul Mejia, a 27-year-old former security guard from the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, said there were some delinquents traveling with the group of several thousand who smoke marijuana and get drunk.\n\nBut, he said, most are like him, just hoping to land a job in the U.S. \u201cThere are more of us who are good, than bad,\u201d Mejia said.\n\nHerson Cordonez, a 29-year-old Honduran, said the actions of a few migrants were tainting the image of the 4,000 to 6,000 in the caravan, not all of whom have yet reached Tijuana. \u201cWe are not criminals, we are migrant workers,\u201dCordonez said, adding that he was considering trying to get into Canada if the U.S. doesn\u2019t want him.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristen Nielsen visited a San Diego pacific coast beach examining up close the newly installed razor wire wrapped around a towering border wall that cuts across the sand. On the Tijuana side, dozens of onlookers gathered with cellphones to take pictures of her arrival through the fence.\n\n\u201cThis is a border wall with row upon row of concertina wire,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cMake no mistake, we are very serious. You will not get into our country illegally.\u201d\n\nShe said there were as many as 500 criminals and gang member in the groups heading northward, though she refused to answer questions about how they were identified or what crimes they had committed. She added that caravan migrants had assaulted \u201cborder police in multiple countries,\u201d even using \u201cincendiary devices,\u201d though she provided no evidence.\n\nA day earlier, Tijuana officials said they had arrested 34 caravan members for drug possession, public intoxication, disturbing the peace and resisting police, and they would be deported to their home countries\n\nNielsen said there were 6,200 migrants already camped in Tijuana and another 3,000 in Mexicali, a few hours\u2019 drive to the east. She said most were young single men who have no legitimate claim to U.S. asylum, adding that wanting to get a job in the U.S. or be reunited with family were not reasons to be allowed in.\n\nLess than an hour before Nielsen\u2019s arrival a man tried to swim into the U.S. but was quickly detained by border patrol agents. Five agents were on jet skis offshore along with two border patrol boats, while two drones on the Mexican side hovered just above the wall to get a view of the activity.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has made a point of saying the city is not happy with the migrants who began arriving last week, and he compared the Central American group unfavorably with about 3,000 Haitians who ended up staying after their bid to reach the U.S. failed last year.\n\n\u201cThe Haitians arrived with their papers, with a clear vision,\u201d Gastelum said in an interview posted on the city\u2019s Facebook page. They came \u201cin an orderly way, they never asked us for food or shelter,\u201d renting apartments and making their own food. He said the Haitians found jobs and \u201cinserted themselves in the city\u2019s economy\u201d and had not been involved in any disturbances.\n\nBy contrast, Gastelum said, the caravan of Central Americans, \u201chad arrived all of sudden, with a lot of people \u2014 not all ... but a lot \u2014 were aggressive and cocky.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government gave the Haitians temporary transit permits, and after they failed in attempts to enter the United States, many have since applied for Mexican residency. The majority in the Central American caravan have refused Mexico\u2019s repeated offers of residency or asylum, and vowed to cross the border.\n\nHaitian Chilo Semaco, 36, said Mexico has been \u201cmore or less\u201d welcoming to the Haitian immigrants. Since arriving in Tijuana two years ago, Semaco has found work selling aprons to people crossing the border in their cars. \u201cIt\u2019s better than being in Haiti,\u201d he said.\n\nSome local police and residents have expressed concern that portraying the caravan as criminals has tarred its innocent members and exposed them to reprisals.\n\nSome of the largely Honduran migrants were frightened when about 500 people in an affluent district of Tijuana staged angry protests Sunday against the caravan. Dozens of the more radical protesters then marched to an outdoor sports complex near downtown where 2,500 migrants have been staying, sleeping on dirt fields and under bleachers.\n\nWalter Matute said he has been deported from the U.S. twice and fears jumping the border would end his ability to get asylum. But he believes others will now take a chance in light of the court ruling blocking Trump\u2019s ban on asylum for illegal border crossers.\n\n\u201cYes people are going to cross,\u201d the 36-year-old Honduran said. \u201cThere are a lot of women and children. A lot are going to be up for it now.\u201d\n\nSitting on a curb near the sports complex, a Honduran woman affirmed his assessment. The woman, who declined to give her name, said she was getting anxious and was considering crossing illegally to skip the long wait at the Mexican port of entry for asylum seekers.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego, and there was already a waiting list of 3,000 when the new migrants arrived, so most will have to wait months to even be considered for asylum.\n\nGastelum, appealing for greater federal help to cope with what he called an \u201cavalanche\u201d of migrants, estimated they would be in Tijuana for at least six months while waiting to file asylum claims.\n\nFor most people in this city of 1.6 million, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans is not very noticeable. Most of the migrants stay within a three-block radius of the sports complex that faces the towering metal walls topped with barbed wire at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut the United States has dramatically increased security at ports of entry in preparation for the caravan, placing cement barriers topped with razor wire that can be quickly moved to block passage if a mass of migrants to try to force their way into the country.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
