Helton realizes fans are unhappy just one season after he led the Trojans to the Pac-12 title. (Timothy J. Gonzalez, File/Associated Press)\n\nHere are some things to watch this week in the Pac-12 Conference:\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK: There\u2019s nothing on the line, but perhaps the most compelling matchup this week is the rivalry game between USC and UCLA because of the drama that surrounds it. The Trojans were officially eliminated from contention for the Pac-12 title game with last weekend\u2019s loss to Cal at the Coliseum. The loss amped up the talk that Clay Helton\u2019s days at USC may be over. A loss to the team\u2019s rival would seem to all but cement his fate. On the other sideline there\u2019s the enigmatic Chip Kelly, who hasn\u2019t fared as well as some Bruins boosters would have liked in his first season as head coach. The Bruins have been eliminated from championship contention, too. A big rivalry win at the Rose Bowl would give those boosters something to cheer.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Stanford quarterback K.J. Costello against California\u2019s defense. While Gardner Minshew has cornered the attention market among Pac-12 North QBs, Costello is putting up solid numbers in his sophomore season. He ranks second in the league (behind Minshew, of course) with an average of 285.4 passing yards per game, and he\u2019s thrown 23 touchdowns. He ranks atop the conference for passing efficiency (156.9). Cal\u2019s D, meanwhile, ranks atop the league for pass defense efficiency (112.0), interceptions (14) and overall pass defense, allowing opponents an average of 183.8 passing yards a game.\n\nNUMBERS GAME: There are three teams in play in the South, so here are the scenarios for a trip to the Pac-12 championship: Arizona State controls its own destiny, and can capture the South\u2019s berth with victories at Oregon and then in the rivalry game against Arizona. Utah needs to win this weekend at Colorado (the Utes finish up against BYU) and get help with a Sun Devils loss in one of their last two games. The Wildcats need to win out (against Washington State this weekend and the rivalry game) and hope for a Colorado victory over the Utes. ... The North could come down to the Apple Cup. Washington and Washington State can clinch the berth by winning out. The Huskies host Oregon State this weekend, while the No. 8 Cougars have Arizona. ... Speaking of the Huskies, they have a 13-game winning streak at home. The Cougars\u2019 home streak is at 12. ... Jake Browning has 91 career touchdown passes, ranking him sixth on the Pac-12 all-time list. Jared Goff is fifth with 96. ... Stanford is bowl eligible for a 10th straight year.\n\nUPSET WATCH: Right now Utah is a 7-point favorite over Colorado. The Utes jumped back into the rankings at No. 21 after a convincing win over Oregon last weekend. Colorado, on the other hand, has lost five straight, and has just been decimated by injuries this season. But the Buffaloes got receiver Laviska Shenault back last week after a three-game absence and he had a 100-yard receiving game in a 31-7 loss to Washington State. And the Buffs are at home. So maybe this is a good time for Colorado to salvage a season that started out with such promise.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER: Matt Gay, who won the Lou Groza award for the nation\u2019s best kicker, seems to just be getting better. If that\u2019s possible. Gay made all six of his field goal attempts in Utah\u2019s victory over Oregon last weekend, a school record. His 20 points tied a team record for a kicker, too. Among those field goals was a career-long 55-yarder. He\u2019s made 18 straight FGs, tying the school record.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker attends a ceremony at the Justice Department in Washington on Thursday. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE)\n\nColumnist\n\nPresident Trump says and does so many outrageous things that it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what\u2019s truly important. Nothing that has happened since Election Day is as important as the fact that Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to stop an investigation of the Trump campaign and replaced him with a political hatchet man who has expressed his desire to throttle special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhen he was asked Wednesday by the Daily Caller why he had appointed Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general, Trump replied: \u201cLook, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had. It\u2019s something that should have never been brought. It\u2019s an illegal investigation.\u201d This is similar to the admission that Trump made to Lester Holt of NBC News in May 2017 that he fired FBI Director James B. Comey because, \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\u201d Once again, the president is essentially admitting to obstruction of justice.\n\nAt least Comey was ultimately replaced with another nonpartisan professional \u2014 Christopher A. Wray. That\u2019s not the case with Sessions.\n\nThe more we know about his successor, the more alarming his appointment appears to be. Whitaker\u2019s track record, apart from a stint as U.S. attorney in southern Iowa, consists of running small businesses such as a day-care center, trying penny-ante cases involving a dry-cleaning business, and acting as a consultant for a shady company, since shut down, known as World Patent Marketing. The very name screams fraud. Whitaker now denies being aware of fraud allegations, but at the time he vigorously defended the firm.\n\nClearly, Whitaker was not appointed based on his legal credentials. He was appointed because he was such an outspoken booster of Trump and basher of Mueller. As a private legal commentator, he dismissed allegations of both collusion and obstruction of justice against Trump.\n\nHis very appointment has been criticized as unconstitutional by eminent legal experts, including conservative legal scholar John Yoo and conservative attorney George T. Conway III, because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. \u201cIn order to prevent a breakdown of federal law enforcement,\u201d Yoo urges, \u201cthe White House should hurry to select a permanent attorney general before any more damage is done.\u201d\n\nThe only precedent the Justice Department could cite to justify Whitaker\u2019s appointment was another non-confirmed official who served as acting attorney general in 1866 for all of six days. If that is the precedent, then Whitaker should have already left office. Yet Whitaker is still on the job \u2014 and he still hasn\u2019t recused himself from supervising the Mueller investigation.\n\nSome informed observers, including Lawfare editor Benjamin Wittes and former FBI agent Asha Rangappa, argue that it\u2019s too late for Whitaker to stop the Mueller investigation. Maybe, maybe not. But Whitaker can certainly impede Mueller\u2019s work by vetoing difficult decisions such as whether to fight a court battle to compel Trump to testify orally or to publicly release the Mueller report.\n\nWhitaker can do great damage even if he does nothing more than read all of Mueller\u2019s files \u2013 as he now will have the right to do \u2013 and share that information with the White House. Sure, he would be risking impeachment or even prosecution for obstruction of justice, but Whitaker is not someone who has exactly exemplified devotion to the rule of law: He believes that Marbury v. Madison, the seminal 1803 case establishing legal review of legislation, was wrongly decided, and he has said that only Christians should serve as judges.\n\nThere is already cause for concern that Whitaker may have tipped off the White House. On Thursday, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation.\u201d Trump has never used the phrase \u201cinner workings\u201d before. Maybe he was just spouting off. Maybe he was reacting to information shared with him by witnesses Mueller has interrogated. Or maybe he has suddenly gained a vantage point on the \u201cinner workings of the Mueller investigation\u201d that he did not have before Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nIn this hour of peril for our democracy, it is imperative that Congress rush to the ramparts. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to move legislation that would protect Mueller. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has belatedly said he would refuse to support judicial confirmations until that legislation is brought to the floor, but his threat will not be effective unless he is joined by at least one other Republican. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) actually introduced legislation to protect Mueller, but now he doesn\u2019t see the need for it and even says Whitaker doesn\u2019t need to recuse himself.\n\nWe are seeing a slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre, and the lack of pushback from Congress, so far, gives Trump a green light to continue his assault on the rule of law. Every day that Whitaker remains in office is a day that our democracy is being undermined.\n\nRead more:\n\nMatthew Whitaker is a crackpot\n\nMatthew Whitaker has experience advising con artists.

(Rafiq Maqbool/Associated Press)\n\nMeditation worked as well as traditional therapy for military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder in a small experiment sponsored by the Department of Defense.\n\nOne method preferred by the Department of Veterans Affairs is exposure therapy, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone and many can\u2019t handle what it requires: purposely recalling traumatic events and confronting emotions.\n\nMeditation could be a better choice for some, the researchers said.\n\nThe experiment tested meditation against exposure therapy, which involves working with a therapist and gradually letting go of fears triggered by painful memories.\n\nMany vets won\u2019t try exposure therapy or drop out because it\u2019s too difficult, said Thomas Rutledge, the study\u2019s senior author and a Veterans Affairs psychologist in San Diego.\n\nEvidence for meditation \u201callows us to put more options on the table\u201d with confidence they work, Rutledge said.\n\nThe study was published Thursday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.\n\nAbout 400,000 veterans had a PTSD diagnosis in 2013, according to the VA health system. The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation\u2019s benefits last.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no follow-up in this study,\u201d Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist\u2019s skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they\u2019d received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it\u2019s not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nThere\u2019s growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably less threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K.

He accomplished the feat in 104 games, easily breaking Calvin Johnson\u2019s mark of 115.\n\nBut Jones refuses to take much credit, pointing out that quarterback Matt Ryan, his teammate since the Falcons drafted him sixth overall in 2011, and many others played an equally big role.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m never an individual guy,\u201d Jones said Thursday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it by myself. It was just like Matt did a great job giving me opportunities, the offensive line. It\u2019s like one of those things that I can\u2019t go out there and play by myself \u2014 football is the ultimate team sport. I don\u2019t know. I feel regular.\u201d\n\nFalcons offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, in his second season working with Jones, has a pretty good idea why his big playmaker causes so many matchup problems even as he\u2019s constantly double-teamed. Linebackers often aren\u2019t fast enough to cover him. Defensive backs are often too small to tackle the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder.\n\n\n\nAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones runs against the Cleveland Browns in the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Cleveland. (Ron Schwane/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how much ground he can cover,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cYou can tell two guys to run a six-step route. He may get to 20 yards and another guy might run it at 14 or 15. He can just cover so much ground, and then his explosiveness to get in and out of breaks, for a man that size, is very impressive.\u201d\n\nJones is more concerned with helping the Falcons (4-5) beat Dallas (4-5) to stay in the NFC playoff hunt. The Cowboys\u2019 secondary has only two interceptions but is still a threat with cornerbacks Byron Jones, Chidobe Awuzie and safeties Jeff Heath and Xavier Woods having combined for 22 pass breakups.\n\n\u201cCover-three team, mix in a little man, and they do have cover-two in there,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut who knows how they\u2019re going to play us?

Knowing Atlanta was no longer a threat to run the ball, the Browns dropped back in coverage and kept everything in front of them.\n\nJones wants the Falcons to establish the run early and maintain it throughout the game. Ryan needs the threat of play-action to keep the linebackers up and let his receivers get open for big gains.\n\n\u201cNot taking anything away from Cleveland, but there were some opportunities that we\u2019ve got to take advantage of,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are always things out there that you miss on the field, but that\u2019s more so on us. We\u2019ve made the corrections.\u201d\n\nNotes: Thursday marked the first day that K Matt Bryant was listed as a full participant in practice since Week 6. Bryant, the career franchise scoring leader, has been sidelined with a sore hamstring. If he is able to play, the Falcons might release Giorgio Tavecchio to add depth at other positions. ... MLB Deion Jones, returning from a foot injury that\u2019s sidelined him since Week 1, was a limited participant for the second straight day. ... Also limited were WR Mohamed Sanu (hip), S Damontae Kazee (shoulder), DE Derrick Shelby (groin), LBs De\u2019Vondre Campbell (calf) and Bruce Carter (knee).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee is intensifying his calls for acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker to recuse himself from supervision of the special counsel\u2019s probe, citing Whitaker\u2019s friendship with a key witness in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere is a blatant conflict of interest here that demands recusal,\u201d Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview.\n\n\u201c[Sam] Clovis is more than just a witness,\u201d Warner said. \u201cHe was the supervisor of the Trump Foreign Policy Advisory Committee, which included a cast of rogue characters.\u201d\n\nClovis, who served as national co-chairman of President Trump\u2019s campaign, was a key contact for two of Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers who have come under scrutiny: George Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Carter Page, the subject of a secret intelligence warrant.\n\nPapadopoulos and Page have acknowledged contact with Russians during the campaign, but they said that the contacts were appropriate and that they have been victimized by overzealous investigators.\n\nClovis has been interviewed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s team, appeared before the grand jury probing Russian interference in the 2016 election and been called before congressional committees.\n\nThe Iowa Republican activist has described the acting attorney general as a \u201cdear friend\u201d and a longtime political ally.\n\nClovis and Whitaker have been close since both made unsuccessful U.S. Senate bids in 2014. Later that year, Whitaker chaired Clovis\u2019s bid for Iowa state treasurer. In a recent interview with Reuters, Clovis said Whitaker was a \u201csounding board\u201d for him when Clovis worked for Trump\u2019s campaign. After Whitaker was tapped by Trump to serve as acting attorney general last week, Clovis said he texted him congratulations.\n\nNeither Clovis nor his attorney, Victoria Toensing, responded to a request for comment.\n\nBut in an interview with The Washington Post last week, Clovis dismissed the suggestion that their relationship raised questions about Whitaker\u2019s ability to oversee the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant, and Matt has high integrity. I\u2019m very happy for him, and he\u2019ll do a fantastic job,\u201d Clovis said.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the acting attorney general \u201cis following the processes and procedures of the Department of Justice on all matters.\u201d She declined to comment on Whitaker\u2019s relationship with Clovis.\n\n[In Matthew G. Whitaker, Trump has a loyalist at the helm of the Justice Department]\n\nWarner\u2019s comments came as other Democratic lawmakers pushed back against Whitaker\u2019s appointment, saying it violated laws governing Cabinet vacancies.\n\nEarlier this week, top Democrats from the House and Senate, including Warner, sent a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s ethics chief demanding to know whether he advised Whitaker to recuse himself from the special counsel\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\nIn their letter, the Democrats argued that he has a \u201cclear bias\u201d against the investigation, citing comments he made before joining the Justice Department in which he was critical of the probe.\n\nWarner said in an interview that the most powerful argument for recusal is Whitaker\u2019s longtime relationship with Clovis, a man he describes as a central player in the still unfolding Russia drama.\n\n\u201cThat would appear \u2014 even to my foggy memory of legal ethics classes \u2014 to smack of a classic conflict of interest,\u201d Warner said. \u201cWe are talking about the acting attorney general of the United States. This is a situation that demands recusal.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers have echoed that call.\n\nThe Clovis-Whitaker relationship \u201cis one of many conflicts of interest that explains why he should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller and his investigation,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. Earlier in the week, the incoming chairman of that panel, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), said Whitaker\u2019s ties to Clovis are troublesome and \u201ccause for recusal.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators have defended Whitaker. During an interview Thursday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) rejected the idea that recusal was necessary. He said that he had spoken to Whitaker and that the acting attorney general \u201cbelieves he doesn\u2019t have a legal or factual reason to recuse,\u201d and also has no plans to interfere with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cHe says he is going to follow regular order. Regular order to me means he\u2019s not going to do anything crazy,\u201d Graham said, adding that Whitaker told him he has not had any interaction so far with Mueller.\n\nClovis was one of the earliest supporters of Trump\u2019s presidential bid. He was named national co-chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign after endorsing the celebrity businessman in August 2015 and held an affiliation with the campaign through Election Day.\n\nIn his role at the Trump campaign, Clovis helped bring in two advisers who have been key in the Russia investigation: Papadopoulos and Page.\n\nPage was an energy consultant who had lived in Moscow and advocated warmer U.S. ties with Russia. Papadopoulos encouraged Trump to meet with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin during the campaign, according to emails and congressional testimony.\n\nPage told the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017 that he was connected with Clovis in January 2016 by campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after he volunteered his services. Page later had breakfast with Clovis in Northern Virginia to discuss joining the campaign, he told the committee.\n\nPapadopoulos told prosecutors that he spoke to Clovis before he was named a foreign policy adviser, according to court documents.\n\nAccording to court filings, Papadopoulos said that Clovis told him that building better relations with Russia was Trump\u2019s principal foreign policy goal.\n\nClovis has denied making those remarks.\n\nPapadopoulos kept his supervisor apprised of his interactions with a London-based professor and a Moscow think tank director and that those contacts could help the candidate secure a meeting with Putin, according to court documents. The Washington Post has identified Clovis as the supervisor.\n\nClovis responded that he would \u201cwork it through the campaign,\u201d adding, \u201cGreat work,\u201d according to filings.\n\nDevlin Barrett and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Mexico's high court tosses law on policing by military", "description": "Mexico's Supreme Court has invalidated a controversial law signed last year that created a legal framework for the military to work in a policing role in much of the country", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexicos-high-court-tosses-law-on-policing-by-military/2018/11/15/24a6d4a0-e92d-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:21:14Z", "content": "MEXICO CITY Mexicos Supreme Court has invalidated a controversial law signed last year that created a legal framework for the military to work in a policing role in much of the country.

(Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)\n\nCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Fifteen months before the next New Hampshire primary, Ohio Gov. John Kasich stood in the offices of one of his closest supporters and sketched out the reasons someone from his own party needed to challenge President Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a time in our country where our leaders divided us, where they preached doom and gloom,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIn the old days, if you were a Republican, you couldn't wait to get to the suburbs. Now you can't go to the suburbs.\u201d\n\nOver 24 hours in the Granite State, Kasich cheerfully stoked speculation about his own presidential ambitions. He worried that Trump's \u201cnegative populism\u201d would make it hard for him to win again. He saw Republicans running on \u201ctaking health care away from Americans\u201d and losing.\n\nCould he run against Trump? Well, he just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be some quixotic adventure that left him and his ideas looking weaker.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m doing in 2020,\u201d Kasich told a group of Saint Anselm College students earlier in the day. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is go into it again and diminish my voice, to get back out here and get the beans beat out of me.\u201d\n\nKasich, who stayed in the 2016 primary contest longer than any Trump opponent, has remained one of the president's chief Republican critics. He denounced the 2017 effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, teaming up with Democratic governors to offer changes instead. He went after the president for an ill-fated summit with Russia, warning that \u201cthe stability of the West\u201d was being risked by bad policy.\n\nNot since 1992 has a Republican president faced a primary challenge to his reelection, but some in the party wonder whether it's time to rethink that tradition.\n\nShortly before the midterms, the University of New Hampshire's Granite State poll found that just 56 percent of the state's Republicans were intent on backing Trump in the 2020 primary; 20 percent favored \u201csomeone else.\u201d Reporters had trailed along as Kasich and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) traveled to New Hampshire, lobbying for a real challenge to Trump.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I hope somebody else runs,\u201d Flake told The Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cMore qualified people than me. But I hope that somebody runs. I\u2019ve not ruled it out.\u201d\n\nTrump's critics argue that the president's position has degraded since 2016, when he dispatched more than a dozen candidates, most with stronger institutional backing. While New Hampshire Republicans narrowly reelected Gov. Chris Sununu, they were wiped out down the ballot, losing both houses of the state's General Court, and badly losing the race in the 1st Congressional District \u2014 the only open seat in the country that elected a Democrat after backing Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cRepublicans lost everything but the governor's office here,\u201d Kasich told reporters on Thursday.\n\nState GOP Chairman Wayne MacDonald blamed the result on \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in outside money,\u201d while Trump critics blamed the president.\n\n\u201cWe lost state senate seats and state legislative seats in areas that are traditionally Republican strongholds,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former New Hampshire GOP chair who's working to find a challenger to Trump. \u201cThey're suburban areas where people are leaving the party because of the president. It's obvious, even if some people don't want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nBill Kristol, the conservative pundit who has made trips to New Hampshire to drum up a resistance to Trump, said that he'd been having more frequent conversations on the topic since the midterms. For two years, he argued, conservatives choked down their qualms about Trump because he'd rescued them from a Hillary Clinton presidency. Now, for the first time, they might question whether Trump was risking the election of a new Democratic president.\n\n\u201cThe implications of the electoral returns are sinking in, even for people who are not as opposed as I am to Trump on more ethical grounds,\u201d Kristol said. \u201cFor a long time, you would hear people say: Oh, he's got the special sauce. He won and Romney couldn't win, so he must know something. And suddenly, you don't hear that as much.\u201d\n\nKasich, the runner-up in New Hampshire's 2016 primary, would start in the strongest position of any potential challenger \u2014 far behind, but with a support base and plenty of allies. He was joined on the trail by Tom Rath, a supporter from 2016 who'd worked with Republican nominees for decades; Gordon Humphrey, a former U.S. senator who had left the GOP over Trump; and Douglas Scamman, a former speaker of the state House.\n\n\u201cPeople don't look up to this president,\u201d Scamman said. \u201cThey might look up to someone who's better.\u201d\n\nRepublican voters, of course, had weighed Kasich's message against Trump's and sided with the latter. The governor's pitch in New Hampshire had not changed much from 2016, when he described a growing economy in Ohio and a state that had made its peace with expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. There was a new post-midterm twist: Kasich counted down all the Midwestern states where Republicans lost last week, then noted that \u201cin Ohio, we won everything.\u201d Why? Voters \u201cweren't frustrated\u201d with their government.\n\nYet within minutes of making that pitch, Kasich was speculating on what it would take to break the two-party system wide open. He imagined a 2020 matchup between Trump and a left-wing Democrat that would create \u201ca vast ocean between the parties.\u201d That was a particularly thrilling concept to Humphrey.\n\n\u201cAre you going to run for president?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cCome on, Gordon, I can't tell you that!\u201d Kasich said with a laugh. \u201cAll options are on the table.\u201d\n\nSeung Min Kim contributed reporting.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nMississippi Senate. Democrat Mike Espy continues to run straight-to-camera pitches in the year's past election; in his latest, he describes himself as a moderate by pointing out that \u201cRonald Reagan signed the first bill I wrote, on infrastructure and jobs.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which just put down $1 million for an ad campaign, is up with a spot describing Espy (accurately) as a \u201chigh-powered lobbyist,\u201d warning that \u201ccorporations rig the game\u201d in Washington.\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) talks to reporters Thursday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSatisfaction with election results (CNN/SSRC, 677 Adults)\n\nHappy - 57%\n\nDisappointed - 34%\n\nFunny things happen in midterms where the House and Senate go in different directions. These numbers line up with what exit pollsters saw; voters, despite taking few economic worries into the election, badly wanted to create a check on the president.\n\nShould Democrats pick Pelosi for speaker? (Monmouth, 802 Adults)\n\nSelect Pelosi - 17%\n\nSelect someone else - 45%\n\nThat's a shockingly low number for the House Democratic leader, but there's a reason for it. Republicans and Independents oppose Pelosi, as one might expect; more importantly, Pelosi is backed by just 23 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of liberals. Those numbers simply don't comport with Democrats' desire to lead the House and suggest that a large number of partisan Democrats are imprinting their frustrations with the party on a leader who's been around since 2002.\n\n2020\n\nMichael Avenatti. The attorney was arrested on an accusation of domestic violence, after which he made bail and denied the charges. Nonetheless, Vermont Democrats scrapped two planned appearances for Avenatti.\n\nSherrod Brown. The senator from Ohio added his voice to the chorus of Democrats asking whether the close races in Florida and Georgia were stolen, telling the National Action Network that \u201cthere are more of us than there are of them\u201d and that \u201cif Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it.\u201d\n\nJohn Delaney. He hired Michael Starr Hopkins, fresh from the Florida Democrats' campaign for governor, as a new spokesman.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand. The senator broke with most New York Democrats to criticize the state's tax break deal with Amazon, which got her some praise from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who, as New York politicos remember, Gillibrand did not back in her primary this year.\n\nKamala Harris. The senator from California is heading to Mississippi on Saturday to campaign for Mike Espy, the Democrat making a long-shot bid in this month's special Senate election.\n\nWAIT, WHAT?\n\nThe Florida recounts have created more than that state's usual amount of sideshows \u2014 and that's a lot. But the most confusing might be the role of Tim Canova, an independent candidate who challenged Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) last week and has spent most of his political career asking whether he's been the victim of election fraud.\n\nOne week ago, Canova tweeted a video that, he said, showed \u201cballots transported in private vehicles [and] transferred to [a] rented truck,\u201d a claim that was signal-boosted by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), even though it was never proved. A few days later, Canova appeared on a Fox News report about \u201celection chaos\u201d in Florida, alleging that there was a \u201cmanipulation or hack\u201d that changed the election.\n\n\u201cWe've had evidence that has now come to light that suggests there was wrongdoing in my own election,\u201d Canova said. \u201cMy election results were capped at 5 percent, which is ludicrous, when a Republican poll showed us neck and neck with Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\u201d\n\nFox didn't follow up, but for South Florida liberals, this was a familiar riff from Canova. In 2016, Canova challenged Wasserman Schultz in the Democratic primary, bolstered by the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and by activists furious at the congresswoman's role leading a DNC that was seen to have favored Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He won 21,504 votes, losing to the congresswoman by 14 points, far beyond the margin for a recount.\n\nThat could have been the end of the story, but Canova never stopped running. Earlier this year, he told The Washington Post that he believed the election results had been manipulated, because they'd identified enough supporters to win and were \u201ccrushing it\u201d during the get-out-the-vote period. In tweets, he suggested that \u201cindependent statistical analysis\u201d of the vote count suggested that his defeat was \u201cimprobable\u201d and that an investigation of the ballots could answer his and his supporters' questions. He also alienated some of his 2016 supporters by speculating that a DNC staffer killed in what police described as a botched robbery had leaked the committee's internal emails; federal investigators have pinned the leak on foreign hackers.\n\n\u201cYou can't even call for an investigation,\u201d a frustrated Canova told The Post. \u201cI said there should be a thorough investigation, and I was crucified for that.\u201d\n\nCanova took the election to court. Nine months after the primary, while making his second primary challenge to Wasserman Schultz, he sued Broward County elections supervisor Brenda Snipes for access to the 2016 ballots . Three months later, Snipes signed off on an order to destroy the ballots. As Canova pointed out, and has continued to point out, Snipes probably broke the law by doing so.\n\nWhat gets lost here is that Snipes acted early on something that always happens after an election is certified. The ballots were destroyed 12 months after the election, which was the standard for state races; they should have been destroyed 22 months afterward, which is the requirement for federal elections.\n\nBut Canova and a core of activists looked at what happened and made a decision: There was no way to win a Democratic primary under these conditions. In April, he bolted the party and became an independent. Last week, he won 13,676 votes, good enough for 5 percent of the vote in a high-turnout election \u2014 and, according to Canova, a fresh reason to suspect that the election had been rigged.\n\nWhat was the evidence? On Fox and elsewhere, Canova referred to a \u201cRepublican poll\u201d that was rumored to exist before the election, though no one has specified who paid for the poll, who it sampled or when it was taken. In an interview today, Canova said he had \u201cno idea\u201d about the details of the alleged poll, which he heard about in the media, speculating that Wasserman Schultz would have released an internal poll that showed her winning easily if one existed.\n\nCanova said he was \u201cspeaking with lawyers\u201d about whether to sue to see the ballots from the 2018 election and to see whether results were manipulated, as he suspected they were. He would continue speaking out about Brenda Snipes, who in the days since the 2018 midterms had become the face of the recount. \u201cWhen an election supervisor manages to give you 5 percent of the vote, that tells you something,\u201d Canova said.\n\nFlorida's 23rd District, however, does not entirely sit inside Broward County. Miami-Dade County also contains a portion of the district; there, Canova did slightly worse than he did in Broward. Asked what that meant for the argument about Snipes, Canova suggested that the faults with electronic voting were not limited to one county.\n\n\u201cThese people are very organized, and if they wanted to rig the vote, I'm sure they could do it in two elections at once,\u201d Canova said.\n\nFor two years, Florida Democrats have dismissed Canova's talk about the election. In the slow-motion chaos of the recount, at least some conservatives have raised him up.\n\nRIGHT\n\nSpeaking of challenging election results, at least four Republicans in uncalled House races are now raising the specter of fraud or going to court.\n\nUtah. Rep. Mia Love is suing Salt Lake County's clerk, hoping to stop the count of absentee ballots until her campaign can challenge the signatures.\n\nCalifornia. Both Rep. Mimi Walters (R) and Young Kim, who have been losing ground as more ballots are counted in their races, have raised the possibility that Democrats are working to steal votes. (In reality, weeks of late-counted ballots that skew toward late-voting Democrats have become a sort of California norm.)\n\nMaine. Rep. Bruce Poliquin is proceeding with a lawsuit against the state's ranked-choice voting system, after a majority of third-party voters picked Democrat Jared Golden as their second choice, pushing him over 50 percent.\n\nThe problem for any Republican who enters the new year behind in the vote count is that the House determines any races that are contested after states certify the results, and Democrats will run the House.\n\nLEFT\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers, which recovered some political ground in 2018, is releasing data from a Democracy Corps poll of 1,250 registered voters that suggests one reason Democrats punched through despite a good economy: worries about education and wages.\n\nPollsters found that a plurality of voters, 48 percent, agreed that \u201cthe economy is strong\u201d and that their own families were economically secure. Among white working-class men, that number rose to 54 percent. A plurality of all voters said that their wages were rising, while white working-class men saw higher wages by a 13-point majority.\n\nBut when pressed, a majority of voters (60 percent) from every bracket said that wages were not keeping up with the cost of living, and 88 percent said health-care costs were too high. By a 17-point margin, voters said that the 2017 tax cuts had not benefited them. Democrats with presidential ambitions have been tripped up sometimes by questions about the strength of the economy; AFT's research suggests a handy answer.\n\n\u201cJust a week after the midterm elections where the GOP faced a resounding voter rebuke of their fear-based agenda that cloaked their allegiance to the wealthy and corporate CEOs above all else, we have further evidence that the people want an agenda that helps them,\u201d said AFT President Randi Weingarten. \u201cThey want investments in public schools, health care, and the things regular people care about, and will vote against those who obstruct this agenda.\u201d\n\nREADING LIST\n\nDoes your vote count in Florida?

(Alastair Grant/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Christian Pulisic played just his second match with the U.S. national team in 13 months, and the Americans failed to muster much of an attack in a 3-0 loss to England on Thursday night that marked Wayne Rooney\u2019s farewell with the Three Lions.\n\nJesse Lingard and Trent Alexander-Arnold scored in a 104-second second span midway through the first half, just after Pulisic was denied by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, and Callum Wilson beat American goalkeeper Brad Guzan in the 77th minute. The United States is 0-3 and has been outscored 7-0 in three matches at old and new Wembley.\n\nRooney, who joined Major League Soccer\u2019s D.C. United in July, entered in the 58th minute in his 120th international appearance, the most among England outfield players. The best chance for the 33-year-old striker was in stoppage time, when his low shot was saved by Guzan to the frustration of a crowd of 68,155.

Since the loss at Trinidad and Tobago last October that ended a streak of seven straight World Cup appearances for the U.S., Pulisic had played just once for his country, in a May exhibition against Bolivia near his home in Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe showed his speed in the first half, breaking in alone on goal, but Pickford was quick off his line. This marked the first time Pulisic played together with midfielders Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Tyler Adams, who entered during the second half.\n\nAfter a giveaway by Pulisic, England went ahead in the 25th minute when Dele Alli took the ball into the corner and passed to Lindgard the top of the penalty area. Lingard took a touch as Miazga failed to close him down, then lofted the ball to the far corner over Guzan\u2019s outstretched arm\n\nWilson dribbled into the penalty area in the 27th at Brooks and Miazga. The ball bounded out to Jadon Sancho, who passed to an unrushing Alexander-Arnold.

Bush, 51, was charged in a six-count indictment that carries a possible death sentence \u2014 though the Justice Department said it would determine later whether to seek that penalty.

That was up from 6,121 in 2016, though the FBI noted that many more law enforcement agencies contributed information.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department launched a new hate-crimes website to provide a centralized portal for the department\u2019s hate-crimes resources for law enforcement, victims, advocacy groups and others. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein has touted the department\u2019s aggressive posture in bringing cases against individual offenders, noting that since January 2017 the department has prosecuted more than 50 defendants for hate crimes.\n\nHe also has called attention to disparate reporting of hate crimes by local law enforcement agencies."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ciaran Fahey | AP", "title": "Germany beats Russia 3-0 thanks to first-half goal barrage", "description": "Leroy Sane and Niklas Suele struck their first international goals to guide Germany to a 3-0 win over Russia in a friendly", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/germany-beats-russia-3-0-thanks-to-first-half-goal-barrage/2018/11/15/ebf3c314-e924-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T22:22:23Z", "content": "LEIPZIG, Germany Leroy Sane and Niklas Suele struck their first international goals to guide Germany to a 3-0 win over Russia in a friendly on Thursday.

If we do that on Sunday we will lose.\u201d\n\nThe stakes will be more meaningful Sunday in the next game at Wembley.\n\nAfter leaving the field, England learned that Croatia beat Spain 3-2 in the UEFA Nations League ahead of its trip to London. England or Croatia has a chance to advance to the Final Four tournament if either can win the match. A draw would allow Spain to advance from league A4 to the finals of Europe\u2019s new national-team competition.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to be ruthless we have to do that right the way through the game,\u201d Southgate said.\n\nRooney is optimistic. When England reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years in July, Rooney was a spectator from afar.\n\n\u201cSeeing how they\u2019re working and how they\u2019re improving has been great for me,\u201d Rooney said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

England and Croatia have four points before they meet at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThe group winner advances to the Final Four tournament in June. The team that finishes bottom of the group will be relegated to League B.\n\nWith Croatia needing a victory to keep its hopes alive, the World Cup runner-up pinned Spain in its area in the final moments and Jedvaj scored on the rebound after goalkeeper David de Gea had blocked a shot.\n\n\u201cI am delighted and proud. I gave my best and this means a lot for us,\u201d said Jedvaj, who plays for German club Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we needed to play for a win and we managed to show that the heavy loss in Spain was just a bad day. We are improving from match to match and now we are facing England. It will be difficult.\u201d\n\nCroatia started strong by applying pressure and sending long balls to forward Ivan Perisic, who forced De Gea to push his shot onto the post in the sixth minute.\n\nPerisic intercepted a pass and set up Andrej Kramaric to open the scoring in the 54th before Dani Ceballos replied two minutes later for Spain.\n\nCroatia went back ahead in the 69th when Jedvaj headed in a cross from Luka Modric, but Sergio Ramos leveled again for Spain with a penalty eight minutes later after Sime Vrsaljko handled.\n\nSpain\u2019s passing was starting to click and the visitors appeared to be getting close to another goal when Croatia went forward in stoppage time in one final push that culminated in Jedvaj\u2019s last-gasp goal.\n\n\u201cCroatia got that little bit of fortune when both teams were desperately trying to win this match right at the end,\u201d said Spain coach Luis Enrique, who has now lost back-to-back matches after also falling to England 3-2 last month.\n\n\u201cWe did enough in the second half to win, but Croatia caught us well on their counters.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nThree likely incoming Democratic chairs of House committees overseeing environmental issues vowed to scrutinize the Trump administration\u2019s actions on climate change and bring before them top administration officials who they think have escaped adequate oversight under their Republican colleagues.\n\nAfter eight years out of power in the House, Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson (Tex.), Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.) and Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.) are expected to lead the committees on Science, Space, and Technology; Natural Resources; and Energy and Commerce, respectively, after serving as the panels' ranking Democrats.\n\nIn a slate of interviews, they outlined an expansive agenda to put a hot spotlight on the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of President Obama\u2019s climate agenda and to delve deep into alleged misconduct of officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department.\n\nAt the top of that list is Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\nGrijalva wants Zinke to testify before his committee about discussions surrounding a deal in Whitefish, Mont., between the Zinkes\u2019 family foundation and Halliburton chairman David Lesar along with other developers. Democrats asked Interior\u2019s acting inspector general to launch a probe of the matter in late June after Politico first reported on the deal. The watchdog office last month referred the matter to the Justice Department.\n\nTrump said last week he was \u201clooking at\u201d the allegations against Zinke but that overall he was \u201cvery happy with most of my Cabinet.\u201d Zinke has denied the allegations as \u201cvicious attacks.\u201d\n\nThe planned oversight is in line with the overall aim by the incoming House majority to scrutinize President Trump and his underlings on subjects such as the president\u2019s tax returns and alleged payments by Trump\u2019s former lawyer to women who said they had affairs with him.\n\nSome agencies are already gearing up for an onslaught of congressional demands. The EPA recently hired two lawyers who are prepared to handle document requests, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nAn EPA spokesman, who declined to comment directly on the two hires, said there had not been a spike in hiring at the agency due to the prospect of greater oversight.\n\nWhile agencies prepare, there is already a turf battle within the new Democratic majority over how to wield its power to address what scientists say is an ecological crisis the world has little time to solve.\n\nAt the moment, even the forum for a climate debate is up for debate.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), looking to corral support and again serve as speaker of the House, said she \u201cstrongly\u201d supports reestablishing a special committee on climate change.\n\n[Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says she has the votes to become the next House speaker]\n\nBy doing so, she is meeting one of the demands from a group of protesters \u2014 one of whom was Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N. Y) \u2014 who occupied her office Tuesday. First impaneled by Pelosi in 2007, the select climate committee was scrapped four years later when Republicans took the House.\n\nBut Pallone and Johnson have voiced apprehension about duplicating the efforts of their own panels.\n\n\u201cWe have climate change champions leading all these committees,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, wondered what a select committee, which was purely a fact-finding panel the last time around, could achieve with Trump regularly dismissing the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the globe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what a special select committee would do to change the executive branch,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nA day after Pelosi tweeted her support for creating a special climate committee, the three ranking Democrats announced they plan to hold two days\u2019 worth of hearings on climate change early next year. Pallone said Democrats want to review some of Trump\u2019s splashier climate-related moves, such as the plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord and to repeal greenhouse-gas limits on coal-fired plants.\n\nThey also want to bear down some smaller-bore but still neglected issues.\n\nPallone wants to determine whether the Trump administration is following legally mandated requirements to review potentially dangerous chemicals and issue energy-efficiency standards.\n\nJohnson said she aims to review a proposal to ban the use of certain studies in rulemaking that rely on confidential health information.\n\nGrijalva said he was interested in conducting hearings on a proposed reorganization plan of Interior, which he worries may break up some \u201cpretty well-functioning\u201d offices.\n\n\u201cIt's a long list that has been dormant,\u201d Grijalva said.\n\nThat alone probably will not be enough for the progressives. A handful of freshmen, including Ocasio-Cortez, are pressuring Democratic leaders to craft an ambitious plan to take the entire nation to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years.\n\nIn addition to answers about the Montana land deal, Grijalva said he wants to know more about an incident last month in which Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson announced one of his top appointees would become Interior\u2019s acting inspector general. Days later, Interior officials called Carson\u2019s statement \u201c100 percent false\u201d and said they would not hire HUD official Suzanne Israel Tufts.\n\n\u201cThe coincidence of the timing, I would question,\u201d Grijalva said, noting that Carson\u2019s statement came shortly after Interior acting inspector general Mary Kendall referred allegations concerning Zinke to Justice.\n\nPallone said he wanted to know more about the work of Nancy Beck, formerly an executive at the lobbying outfit American Chemistry Council, at the EPA.\n\nEven the tenure of Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s first EPA administrator who resigned in July amid ethics investigations, may again be scrutinized.\n\n\u201cMy concern with the EPA is: How was Mr. Pruitt able to get away with all he got away with and remain there?\u201d said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is set to take over the gavel of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nAsked about future congressional investigations, Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift declined to directly address the issue in an email.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of bipartisan priorities that we work with Congress on and we will continue to work with them,\u201d she said.\n\nHouse Democrats will also have the opportunity to grill corporate executives. Already, environmental groups have called for Democrats to investigate ExxonMobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a company, and there\u2019s been outreach before by the minority on these committees, then that gives you a pretty good indication that they\u2019re going to want to talk to you,\u201d said Aaron Cutler, a former lawyer for Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee who now works at the law firm Hogan Lovells.\n\nBut Democrats will have to balance their impulse to investigate Trump\u2019s environmental deputies with their desire to try to work with the president on a long-promised infrastructure bill.\n\nPallone expressed interest in working with the White House to improve drinking-water systems, while Grijalva said he wants to finish a plan kicked off by congressional Republicans to use federal oil and gas revenue to fix leaky pipes and craggy roads in national parks.\n\n\u201cThis is an area where we can work with the president,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nBut at a news conference this week, Trump threatened to take a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d if Democrats investigated him and his team.\n\nAnd while lawmakers have the power to demand documents when they\u2019re in the majority, Alston & Bird partner Kevin Minoli said it is important to keep things in perspective. Minoli, who led the EPA\u2019s response to congressional oversight during the Obama administration, noted that members of Congress often set tight deadlines of two weeks or less.\n\nBut, he cautioned, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that when they write that letter that the agency is going to provide them the next day, or even ever.\"\n\nBen Guarino and Paul Schwartzman contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ian Livingston", "title": "PM Update: Rain and freezing rain becomes showery tonight, may turn back to snow before ending", "description": "Some refreeze and slick spots are possible, especially north and west.

These are the are the areas where a bit of a refreeze is possible heading into the morning. Temperatures should remain fairly steady everywhere through the night.\n\nBy the way, we may see the remaining rain showers change briefly back to snow and/or sleet before the precipitation exits for good by 4 a.m. or so, but with no additional accumulation expected in the immediate metro area. Maybe just an additional dusting in those same far western and northern suburbs mentioned above.\n\nOriginal post\n\nIt\u2019s been a long winter, and it hasn\u2019t even started. I\u2019m kidding. Sort of. The first snow is always fun, at least until it makes a mess and/or turns to rain and slop. We\u2019re in phase two at this point locally. Lots of slop to deal with, and this part of the current winter storm is peaking through the evening.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: We\u2019ll continue to see patches of moderate to occasionally heavy precipitation into the evening. Overall, we are seeing activity transition from a solid shield of rain to more showery, or waves of precipitation. This is primarily rain, but there is some freezing rain in our far north and west suburbs where temperatures are still at or below freezing. Some precipitation may still be locally intense at times, but it also becomes increasingly hit-or-miss into the night. It could turn back over to sleet and snow as the storm pulls away after midnight and toward sunrise, particularly across northern Maryland. Any additional accumulation would be minor. Temperatures don\u2019t go far from where they are now, with lows mostly in the near 30 to mid-30s zone. Some refreeze is a concern, especially north and west (more on that below).\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Friday): It\u2019s breezy behind the nor\u2019easter, but sunshine should return. With those rays come temperatures plenty high enough to finish off much of the melting process except in places it really piled up. Highs aim for the mid-to-upper 40s under partly sunny skies. Those winds are out of the north around 10 mph.\n\nSee David Streit\u2019s forecast through the beginning of next week.

If your area remains at or below freezing this evening, this is especially targeted at you.\n\n\n\nTemperatures tonight will dip to remain near freezing in colder spots north and west. These temperatures are representative but not exact. Near freezing should be considered potentially below freezing. (Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nAs CWG\u2019s Jason Samenow indicated in the last main storm update, temperatures heading into sunset remained near and below freezing \u201cwest of Poolesville and Sterling, and north of Gaithersburg and Columbia.\u201d In addition to seeing freezing rain in the short term, these are the same general areas that are likely to see the most in the way of refreeze overnight.\n\nAlthough it may not be extensive and a major event in itself, there is a good chance there will be more delays and cancellations on Friday as we deal with the aftermath of today\u2019s weather.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nThe cost to create President Trump\u2019s Space Force could be lower than $5 billion and certainly will be in the single-digit billions, Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said at a briefing Thursday, pushing back against Air Force estimates that put the price tag at $13 billion or more.\n\nShanahan, the lead Pentagon official working on the Space Force, expressed confidence the project would come to fruition \u2014 even though Democrats taking over the House have opposed it and the White House has broadly ordered the Pentagon to cut costs.\n\nShanahan also said the Pentagon has failed its first-ever completed audit \u2014 a result he described as expected.\n\n\u201cThere is a considerable number of areas where we had a pass,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there are some other ones where they went through and they said, \u2018We went into your inventory system and we didn\u2019t find these things, so therefore that\u2019s a finding, and you don\u2019t have a clean assessment.\u2019 In a lot of these audits, it\u2019s the type of finding that matters.\u201d\n\nThe fact that an audit was completed at all is \u201csubstantial,\u201d Shanahan said. He added that more information would be made public in due course by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general and comptroller.\n\nHe said the Pentagon has been coming up with \u201ccorrective actions\u201d in response to the audit\u2019s preliminary findings. Some of the compliance issues in particular irritated him, he said, such as inventory inaccuracies where the Navy had buildings on the books that actually weren\u2019t there.\n\nWhile Shanahan seeks to introduce better compliance and business practices at the Pentagon, the former Boeing executive is also dedicating much of his time to the creation of the Space Force, a hallmark project for the president. The Pentagon is working on a proposal to submit to Congress for the creation of the separate military branch.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really targeting is to submit the legislative proposal so that Oct. 1 of next year we can say, \u2018Here\u2019s the birthday of the Space Force,\u2019 \u201d Shanahan said.\n\nOutside the legislative proposal, the Pentagon is already creating a unified Combatant Command for space \u2014 similar to Transportation Command or Strategic Command \u2014 and a space development agency. Shanahan said he would like to see the leader of the space development agency chosen by the end of the year and the first head of Combatant Command confirmed at the beginning of 2019.\n\nThe undertaking comes as the White House asks the Pentagon to shrink its budget for next year in response to a federal deficit that shot up since last year\u2019s tax cut.\n\nDemocrats have expressed skepticism over the need for an entirely new military bureaucracy to step up American power in space.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, who is poised to take over as chairman, has agreed that the United States must expand its military capability in space to counter Russia and China but has said the creation of an entirely new bureaucracy for the task is costly and unnecessary at a time when budget concerns should be in the forefront.\n\nShanahan said Thursday he can work with Smith on the issue. \u201cOn the Space Force itself, across the board everyone has said, \u2018Accelerate your ability to \u00addeliver capabilities,\u2019 \u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThat\u2019s been universal. I think with Chairman Smith in place, what he has said is he wants to focus on cost and efficiency.\u201d\n\nShanahan vowed that the Pentagon\u2019s proposal to Congress for the Space Force would withstand cost scrutiny. \u201cThe proposal that we are going to carry forward makes sense,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House has ordered the Pentagon to come up with a budget some 5 percent less than the military had planned for next year. Shanahan said his office is working on a $700 billion budget in accordance with that order, about $33 billion less than the Pentagon had planned, and expects to get input from the branches of the military early next week. This year\u2019s budget was $716 billion.\n\n\u201cWhat I want the president to understand going forward are what are those trade-offs so he has an informed position,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cHe needs to have an awareness of what that number really translates to in terms of performance here in the department.\u201d\n\nDespite the rollback, the coming budget proposal will still be a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d that shows how the Pentagon is reshaping the military for an era of great-power competition with Russia and China, Shanahan said. It will retain priority areas for the strategy, such as the development of greater cyber capabilities and the pursuit of hypersonic missiles, he noted.\n\nThe White House\u2019s demand for a pared-back Pentagon budget came as Trump dispatched thousands of active-duty troops to the border with Mexico ahead of the midterm elections to help U.S. Customs and Border Protection prepare for the arrival of a caravan of Central American migrants. Critics described the deployment as a wasteful political stunt, a criticism that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis dismissed during a visit to deployed troops in Texas this week.\n\nAt the Pentagon, Shanahan confirmed that the number of active-duty troops supporting the Department of Homeland Security at the border had peaked at 5,900, far fewer than the 10,000 to 15,000 troops Trump said he planned to send to the border before the midterms. In addition to the active-duty troops, 2,000 National Guard personnel have been deployed to the border since April.\n\nAsk about the discrepancy between the numbers the president cited and a peak deployment of 5,900 forces, Shanahan declined to offer an explanation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to reconcile the two,\u201d he. He referred questions on the troop figures to U.S. Northern Command, which is in charge of the mission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much peaked in terms of the number of people who are down there,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nThe deputy defense secretary also dismissed speculation that he could leave the Pentagon and possibly join the White House office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cI will absolutely be here,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI am 100 percent confident in that. I am going to run through the tape.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emilyheil", "title": "It's back to 'Be Best' for Melania Trump after clash with West Wing official - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post It's back to 'Be Best' for Melania Trump after clash with West Wing official Washington Post Melania Trump's whirlwind week started with a flight on Sunday to Washington from Paris, where her husband had faced stinging criticism for missing a \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-back-to-be-best-for-melania-trump-after-clash-with-west-wing-official/2018/11/15/5a5c510e-e90c-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/O7Efap4d7i5aG5a-IxFrlNnzhPc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XX6GMTXJDQI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:41:03Z", "content": "Melania Trumps whirlwind week started with a flight on Sunday to Washington from Paris, where her husband had faced stinging criticism for missing a ceremony honoring the military in World War I.

(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s whirlwind week started with a flight on Sunday to Washington from Paris, where her husband had faced stinging criticism for missing a ceremony honoring the military in World War I. Over the next few days, as the president reportedly fumed and contemplated a rattling staff shake-up, the first lady had a tumultuous week of her own.\n\nShe seemed to publicly slight her predecessor, Michelle Obama, then made headlines when NBC reported that she was had clashed with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly. Finally, Trump initiated a personnel drama of her own when she engineered the ouster of the deputy national security adviser.\n\nBy Thursday, the first lady appeared serene and smiley at a panel discussion with teenagers about fighting bullying online.\n\nTrump\u2019s attendance at the conference marked a return to business as usual for the first lady, who has made combating online bullying part of her signature \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative for children.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s technology provides people with a digital shield to hide behind and being anonymous often takes the place of being caring and responsible, which can lead to children and adults feeling empowered to be unkind and at times, cruel,\u201d Trump said at the \u201cCreating a Culture of Responsibility Online\u201d panel, which was part of a conference put on by the Family Online Safety Institute. \u201cAs I have said before, it is not news or surprising to me that critics and the media have chosen to ridicule me for speaking out on this issue, and that\u2019s okay. I remain committed to tackling this topic because it will provide a better world for our children.\u201d\n\nBut it capped a week in which she took a much more aggressive posture herself \u2014 and one that has reshaped the way many people will see her.\n\n[A White House aide picked a fight with Melania Trump. The first lady won.]\n\nPreviously, many people have viewed the guarded first lady as the \u201ckinder, gentler Trump,\u201d said Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University history professor. But a statement from her office declaring that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel \u201cno longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House\u201d could indicate that she\u2019s willing to trade her \u201csoft power\u201d for the kind of blunter-edged style that the rest of Team Trump routinely employs, she said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent things are working in the Trump White House, the preferred style is take-no-prisoners,\u201d Jellison added. \u201cIt certainly is how her husband has his way.\u201d\n\nAfter the statement from Melania Trump\u2019s office, Ricardel \u2014 who had tangled with several members of Trump\u2019s small and loyal East Wing staff over the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa last month \u2014 was out.\n\nTrump has typically offered advice to her husband in private, hardly ever stepping into the West Wing or publicly weighing in on news of the day, a dynamic that might invite West Wing staffers to overlook her as a force. And she has underscored the limits of the counsel she does give to her husband. \u201cI give him my honest advice and honest opinions,\u201d she said in an ABC interview last month. \u201cAnd then he does what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nBut Anita McBride, who was chief of staff to Laura Bush, said the episode with Ricardel cemented the first lady\u2019s privilege of having the last word with her husband. \u201cIf staff had not caught on that he is going to support his wife at the end of the day over them, here is a lesson,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile it was highly unusual for a first lady to so publicly oust a White House aide, the firing wasn\u2019t her first. The Trumps last year pushed out chief usher Angella Reid, who was hired on the White House residence staff by the Obamas, and replaced her with Timothy Harleth, a senior manager at Washington\u2019s Trump International Hotel. And this summer, the first lady\u2019s policy director, Reagan Hedlund, was asked to leave her job, according to a person with knowledge of the move.\n\n\n\nChief of Staff John F. Kelly\u2019s position has been tenuous for months and has reportedly been undermined further by Melania Trump\u2019s anger that Kelly refused to promote some of her aides. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTrump\u2019s headline-grabbing moves also came just as her predecessor, Michelle Obama, embarked on a media tour to promote her memoir, \u201cBecoming.\u201d The former first lady has been a near-constant presence in the media this week, appearing alongside Oprah Winfrey in Chicago on Tuesday night for a stop on her book tour, with Jenna Bush Hagar on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d Wednesday, and on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d on Thursday.\n\nLater this week, Obama is slated to drop by \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d and appear at another sold-out book tour stop at the Capital One Arena in Washington.\n\nAnother media appearance, an interview with Robin Roberts that aired earlier this week, drew the current first lady into headlines about her predecessor. Roberts asked Obama whether Trump had ever reached out to her for help \u2014 as Obama had to Laura Bush\u2019s team. Trump, Obama said, had never called.\n\nThat revelation prompted Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham to release a statement: \u201cMrs. Trump is a strong and independent woman who has been navigating her role as First Lady in her own way,\u201d Grisham told reporters. \u201cWhen she needs advice on any issue, she seeks it from her professional team within the White House.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the week did seem to be about Melania Trump asserting her independence, said Jellison, who added that first ladies often feel permanently resigned to the passenger seat in their husband\u2019s administrations.\n\n\u201cIf a first lady typically has a sense of powerlessness, ramp that up a few notches and that\u2019s Melania Trump\u2019s world,\u201d Jellison said. \u201cThis could be her moment to say, \u2018I\u2019m putting my foot down, and I\u2019m going to try to control this corner of my world.\u2019 \u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "US cutting counterterror forces in Africa", "description": "The Pentagon says it is reducing its counterterrorism forces in Africa and is studying whether to make similar moves elsewhere in the world", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cutting-counterterror-forces-in-africa/2018/11/15/e833d7ce-e91e-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:39:19Z", "content": "WASHINGTON The Pentagon says it is reducing its counterterrorism forces in Africa and is studying whether to make similar moves elsewhere in the world.

It said the reductions will not touch military operations in Libya, Somalia or Djibouti. They will be focused on countries in West Africa; the Pentagon did not cite any specific countries as examples, but the U.S. has relatively small military groups operating in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and elsewhere.\n\nIn Africa, as in other parts of the world where extremist groups pose threats, the U.S. military\u2019s approach has been to provide training and other forms of support for local armies so that they can do the main fighting against extremists. Even so, U.S. forces have suffered casualties in Africa, including in Niger in October 2017 when four U.S. soldiers and four of their Nigerien partners were killed in an ambush that sparked a fierce firefight with more than 100 insurgents.\n\nAfrica Command is the first U.S. regional military command to begin implementing reductions in counterterrorism forces, but others in Europe, the Pacific and elsewhere will be weighing the possibility of cuts. This is in line with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s desire to focus more on potential conflict with Russia and China, and less on the insurgent wars of the past 17 years. This was spelled out in a revised national defense strategy published in January.\n\nThe defense strategy is based on the Trump administration\u2019s belief that the central challenge to U.S. security and prosperity is what it calls the re-emergence of strategic competition with China and Russia. While threats from extremist groups like the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are deemed significant, they are no longer the main U.S. defense focus.\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly clear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model \u2014 gaining veto authority over other nations\u2019 economic, diplomatic, and security decisions,\u201d the defense strategy said.\n\nThe strategy document described China as a strategic competitor using \u201cpredatory economics\u201d to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing areas in the South China Sea. It asserted that Russia has violated the borders of nearby nations, including Ukraine, and \u201cpursues veto power\u201d over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbors.\n\nThis has convinced Mattis that the U.S. must accelerate its efforts to maintain a dominant position in space while doing more to prepare combat troops for war on a far larger scale than they have faced in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also is at the core of the Pentagon\u2019s rationale for investing hundreds of billions of dollars to modernize the nuclear weapons arsenal.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A final vote is set for Friday, and anything can change but is not likely to.\n\nThe changes in standards, which take effect for the next school year, exploded into public view in September when board members took a preliminary vote to remove several historical figures, including Clinton, the first female presidential nominee from a major U.S. party as well as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady.\n\nThe board aimed to streamline the standards \u2014 though as is common in Texas, the debate became political, with educators and historians complaining that political views influenced some decisions. A letter just sent to the board and signed by nearly 200 scholars from colleges and universities across the country called on the panel to correct historical distortions and align the standards with \u201csettled historical knowledge.\u201d\n\nAmong the actions the board took, spurning the recommendations of scholars and historians:\n\nRejected amendments to remove the myth that defending \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d was a cause of the Civil War and failed to correct the false portrayal that opposition to civil rights progress came exclusively from Southern Democrats. The letter from the scholars says the standards effectively resurrect the \u201cLost Cause\u201d myth, \u201ca long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies such as the disenfranchisement of African Americans and Jim Crow segregation.\"\n\nRejected an amendment to remove Moses from a list of political thinkers who were major influences on the American founding documents. The current standards says: \u201cIdentify the individuals whose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents, including those of Moses, William Blackstone, John Locke, and Charles de Montesquieu.\u201d\n\nRejected an amendment to correct a standard that suggests separation of church and state is not a key constitutional principle.\n\nRejected a recommendation to remove a reference to the \u201cheroism\u201d of the defenders of the Alamo, meaning, as a Board of Education release said: \u201cTexas schoolchildren will still learn of the heroic \u2018Victory or Death\u2019 letter penned by Lt. Col. William Barret Travis while besieged in the Alamo.\u201d\n\nClinton and Helen Keller stayed in the curriculum after at least one board member was besieged with phone calls about their removal. Some other historical figures are being removed, including Eleanor Roosevelt and Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater, who ran for president in 1964.\n\nControversies about Texas standards are hardly new. Four years ago, scholarly reviews of 43 proposed history, geography and government textbooks found numerous inaccuracies, biases and exaggeration such as:\n\nThe idea that Moses and Solomon inspired U.S. democracy.\n\nThat in the era of segregation only \u201csometimes\u201d were schools for black children \u201clower in quality.\u201d\n\nThat Jews view Jesus Christ as an important prophet.\n\nIn 2010, controversy erupted over a bid by conservatives on the Board of Education to label the grotesque U.S. slave trade by the innocuous term the \u201cAtlantic triangular trade.\u201d\n\nCarisa Lopez, political director of the nonprofit Texas Freedom Network (which describes itself as the \u201cstate\u2019s watchdog for monitoring far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders\u201d), reacted to the latest vote by the board:\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to writing curriculum standards for our kids\u2019 schools, it\u2019s painfully clear that the personal beliefs of politicians on the state board matter more than what countless historians and teachers have told them is factually true. Rather than teaching the truth, too many board members stubbornly mislead students on fundamental facts from our nation\u2019s history. Texas kids deserve a lot better than a politicized version of history that fuels so many of the divisions in our country today.\u201d\n\nAnd the conservative Fordham Institute has said about previous versions that \u201cTexas combines a rigidly thematic and theory-based social studies structure with a politicized distortion of history.

(Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTheresa May\u2019s premiership has been declared dead before. After her election losses last year, the British prime minister appeared to be on the brink of resigning.\n\nAs she left 10 Downing Street on Thursday morning, members of her own party again wondered: How long can she last? In the early morning hours, several of her cabinet ministers resigned over May\u2019s draft deal to leave the European Union, which was released Wednesday. May probably expected some resignations, but one was unexpected: Dominic Raab, her second Brexit minister.\n\nWith the official who negotiated May\u2019s Brexit deal writing that he \u201ccannot support the proposed deal,\u201d the government was suddenly thrown into jeopardy. In an evening news conference, May vowed to fight for her deal and rejected any suggestions that she might be on the way out of office.\n\nBut May is under attack from both sides of the political spectrum. Staunch pro-Brexiteers argue the deal does not go far enough and would keep Britain under the sway of the E.U. while taking away all powers to shape that bloc. Pro-European members of Parliament (MPs), meanwhile, think that Britain should stay more closely aligned with E.U. laws and within the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nWhen May told Parliament on Thursday that \u201cwe will leave the E.U. in a smooth and orderly way,\u201d her remarks were met with laughter by lawmakers.\n\nSo, what could be next? Here are some of the likely scenarios.\n\nTwo key choices ahead\n\n1) MPs vote in favor of May\u2019s deal\n\nEven though May\u2019s deal pleases neither pro-European nor pro-Brexit MPs, the prime minister may still have leverage to push through her deal or a modified version of it. The most powerful argument in her favor would be that the problem might not be her, but Brexit itself.\n\nWhile her deal is imperfect on many levels, it would still help Britain avoid a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit that could cost jobs and trigger a recession. At the same time, there has been cross-party agreement to respect the results of the 2016 referendum to leave the E.U. Many MPs who want to uphold that promise but are scared of a no-deal Brexit will back May.\n\nStill, the prime minister is not believed to have the necessary votes for that to happen, and with every minister resignation, chances are getting slimmer.\n\n2) MPs vote against May\u2019s deal or dump her\n\nShe can\u2019t bank on much support from the opposition. The Scottish National Party is disgruntled that it was left out of the negotiations, and the Liberal Democrats will vote against the deal out of principle. Most Labour Party members are expected to also reject the agreement, partially because a May defeat increases the likelihood of a future Labour prime minister.\n\nWorse even, May is facing a rebellion among her own allies. Pro-Brexiteers will vote against her deal, and the party that has kept her in power since last year \u2014 the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) \u2014 might join them. The DUP leadership fears May\u2019s deal could create a de facto border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That\u2019s a red line for a party committed to keeping Northern Ireland fully within the U.K.\n\nLabour cannot topple May by itself, but the prime minister\u2019s own allies may help with that. Moreover, if the DUP were to withdraw from its agreement to keep the Conservative Party \u2014 led by May or any successor \u2014 in power, then new general elections would be almost inevitable. Without the DUP, the Tories lack a majority in Parliament.\n\nWhat it means for Brexit\n\nA no-deal Brexit is unpopular but may be inevitable\n\nIf May\u2019s deal is rejected, chances of a no-deal Brexit rise. While leading pro-Brexiteers have said that they would prefer this scenario over a bad deal, a no-deal Brexit would probably not be a deliberate choice but instead an accidental outcome of a government unable to obtain a majority for any better solution.\n\n\n\nMost people in London voted against exiting the European Union. (Bryn Colton/Bloomberg News)\n\nMost stakeholders know very well that a no-deal Brexit could have catastrophic repercussions on the British economy. As an island, Britain is dependent on its trade with the E.U., and a no-deal Brexit would disrupt all those ties overnight. The government may have to ship in goods to keep supermarkets stocked, and nobody knows for sure what the effect of a no-deal Brexit would be on the millions of Europeans working in Britain.\n\nNothing really changes\n\nGiven the risks of a no-deal Brexit, Parliament could theoretically reject May\u2019s deal until Christmas and still approve a similar document next year.\n\nBut even then, it would be unclear what sort of relationship Britain would have with the E.U. in the long term. What would Britain\u2019s immigration policy look like, especially as think tanks predict that the country will face a severe labor shortage going forward? Could it stay in the customs union permanently to prevent a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country?\n\nTheoretically, Britain could extend the agreed transition period \u2014 in which Britain would continue to abide by E.U. rules without having a say on shaping them \u2014 year after year, arguing that Britain isn\u2019t ready to fully withdraw, yet. But in that case, Britain would be outside the E.U. only on paper.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Thursday that he cannot accept having to choose between no deal and May\u2019s deal.\n\nGoing back to Brussels\n\nThe question is what other choices there are. Corbyn has implied that going back to Brussels to get a better agreement could be one way out of the dilemma. But the E.U. has proved over the past year that it is bound by its own treaties and has little interest in adapting its rules to British demands.\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the British opposition Labour Party. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why that would change under Corbyn, unless he agreed to stick to staying in the single market and the customs union. This would mean Britain would essentially still be subject to E.U. laws, which has been rejected many times by all parties. Such a solution would probably be possible only in the unlikely scenario that Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party campaigned on that promise in general elections and won an overwhelming mandate for it \u2014 or supported a second referendum.\n\nA second referendum\n\nSupporters of a new vote on Britain\u2019s E.U. membership argue that a second referendum is not only an option but also a must, given that the promises on which pro-Brexit politicians campaigned have largely proved to be misleading. Critics maintain that posing the same question again because MPs didn\u2019t like the British people\u2019s response would ruin trust in British democracy.\n\nAmid all the confusion, there\u2019s one certainty, though: Britain has only four more months left to figure it all out. It\u2019s set to either leave or crash out of the E.U. by March 29.\n\nRead more:\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit secretary resigns over Theresa May\u2019s plan to exit European Union"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Nurse's kidney donation triggers bi-state transplant chain - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Nurse's kidney donation triggers bi-state transplant chain Washington Post KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 A nurse's decision to donate a kidney to a patient triggered a series of events that led to three people getting new organs at two Kansas City-area h\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nurses-kidney-donation-triggers-bi-state-transplant-chain/2018/11/15/6306ce82-e91c-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:24:06Z", "content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.

(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf you ask Republicans, which the Pew Research Center did, they\u2019ll say that President Trump\u2019s support and his steady stream of rallies before Election Day were mostly helpful to Republican candidates. Interestingly, younger Republicans were less likely to pronounce Trump\u2019s advocacy as beneficial, with more than half saying that either Trump\u2019s support was a wash or that he mostly hurt Republicans on the stump. Overall, though, 60 percent of Republicans say that, yes, Trump helped candidates of his party get across the finish line.\n\nThis, of course, is Trump\u2019s argument. As the midterms approached, he talked about his strong track record of supporting candidates over the course of the year, intentionally conflating Republican primary contests \u2014 where his popularity was an asset \u2014 with Democrat-vs.-Republican contests, where results were much more mixed. Our first look at Trump\u2019s tweeted endorsements showed that his candidate won about half the time, meaning that an endorsement from Trump was about the same as an endorsement from George Washington (in coin form, once flipped).\n\nThis discrepancy between Trump\u2019s effect on Republicans (good) and on everyone else (less good, as a survey in Colorado showed) is probably why Republicans thought he was a benefit to Republican candidates. To bolster the case that Trump wasn\u2019t a drag on his party, counselor Kellyanne Conway \u2014 whose job seems heavily to entail giving cable-news interviews \u2014 appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d the day after the election to argue that Trump was an asset.\n\n\u201cEven though [the Democrats] have won a few seats here and there,\u201d she said, \u201cthis president has made history yet again last night. In the last 80 years, the party in power has only picked up eight Senate seats, and last night, the president \u2014 through his leadership and his engagement on the ground for these candidates again and again \u2014 has produced three new Senate seats.\u201d She later amended, \u201cThree, possibly five as the count still goes on.\u201d\n\nThose \u201cfew seats\u201d the Democrats won now total 35, with three more wins possible. The three new Senate seats is one seat, with the race in Florida too close to call and a runoff in Mississippi scheduled in a few weeks' time.\n\n\u201cThat last day alone,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe three people he went and campaigned for\u201d \u2014 in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri \u2014 \u201chuge pickups, particularly in those two Senate seats [in Indiana and Missouri], those flipped from Democrat to Republican, on the strength of the president showing up to packed houses, historic rallies and overflow crowds.\u201d\n\nThis is the question: Did Trump make the difference? Did he boost turnout among his base, powering those wins?\n\nAt first glance, we have to note that Republicans should win Senate races in those three states. In the 2016 presidential election, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri backed Trump for president by 8, 19 and 19 points, respectively. In Ohio, Conway noted that Trump campaigned for Mike DeWine (R), now governor-elect. But he also campaigned for James B. Renacci (R), who was challenging Sen. Sherrod Brown (D). Renacci lost, despite that advantage Ohio showed Republicans two years ago.\n\nThat Trump closed out the election in red states probably wasn\u2019t a coincidence. The House was obviously out of reach, so Trump hit the trail mostly to stump for statewide candidates in states that he himself had won.\n\nWe decided to evaluate turnout and vote margin in states and House districts where Trump rallied in October and November to try to answer the question about how much of an effect he had.\n\nIn the House districts where he held rallies \u2014 usually not on behalf of the House candidates \u2014 the vote relative to the 2016 election was more heavily Democratic in 20 of 25 districts. If we consider a national shift of about three points to the Democrats (the 2016 national margin, compared with the national House vote as of Nov. 15, which favors the Democrats by about five points), 17 of 25 House districts where Trump rallied moved more to the Democrats than the country did overall.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nMany of the candidates in those districts won, anyway \u2014 a mark of how heavily Republican most of the places Trump rallied are. On average, the Cook Political Report Partisan Voter Index score for these seats was R+6, leaning Republican. Take out the House district in Cleveland where Trump rallied on the eve of the election (and which then voted Democratic), and it climbs over seven points.\n\nComparing House vote totals in 2016 with totals this year, most of those races saw drops in voter turnout, though the national drop (clumsily comparing national House vote totals to the 2016 vote total) was larger.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe big exception to that rule was Arizona\u2019s 9th District, where Democrats held the seat. Turnout likely surged in part because it was the home district of Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D), who narrowly won election to the Senate in a state that backed Trump by four points two years ago.\n\nBut, remember: Trump was clearly picking rally locations based on statewide races. So how\u2019d that go?\n\nThe results in Florida and Nevada moved further to the left from 2016, but not as much as the country on the whole (again looking at the national House vote in 2018). In Illinois, the incumbent Republican candidate for governor did worse than Trump had, but neither did very well.\n\n(Two notes on the chart below. First, the results are for the biggest statewide contest, favoring Senate over gubernatorial races. Second, there were no statewide races in North Carolina or Kentucky, so we used statewide House vote totals.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut notice how much more blue is on this chart! Trump visited only two states he didn\u2019t win in 2016: Nevada and Illinois. Democrats picked up a Senate seat and a governor\u2019s mansion in those states, respectively. They also got that Arizona Senate seat won by Sinema. Conway focused on the two Senate victories, but Democrats have taken as many seats in states Trump visited as Republicans did. (If and when Florida is called for Gov. Rick Scott (R), that will change.)\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting point when we consider how vote totals in 2018, compared with 2016. The state where the total number of votes in the Senate race was closest to the votes cast in 2016 was Montana.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut you\u2019ll notice that Montana also moved heavily to the Democrats, relative to 2016. Incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D) narrowly won reelection. If we plot all of the statewide results as a function of change in turnout and change in partisan margin, Montana is at the top \u2014 and well to the left of the no-change line on partisanship.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTurnout was high \u2014 and the Republicans did worse than in 2016. What\u2019s more, Trump visited the state twice, including on the weekend before the election.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has a theory: There, Trump spurred an increase in non-Republican turnout, perhaps making the difference for Tester.\n\nNot the story the White House is telling."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "In El Salvador, where abortion is illegal, a rape survivor who gave birth faces trial for attempted abortion", "description": "Imelda Cortez faces up to 20 years in prison if she is convicted.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/15/el-salvador-where-abortion-is-illegal-rape-survivor-faces-trial-attempted-abortion-after-giving-birth/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a4bCoa5wJ6ayOdbAGZAr_dVJEAQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ESUSLAXGZUI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:20:46Z", "content": "Imelda Cortez woke up one morning nearly two years ago with a horrible pain in her stomach.

She rushed to a nearby latrine, where she gave birth to a baby girl, and then passed out. She had become pregnant at 17, after her stepfather repeatedly raped her. When her mother took her to a hospital to seek attention for bleeding, doctors suspected she had tried to have an abortion, which is illegal under any circumstances in her home country of El Salvador.\n\nNow, Cortez, who says she never tried to terminate her pregnancy, is in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. That trial was scheduled to begin Nov. 12, but a Salvadoran judge postponed it to Dec. 17 after one of the prosecutors failed to show up, citing health reasons. Critics say the court purposely pushed the date closer to the Christmas holiday in hopes it would receive less international attention.\n\nIf convicted, Cortez could face up to 20 years behind bars.\n\nEl Salvador is one of the most strictly antiabortion countries in the world. In 1998, the country passed an absolute ban on abortion, making the procedure illegal even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. Since the law\u2019s passage, more than 40 women have been convicted on abortion-related charges, and more than 20 of those women remain in prison.\n\nPaula Avila-Guillen, director of Latin American initiatives at the Women\u2019s Equality Center, a group involved in Cortez\u2019s case, said the law makes doctors suspicious whenever women seek medical attention for any form of obstetric emergency such as a miscarriage or a stillbirth. \u201cDoctors feel the pressure to denounce anybody seeking medical attention who could be under suspicion of having an abortion,\u201d Avila-Guillen told The Washington Post.\n\nThis year, it seemed, El Salvador was shifting toward softening its stance on abortion. At least two women serving abortion-related sentences were released from prison, and others have had their sentences shortened. But the postponement of Cortez\u2019s case \u2014 the only new case this year \u2014 has left advocates discouraged.\n\n\u201cIt takes practically the mobilization of the entire world to save one of these women at a time,\u201d Avila-Guillen said. \u201cThe system keeps failing her over and over.\u201d\n\nCortez waits in prison for her next court date as her daughter, now nearly 2, stays with Cortez\u2019s mother.\n\nRead more:\n\nWomen serving decades-long prison terms for abortion in El Salvador hope change is coming\n\nHow a change in U.S. abortion policy reverberated around the globe\n\nThis is why Argentina did not legalize abortion this week"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "Trump\u2019s late-election rallies weren\u2019t the boon the White House insists they were", "description": "As with his endorsements, results were very mixed.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-late-election-rallies-werent-the-boon-the-white-house-insists-they-were/2018/11/15/f2e05899-fdb8-4522-a26d-d08888fc0b9a_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:18:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nPresident Trump speaks at a Make America Great Again rally in Cleveland on Nov. 5.

In Illinois, the incumbent Republican candidate for governor did worse than Trump had, but neither did very well.\n\n(Two notes on the chart below. First, the results are for the biggest statewide contest, favoring Senate over gubernatorial races. Second, there were no statewide races in North Carolina or Kentucky, so we used statewide House vote totals.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut notice how much more blue is on this chart! Trump visited only two states he didn\u2019t win in 2016: Nevada and Illinois. Democrats picked up a Senate seat and a governor\u2019s mansion in those states, respectively. They also got that Arizona Senate seat won by Sinema. Conway focused on the two Senate victories, but Democrats have taken as many seats in states Trump visited as Republicans did. (If and when Florida is called for Gov. Rick Scott (R), that will change.)\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting point when we consider how vote totals in 2018, compared with 2016. The state where the total number of votes in the Senate race was closest to the votes cast in 2016 was Montana.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut you\u2019ll notice that Montana also moved heavily to the Democrats, relative to 2016. Incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D) narrowly won reelection. If we plot all of the statewide results as a function of change in turnout and change in partisan margin, Montana is at the top \u2014 and well to the left of the no-change line on partisanship.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nTurnout was high \u2014 and the Republicans did worse than in 2016. What\u2019s more, Trump visited the state twice, including on the weekend before the election.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has a theory: There, Trump spurred an increase in non-Republican turnout, perhaps making the difference for Tester.\n\nNot the story the White House is telling."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mradamtaylor", "title": "Can Brexit be stopped?

(Peter Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nConfused about Brexit? You\u2019re not alone! Britain\u2019s path to leaving the European Union has gotten rather complicated and long, full of forks in the road, double-backs and more than a few dead ends. Even seasoned Brexit-watchers have been left at a loss for words.\n\nBut have no fear. Below, we\u2019ve answered some of the most pressing questions about Brexit.\n\nQ: What is Brexit?\n\nA: British Prime Minister Theresa May has said \u201cBrexit means Brexit.\u201d But what that actually means is that Britain is going to leave the European Union. This would mean giving up the automatic free movement and free trade rights that come with E.U. membership.\n\nQ: Why is Britain leaving the E. U.?\n\nA: That\u2019s a big debate. But basically, it\u2019s because Britain voted in a referendum on June 23, 2016. Those voters who wanted out of the E.U. and to \u201ctake back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s laws and borders won 52-48.\n\nQ: So Britain is definitely leaving the E. U.?\n\nA: Probably.\n\nQ: Probably!?\n\nA: Well, first Britain and the E.U. need to agree on terms for how it will leave. Then Britain\u2019s parliament will need to agree, too. Also, some Brits want a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote.\"\n\nQ: That sounds like a lot. How long do they have to sort it out?\n\nA: Technically the ultimate deadline is March 29, unless there is an extension agreed upon.\n\n\n\nAnti-Brexit supporter Steve Bray of Wales protests outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Thursday. (Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nQ: Oh. So how\u2019s that all going?\n\nA: Well, it\u2019s taken a while. But May won approval for her withdrawal agreement from her divided cabinet on Nov. 14.\n\nQ: Wait, this is a withdrawal agreement? Is that different from a trade deal?\n\nA: Yes. The withdrawal agreement outlines how Britain will leave the E.U. \u2014 things like a timetable for a transition period, what happens to E.U. nationals living in Britain and the amount of money that Britain has to pay the E.U. A trade deal would establish an independent Britain\u2019s future economic relationship with the E.U.\n\nQ: Okay, but this withdrawal agreement has the full support of Britain?\n\nA: Not by a long way. In fact, there are plenty of people within May\u2019s own ruling Conservative Party who want to remain in the E.U. \u2014 and many hardcore Brexiteers who don\u2019t support her plan for the opposite reason.\n\nQ: Huh? I thought they wanted Brexit.\n\nA: They do, but they feel like May has made too many concessions to Europe with this deal.\n\nQ: What sort of Brexit did they want?\n\nA: Many Brexiteers want an agreement that keeps the economic benefits of the E.U. but ends free movement, takes away Brussels' control over Britain\u2019s trade laws and avoids a hard Irish border (more on all this later).\n\nQ: Who are they, by the way?\n\nA: The most notable ones are Boris Johnson, May\u2019s former foreign secretary, and Jacob Rees Mogg, another member of the Conservatives. But there are many others.\n\nQ: What is the worst-case scenario for Brexit?\n\nA: Probably the \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario of a no-deal Brexit, whereby Britain has to revert to World Trade Organization trade rules at its borders because it can\u2019t reach an agreement with Europe.\n\nQ: Why would that be so bad?\n\nA: It would likely cause major changes to British trade, resulting in serious disruption to almost every aspect of Britain\u2019s business. An International Monetary Fund projection this week warned that up to eight percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product could be lost.\n\n\n\nA British Union flag is held aloft bearing slogans during the People's Vote March, in London last month. (Yui Mok/AP)\n\nQ: Yikes. Are people prepared for that?\n\nA: Cadbury\u2019s started stockpiling the ingredients for chocolate. So maybe that part of British life will be okay.\n\nQ: How likely is this?\n\nA: It\u2019s definitely possible. One study that came out before May made her deal estimated there were five possible scenarios for Brexit. All but one resulted in no deal.\n\nQ: So is this likelihood lesser now?\n\nA: Hardly. There has been a string of resignations from May\u2019s government, casting doubt upon her ability to get her withdrawal agreement through parliament.\n\nQ: Does the E.U. want a no-deal for Britain?\n\nA: European leaders have voiced real concerns about a no-deal Brexit \u2014 it could potentially disrupt their own agreements, too, remember. But the E.U. is also worried about other countries trying to leave, so it is driving a hard bargain with Britain and offering few concessions.\n\nQ: Does Britain\u2019s opposition party oppose Brexit?\n\nA: Labour is split on Brexit generally but is likely to oppose May\u2019s deal for political reasons. However, it is unlikely to stop Brexit anytime soon: Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said recently that Brexit could not be stopped.\n\nQ: Does anyone want to stop Brexit?\n\nA: Yes. Lots of politicians in both the Labour and Conservative parties do want to stop it, while smaller parties, such as the Liberal Democrats, actively campaign against it.\n\n\n\nSinn Fein activists wearing face masks depicting British MP Boris Johnson and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May took part in a rally against Brexit and any hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland in Belfast last month. (Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nQ: Could Brexit be stopped?\n\nA: Theoretically, yes \u2014 a point May herself recently alluded to for the first time after reaching her draft agreement. But it would be a risky move politically.\n\nQ: Couldn\u2019t they just have a second referendum?\n\nA: The idea of a second referendum (a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d) on the final terms has considerable support among the public, but politicians are hesitant, as it could unleash further political chaos.\n\nQ: How would Britain vote if that happened?\n\nA: Hard to say, but many polls do suggest that British voters have grown more opposed to Brexit over the past two years.\n\nQ: Okay, let\u2019s back up. What is E.U. freedom of movement, and why didn\u2019t Brexiteers like it?\n\nA: Citizens of the European Union are entitled to move around the nation states. For many in the pro-Brexit camp, immigration was a major issue with the rest of Europe.\n\nQ: And what is the Customs Union? And the Single Market?\n\nA: The E.U. Customs Union means it negotiates trade laws as a bloc, and the Single Market means that Europe has no trade barriers within it. Pro-Brexit voices hope that by leaving Europe, Britain can negotiate its own, better trade deals.\n\nQ: What is the big issue with the Irish border?\n\nA: If Britain were to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market, there could be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, where border checks are now minimal.\n\nQ: Why is that a problem?\n\nA: It could jeopardize the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and, with it, the Northern Ireland peace process. It also would likely have a significant impact on trade. Plus, May needs to get her political partner in Northern Ireland (the Democratic Unionist Party) and the Irish government on her side.\n\nQ: So does May\u2019s deal solve all this?\n\nA: Kind of. But also, not really.\n\n\n\nStickers are pasted on the Cabinet Office door after an anti-Brexit march through central London last month. (Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nQ: How so?\n\nA: In the Brexit withdrawal agreement\u2019s 585 pages, the most notable outcome was the creation of a transition period, which would essentially keep Britain in the bloc\u2019s Customs Union until 2020, and possibly past then.\n\nQ: And that solves the Irish border problem?\n\nA: No, but it appears to provide a backstop for sorting it out in the future.\n\nQ: And freedom of movement?\n\nA: E.U. nationals living in Britain and Brits living in E.U. states will retain their rights, but they will have to formally apply for status to remain in the country.\n\nQ: This doesn\u2019t sound like it would please everyone.\n\nA: It doesn\u2019t. As we noted before, both pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit camps have voiced opposition.\n\nQ: What happens next?\n\nA: The plan needs to go to Brussels, where European leaders will debate and vote on Nov. 25. That\u2019s if May can keep her job, however.\n\nQ: Wait, May could lose her job?\n\nA: Yes. She may be forced from office with a no-confidence vote, or she might even resign. It\u2019s unclear who would replace her, though, or whether they\u2019d do a better job.\n\nQ: What would happen then?\n\nA: \u203e\\_(\u30c4)_/\u203e\n\nQ: I have more questions that were not answered here.\n\nA: We all do. Send them to us, and we\u2019ll try to answer them in an update.\n\nWilliam Booth and Karla Adam contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "title": "Saudi Arabia's latest account of Khashoggi's death is shocking in its audacity - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Saudi Arabia's latest account of Khashoggi's death is shocking in its audacity Washington Post THE NEW account of Jamal Khashoggi's death offered by Saudi Arabia on Thursday was shocking in its audacity.

Having previously acknowledged that the journalist was the victim of premeditated murder, authorities in Riyadh reverted to an earlier, discredited tale: that Mr. Khashoggi was killed spontaneously inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by a team sent to return him to Saudi Arabia. While reporting that 11 suspects had been indicted and that the death penalty would be sought for five of them, a Riyadh public prosecutor excused not just Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 the chief suspect in the murder \u2014 but also two of his top aides, who the prosecutor said ordered or advised the capture operation but did not approve Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nBy offering up this incredible account, the Saudi regime is baldly defying all those, including leading members of Congress, who called for full disclosure and accountability. Yet the Trump administration appears ready to accept its stonewalling. On Thursday, it announced sanctions against 17 people implicated by the Saudis \u2014 leaving untouched both the crown prince and top intelligence officials in Riyadh.\n\nAccepting the Saudi story means ignoring a number of well-established facts. An audio recording of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s last moments, which Turkish officials shared with CIA Director Gina Haspel, indicates he was attacked and strangled immediately after entering the consulate. The Saudi version claims he died only after a quarrel and a struggle that prompted the head of the \u201cnegotiation team\u201d to decide to murder him by injecting him with drugs.\n\nThe Saudi account says the operation was ordered by the then-deputy chief of intelligence, Ahmed al-Assiri, and advised by Saud al-Qahtani, a court propagandist. Both are close to Mohammed bin Salman. The two aides, so Riyadh\u2019s story goes, were not complicit in the decision to kill Mr. Khashoggi and were fooled by their team\u2019s claim that the journalist had left the consulate alive. That doesn\u2019t explain a portion of the audio recording reported by the New York Times, in which Maher Mutreb, a close associate of the crown prince, instructs an official by phone to \u201ctell your boss\u201d that the mission was accomplished. As the Times reported, U.S. intelligence officials believe the \u201cboss\u201d is \u201calmost certainly Prince Mohammed.\u201d\n\nOther contradictions and improbabilities abound. It\u2019s known that a forensic expert who specializes in autopsies was on the Saudi team; the Turks said he arrived with a bone saw for dismembering Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s body. Yet the Saudis would have the world believe that the specialist was recruited only to clean up any evidence of an abduction, and that officials in Riyadh didn\u2019t know about him.\n\nThis all-too-transparent tissue of lies only underlines the need for a genuinely independent international investigation led by the United Nations, as Turkey\u2019s foreign minister called for this week. Instead, the Trump administration is abetting the Saudi coverup; the new sanctions do not even cover Mr. Assiri, the official who Riyadh says ordered the Khashoggi mission.\n\nCongress should not allow this travesty to continue. It should suspend all military sales and cooperation with Saudi Arabia until a credible international investigation of the Khashoggi killing is completed. The Saudi cover story is just one more instance of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s arrogant and reckless behavior. The true murderers of Jamal Khashoggi must be named and punished."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Scott Allen", "title": "The one writer who voted Max Scherzer ahead of Jacob deGrom for Cy Young explains his ballot", "description": "\u201cWhat it came down to in my mind was wins and losses,\" the San Diego Union-Tribune's John Maffei said.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/15/one-writer-who-voted-max-scherzer-ahead-jacob-degrom-cy-young-explains-his-ballot/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BRQ8kszLObtVbxJRYFLkDmwweRQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53NJNNFPX4I6RC2TKAIWO2HETE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:04:47Z", "content": "Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday and received 29 of 30 first-place votes in the process.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nNew York Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday and received 29 of 30 first-place votes in the process. The lone dissenter was San Diego Union-Tribune reporter John Maffei, who voted deGrom second behind two-time defending Cy Young winner Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals.\n\n\u201cI take this very seriously,\u201d Maffei, 70, said in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cI didn\u2019t line up at the last minute and throw a dart and it hit Max\u2019s name.\"\n\nMaffei, who primarily writes about high school sports these days, is one of the official scorers at San Diego\u2019s Petco Park and estimates that he attended about 70 Padres games this season. He said he watched each of Scherzer and deGrom\u2019s last five starts on the \u201cMLB Extra Innings\u201d package before casting his vote, which was swayed by a conversation he had in September with a former National League Cy Young winner with great hair.\n\n\u201cWhat it came down to in my mind was wins and losses,\u201d Maffei said. \u201cI had a really nice conversation with Randy Jones, the Padres' 1976 Cy Young Award winner and a man I greatly respect. Randy goes: \u2018Hey, wins over everything. It doesn\u2019t matter what run support you get; you have to pitch to what your team is giving you. If they give you one, you got to throw a shutout. If they give you two, you can give up one. If they give you three, you can give up two.\u2019 He said, \u2018That\u2019s taking nothing away from deGrom, but you need to pitch to what your team has given you.\u2019 That was what kind of broke the tie in my mind.\u201d\n\nScherzer was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and a 0.91 WHIP. DeGrom was 10-9 with a 1.70 ERA and a 0.91 WHIP. The Nationals averaged 5.27 runs in games that Scherzer started, while the Mets scored 3.53 runs in games started by deGrom, the second-worst run support in the majors.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t go wrong,\u201d Maffei said. \u201cThese were two great pitchers. DeGrom had a historic season in his right, with the 1.70 ERA and all the other things. But Scherzer had a historic season, too, with 300 strikeouts. That can\u2019t be overlooked. It wasn\u2019t the deciding factor, but it was a factor. He was a dominant pitcher. With Randy\u2019s talk being the tiebreaker, it was eight more wins and fewer losses, and a 2.53 ERA, which is pretty darned good.\u201d\n\nDeGrom made 24 consecutive quality starts, allowed three or fewer runs in 31 of his 32 starts, and one run or zero runs in 18 starts. He led all pitchers in the FanGraphs calculation of wins above replacement (8.8 to Scherzer\u2019s 7.2) and fielding-independent pitching (1.99 to Scherzer\u2019s 2.65), two of the advanced analytics that many writers value over wins when evaluating pitchers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely aware of the analytics,\u201d Maffei said. \u201cI do think that wins and losses are somewhat out of your control, but they\u2019re also somewhat in your control. You need to pitch out of situations. There are times when you absolutely need to get out of a situation, you need a strikeout, or you need a groundball. You end up spiking a curveball and it goes to the backstop and you give up a run. That\u2019s in your control. It\u2019s something you look at.\"\n\nMaffei was \u201cstunned\u201d that he was the only writer to cast a first-place vote for Scherzer.\n\n\u201cI thought deGrom would win, probably,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seemed to be the trend, but I thought certainly that Scherzer would get somewhere between five and seven first-place votes.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Maffei was among the few voters who didn\u2019t cast a first-place vote for Scherzer when he won the award in 2016 and 2017. Last year, Maffei was one of three writers who put Clayton Kershaw ahead of Scherzer, who finished with two fewer wins than the Los Angeles Dodgers' ace, on their ballots. In 2016, Maffei cast the only first-place vote for Chicago Cubs starter Jon Lester, despite the fact that Scherzer led the league in wins.\n\nMaffei has drawn the ire of Mets fans who, on top of rooting for a dreadful team, were denied the joy of being able to say deGrom was a unanimous Cy Young winner. On Wednesday night, Maffei agreed to go on WFAN sports radio in New York to explain his vote, but he ended the interview before it really began.\n\n\u201cJohn Maffei \u2014 not from Washington, where you would think homerism lives and thrives \u2014 John Maffei is with the San Diego Union-Tribune,\u201d WFAN\u2019s Steve Somers said by way of introduction. \u201cJohn, can you look at yourself in the mirror. \u2026 John?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I?\u201d Maffei said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No, no, no,\u201d Somers replied. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for 15 minutes of fame and attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteve, this interview is over,\u201d Maffei said. \u201cThank you, goodbye.\u201d\n\nMaffei hung up.\n\n\u201cIt was insult right from the start,\u201d Maffei said Thursday. \u201cIf you want a conversation and an explanation, I\u2019ll give it to you. If you want to throw out insults, then we\u2019re done. That\u2019s the way he attacked it, so suddenly I\u2019m a bad guy in New York because I insulted Steve Somers. His producer called back and apologized for his behavior.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maffei penned a column explaining his vote for Scherzer in the Union-Tribune.\n\n\u201cWould I vote for Scherzer again?\u201d he wrote. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nThe Nationals need starting pitching.

(Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHouse Democrats are proposing to make substantial changes to the chamber\u2019s rules as they prepare to take the majority, according to a list of changes endorsed by top party leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and presented to lawmakers Thursday.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed reforms would potentially slow down the process for bringing legislation to a floor vote, make it easier to call up a bill that has bipartisan support but is opposed by the majority party\u2019s leadership, and give committees a stronger role in drafting legislation.\n\nThe list of proposals obtained by The Washington Post is not considered to be final and could be substantially modified before the rules are adopted in January, but the changes floated Thursday have the backing of Pelosi and incoming Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). Taken together, the proposals seek to address Democrats' concerns about the way the outgoing Republican majority ran the chamber but also bipartisan complaints about more-persistent weaknesses in House operations.\n\nThey also come as Pelosi is stumping for support to be House speaker again, and among the proposals are changes that have been demanded by some members in return for their speaker votes.\n\nThe proposed rule changes require more time for the review of legislation before a floor vote, changing the standard from three days \u2014 which often means a little more than 24 hours \u2014 to a full 72 hours. They would require every bill sent to the floor by the Rules Committee to get a committee hearing and markup before getting a floor vote. They would create a supermajority requirement to raise individual income taxes on the lowest-earning four-fifths of taxpayers. And they would require each legislative committee to hold \u201cMember Days\u201d to solicit legislative ideas from lawmakers who don\u2019t serve on those committees.\n\nAnother proposal would reform the \u201cdischarge petition\u201d process to make it simpler to call up bipartisan bills for a vote. Under current rules, there are only certain legislative days where those bills \u2014 which have garnered majority support in Congress but have not been brought to the floor \u2014 can be considered. The proposed change would allow a discharged bill to be called up within three days, regardless of the calendar.\n\nDemocrats are also looking to pursue a \u201cmore thoughtful process\u201d surrounding the process for removing a sitting House speaker. That has emerged as a closely watched issue since 2015, when conservative hard-liners used the \u201cmotion to vacate the chair\u201d as a cudgel that ultimately forced out Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). Many rank-and-file lawmakers since then have pushed to eliminate the ability of any one member \u2014 or even a small group \u2014 to call a vote on ousting a speaker.\n\nThose proposals address some, but not all, of a series of rule changes supported by the Problem Solvers Caucus \u2014 a bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers that has threatened to withhold their speaker votes unless certain changes are made. In a letter to the group\u2019s members Thursday, Pelosi agreed in principle that the chamber\u2019s rules must be improved, without specifically committing to the entire range of their proposals.\n\n\u201cTransparency, openness and bipartisanship must be the guiding rules of our new Democratic House if we are to break the gridlock of Washington and make progress in the lives of hard-working Americans,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOther proposed changes would seek to increase transparency and accountability. The proposed rule would make clear that a nondisclosure agreement could not keep a staff member from speaking to the authorities on Capitol Hill. Another would require the Ethics Committee to open an investigation within 30 days if a member is charged with a crime. Another \u2014 banning members and staff from serving on corporate boards \u2014 has already garnered bipartisan support.\n\nA proposal from Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the incoming Budget Committee chairman, would serve to defuse potential legislative cliffhangers over the federal debt ceiling by reinstating the \u201cGephardt rule\u201d \u2014 a provision in place from 1980 to 2010 that deemed the debt ceiling raised when Congress adopted a budget.\n\nThree proposals explicitly backed by Pelosi would seek to \u201crestore inclusion and diversity,\u201d ranging from a rule making clear that religious headwear is permitted in the House chamber, to the establishment of a new diversity office to assist in minority hiring, to writing an explicit ban on gender-identity and LGBT discrimination into the House rules.\n\nThe proposals also include undoing several rule changes put forward by Republicans when they were in the majority, including eliminating the \u201cHolman rule,\u201d a provision allowing Congress to target individual employees' salaries in spending bills; renaming the Committee on Education and the Workforce to the \u201cCommittee on Education and Labor\u201d; and again allowing delegates and the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico to participate in some floor votes. Another proposed reversal would be to eliminate the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s use of \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d the practice of taking economic growth estimates into account when projecting the fiscal effect of legislation.\n\nAnd in a catchall proposal that could lead to further reforms, several Democrats are proposing a select committee to improve the operation of Congress, one that would include members of both parties empowered to make further recommendations."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Family: North Carolina hiker missing in Mexico killed", "description": "The family of an American hiker missing in northern Mexico says that the state government has informed it that he was killed by a criminal organization", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/family-north-carolina-hiker-missing-in-mexico-killed/2018/11/15/c1108a80-e913-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:20:15Z", "content": "MEXICO CITY The family of an American hiker missing in northern Mexico says that the state government has informed it that he was killed by a criminal organization.

After the incident, the woman said, she told the man, \u201cyou just raped me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the defendant said he replied. \u201cWe just has sex.\u201d\n\nHe painted a much different picture of the evening, saying that the pair had kissed and then gone outside to lie down in a muddy area nearby, at which point they had consensual sex. (No witnesses confirmed that the pair had kissed.)\n\nThe woman pressed charges, and the case went to trial. Both sides framed it as a question of consent.\n\n\u201cYou have heard her say she did not consent. You have heard him say she did consent,\u201d Tom Creed, a lawyer for the plaintiff, told the jury. \" If you are satisfied she did not consent and that he knew she did not consent, then you convict. She is quite clear she did not consent. She said she never had sexual intercourse before.\"\n\nBut the defendant\u2019s lawyer took a different approach, suggesting that the teenager was lying. As evidence, she pointed to how the plaintiff dressed.\n\nDuring the trial, defense attorney Elizabeth O\u2019Connell highlighted the fact that the 17-year-old was wearing thong underwear the night she alleged she was assaulted.\n\n\"Does the evidence out-rule the possibility that she was attracted to the defendant and was open to meeting someone and being with someone?

Trump has even said as much: \u201cI hope that the king and the crown prince didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d he said Oct. 17. Even as Trump has occasionally offered tough words, none of it pointed to the top, and most everything Trump has said has offered an alternative narrative that doesn\u2019t implicate Mohammed.\n\nThat wishful thinking now meets reality, but Trump appears primed to doubt his own intelligence community and/or fail to act upon its conclusions on an issue of huge international import.\n\nAgain.\n\nThe Washington Post reported late Friday that the CIA now has high confidence that Mohammed personally ordered the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist and former ally of the Saudi royal family who became a critic. This contradicts the official Saudi explanation, which is that Mohammed\u2019s deputies merely ordered the repatriation of Khashoggi and the team sent to Istanbul instead killed him.\n\nThe situation \u2014 and Trump\u2019s position in it \u2014 now carries eerie parallels to the Russia investigation. The U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia interfered in the U.S. election and favored Trump, but Trump has spent most of his presidency publicly casting doubt on this and resisting punitive measures. His administration has still punished Russia. But Trump, whose personal interest in doubting Russian interference is clear (he feels it undermines his 2016 election win), has frequently been a less-than-willing participant.\n\nAnd just like then, The Post is reporting Trump remains skeptical of the finding that the prince was responsible \u2014 despite the evidence:\n\nPresident Trump has resisted pinning the blame for the killing on Mohammed, who enjoys a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Privately, aides said, Trump has been shown evidence of the prince\u2019s involvement but remains skeptical that Mohammed ordered the killing. The president has also asked CIA and State Department officials where Khashoggi\u2019s body is and has grown frustrated that they have not been able to provide an answer. The CIA does not know the location of Khashoggi\u2019s remains, according to the people familiar with the agency\u2019s assessment.\n\nTrump said Saturday that he hadn\u2019t been briefed on the matter yet and that he would be speaking with the CIA. But aides say he\u2019s seen evidence implicating Mohammed and looked for ways to avoid pinning the blame on him.\n\nAs with Russia, Trump\u2019s motivation to disbelieve his intelligence community is apparent: The Saudis are an important strategic ally; his son-in-law Jared Kushner is close to Mohammed; and Trump has long-standing business ties with Saudis. And this week was full of signs that Trump\u2019s administration isn\u2019t prepared to hold Mohammed accountable \u2014 signs that are even starker now that we know what Trump has been told behind the scenes.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Thursday announced sanctions against 17 Saudis for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Among them is Mohammed\u2019s senior aide, Saud al-Qahtani. But while the statement implicates Qahtani in what happened to Khashoggi, it isn\u2019t clear on whether he is believed to have ordered or approved the killing. It uses somewhat vague language as to which of the 17 is accused of what, specifically:\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s release said the 17 men were being sanctioned \u201cfor having a role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d \u201cHaving a role in\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly indicate whether any of them individually plotted or carried out the killing.\n\nIn a quote, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added the men \u201cwere involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi\u201d \u2014 similar to the language above \u2014 and they \u201ctargeted and brutally killed\u201d him, although he didn\u2019t differentiate between who targeted him and who killed him.\n\nIt said Qahtani \u201cwas part of the planning and execution of the operation that led to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.\u201d The key words there are \u201cthat led to.\u201d That sentence also seemed to separate the person from the eventual outcome.\n\nAlmost all of this fits with the Saudi version of events. On Thursday, a Saudi prosecutor announced indictments of 11 unnamed people, five of whom could face the death penalty. The prosecutor also said Qahtani was involved but only in a plan to repatriate Khashoggi \u2014 that is, bring him from Istanbul to Saudi Arabia. The language above from the Treasury Department could be consistent with Qahtani planning a repatriation operation that eventually resulted in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, without his approval. If the effort doesn\u2019t necessarily reach up to someone so close to Mohammed, that means he remains insulated.\n\nNBC News reported Thursday that the Trump administration looked into the possibility of extraditing exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has been in Pennsylvania for two decades and is accused by the Turkish government of plotting a failed 2016 coup. The reasoning, per NBC, is the U.S. government wanted to \u201cplacate\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been accusing Saudi Arabia of a deliberate plot to kill Khashoggi, and \u201cpersuade Erdogan to ease pressure on the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nWhy would the administration feel the need to placate Erdogan over a killing allegedly committed by the Saudis? The logical conclusion is they wanted to cover for their allies in the Saudi government \u2014 a goal that would be consistent with all of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. But that also means the truth about what happened to Khashoggi \u2014 about which Turkey, it turns out, has been pretty accurate \u2014 would be taking a back seat.\n\nThe question now is just how much Trump cares about the truth that his intelligence community has determined."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Aaron Blake", "title": "The Trump administration is trying hard not to blame the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi\u2019s death", "description": "New U.S. sanctions stop short of implicating Mohammed bin Salman's senior aides in plans to kill Khashoggi.

This contradicts the official Saudi explanation, which is that Mohammed\u2019s deputies merely ordered the repatriation of Khashoggi and the team sent to Istanbul instead killed him.\n\nThe situation \u2014 and Trump\u2019s position in it \u2014 now carries eerie parallels to the Russia investigation. The U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia interfered in the U.S. election and favored Trump, but Trump has spent most of his presidency publicly casting doubt on this and resisting punitive measures. His administration has still punished Russia. But Trump, whose personal interest in doubting Russian interference is clear (he feels it undermines his 2016 election win), has frequently been a less-than-willing participant.\n\nAnd just like then, The Post is reporting Trump remains skeptical of the finding that the prince was responsible \u2014 despite the evidence:\n\nPresident Trump has resisted pinning the blame for the killing on Mohammed, who enjoys a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser. Privately, aides said, Trump has been shown evidence of the prince\u2019s involvement but remains skeptical that Mohammed ordered the killing. The president has also asked CIA and State Department officials where Khashoggi\u2019s body is and has grown frustrated that they have not been able to provide an answer. The CIA does not know the location of Khashoggi\u2019s remains, according to the people familiar with the agency\u2019s assessment.\n\nTrump said Saturday that he hadn\u2019t been briefed on the matter yet and that he would be speaking with the CIA. But aides say he\u2019s seen evidence implicating Mohammed and looked for ways to avoid pinning the blame on him.\n\nAs with Russia, Trump\u2019s motivation to disbelieve his intelligence community is apparent: The Saudis are an important strategic ally; his son-in-law Jared Kushner is close to Mohammed; and Trump has long-standing business ties with Saudis. And this week was full of signs that Trump\u2019s administration isn\u2019t prepared to hold Mohammed accountable \u2014 signs that are even starker now that we know what Trump has been told behind the scenes.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Thursday announced sanctions against 17 Saudis for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Among them is Mohammed\u2019s senior aide, Saud al-Qahtani. But while the statement implicates Qahtani in what happened to Khashoggi, it isn\u2019t clear on whether he is believed to have ordered or approved the killing. It uses somewhat vague language as to which of the 17 is accused of what, specifically:\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s release said the 17 men were being sanctioned \u201cfor having a role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d \u201cHaving a role in\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly indicate whether any of them individually plotted or carried out the killing.\n\nIn a quote, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added the men \u201cwere involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi\u201d \u2014 similar to the language above \u2014 and they \u201ctargeted and brutally killed\u201d him, although he didn\u2019t differentiate between who targeted him and who killed him.\n\nIt said Qahtani \u201cwas part of the planning and execution of the operation that led to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.\u201d The key words there are \u201cthat led to.\u201d That sentence also seemed to separate the person from the eventual outcome.\n\nAlmost all of this fits with the Saudi version of events. On Thursday, a Saudi prosecutor announced indictments of 11 unnamed people, five of whom could face the death penalty. The prosecutor also said Qahtani was involved but only in a plan to repatriate Khashoggi \u2014 that is, bring him from Istanbul to Saudi Arabia. The language above from the Treasury Department could be consistent with Qahtani planning a repatriation operation that eventually resulted in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, without his approval. If the effort doesn\u2019t necessarily reach up to someone so close to Mohammed, that means he remains insulated.\n\nNBC News reported Thursday that the Trump administration looked into the possibility of extraditing exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has been in Pennsylvania for two decades and is accused by the Turkish government of plotting a failed 2016 coup. The reasoning, per NBC, is the U.S. government wanted to \u201cplacate\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been accusing Saudi Arabia of a deliberate plot to kill Khashoggi, and \u201cpersuade Erdogan to ease pressure on the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nWhy would the administration feel the need to placate Erdogan over a killing allegedly committed by the Saudis? The logical conclusion is they wanted to cover for their allies in the Saudi government \u2014 a goal that would be consistent with all of Trump\u2019s rhetoric. But that also means the truth about what happened to Khashoggi \u2014 about which Turkey, it turns out, has been pretty accurate \u2014 would be taking a back seat.\n\nThe question now is just how much Trump cares about the truth that his intelligence community has determined."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jenny Starrs", "title": "Democrat prevails in Maine congressional race that used ranked-choice voting system", "description": "The Republican incumbent had narrowly led after the first round of results came in on Election Day.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrat-prevails-in-maine-congressional-race-that-used-ranked-choice-voting-system/2018/11/15/e8d81cae-e8ff-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QNKe1ivfwOqQZsCCZsVqy6B0rc0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3W4SLUXJBMI6ROG4M3GKICOBQA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:01:19Z", "content": "Democratic challenger Jared Golden prevailed Thursday in a Maine congressional contest, defeating a Republican incumbent in the first federal race in the country in which a ranked-choice voting system was used to determine the winner.

The system allows voters to cast ballots for their candidate but also rank other contenders in order of preference.

As President Ashraf Ghani, who is seeking a second term, and an array of potential rivals try to form winning coalitions, observers fear the race could divide the country along dangerous ethnic lines.\n\nAt the same time, momentum for talks with the Taliban is steadily building, with a special U.S. peace envoy pushing the process hard and insurgent leaders showing serious interest in negotiating for the first time. But they have insisted that they will not deal directly with the Ghani government, instead reportedly meeting U.S. officials in Qatar and then attending a recent pro-peace conference in Moscow.\n\nAs both developments accelerate, some Afghan and Western voices have begun questioning whether the peace process may need to come first, rather than competing on a parallel track that could enmesh the election run-up in battles over the cost of peace and sabotage the first steps toward reconciliation.\n\n\u201cThe constitution is not as important as peace. If peace can be restored, then the elections will have to be delayed for it,\u201d Wadir Safi, a professor of political science at Kabul University, told the Weesa Daily newspaper here.\n\nOn the other hand, other Afghans are concerned that the Trump administration, in its haste to speed up talks and end the long and costly war, could push for concessions that might weaken or undo the Democratic gains of the post-Taliban era.\n\nPress reports this week that the Trump administration is considering asking the Ghani government to delay the election and prioritize the peace process could not be confirmed. There were also unconfirmed reports that the U.S. peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, had broached the same idea in private talks with Taliban representatives.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, John R. Bass, said in an online post and tweet: \u201cWe remain committed to helping the electoral commissions and the Afghan government prepare for presidential elections in April 2019. Timing of Afghan elections is for Afghans to decide.\u201d\n\nThe Ghani government has insisted that the polls will take place on time, in accordance with the Afghan constitution. It has rejected a variety of alternative proposals from Afghan political groups, such as holding a national assembly of elders or creating an interim government while the peace process continues.\n\nGhani has also offered repeatedly to talk with the Taliban, but after a brief truce in June, the insurgents returned to an aggressive military campaign and sought other foreign interlocutors. Last week at the meeting in Moscow, Taliban representatives denounced Ghani and his government, which sent only inexperienced peace commission members who said little.\n\n\u201cThis was a big win for Russian diplomacy and Taliban public relations, and a big loss for the Afghan government,\u201d said Kabul analyst Harris Wadan. Shortly after the meeting, the insurgents launched attacks in previously safe areas of Ghazni province, sending hundreds of people fleeing to other regions.\n\nThe political effect of these diplomatic and battlefield maneuvers has been to weaken the Ghani government\u2019s credibility and incumbent advantage. This could potentially turn the race into a nasty free-for-all, with powerful former warlords either running or playing kingmakers, while Taliban leaders keep stretching out the peace process and prosecuting the war.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban have refused to talk to Ghani and his government because they do not consider it legitimate,\u201d said Haroun Mir, an analyst in Kabul. Whether the president is reelected or replaced, the results will probably be marred by charges of fraud, Mir added, giving the next government \u201ca tainted legitimacy\u201d and further strengthening the Taliban\u2019s position in negotiating with the United States.\n\nThe outcome of the election will \u201ctremendously impact the peace talks,\u201d Mir said. If the Afghan elite remains fragmented and cannot build a united front against the insurgents, they will make few major concessions in talks. \u201cAt this stage, we need a leader who is able to bring people together rather than deepening political and ethnic rifts,\u201d he said.\n\nYounus Qanooni, a senior figure in the main ethnic Tajik opposition group, warned that the election presents a \u201cvery dangerous challenge\u201d that could \u201cdivide the country\u201d between the Pashtun south and the ethnic-minority-led north. He said this risk was \u201cfar greater\u201d than in the 2014 presidential election, which was so badly flawed that the United States had to broker a power-sharing arrangement between Ghani and his top rival.\n\nThe Taliban, whose members are Pashtun, has listed several demands for potential peace talks that would be very difficult for many Afghans to accept, such as implementing full Islamic law, keeping control of southern provinces and changing the constitution.\n\nDespite the public\u2019s sense of urgency about ending the war, many Afghans fear the price of peace will be too high. The insurgents have separate demands for U.S. officials, especially that all foreign forces withdraw and foreign military bases be closed.\n\nSalahuddin reported from Kabul.\n\nRead more:\n\nRussia shows it\u2019s back in the \u2018Great Game\u2019 by hosting Taliban-Afghan peace talks\n\nAfghan officials: Taliban kill 30 policemen in west province\n\nThe despair at the heart of the Afghanistan elections\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Erik Wemple", "title": "Trump, Daily Caller repeat Tucker Carlson\u2019s unproven claim that protesters broke his door", "description": "The pursuit of evidence continues in the matter.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/15/trump-daily-caller-repeat-tucker-carlsons-unproven-claim-that-protesters-broke-his-door/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:43:58Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nVandalism at the D.C. residence of Fox News host Tucker Carlson (Erik Wemple Blog)\n\nMedia critic\n\nAfter protesters gathered last Wednesday night at his D.C. residence, Fox News host Tucker Carlson gave an interview to The Post in which he floated a highly disturbing detail: \u201cSomeone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\u201d\n\nThere was plenty to abhor about this protest, and many folks across the political spectrum did just that. The protesters chanted creepy messages such as \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!\u201d And there was vandalism to Carlson\u2019s driveway in the form of a spray-painted anarchy symbol.\n\nAs for that crack in the door, the search for corroborating evidence continues. The day after the protest, the Erik Wemple Blog and colleague Drew Goins visited the home, documenting the spray-painted vandalism and taking a close look at the front door. It seemed sturdy and fully intact. A woman who answered a knock looked it up and down and appeared to conclude it was in fine shape. It appeared to close snugly.\n\nFurthermore: Alan Pyke, who witnessed the event, wrote on ThinkProgress:\n\nOne of the protesters knocked firmly on Carlson\u2019s front door three times then trotted back down the steps to join the rest of the group in the street. This person did not throw their body against the door, as Carlson has claimed to newspapers.\n\nAs noted by this blog last week, there\u2019s no mention in the police report of a damaged door, though it does mention the driveway symbol.\n\nSeveral attempts by this blog to secure corroboration from Carlson himself have proved fruitless. In response to the last request, Carlson seemed miffed that we\u2019d even checked in the first place: \u201cAre you going to come back and illegally trespass on my property again?\u201d\n\nMany folks have taken the cracked-door claim at face value, including USA Today: \u201cAntifa protesters chant outside Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson\u2019s home, break door,\u201d reads a headline on the protest. On his Fox News program, host Sean Hannity said of the incident: \u201cHis wife, home alone, having to barricade herself inside the house and calling the police. But not before the mob literally cracked his front door, throwing themselves against it, vandalizing his driveway \u2026 with spray paint, shouting threatening messages over a bullhorn.\u201d\n\nThanks to a Daily Caller interview, we now know that this group includes President Trump. Here\u2019s a transcripted snippet from the session:\n\nTHE DAILY CALLER: Tucker Carlson had his house attacked, he had a mob outside of his house while his wife was home. They cracked the door \u2014 what is this violence? Where does it come from? Do you have a message for Tucker and his family? POTUS: I do, I spoke to Tucker and I think Tucker\u2019s a great guy and I think it\u2019s terrible, they were actually trying to break down the door. THE DAILY CALLER: How do you think the police should handle Antifa, generally? POTUS: These people, like the Antifa you\u2019re talking about, the Antifa \u2014 they better hope that the opposition to Antifa decides not to mobilize. Because if they do, they\u2019re much tougher. Much stronger. Potentially much more violent. And Antifa\u2019s going to be in big trouble. But so far they haven\u2019t done that, and that\u2019s a good thing. But they better hope that the other side doesn\u2019t mobilize, you understand what I\u2019m saying. Because if you look, the other side is the military, it\u2019s the police, it\u2019s a lot of very strong, a lot of very tough people. Tougher than them. And smarter than them. And they\u2019re sitting back and watching and they\u2019re getting angrier and angrier.\n\nOn one level, the Daily Caller and Trump are correct to seize on the detail about the door. The idea that protesters rammed a door hard enough to compromise it is chilling and terrifying. If true.\n\nWe asked Daily Caller Editor in Chief Geoffrey Ingersoll if his site had any evidence, aside from Carlson\u2019s comments, to substantiate a cracked door. He responded that it did not. In response to this inquiry, Ingersoll changed a write-up of the interview to make clear that the claim rested on Carlson\u2019s statements to The Post. (Carlson is a co-founder of the Daily Caller but announced his withdrawal from management duties there upon moving to a prime-time post at Fox News in late 2016.)\n\n\u201cNeither of those guys [Saagar Enjeti and Benny Johnson] did much reporting on Tucker\u2019s incident, so they\u2019re repeating what they heard him say. We believe Tucker Carlson as a matter of course here. There\u2019s also dozens of ways to crack a door, so I\u2019m not entirely sure a laymen\u2019s superficial scan is enough to settle the matter,\u201d noted Ingersoll in an email. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it odd a ThinkProgress reporter seemed to be a part of this posse with complete foreknowledge of potentially criminal harrassment? You dropped the link here as evidence, Erik [Wemple Blog], and I think it\u2019s worth a bit more scrutiny than the state of Tucker\u2019s door.\u201d ThinkProgress\u2019s Pyke responded with a long statement that we\u2019ll abridge this way: \u201cThis is a simple story, and it goes like this: I\u2019m a reporter who got a tip and followed it. I wrote what I saw from across the street. Insinuations otherwise are a silly diversion from a simple question that Carlson could put to bed himself easily with a picture.\u201d\n\nObviously, he doesn\u2019t need to do that, considering how many people will take his claims at face value. The interview transcript reflects agreement on the matter from both the Daily Caller and Trump: Carlson\u2019s door was broken, cracked by protesters. The claim, which is based on flimsy evidence, takes one more step toward annealed, common wisdom.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: Here\u2019s the vandalism that protesters left at Tucker Carlson\u2019s house\n\nLetters to the Editor: Hounding Tucker Carlson at home is the wrong tack\n\nErik Wemple: Stop threatening Tucker Carlson"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Greece: Bailout lenders agree to scrap 2019 budget cuts", "description": "Greek officials say lenders have agreed to scrap a major round of government funding cuts planned for next year after the country outperformed budget targets set to help protect public finances", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/greece-bailout-lenders-agree-to-scrap-2019-budget-cuts/2018/11/15/428a5420-e90e-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:40:09Z", "content": "THESSALONIKI, Greece Greek officials say lenders have agreed to scrap a major round of government funding cuts planned for next year after the country outperformed budget targets set to help protect public finances.

They are accused in the June 2017 death of Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar, a member of 3rd Special Forces Group.\n\nMilitary investigators said in charge sheets released Thursday that the accused service members broke into Melgar\u2019s private bedroom in Bamako, Mali\u2019s capital, while he was sleeping, with intent to assault and bound him with duct tape. Then one of the service members put Melgar in a chokehold that was \u201cinherently dangerous to another and evinced wanton disregard for human life,\u201d the charge sheets said.\n\nThe charges, first reported Thursday by the Daily Beast, had been expected for some time in the close-knit Special Operations world, which was rocked by the death. The Navy moved forward Wednesday and has scheduled a preliminary hearing for the four service members Dec. 10 in Norfolk. Rear Adm. Charles W. Rock has been appointed by the Navy to oversee the proceedings.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, Navy Capt. Jason Salata, said in a statement that if substantiated, the allegations would represent \u201ca violation of the trust and standards required by all service members.\u201d The military trusts all of its members to safeguard U.S. interests and to do so with honor, he said.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow allegations or substantiated incidents of misconduct to erode decades of honorable accomplishments by the members of U.S. Special Operations Command,\u201d Salata said. \u201cOurs is a culture of professionalism and accountability, which prides itself in being a learning organization that uses critical self-examination in a relentless dedication to improvement.\u201d\n\nThe names of the accused service members were redacted from the charge sheets released Thursday, but they are identified by rank as a Marine staff sergeant, a Marine gunnery sergeant and two Navy petty officers.\n\nThe investigation progressed as the Pentagon weighed how many U.S. troops to keep deployed across Africa as it reorients to better prepare for adversarial relations with Russia and China. On Thursday, the Pentagon said that after a review, it has decided to reduce the number of deployed troops by about 10 percent, down from 7,200, over the next few years.\n\nMelgar\u2019s death was kept secret by the U.S. military for months as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and other federal officials began probing what happened. It was first reported in October 2017 by the New York Times. A native of Lubbock, Tex., Melgar had served two previous deployments in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe accused service members wanted to confront Melgar after he was invited to a party at the U.S. Embassy in Mali and they were not, the Daily Beast reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the case.

The company said that it catches more than 95 percent of nudity, fake accounts and graphic violence before users report it to Facebook.\n\nBut for hate speech and a related category, bullying, the company catches 51.6 percent and 14.9 percent of incidents before they are flagged by Facebook users.\n\nOn a call with reporters, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that the company was making changes to how it handles decisions about what pieces of content to take down. Facebook will soon create an independent board to review people\u2019s appeals of Facebook\u2019s decisions, and will also publish the minutes of its meetings when new content policies are decided.\n\nFacebook has long faced complaints about lack of transparency in its decision-making around removing this post.

The end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. (Eraldo Peres, File/Associated Press)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Millions of Brazilians may be left without access to doctors due to the end of a program that brought Cuban physicians to rural and dangerous areas in Brazil, the former health minister who helped create the initiative said Thursday.\n\nThe Cuban government on Wednesday said it would end the program after Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said it could only continue if several conditions were met.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain, campaigned in part on promises to take a hard line against left-leaning governments. As a congressman, the far-right leader often complained about the Cuban doctors\u2019 program and tried to end it.\n\nIn a phone interview, former Health Minister Alexandre Padilha said the decision to pull out would leave millions of Brazilians without access to doctors.\n\nPadilha said Cuban doctors were in 2,800 cities and towns \u2014 and they were the only doctors in 1,700 of those towns. Padilha said the initiative was launched in 2013 because local doctors could not be found for many positions.\n\n\u201cThis will have an immediate and terrible impact on the health care system,\u201d said Padilha. \u201cCuban doctors are in the most vulnerable areas. They are in the Amazon, rural towns and in slums.\u201d\n\nBrazil, which includes the largest portion of the Amazon basin, is a vast country, a little bit larger than the continental United States. Many areas, particularly in the Amazon and historically poor Northeast region, are sparsely populated and lacking basic infrastructure.\n\nAfter Cuba\u2019s announcement Wednesday, Bolsonaro made a blistering critique of the program. Frequently referring to the Cuban government as a \u201cdictatorship,\u201d he said the program was \u201cslave work\u201d because the Cuban government keeps 70 percent of doctors\u2019 salaries. He also said Brazil had no way to verify if the doctors were truly qualified.\n\nNeither Bolsonaro nor the Cuban government has said when the estimated 8,500 Cuban doctors currently in Brazil would be leaving. Bolsonaro said Cuban doctors who asked for asylum would get it, though he stopped short of saying Brazil would provide that to any Cuban who asked.\n\nBolsonaro, who takes office Jan. 1, said he had signaled the program could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, were able to bring their families during their assignments and had their credentials verified.\n\n\u201cWe have no proof that they are really doctors and able to take on these functions,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nPadilha said the program, passed by Congress, already includes an evaluation of the doctors\u2019 credentials and language training; Brazil\u2019s national language is Portuguese and Cuba\u2019s is Spanish.\n\nThe former health minister said the doctors were not only highly qualified, but specialists in rural medicine, something that Brazil\u2019s health system badly lacks. He said the salary structure was something the Cuban government had worked out with more than 60 countries that participate in the program, and not something specific to Brazil.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro doesn\u2019t understand that a doctor doesn\u2019t just practice medicine for money,\u201d said Padilha. \u201cDoctors who work in the poorest areas are not just thinking about money.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those actions have been criticized by human rights groups for seemingly targeting civilians and fomenting a humanitarian catastrophe in the war-torn country. They have inspired passionate debate in the United States about whether Washington should continue supplying arms as well as air and intelligence support to the coalition.\n\nBut Bahrain is also home to most of the Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, the United States\u2019 most strategic military outpost against Iran in a region where the Islamic Republic\u2019s influence is spreading. And for most senators, maintaining good relations with the host country of that base is more important than trying to send an indirect message to Saudi Arabia, by stopping military sales to a country that has contributed about a dozen planes to the Yemen effort.\n\n[For war-ravaged Yemen, few expect \u2018game changer\u2019 in Saudi-led airstrikes after end of U.S. refueling]\n\n\u201cFor us to block sales, offensive sales to the country of Bahrain that is housing one of our most important naval bases over something that has nothing to do with them but has something to do with another country, is not a pragmatic nor a sensible step,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said, objecting to the bill.\n\n\u201cThis vote is not Yemen, it is not Saudi Arabia, it is not the United Arab Emirates, it is Bahrain,\u201d said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cAnd Bahrain is a critical ally to us.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who led the effort to block the sale of attack helicopters, missiles and other munitions to Bahrain, acknowledged that it would be \u201ca proxy vote\u201d at best, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not being allowed a direct vote on the war in Yemen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Saudis aren\u2019t getting the message. The Bahrainis are part of the coalition,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSend them a message.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, President Trump has announced plans to end in-flight refueling of Saudi planes operating in Yemen and issued sanctions against 17 Saudis allegedly involved in Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2014 a partial response to an appeal from the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to consider imposing sanctions on the highest leaders of the Saudi kingdom, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nBut critics, including Paul, have been underwhelmed by that response, pointing out that Saudi leaders already had asked for the United States to end refueling its planes. Paul also ridiculed Trump\u2019s sanctions, calling them \u201ca way of pretending to do something and doing nothing\u201d and arguing that many of the sanctioned individuals were already in Saudi jails, probably facing the death penalty.\n\n\u201cPeople respect strength. We don\u2019t show strength unless we do something that is more dramatic than putting sanctions on people who are in prison,\u201d Paul said, stressing that even denying a Saudi ally one arms sale might affect decision-making in Manama, the capital of Bahrain, and Riyadh.\n\nPaul has advocated invoking the War Powers Resolution to force the United States to fully end its support for Saudi\u2019s Yemen war effort. But this year, senators were unable to muster enough votes to support such a measure.\n\nIn the House, Republican leaders blocked a similar effort Wednesday, tucking a rule change into a bill about managing the gray-wolf population that effectively blocked proponents of a resolution to end the war in Yemen, by nullifying a provision of the War Powers Resolution requiring expedited consideration for the specific Yemen measure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful that @SpeakerRyan and House Republicans denied Congress the chance to do our constitutional duty while millions of lives are at stake in Yemen,\u201d resolution sponsor Rep.

These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won\u2019t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nI\u2019m not even going to bother with the false and ridiculous details of this rant, other than to note that when the president is using ALL CAPS to make his point, it\u2019s pretty clear evidence that he\u2019s the angry one.\n\nAnd I suspect I know why. The president\u2019s dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointment of Matthew Whitaker to be acting attorney general \u2014 which was in large part, if not entirely, so that Whitaker could end or at least restrict Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Russia scandal \u2014 is turning out to be a disaster. Whitaker\u2019s appointment has produced a wave of embarrassing stories about the patent company he worked for that was shut down after allegations of fraud by the Federal Trade Commission. He\u2019s even being mocked on late-night TV. Most importantly, Whitaker has now been hamstrung from fulfilling the purpose for which he was installed.\n\nYou might object that I can\u2019t know for sure that Trump appointed Whitaker so that he could go after Mueller. But let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s own words. Wednesday, the president sat for an interview with the Daily Caller, a conservative website. In this remarkable excerpt, the interviewers ask him what his thinking is on a permanent replacement for Sessions, and after referencing a memo written by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel affirming that Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general is permissible, Trump suddenly shifts \u2014 unprompted \u2014 to talking about the Russia investigation:\n\nTHE DAILY CALLER: Could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position? I know you\u2019re happy with Matthew Whitaker, do you have any names? Chris Christie \u2014 POTUS: Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He\u2019s \u2014 and he\u2019s, very importantly, he\u2019s respected within DOJ. I heard he got a very good decision, I haven\u2019t seen it. Kellyanne, did I hear that? WHITE HOUSE ADVISER KELLYANNE CONWAY: 20 pages. POTUS: A 20-page? THE DAILY CALLER: It just came out right before this, sir. POTUS: Well, I heard it was a very strong opinion. Uh, which is good. But [Whitaker] is just somebody that\u2019s very respected. I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had. It\u2019s something that should have never been brought. It\u2019s an illegal investigation. And you know, it\u2019s very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller\u2019s not Senate confirmed.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s exactly what happened when Trump was interviewed by Lester Holt of NBC News in May 2017 and he blurted out that he fired FBI director James B. Comey because of the Russia investigation. Like the Daily Caller interviewers, Holt didn\u2019t mention Russia at all in his question; he asked Trump about a report that he had ordered Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to write about Comey (seemingly to offer justification for firing him), and inquired about whether Trump had already decided to fire Comey when he got that report. Trump then said, \u201cBut regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself \u2014 I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nHere we have two cases where Trump is asked questions about personnel moves at the Justice Department, and both times, without prompting, he makes it clear that he made the decision in order to quash the Russia investigation. He just can\u2019t help himself.\n\nThe scenario Trump would have preferred for this whole thing would have been that the Whitaker appointment attracted little attention other than people saying, \u201cWell, he seems like a capable fellow,\u201d then Whitaker could either fire Mueller and shut down his investigation or find some other way to strangle it. But with Whitaker\u2019s colorful past and his lengthy record of statements on TV criticizing the investigation before he joined the administration, everyone is now watching Whitaker closely, and if he moves against Mueller it will be considered a crisis.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated insistence that the fact that Mueller wasn\u2019t confirmed by the Senate somehow delegitimizes him may also be a tell that the confirmation issue is on his mind. When he does appoint a permanent attorney general, that person will be subjected to lengthy, detailed questioning about how he (and it will presumably be a man) plans to conduct himself with regard to Mueller \u2014 whether he has spoken to the president about the investigation, whether he believes there has been any misconduct on Mueller\u2019s part, and so on. If he can\u2019t answer those questions in a way that gives assurance of his objectivity, he might not get confirmed. Whitaker, on the other hand, has the benefit of not needing confirmation, so he won\u2019t have to answer those questions.\n\nBut it may be too late. As each day passes, Mueller gets closer to reaching the end of his inquiries, and he has no doubt prepared for the moment when he\u2019s fired by making sure the evidence he has gathered can either be passed to other prosecutors or made public in some form. According to CNN, Mueller has already begun writing his final report even as it looks like more indictments are coming.\n\nIt has been clear all along that Trump has desperately wanted to mount a frontal attack on Mueller, but he\u2019s too impulsive to do it without telling everyone exactly what he\u2019s up to, which then makes it harder to carry out his plan. He can\u2019t even obstruct justice properly."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Argentina detains 12 in bomb attacks ahead of G20", "description": "Argentine officials say they've arrested 12 presumed anarchists in connection with two homemade bomb attacks two weeks before world leaders gather in Buenos Aires for the Group of 20 summit", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/argentina-detains-12-in-bomb-attacks-ahead-of-g20/2018/11/15/baf6d810-e905-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:39:06Z", "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina Argentine officials say theyve arrested 12 presumed anarchists in connection with two homemade bomb attacks two weeks before world leaders gather in Buenos Aires for the Group of 20 summit.

That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019ve had to stop visiting schools to talk with kids. Finally, I was diagnosed with ALS. That's the bad news.\n\n\u201cNow the good news: Like many conditions, ALS has different forms. While of course I\u2019d rather not have it at all, I am extremely grateful that mine is a slow-progressing version of the disease.\u201d\n\nGreen will appear on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Sunday as he launches a fundraising effort to fight ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that claimed the life of former 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark last summer.\n\n\u201cAs always, I will spend the coming days and years counting the blessings I have instead of pining for the things I don\u2019t,\u201d he wrote. \u201cToday I will take a walk.

As good as it gets\u2026\u201d\n\nGreen, who turns 55 next month, was a two-time all-American at Syracuse, where he played from 1982-85. The 17th overall draft pick of the Falcons in 1986, he started 71 games and had 24 career sacks. His playing career ended in 1993 and he went on to earn a law degree. He wrote about football in \u201cThe Dark Side of the Game: My Life in the NFL\u201d and children\u2019s books. He also appeared on several TV networks.\n\nSteve Gleason, a 41-year-old former New Orleans Saints safety, was diagnosed with ALS in 2011. Like Green, former NFL player Tim Shaw and others, he is fighting hard.\n\n\u201cOne year after my diagnosis, I was using a wheelchair,\u201d he wrote for The Post in 2014. \u201cOne year after losing my ability to walk, I lost my ability to speak. Heeding the advice to stay proactive, I had spent the previous summer recording my voice. After recording nearly 5,000 sentences, I was able to use technology to \u2018bank\u2019 my voice. As a result, when I use my eyes to type my thoughts to my wife, my son or anyone, the voice they hear is mine. I believe that what ALS takes away, technology can give back. Some day in the not-distant future, everyone will control computers with their eyes or their thoughts. When that day comes, remember that you heard it here first.\u201d\n\nClark said in March 2017 that he was considering whether there was a link between the head trauma football players suffer and ALS, as there is with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked if playing football caused this,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure.

(AP Photo/Nell Redmond)\n\nThe NFL has awarded more than $35 million in grants to fund medical research into brain health and injuries, the league said Thursday.\n\nThe grants were made as part of a $100 million initiative announced by the league in 2016. Under that initiative, which the NFL called \u201cPlay Safe. Play Smart,\u201d the league said it would devote $60 million to technological research, including attempts to improve helmet safety for players, and $40 million toward the funding of medical research into the effects of head injuries.\n\nThe NFL established what it called an independent scientific advisory board of doctors, scientists and clinicians to identify and support research proposals.\n\nThe grants announced Thursday were made to research projects evaluated and chosen by that scientific advisory board, the NFL said. That panel was chaired by Peter Chiarelli, a retired U.S. Army general who is the former CEO of One Mind, a nonprofit organization focused on the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to promote was translational research, research that was going to help patients understand the disease today \u2026. We feel very strongly that the research we recommended to the NFL is going to do just that,\u201d Chiarelli said in a phone interview.\n\nThe advisory board reviewed 129 proposals, whittled that to eight finalists and recommended five of those eight to the NFL for funding. The NFL accepted all five recommendations, according to Chiarelli, who said the research will have applications beyond football.\n\n\u201cThis is a public health problem that\u2019s significant, that doesn\u2019t just affect football players and soldiers,\u201d he said.\n\n[Concussions were down 13 percent during the NFL preseason, league says]\n\nThe largest award announced Thursday was a nearly $14.7 million grant to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and the Harvard Medical School for a study to assess the neurological health and track the progress of a group of as many as 2,500 former NFL players originally assessed in 2001. As the research, being led by William P. Meehan III, nears its conclusion, the NFL said, players who exhibit impairment will be eligible for clinical trials of promising treatments.\n\nThe NFL said it awarded $9.4 million to a University of Calgary study of concussions suffered by high school student-athletes; nearly $6.1 million to a study of brain health of retired football players by the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; nearly $3.5 million to a University of California-San Francisco study of clinical knowledge and research into traumatic brain injury; and nearly $1.6 million to a study by the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and Harvard Medical School into brain injuries suffered by young athletes in football, hockey, soccer, rugby and other collision sports.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh study is to compare the rates of brain injuries and disease in retired football players to those of a control group, perhaps getting at the issue of whether such issues are more prevalent for NFL players.\n\nThe remaining $5 million of medical funding toward the $40 million commitment has been allocated to research on player health and safety under the guidance of Chiarelli, the NFL said.\n\n\u201cI believe what you\u2019re going to see is this was the best $35 million ever spent in this particular field,\u201d Chiarelli said.\n\n[Ex-NFL player Larry Johnson grapples with violent urges and memory loss. He thinks it's CTE.]\n\nThe allocations announced Thursday are separate from the more than $17 million of funding for research into concussions and the effects of brain injuries that the NFL reallocated in January after a controversy over funding for research by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn that case, the NFL was scrutinized by members of Congress over accusations that the league and its head, neck and spine committee tried to influence a study by attempting to steer the research to someone with ties to the NFL. The league denied the accusations, saying it raised concerns appropriately and through proper channels. Under the reallocations, the funding was divided among research done by the Department of Defense, TRACK-TBI (a study funded by NIH) and the National Institute on Aging, a branch of NIH, according to the NFL.\n\nChiarelli said that the panel he oversaw to award this funding made its own choices about which studies to recommend.\n\n\u201cI can say with assurance this was totally an independent scientific advisory board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were totally independent.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment also was expressed by another member of the group.\n\n\u201cThis process and the [scientific advisory board] members were independent and we focused on the science,\u201d said Sidney Hinds, a brain health research program coordinator at the Department of Defense.\n\nThursday\u2019s allocations come after the NFL said last month that the number of concussions suffered by players during the preseason this year was down about 13 percent from last year. The decrease came after the league enacted a plan to reduce concussions following a 2017 season in which concussions were up.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s plan focused on reducing concussions during the preseason, getting players to wear better-performing helmets and enacting rule changes. The rule changes included modifications to kickoffs and a ban on players lowering their head and using their helmet to initiate hits.\n\nThe NFL previously reached a $1 billion settlement with former players who had sued over the effects of head injuries."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Ian Livingston", "title": "Some of our favorite images from the first snowfall of the season in the D.C. area", "description": "The first snow is always special.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/15/some-our-favorite-images-first-snowfall-season-dc-area/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jtTqTML0V03vICugkvbaZLXZXg4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DDXOTMHI4UI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:16:14Z", "content": "The first snow of the winter season is always special, even when its a headache.

June 25, 2016. ( Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)\n\nJonathan Hillman is director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are capitalizing on President Trump\u2019s absence from two major summits. Putin met with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Singapore, and Xi will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea. In Asia, where economics is strategy, Xi and Putin are not only showing up but claiming to champion a new approach to globalization.\n\nLately, Xi and Putin like calling for openness and inclusivity, appropriating Western language to fuel resentment in many of the places that have benefited from globalization the most. They even pledged to link their signature economic visions in 2015, a political act kept alive by endless joint statements and signing ceremonies, including those last week. China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative promises $1 trillion of new infrastructure, trade deals and stronger cultural ties with over 80 countries. The Eurasian Economic Union puts Russia at the center of a single market for goods, services, capital and labor.\n\nThe problem is not American ignorance of this threat but the absence of a coherent strategy in meeting it. \u201cMoscow and Beijing share a common interest in weakening U.S. global influence and are actively cooperating in that regard,\u201d the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency concluded in a 2017 report. But unintentionally, the cumulative effect of U.S. sanctions against Russia and tariffs against China could hasten the very threat Washington seeks to avoid: an anti-Western authoritarian partnership between the world\u2019s largest nuclear power and second-largest economy.\n\nThat nightmare can still be avoided. Thankfully, the Sino-Russian partnership still has an artificial flavor, supported more by leaders-on-high than organic developments on the ground. After each round of ceremonial signings and partnership promises, China still towers above Russia in economic and demographic terms. With a long history of invasions, Russia\u2019s paranoia about foreign powers approaching its borders will not vanish overnight.\n\nBut Russian policymakers must be persuaded to take China\u2019s economic power as seriously as the West\u2019s military power. China\u2019s grand ambitions run through Russia and its neighbors, but its investments and infrastructure projects have not yet triggered alarms in Moscow. Russia is the gatekeeper for China\u2019s overland push westward, but Xi now holds the keys in the form of investment and respect that Putin, economically and diplomatically isolated from the West, craves.\n\nWashington should highlight the risks of China\u2019s Belt and Road in Russia\u2019s backyard. Three of the eight countries with the highest debt risk from Chinese lending are Russia\u2019s close neighbors: Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia. China can exploit the weakness of small economies that borrow big, as it did when it wrote off a portion of Tajikistan\u2019s debt in exchange for disputed territory in 2011. Inevitably, as China\u2019s economic footprint grows, so will its security footprint. Sightings of Chinese military vehicles and construction in Afghanistan\u2019s Wakhan Corridor suggest this expansion is already underway.\n\nTo take the air out of Xi and Putin\u2019s globalization tale, Trump\u2019s trade policy must be updated. Yesterday, a memorandum of understanding was signed to boost trade between ASEAN and the Eurasian Economic Union. China is backing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a regional deal that gained momentum when Trump withdrew from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. Easier said than done, but the United States urgently needs to get back into the game of offering regional alternatives rather than bilateral ultimatums.\n\nFinally, a bit of old-fashioned diplomacy would go a long way. For now, the United States does not need to choose between Russia and China, as President Richard Nixon famously did over four decades ago. It would be wiser to work selectively with both sides, toning down the \u201cwith us or against us\u201d rhetoric and noting areas of existing cooperation. Before reflexively approving the next round of sanctions, American policymakers should carefully evaluate their longer-term consequences, such as encouraging the rise of alternative payment systems, harm to the dollar, and pushing U.S. competitors closer.\n\nWith restraint and patience, the United States could reestablish itself as a natural wedge between Russia and China. At the very least, it must avoid becoming a bridge that unites them.\n\nThis was produced by The WorldPost, a partnership of the Berggruen Institute and The Washington Post."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Batkid won our hearts.

These professors leered at, groped, sexted, intoxicated, and even raped female students.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit describes a culture in which well-regarded professors who helped build a powerhouse department at the Ivy League school acted with impunity and repeatedly mistreated students who were dependent on their academic support. It asserts that professors regularly held professional lab meetings in bars, invited students to late-night hot-tub parties, and conditioned academic support on participation in a hard-drinking party culture and tolerance of unwanted sexual attention.\n\n\u201cThis was an open secret,\u201d said Andrea Courtney, one of the plaintiffs, who earned her doctorate at Dartmouth. \u201cThis was happening in front of everyone, in the department, in the town of Hanover, at academic conferences -- these men had reputations as . . . gropers and predators. It was very widely known, yet no one in positions of power stepped up to do anything to change that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnnemarie Brown, Andrea Courtney and Marissa Evansin, from left in the back row, and Sasha Brietzke, Vassiki Chauhan and Kristina Rapuano, from left in the front row, sued Dartmouth College for allegedly allowing three professors to create a culture that encouraged drunken parties and subjected female graduate students to harassment, groping and sexual assault. (Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nDavid Sanford, one of the women\u2019s attorneys, said the $70 million class-action lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in New Hampshire, \u201cputs the Trustees on notice of their responsibility to implement significant, systematic reforms before other female students are criminally impacted by Dartmouth\u2019s callous indifference and perpetual inaction.\"\n\nThe former Dartmouth professors could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nJustin Anderson, a spokesman for the college, said in a written statement that \u201csexual misconduct and harassment have no place at Dartmouth.\"\n\n\u201cAs a result of the misconduct we found earlier this year\u201d by the three faculty members, Anderson said, Dartmouth \u201ctook unprecedented steps toward revoking their tenure and terminating their employment.\u201d The former professors are banned from campus and from all Dartmouth-sponsored events.\n\nAnderson said the college applauds the courage displayed by those who brought the allegations to Dartmouth\u2019s attention last year. \u201cAnd we remain open to a fair resolution of the students\u2019 claims through an alternative to the court process.\n\n\u201cHowever, we respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the characterizations of Dartmouth\u2019s actions in the complaint and will respond through our own court filings.\u201d He wrote that the school\u2019s trustees and leaders are dedicated to maintaining a safe and inclusive campus, and remain committed to improving the school\u2019s culture.\n\nKristina Rapuano, one of the six named plaintiffs, alleges that while she was a graduate student at Dartmouth in 2014, Whalen sent her a text message summoning her back to his office after they had finished grading exams. When she arrived, he closed the door, the complaint alleges, turned the light off and began trying to touch her. When she tried to leave, the lawsuit says, Whalen pinned her to the wall and repeatedly tried to put his hands down her pants despite repeated demands that he stop, until she forcefully removed his hands.\n\nAt a professional conference in 2015, after drinking with Kelley one night, he told her the next morning they \u201chad sex\u201d two times, and that Rapuano had \u201cfreaked out,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Rapuano has no memory of engaging in sexual intercourse, and does not remember leaving the bar or how they got to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. During the 2015-2016 school year, the suit alleges, Kelley ignored Rapuano\u2019s discomfort with his sexual advances and continued to pressure her. The lawsuit describes her repeated attempts to distance herself from him, including securing a fellowship overseas, and alleges he engaged in academic retaliation.\n\nOver several months in 2017, more than two dozen complainants participated in a Title IX investigation, according to the suit. Last month, the New Hampshire attorney general opened a criminal investigation into the allegations against the professors. A spokeswoman for the attorney general said Thursday the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that even after serious complaints were lodged, Dartmouth encouraged the women to continue working with Heatherton, Kelley and Whalen. \u201cDartmouth warned the victims that the accused professors would likely retaliate against students who discontinued working with them by disparaging them and revoking their academic support, actions which could result in the victims being expelled or placed on academic probation,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThus, at Dartmouth\u2019s suggestion, the victims continued working with their harassers for nearly four months.\u201d\n\nOne woman was sexually assaulted 20 days after a group of women had filed a complaint, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAn attorney for Heatherton sent a statement Thursday saying his client categorically denies playing a role in creating a toxic environment at Dartmouth. \u201cThe specific allegations in the lawsuit predominantly involve the other professors and their relationships with students,\" the statement said. \u201cNone of the complaining parties were his graduate students. He is disturbed by the graphic allegations.\u201d\n\nHeatherton previously acknowledged regret for his behavior in public while intoxicated, including touching a graduate student in a bar in 2017. He denied it was sexual in nature.\n\n\u201cMany of the allegations that attribute knowledge or conduct to Professor Heatherton are patently false,\u201d Julie Moore, his attorney, wrote, including the statement that the three professors all tended to hire attractive research assistants. All of the hiring for Heatherton\u2019s lab was done by his female lab manager, Moore wrote, and the male and female research assistants were selected for their interests and skills, not their appearance.\n\nHeatherton did not regularly socialize with graduate students, and did not attend the parties or events mentioned in the lawsuit, Moore wrote. Lab meetings with his graduate students did not involve alcohol, she wrote, and he did not drink shots with underaged students.\n\nCourtney said that as graduate students, there\u2019s so much at stake, with their academic careers heavily dependent on their relationship with advisers. Dartmouth\u2019s resources, its funding from federal grants and its technology \u201cwere huge draws for us, and a huge opportunity for our careers. But along with that came this highly sexualized culture and this boys' club environment,\u201d and the expectation that they would play along with that or be cut off.\n\nKelley often made unwelcome comments, Courtney said, saying he had the hottest lab assistants, talking about their breast sizes, asking about their sex lives and the penis sizes of their partners or male lab-mates. People who returned sexual advances had access to academic resources, she said, but she felt completely shut out and ignored by Kelley academically. She said Whalen made unwelcome comments as well.\n\nAnnemarie Brown, another plaintiff, said she was groped by Whalen at a party at his home, and she pulled away and left immediately, but then, like Courtney, she said she saw her academic advising dwindle. \u201cI was essentially academically abandoned.\u201d\n\nIt was terrifying to come forward publicly, said Courtney, now a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, not knowing what ramifications it could have on her career. But she felt she had no choice. The women received professional advice that they should just keep their heads down and do science, she said. \u201cWe wish we could,\" she said. \"In order to do science we need to stand up for ourselves and future women scientists.\u201d\n\nJennifer Jenkins contributed."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Valerie Strauss", "title": "Where in the world are teachers most respected?

In both countries, the teaching profession is seen as on par with doctors. The United States doesn\u2019t fare especially well in the index, which was created by the Varkey Foundation, a nonprofit global charitable organization.\n\nThe foundation surveyed people in 35 countries, an increase from the 21 surveyed five years ago, and looked at a number of measures that went into its teacher status index, including social standing of teachers, how well teachers are respected in relation to other professions, what people think teachers should be paid, and whether parents would encourage their children to be teachers.\n\nThe top five, on an index of 100, were China (100), Malaysia (93.3), (Taiwan, 70.2), Russia (65), and Indonesia (62.1). At the bottom of the scale were Argentina (23.6), Ghana (18.9), Italy (13.6), Israel (6.6) and Brazil (1). The United States was 16th with a ranking of 39.7.\n\n\n\n2018 Global Teacher Status Index. (Varkey Foundation)\n\nThose who were surveyed, including members of the general public and teachers, were asked to rank, by level of respect, 14 professions, including doctor, nurse, lawyer, librarian, local government manager, social worker, accountant, police officer, engineer, accountant, management consultant and website engineer. The average respect ranking for a teacher was seventh across the 35 nations. However, U.S. respondents ranked secondary school teachers far lower, the 12th lowest of all the countries included in the survey.\n\nIn most of the countries, the social status of teachers was seen as most similar to that of social workers. In the United States, respondents equated the role of teachers to that of librarians. In China and Malaysia, teachers were compared to doctors.\n\nBut, interestingly, teachers in the United States think the status of their profession is lower than the general public does, according to the index. Teachers who were polled set their status level at 37.1 out of 100, while the general public put it at 48.7 out of 100.\n\nThe report says that there are significant contrasts among the 35 countries about the extent to which parents would encourage younger generations to become teachers. More than half of parents in China, India, Ghana and Malaysia provide \u201cpositive encouragement\"; less than 8 percent do so in Israel and Russia. In the United States, 42 percent of parents would encourage their children to go into the teaching profession, the index said, even though Americans think teachers are underpaid.\n\nHere is a chart showing the countries that were polled, as well as their ranking on the global index, along with teacher salaries, and their ranking with respect to the scores of the international test known as PISA, or Program for International Student Assessment, which tests 15-year-old students in reading, math and science every three years.\n\n\n\nFrom the 2018 Global Teacher Status Index.

Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) speaks with reporters after meeting with President Trump at the White House on March 8, 2017.

Kavanaugh\n\nThe vetting process for security clearances\n\nAbuse of the pardon power\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s hush-money payments to women\n\nRussian interference in the 2016 election\n\nSome of these are more serious than others; some are encompassed by the special counsel\u2019s ongoing investigation. Some require further investigation; other issues are already ripe for legislative proposals. Let me suggest a few guidelines that Democrats might want to consider to strike the right balance so that vigorous oversight (as well as satisfying their base) does not devolve into a redux of the Benghazi hearings, where the congressional investigators ultimately found very little and only made themselves look desperate.\n\nFirst, do not duplicate the special counsel\u2019s work or the investigations taking place in the Southern District of New York (e.g., interference with the Justice Department regarding the Russia investigation, dangling pardons in front of witnesses, hush-money payments, Russian meddling). It\u2019s not a good use of time and may interfere with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s efforts.\n\nSecond, the new Congress must protect the Justice Department from harm. If acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker is still there in January, hearings must be conducted on his appointment, which was likely unconstitutional and in any case utterly inappropriate. Likewise, the House should swiftly pass legislation to protect Mueller. On Wednesday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) declared he wouldn\u2019t vote on any judges until the bill that already passed the Senate Judiciary Committee to protect Mueller is brought to the floor. (Yes, we wish Flake had done this months ago, but this really is a case of better late than never.) Flake will be gone in January, but perhaps Sen.-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) can take up the cause. It\u2019s a good way to test the sincerity of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), among the best hand-wringers in the Senate, who previously voiced support for protecting Mueller.\n\nOtherwise, in the scandal department, Democrats should focus on items under the broad umbrella of \u201ccorruption\u201d and perhaps conduct a joint investigation under the auspices of the Judiciary and Government Oversight committees. (They can call it the Joint Committee on Corruption, so that each time it generates news, the public will hear the word \u201ccorruption.\u201d) The House could issue subpoenas for Trump\u2019s tax returns (to examine conflicts of interest with Russia, Saudi Arabia and other foreign powers) and investigate misuse of taxpayer funds for travel and other extravagant expenses. It could pass a resolution disallowing foreign emoluments and then seek all evidence to determine what foreign monies Trump has received.\n\nFinally, every other hearing should be about the harm the Trump administration has caused to real people: The mishandling of Hurricane Maria, sabotage of the Affordable Care Act, the family-separation policy (which the Trump administration denied was a policy at all), drug prices, insufficient attention to domestic terrorism, Education Department handling of student loan forgiveness, voter suppression and lack of voter access, etc. The result of each investigation should be a set of legislative proposals (e.g., new funds for Puerto Rico and a process for obtaining statehood; standardized reporting for hate crimes and new resources for countering domestic terror).

Parker wanted to end her life on her own terms before the suffering became unendurable, so she applied for a physician-assisted death, she told CTV news.\n\nThough she was approved, there was a problem.\n\nUnder Canadian law, patients must be lucid enough to give informed consent to their deaths twice: at the time the request is made and immediately before they are administered the cocktail of life-ending drugs.\n\nParker told CTV News that she wanted to experience one final Christmas, but she feared that if she waited that long, the disease and her medication might rob her of the mental cognition to consent a second time. She was forced, she believed, into dying earlier than she intended.\n\nIn her final farewell on Facebook, published the morning of Nov. 1, Parker wrote that while \u201cdying is a messy business,\u201d those approved for a medically assisted death should be free to \u201cfigure out when the right time to die is upon them.\u201d Later that day, she was given a lethal injection and died.\n\nSince Canada\u2019s supreme court ruled in 2015 that adults suffering from \u201cgrievous and irremediable\u201d medical conditions whose deaths were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d had the right to a physician-assisted death, more than 3,700 Canadians have received one.\n\nBut criticism of the country\u2019s medically assisted dying legislation, which was passed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government in 2016, has bubbled to the surface following Parker\u2019s death.\n\nCritics say it forces patients to make a cruel choice: forgoing the death they want and prolonging their suffering; or ending their lives before they want to. Neither scenario provides them the autonomy to end their lives on their own terms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the tragic ironies of our law,\u201d said Shanaaz Gokool, the chief executive of Dying With Dignity Canada.\n\nCases like Parker\u2019s are \u201cdefinitely not rare,\u201d said Gary Rodin, the doctor in charge of the supportive care department at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto.\n\n\u201cThe ability to control the circumstances of dying is very important for people who choose physician-assisted death,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Canada was drafting the legislation, two independent advisory committees recommended that the government permit the use of \u201cadvance requests,\u201d written instructions that detail the terms for a physician-assisted death that must be followed even if the person is unable to provide late-stage consent.\n\nBut others voiced opposition, fearing the inclusion of \u201cadvance requests\u201d would harm vulnerable people, particularly those with degenerative neurological disorders such as dementia, who may be unable to speak for themselves and forced instead to have others decide whether they live or die.\n\n\u201cFor those who care for them, it is difficult or impossible to know what the person with dementia comes to value over time, especially if those values are at odds with previously expressed desires,\u201d Mimi Lowi-Young, the chief executive of the Alzheimer Society of Canada, testified before a parliamentary committee.\n\nThe government opted to leave out advance requests as a safeguard.\n\nJocelyn Downie, a professor of health and ethics law at Dalhousie University and a member of one of the advisory committees, said the decision has had unintended consequences.\n\nNot only are people being forced to die earlier than they wish but some patients also are dialing back their pain medication before their physician-assisted death so they are lucid enough to consent, even though it can cause them excruciating suffering.\n\nAccording to Health Canada, loss of capacity is the top reason requests for the procedure are declined.\n\nDownie notes that there is a distinction between cases like Parker\u2019s and the more ethically fraught ones of those with dementia, because \u201cthere is no way you can argue Parker is going to change her mind.\u201d\n\nMoreover, she added, people with dementia frequently spell out their wishes for their end-of-life care in advance directives, which are supposed to be respected by their health-care providers and powers of attorney. They may indicate, for instance, that they wish to refuse treatment in the event of a pneumonia or ask to decline tube feeding if they can no longer eat on their own.\n\n\u201cTo say the complexity of the situation with dementia means we shouldn\u2019t allow any requests at all doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Downie said. Asked in Parliament whether the government would amend its medically assisted dying law, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, the federal health minister, expressed sympathy for Parker\u2019s plight.\n\n\u201cIf I could have given authorization for her advanced request, I would absolutely have done so,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as parliamentarians, the laws we make are for all Canadians.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s law required the government to commission an independent study focused on whether the law should be expanded to include three types of patients: those like Parker who want to make advance requests, patients whose sole purpose for seeking a physician-assisted death is mental illness, and mature minors.\n\nThe Council of Canadian Academies, a nonprofit with a public policy focus, will release the report next month. It will summarize the evidence but will not make any recommendations.\n\nRead more\n\nIn Canada, pretending to be a witch is a punishable offense\n\nOntario reverts to an outdated sex-ed curriculum as the Canadian province shifts to the right\n\n\u2018Third World conditions\u2019: Many of Canada\u2019s indigenous people can\u2019t drink the water at home"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Chief of Iran Social Security Organization dies in car crash", "description": "Iran's state TV is reporting that the managing director of the country's social security agency and his deputy have been killed in a car crash in northern Iran", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/chief-of-iran-social-security-organization-dies-in-car-crash/2018/11/15/6ac6abae-e8fb-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:25:17Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iran\u2019s state TV is reporting that the managing director of the country\u2019s social security agency and his deputy have been killed in a car crash in northern Iran.\n\nThe Thursday report said Taghi Nourbakhsh and his deputy, Abdolrahman Tajeddin, were injured in a car crash in northern Golestan Province and both died later in a hospital.\n\nThe Social Security Organization is a non-governmental organization that provides retirement, disability and unemployment insurance for wage-earners and salaried workers as well as self-employed persons who voluntarily pay in to the organization.

(Hussein Malla/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 The son of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah leader designated by the U.S. State Department this week as a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d is a poet and music lover who is said to move around without security and whose role within the group is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nJawad Nasrallah, the 37-year-old father of four, is the second eldest son of Hassan Nasrallah who has been at the helm of the Iran-backed Shiite group since 1992.\n\nIn its designation on Tuesday, the State Department described him as \u201cthe rising star of Hezbollah,\u201d saying he has recruited people to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel in the West Bank, and in January 2016 tried to activate a suicide bombing and shooting cell based there.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets that those designated may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.\n\nThe action followed the Trump administration\u2019s decision this month to re-impose oil and banking sanctions on Iran over its financing of militant groups like Hezbollah, its military engagement in Syria and its nuclear program.\n\nIn May, the U.S. and some of its Arab allies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, imposed sanctions on 10 top Hezbollah officials including its leader Nasrallah, his deputy Naim Kassem and top officials Hashem Safieddine, Ibrahim Aim al-Sayyed, Hussein Khalil and Mohammed Yazbek.\n\nPeople who know Jawad Nasrallah, however, disputed the State Department\u2019s description of his role within Hezbollah, with one resident of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, saying Nasrallah is not even a senior official within the group.\n\nThe man with close links to the group, who met the young Nasrallah on several occasions, described him as a modest man, adding it is almost impossible to believe that he is the son of the group\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cHe moves around without security and visits shops to buy stuff or to eat,\u201d the man said. \u201cPeople respect him because he is a humble person and the son of Sayyed Nasrallah,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was speaking about matters related to the group\u2019s security. He said Jawad is religiously moderate, unlike some other members of the group, and likes to listen to music.\n\n\u201cHe is not a big official with the party. I never heard that he has a security or military post,\u201d the man said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the group also cast doubt on the \u201crising star\u201d narrative or that he was a high-ranking member of the group.\n\nHezbollah declined a request by The Associated Press to comment on the State Department action. The group generally dismisses sanctions imposed on Hezbollah members as ineffective and part of psychological propaganda against the group. The Israeli Foreign Ministry also declined comment, while a Palestinian senior security official said Hezbollah stopped its activity in the West Bank and Gaza after the second intifada, or uprising, which ended in 2005.\n\nAlthough his rank and role within the group have remained ambiguous, the round-faced Nasrallah is not the reclusive type, as senior Hezbollah commanders tend to be.\n\nHe has appeared publicly on numerous occasions, including at book signing events in 2007, when he published a collection of poems called \u201cResistance Letters.\u201d The book focuses on the role of poetry in resistance with poems that glorify those who died fighting Israel, including his elder brother, Hadi, who died while fighting Israel in south Lebanon in 1997.\n\nIn one poem called \u201cShukran,\u201d or \u201cThank you,\u201d he writes: \u201cFrom the heart, thank you to the most beautiful father, thank you for being my inspiration, my father and my commander.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with a local TV station in that same year, Jawad refused to give details about his role within the group, only saying that he dedicated his life to the resistance. He said he likes music and movies, including comedy films, history and documentary movies.\n\nHe was active on Twitter for a while, before his account was suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up pressure on Iran and Hezbollah since withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal last year. On Tuesday, the Department of Treasury also announced it was imposing sanctions on four Hezbollah operatives who were said to have provided financial, material and technological support to Hezbollah in Iraq.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThe White House has teased a pivot to infrastructure so often that it\u2019s become a running joke about the administration\u2019s inability to stay on message: \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d now stands for whatever the Trump team would rather be talking about besides the latest headlines about West Wing intrigue.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 midterm performance has revived prospects for addressing the nation\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges, highways and transit systems. Odds of a breakthrough remain long. Yet those working on the issue say there is a path forward. And it is widened by the administration\u2019s eagerness to notch a bipartisan win after a bruising election \u2014 while jolting a slowing economy heading into the next one.\n\nThe biggest roadblock is how to pay for it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who discussed the issue with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after the midterms, said Wednesday that any package would need to be funded:\n\nMcConnell on infrastructure: \"Republicans are not interested in a $900 billion stimulus.\" \u2014 Ylan Q. Mui (@ylanmui) November 14, 2018\n\nOne big caveat: Republicans love to talk about offsetting the cost of big-spending legislation, but they eagerly got behind the GOP tax overhaul that is expected to add $1 trillion to the deficit and they also embraced a $1.3 billion budget deal last March that was heavily panned for its rampant spending. The deficit grew by $100 billion in October, a 60 percent increase from a year earlier \u2014 and it is projected to top $1 trillion a year by 2020.\n\nAdvocates of a big infrastructure deal from both business and labor groups say increasing the gas tax provides the simplest solution. Congress hasn\u2019t touched the levy since 1993. And a plan the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rolled out earlier this year to phase in a 25-cent increase would raise $394 billion over ten years, by the group's math. That would provide a significant down payment on the $1 trillion in spending that both President Trump and House Democrats have called for.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to be a challenge in the sense that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s politically easy to get done,\u201d says Ed Mortimer, the chamber\u2019s vice president of transportation and infrastructure. \u201cAll these members keep saying they want more infrastructure. If it\u2019s so important to invest in, let\u2019s have a serious discussion about the investments that need to be made.\u201d\n\nMortimer says the issue will be a top priority for the chamber in the next Congress, and it will press for a \u201clong-term sustainable funding source \u2026 One-time budget gimmicks or talk of repealing any part of the tax reform bill are nonstarters.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Democrats in the House, where a bill is expected to originate, will be willing to embrace a tax increase that lower-income people are likely to feel more acutely.\n\nRolling back some of the GOP\u2019s tax cuts for businesses and upper-income earners would be an easier sell for the party, forcing Republicans to choose between rebuilding public works and protecting the wealthiest. And Democrats got a taste of how dicey a gas tax can be in June when California Republicans knocked off a Democratic state senator in a recall campaign that focused on his vote for a 12-cents-per-gallon levy. (Then again, as the American Road & Transportation Builders Association points out, 96 percent of state lawmakers who voted for such a tax and then faced primaries this year advanced to the general election.)\n\nFor now, House Democratic leaders are looking to the White House, trying to evaluate whether the administration is \u201cwilling to play ball,\u201d one top House aide tells me. Trump discussed the issue with Pelosi; and in a potential sign of the Trump team\u2019s seriousness, administration officials have also reached out to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the likely House Transportation Committee chairman, and Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the likely Ways and Means Committee chairman, per people close to the process.\n\nThe Merchants Bridge crosses the Mississippi River in St. Louis.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nSenate Republicans, 21 of whom will be up for reelection in 2020, are no more eager to raise taxes. \u201cThis might be the only thing left on the table that can get done,\u201d says Mike Friedberg, a transportation and infrastructure lobbyist at Holland & Knight. \u201cBut neither party wants to have an increase in the gas tax going into the presidential election, and they\u2019ve said that.\u201d\n\nTrump himself endorsed the idea in a meeting with lawmakers earlier this year. Whether he will hew to that position is another question.\n\n\u201cIf the mutual will is there politically, then the funding will be there. If you can broker a deal in principle, the rest will work itself out,\u201d says Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist who lobbies on infrastructure issues. But he said cooperation could break down as a new set of House Democratic chairmen use their subpoena power to launch probes of the Trump administration. \u201cHow do you get there with this political cold war in the background?\u201d\n\nThe president made the point in his post-election news conference. He said House Democrats could investigate him, \u201cor we can work together. You can\u2019t do them simultaneously, by the way.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s stated unwillingness to follow then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s strategy of compartmentalization \u2014 boxing off Republican probes so he could devote most of his attention to pushing his agenda amid divided government \u2014 bodes badly for an infrastructure breakthrough.\n\nThose rooting for one agree Trump will need to rally support for a package. Otherwise, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d will persist as a punchline about what the administration could be accomplishing.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May in London on Nov. 15. (Tim Ireland/AP)\n\n\u2014 Britain's Brexit secretary resigns. The Washington Post's William Booth and Karla Adam: \u201cThe minister in charge of helping Britain leave the European Union, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, abruptly resigned from Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government on Thursday morning, saying he could not support the withdrawal agreement approved by her cabinet the night before. It was a stinging setback for May. Also quitting their posts were two other ministers and a junior minister in the Brexit ministry. The rapid-fire resignations sent shudders through London and E.U. headquarters in Brussels, raising the possibility that May does not have the support she needs to pursue her deal for a softer, slower-moving Brexit, a plan loaded with compromises that few in Britain like. In his resignation letter, Raab wrote, \u2018I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 World's economy weakens while America's flourishes. The Wall Street Journal's William Boston and Nina Adam: \u201cSigns are mounting of a slowdown in the global economy, indicating a deceleration in China and trade tensions are beginning to take a broader toll on much of the rest of the world. . . . The raft of weakening data stands in contrast with a U.S. economy that expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5% in the quarter, underpinned by robust consumer and government spending. Though few economists predict a global downturn, the economic data increasingly show that the global economic cycle is entering a mature phase.\n\n\"One reason is a slowdown in demand from consumers and companies in China, the world\u2019s second-largest consumer. A months-long slowdown there, driven in part by a crackdown on risky financing and jitters over the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington, is hurting spending on cars, other consumer products and property, according to official data released Wednesday. That is rippling through the world, hurting some of China\u2019s major economic partners.\u201d\n\nThe Fed is tracking it. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was closely monitoring a modest deceleration in global growth, whose strength last year had provided an important tailwind for the U.S. economy. \u2018This year has seen a gradual chipping away at that picture. You\u2019ve seen a bit of a slowdown\u2014not a terrible slowdown,\u2019 Mr. Powell said Wednesday evening. \u2018You still see solid growth, but you see growing signs of a bit of a slowdown. And it is concerning.\u2019\u201d But it's not concerning enough, he added, to change the Fed's rate-hiking path.\n\nPowell also defended the Fed. NYT's Binyamin Appelbaum writes he \"countered [Trump\u2019s] loud and repeated attacks on the Fed without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. Mr. Powell hammered on two simple themes during an hourlong question-and-answer session in front of several hundred people at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Fed is doing its job, he said, and the economy is doing really well. 'I\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,' Mr. Powell said. 'There\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.' He added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. 'Our policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,' he said.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve in Washington on May 2. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Inflation stays muted. Bloomberg News's Sho Chandra: \u201cU.S. inflation showed little sign of breaking out in October despite strength in the economy and wages, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on its path of gradual interest-rate increases. Excluding food and energy, the core consumer-price index rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday, slightly short of the median estimate of economists for a 2.2 percent increase, which was also the gain in September. . . \u2018These are pretty steady inflation prints,\u2019 with \u2018nothing in here that argues inflation is going to overshoot,\u2019 said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale. Also, there\u2019s little to concern policy makers, so they\u2019ll \u201ccontinue to stay gradual\u201d with interest-rate hikes, he said.\u201d\n\n\u2014 GE goes through rough patch. WSJ's Matt Wirz: \u201cWall Street has a GE problem. General Electric Co. raised $115 billion of debt on a reputation as one of the U.S.\u2019s safest borrowers. Now, revelations of losses and questions about its accounting have shaken investors\u2019 confidence, driving bond prices sharply lower in recent weeks. The impact is rippling through financial markets as investors scramble to reassess the company\u2019s risk, bearish hedge funds bet prices will fall further and banks move to limit their exposure. . . . Prices of GE\u2019s various bonds have tumbled about 5% to 18% since late October to junk levels, according to MarketAxess, showing that some investors expect further downgrades . . . A slide below investment grade by GE \u2014 a name many Americans associate with safe and boring investing \u2014 could become a pivotal moment in the U.S. credit market\u2019s nine-year bull run, forcing fund managers to question how well they understand the risk in their investments.\u201d\n\nGE Credit Crunch Ripples Across Wall Street A steep fall in GE\u2019s bonds to junk levels is roiling credit markets, spreading pain and gain among investors and banks.

(Lauren Victoria Burke/AP)\n\n\u2014 Pascrell says new NAFTA needs changes. Bloomberg News's Erik Wasson and Andrew Mayeda: \u201cTrump\u2019s new trade deal with Canada and Mexico needs changes to secure support from Democrats, according to a senior House Democrat in line to play a leading role on trade policy in the new Congress. There needs \u2018to be not only changes in the legislation but more enforcement\u2019 if the Trump administration wants votes from Democrats, said New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, who is positioned to chair the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee, in an interview on Wednesday.\n\n\"Democrats\u2019 concerns wouldn\u2019t require a major rewrite of the deal and likely could be addressed by putting strong \u2018enforcement mechanisms,\u2019 especially over labor and environmental rules, in the U.S. law that brings the deal into force, said Pascrell . . . While the lawmaker didn\u2019t outline specific changes his party is seeking to the deal, Democrats have been consistent in pushing for tougher labor provisions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 White House reins in Navarro. CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Eamon Javers: \u201cThe White House has deliberately curtailed trade advisor Peter Navarro's public profile amid a clash with top economic advisor Larry Kudlow . . .

On Tuesday, Kudlow slammed Navarro for his remarks on the White House's ongoing trade negotiations with China. . . . Last week, Navarro said a potential deal with China \u2018will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd Trump holds his fire. The Post's David Lynch: \"After several months of tough talk and even tougher tariffs, [Trump] may be pulling some punches in his 'America First' global trade offensive. The president has deferred until next year a decision on imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported automobiles and is considered likely to hold off on new trade restraints on Chinese imports when he meets China\u2019s President Xi Jinping later this month at the Group of 20 summit \u2014 refraining for now from moves that would mean higher prices for American consumers.\" One multinational executive tells David that market turmoil and the midterm elections have rattled Trump's trade team.\n\n\u2014 China outlines concessions. Bloomberg's Shawn Donnan and co.: \"Chinese officials have outlined a series of potential concessions to the Trump administration for the first time since the summer as they continue to try to resolve a trade war, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The commitments for now fall short of the type of major structural reforms that [Trump] has been demanding, two of the people said, cautioning that a long road lies ahead in negotiations. One person said that talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies are continuing and constructive. As a result, one of the people said, it raised doubts over how substantive a deal Trump could make with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet later this month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires. Most of the document appeared to be a rehash of previous changes already made by Beijing, such as raising equity caps on foreign investment in certain industries.\"\n\nAs it struggles to seal regional trade pact. WSJ's Ben Otto and Jake Maxwell Watts: \u201cChina has cast itself as a champion of free trade and multilateralism in the \u2018America-first\u2019 era, but the world\u2019s second-largest economy is finding that turning such talk into outcomes is substantially more difficult. At meetings of global leaders in Singapore, negotiators working on a sweeping, 16-nation trade pact backed by Beijing said Wednesday they couldn\u2019t finish the deal this year, citing its size and the complexity of talks among a range of economies. That leaves Beijing without a major deal to its name at a time when a trade fight with the U.S. is beginning to bite and some of its Asian partners are pushing back against Chinese investments they believe come loaded with crippling debt or other burdens.\u201d\n\nMercedes-Benz sedans sit inside a car carrier before being hauled away for distribution from the company's vehicle processing center in Baltimore on March 27, 2014.

WSJ's Josh Zumbrun: \u201cInternational companies in the U.S. rate potential tariffs on automobile and auto-parts imports as the most damaging of the Trump administration\u2019s trade actions, a new survey finds, surpassing the tariffs that have been imposed between the U.S. and China, and the global tariffs on steel and aluminum. Companies, even outside the automobile industry, are closely watching as the administration debates whether to impose the auto tariffs, the survey shows.

While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros.

(Manish Swarup/AP)\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\u2019s trip to India to sell his family\u2019s luxury condominium projects cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $100,000, documents obtained by The Washington Post show.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, responding to a Freedom of Information request, released 47 pages of purchase orders, requisition forms and planning worksheets showing Trump Jr.\u2019s February trip cost more than $97,805 for hotel rooms, airfare, car rental and overtime for Secret Service agents. The costs were incurred on a February tour of four Indian cities \u2014 New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata \u2014 where the Trump family has licensed its name to luxury high-rise projects.\n\nTrump Jr., 40, is the executive vice president of the family real estate company that the president still owns, although the elder Trump says he has stepped back from day-to-day control.\n\n[From rebellious to reliable: Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s journey back to family loyalty]\n\nDuring his tour, Trump Jr. walked the red carpet, attended a ribbon-cutting at a high-rise overlooking the Arabian Sea in Mumbai, hosted champagne dinners for buyers and had a private t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Full-page glossy newspaper ads offered those who put down a $38,000 deposit on a new luxury project outside New Delhi a chance to dine with the president\u2019s son, prompting charges of conflict of interest. His team boasted to reporters that it had sold $100 million worth of the pricey flats, including $15 million in a single day.\n\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect the president and his immediate family, although Trump Jr. briefly waived his protective guard last fall while on a moose-hunting trip to the Yukon. The idea that U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for Secret Service travel while the Trump children are on trips to promote the family\u2019s brand overseas has prompted criticism from both Capitol Hill and watchdog groups.\n\nJordan Libowitz, communications director for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that because the president has not placed his assets in a blind trust, as other presidents have done, he still effectively controls his real estate empire and benefits from his children\u2019s travels. Both Trump Jr. and the president\u2019s other son, Eric, have traveled widely to promote the Trump brand, including trips to Dubai and Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that essentially the president still owns his businesses, and these trips are being done to make the president money. Essentially the government is spending money for the president\u2019s private businesses,\u201d Libowitz said.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not immediately respond to emails or return calls for comment. In a statement, Jeffrey Adams, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said for security reasons the agency could not discuss \u201cthe means, methods, resources, costs, or numbers utilized to carry out our protective responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe Trump family will face tighter scrutiny going forward now that the Democrats have regained control of the House of Representatives, experts say. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who has been a frequent critic of the strains Trump\u2019s family has placed on the Secret Service\u2019s budget, is expected to assume control of the powerful House Oversight Committee next year.\n\nDemocrats began investigating the costs of Trump\u2019s family travel last year, but the effort did not get far. They are now awaiting the results of two reports from the Government Accountability Office \u2014 one on the costs of presidential travel and a second on the security at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Fla., the committee said.\n\nChuck Young, managing director of public affairs for the GAO, says the family travel study is expected in mid-December and will include travel in 2017. That means Trump Jr.\u2019s India trip is not in the study\u2019s scope.\n\nDuring the nearly week-long trip protecting Trump Jr., Secret Service agents following Trump crisscrossed the country, staying in a variety of luxury hotels, including the Oberoi in New Delhi and the Four Seasons in Mumbai, where rooms range from $150 to nearly $500 a night. The promotional events were for properties where the Trumps have licensing deals, not properties the Trump Organization owns.\n\nThe documents released by DHS are incomplete. The Mumbai figures show an estimate of the total trip cost as $25,174, including $18,785 for rooms at the Four Seasons and $6,389 for car rentals, cellphone use and payment of local staff. Purchase orders of the final hotel bills with the General Services Administration show the government actually paid $15,166 for rooms during what it called \u201cDon Jr Visit to Mumbai\u201d and another bill for $3,501, a bit less than the estimate.\n\nThe documents for the New Delhi days of the trip show only the hotel receipts \u2014 about $27,000 \u2014 which adjusted down to $15,360 because a member of the group whose name was redacted \u201cwill settle his hotel invoice on his own,\u201d according to the documents.\n\nThe government spent a similar amount \u2014 about $97,830 \u2014 for hotel stays for Secret Service and embassy staffers for Eric Trump\u2019s trip last year to Uruguay, a Post review of purchasing orders found. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released a report in July showing the Secret Service spent $200,000 on airfare, hotel rooms and other expenses when Trump Jr. and Eric Trump went to the United Arab Emirates to open a golf resort last year.\n\nDavid Fahrenthold contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jeff Stein", "title": "Almost all of Sen.

Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) would cost the federal government $2.8 trillion over a decade but cut taxes by about $3,000 for the majority of working-class Americans, according to a new analysis.\n\nUnder Harris\u2019s plan, the federal government would pay tax credits that match a person\u2019s earnings up to $3,000 (or $6,000 for married couples) but phase out those credits for higher earners.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, said Wednesday that Harris\u2019s LIFT Act would add $2.8 trillion to the federal deficit in its first 10 years and an additional $3.4 trillion in the following decade. Harris has proposed paying for the tax cut by eliminating the parts of the Republican tax law passed last fall that benefit the rich, as well as levying a new tax on large financial institutions.\n\nBecause the amount an individual or couple can receive from the tax credit would diminish as their incomes rise, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the plan\u2019s benefits would go to those who earn less than $87,000, the Tax Policy Center said.

Those on the left have said Harris\u2019s plan should also offer benefits to poorest Americans, and argued it is difficult to explain to the average voter.\n\n\n\nSen. Kamala Harris's tax plan: Benefit by income bracket\n\nHarris\u2019s proposal does not offer any benefits to Americans who have no earnings, an attempt to use the credit to reward people who work. The plan\u2019s benefits also diminish for those at the high end of the income distribution, dwindling starting at $30,000 annually ($60,000 for married couples, $80,000 for single parents) before disappearing for those earning more than $50,000 annually (or $100,000 for married couples).\n\nThe People\u2019s Policy Project, a socialist think tank, argued that Harris\u2019s plan should \u201cat the very least include the poorest among us.\u201d (Harris aides say they have other plans that would help destitute Americans, including supporting Medicare-for-all and expanding Social Security.) A columnist at Slate also criticized Harris\u2019s proposal as complicated and expensive, while noting that it accidentally penalizes couples who get married (combining a couple\u2019s income can put them above the cutoff for receiving the credit).\n\nMatt Bruenig, founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, wrote that the plan reflects a policy design that \u201cperversely exclude[s] the most needy from assistance in favor of those who are on the rung just above them.\u201d\n\nStill, Harris\u2019s plan would cut taxes for a majority of Americans in the bottom income bracket, or those earning less than $25,500 annually, according to the Tax Policy Center. Two-thirds of the benefits from Harris\u2019s tax cut would go to those who earn less than $50,000, while most of the remaining third would go to those earning $50,000 to $87,300, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe distribution of proposed tax cuts from Harris\u2019s plan contrasts sharply with the tax law Republicans passed in December.\n\nThe richest 1 percent of Americans would receive about 21 percent of the benefits from the GOP tax law in 2018, as well as 83 percent of its benefits in 2027, according to the Tax Policy Center. Only 17.4 percent of the benefits from the GOP tax cuts would go to the lower and middle classes, the center has found.\n\nFor Harris\u2019s plan, that number is about 90 percent.\n\nThe plan is significantly more expensive than the law Republicans passed, which is estimated to cost $1.3 trillion over 10 years, not factoring in interest costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Because Harris has not specified how she would tax banks, the Tax Policy Center said her bill \u201cwould fall far short\u201d of paying for itself.

She appeared to make headway as leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus described their session with her as a \u201cproductive and successful conversation\u201d that they would share with their 70-plus membership.\n\nThe veteran Democratic leader is also relying on an aggressive outside campaign to lobby lawmakers, made up of liberal interest group leaders and high-profile Democrats, including one of former president Barack Obama\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 former chief of staff Denis McDonough.\n\nThe powerful liberal organization, MoveOn, endorsed Pelosi while civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said she has \u201cdemonstrated the proven, tested leadership we need to confront the issues before our nation.\u201d\n\nPelosi remains short of the votes necessary, with solid opposition from at least 19 Democrats. Her first critical test is Nov. 28 in a secret-ballot contest among Democrats and then again in the higher-stakes public roll call of the entire House on Jan. 3.\n\nPublicly, Pelosi has grown defiant, and annoyed, at questions about her hold on power. \u201cI have overwhelming support in my caucus to be speaker of the House,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at her weekly press briefing. \u201cI happen to think at this point, I\u2019m the best person for that.\u201d\n\nPelosi, already the first woman to serve as speaker, would be the first lawmaker to reclaim the gavel since 1955.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi faction received a potential lift Thursday when a veteran member of the Congressional Black Caucus said she would consider challenging Pelosi, helping rebut one of the central criticisms of this rump caucus of agitators: that they had no plan other than toppling Pelosi.\n\nThe CBC, which represents about 20 percent of the Democratic caucus, would likely be divided if Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) follows through with the challenge. At least a dozen of its members have publicly endorsed Pelosi. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a member of the CBC, said that his bid for majority whip, the No. 3 position, is a unified trifecta with Pelosi for speaker and Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) for majority leader.\n\n\u201cShe would be a threat to me, as well,\u201d Clyburn told reporters after a two-hour meeting of Democrats. \u201cBecause we put together a team, I\u2019m supporting that team, and that team is Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) signaled Thursday that he is willing to consider Fudge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably be for it,\u201d Richmond said, declining to suggest he would vote against Pelosi but in support of a friend. \u201cWhatever Marcia does, I\u2019m very pro-Marcia.\u201d\n\nWhen all the votes are tallied from last week\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats will emerge with a likely majority of 15 to 17 votes. That gives Fudge and the other anti-Pelosi Democrats the rough estimate of how many Democrats they would need to deny her a majority in the January vote.\n\n[Pelosi faces daunting challenge in speaker\u2019s bid as Democratic foes stand firm]\n\nOutside advisers to Pelosi believe that the anti-Pelosi wing needs more than just the bare minimum of votes to prevent her from securing 218 votes, with the far greater threat coming from the freshman class that is dominated by female political stars. If many of them announced opposition to Pelosi, it could be a politically mortal wound.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post on Thursday, Fudge said she has been taken aback by the support from many of her colleagues for her possible bid.\n\n\u201cOver the last 12 hours, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of support I\u2019ve received,\u201d Fudge said, adding \u201cprobably closer to 30\u201d Democrats have privately signaled they are willing to oppose Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThings could change rapidly,\u201d she said.\n\nFudge, 66, a former CBC chair, said she is building a diverse coalition as she considers a run, talking with allies in the CBC, moderate Democrats and newly elected members.\n\n[Democratic Rep. Fudge says she\u2019s \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 by support as she weighs speaker bid]\n\nIn a significant boost for Pelosi on Thursday, Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), a CBC member whom some have touted as a potential replacement for Pelosi, said in a tweet that she is backing Pelosi, 78, for the top leadership post.\n\nFormer attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who is contemplating a 2020 presidential bid, also voiced support for Pelosi, praising her in a tweet as \u201can architect of the recent midterm success.\u201d\n\nMcDonough, Obama\u2019s top aide in his second presidential term, has begun making calls to shore up support for Pelosi, according to an adviser.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s vote used to be a perfunctory valedictory moment in which Republicans backed their nominee and Democrats their choice, the gavel going to whichever party had the majority.\n\nBut in this era of decentralized political forces, more rank-and-file feel free to oppose their party\u2019s leader. These Democratic dissidents are following the footsteps of Republicans who chased one Republican speaker, John A. Boehner, out of office and made life difficult for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nPelosi could potentially draw votes from some moderate Republicans who have complained about how Boehner and Ryan ran the House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to crossing over,\u201d Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) said. As chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Reed sits in a potential swing district and is working with moderate Democrats on ambitious rules changes.\n\nBut Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic caucus for almost 16 years, said she has no interest in getting a few extra votes from Republicans. \u201cI intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi has deputized the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), to try to produce a new rules package designed to open up the House so that more junior lawmakers can have input through their committees, an olive branch to the incoming freshmen and dozens of ambitious younger Democrats who have felt underutilized in recent years.\n\nMcGovern presented those proposals at a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon but noted afterward that the process had just begun and he needed to hear from the nearly 60 incoming freshmen. \u201cThe new members just got here, so they haven\u2019t had time to really have any input on any of this stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi convened a meeting of her whip team for the race: 43 members met in her conference room just before noon Thursday in the Capitol, according to her allies.\n\nThere were signs some undecided Democrats would fall into line behind Pelosi.\n\nRashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), an incoming congresswoman who called for new leadership during her campaign, said she would meet with Pelosi on Friday to talk about committee assignments.\n\n\u201cWe can celebrate that diversity, that rainbow of women coming in,\u201d said Tlaib, who will be one of the first Muslim women in Congress. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really important that we also honor it by putting [women] on some really critical committees.\u201d\n\nAsked what she wants to hear from Pelosi, Tlaib said: \u201cThat working families are important and that me being here and celebrating that I\u2019m a first is important but that she\u2019ll honor it by putting me on critical committees where decisions are made.\u201d\n\nRobert Costa, Erica Werner and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "A loss in Utah and fury in Florida", "description": "Just count the votes already.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/15/a-loss-in-utah-and-fury-in-florida/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PnDbfKGl2PZCKidoBf_90iU1be0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LJT67XJ4DI5N3J7MRCHMJQXPNI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:45:45Z", "content": "Rep.

CBS News reports:\n\nIn a contest where \u201cevery single vote is crucial,\u201d the Love campaign claimed poll-watchers have seen a few cases where voter signatures on ballots accepted by election workers did not appear to match those on file in Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County. County attorneys pushed back in court documents, arguing state law gives the campaign no right to interrupt the vote count, and letting the campaign question signatures could violate voters\u2019 rights by revealing who they cast their ballots for.\n\nAbsent concrete proof, Love\u2019s attempt to block the counting of valid votes (as opposed to investigating which if any ballots may not be valid) is the definition of voter disenfranchisement; it\u2019s precisely what the 15th Amendment was designed to prevent. It\u2019s a frightful comment on the GOP that a supposedly moderate Republican now resorts to the tactics of Florida Gov. Rick Scott, President Trump and others who refuse to accept results that don\u2019t go their way. (\u201cNothing in their petition shows any violation of election law in Salt Lake County, the county said in a motion asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit.\u201d) There is simply no reason to stop counting votes when state law provides a remedy for precisely the sort of problem Love alleges. (\u201cWhen tabulating mail-in ballots, county elections workers compare signatures to verify a voter\u2019s identity. If a worker decides a voter signature doesn\u2019t match the one on file, the person gets a letter informing them and asks them to sign and return an affidavit confirming their identity.\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Florida remain determined to deny the premise of democracy that all voters are equal and all votes get counted. The Miami Herald reports:\n\nA federal judge has ordered Florida\u2019s 67 elections supervisors to give thousands of voters whose ballots were rejected over mismatched signatures another two days to fix the problem and have their votes counted toward the results of the 2018 midterms. Judge Mark Walker ruled early Thursday that the state\u2019s elections offices have unconstitutionally applied the law that lays out the methods for voters to \u201ccure\u201d problematic signatures on absentee and provisional ballots. More than 3,700 such ballots were rejected this year after canvassing boards deemed that a signature on an envelope containing a mail-in or provisional ballot did not match the signature the state had on file for the voter.\n\nThe judge\u2019s reasoning is simple and sound: The state cannot set up a bunch of artificial deadlines that result in refusing to count all valid votes. The right to vote is paramount. Once again Republicans are advancing the theory that they should be able to stop the vote count if they don\u2019t like the results. All voters are equal, it seems, but some voters are more equal than others.\n\nThere are several issues at play here. First, we have utterly failed to invest needed funds to make voting and vote-counting quick and easy. Voting by mail would cure line-waiting and speed up the vote counting (insofar as tabulation can be done as votes come in). Second, we need to heed the words of James Madison in Federalist Paper No. 10: \u201cNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.\u201d Ideally states should disallow candidates from supervising or having any role in counting votes in which they are a party; if an update to the Voting Rights Act is required, Congress should enshrine this principle in federal law. And finally, whether it is Trump or Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who said, \u201cIf Stacey Abrams doesn\u2019t win in Georgia, they stole it, it\u2019s clear,\u201d no elected leader should cry fraud or foul simply on the basis of who won. (This is different than deploring and litigating efforts to suppress votes as seems to be the case in Georgia; voter suppression is wrong whatever the result.) Likewise, ex-officials such as Jeb Bush should not condemn candidates who go to court, as they are constitutionally entitled to do, to ensure all valid votes are counted. While Republicans are primarily responsible for the new anti-democratic tactic of undermining election results, this is one instance where Democrats should not mimic their foes. At least one party must defend the notion that voting is sacred, all votes must be counted and the results must be respected."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "In a flurry of frustration, Trump again turns his fire on Robert Mueller", "description": "Something\u2019s spurring Trump to new levels of frustration about the special counsel.

Mueller pressed forward with his work, examining possible links between Trumps\u2026 [+6978 chars]", "fulltext": "For the past month or two, President Trump had been unusually quiet about the investigation he once described as a cloud hanging over his presidency. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III pressed forward with his work, examining possible links between Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russian election interference efforts (with a focus, it seems, on longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone and WikiLeaks). But Trump did not talk much about that, instead focusing on the midterm elections. In part, that may have been because Mueller and his investigators were expected not to take any actions that would make waves before the elections.\n\nThe results in, that assumed prohibition no longer stands. The midterms went poorly for Trump, and, the day after voting ended, he began targeting Mueller again. Citing exit polling, Trump asserted more people disapproved of the investigation than approved.\n\n\u201cThey are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about!\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat was just the beginning. Within hours, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man he blamed for not exercising control over Mueller\u2019s probe. (Technically, Trump asked Sessions to resign, and Sessions did.) Sessions\u2019s recusal from the investigation \u2014 spurred by a recommendation from Justice Department lawyers, given Sessions\u2019s role in the 2016 campaign \u2014 was frequently cited by Trump as a mistake and a betrayal. Trump obviously wanted someone to steer Mueller in a different direction, and Sessions had taken his hands off the wheel.\n\nIn Sessions\u2019s place, Trump installed Matthew G. Whitaker, someone who had been hired to serve as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff only after he had repeatedly appeared on television disparaging the Mueller probe. There are legal reasons Whitaker might not be allowed to oversee the investigation, which Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein turned over to his new boss last week. But allies of Whitaker\u2019s told The Washington Post he intended to maintain control of it.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump again revisited the Mueller question, offering a flurry of criticisms about how the investigation is being handled. \"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. \u201cThey are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want.\u201d It was a \u201cwitch hunt like no other in American history,\u201d he wrote \u2014 but his was in all capital letters. In another tweet, he offered a brief summary of his alternative theory of where culpability lies.\n\nUniversities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page & her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\nThat, in particular, is a style of tweet often employed by Trump: References to a variety of other issues, none of them particularly salient to the broader point, but offered with the understanding that his most energetic supporters would know how to fit the pieces together.\n\nPerhaps the most revealing commentary Trump has made about the Mueller investigation in recent days, though, came in a conversation he had with the Daily Caller in the Oval Office on Wednesday. An exchange spotted by Crooked Media\u2019s Brian Beutler has Trump talking about whether Whitaker\u2019s elevation to acting attorney general would be made permanent.\n\nDAILY CALLER: Sure. Could you tell us where your thinking is currently on the attorney general position? I know you\u2019re happy with Matthew Whitaker, do you have any names? Chris Christie \u2014 TRUMP: Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He\u2019s \u2014 and he\u2019s, very importantly, he\u2019s respected within DOJ. ... [Whitaker] is just somebody that\u2019s very respected. I knew him only as he pertained, you know, as he was with Jeff Sessions. And, you know, look, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had. It\u2019s something that should have never been brought. It\u2019s an illegal investigation. And you know, it\u2019s very interesting because when you talk about not Senate confirmed, well, Mueller\u2019s not Senate confirmed.\n\nOnce Whitaker was named, a variety of questions were asked about his background. Other questions focused on whether he could even serve as acting attorney general, given the constraints that exist around such appointments. That is why Trump mentions Senate confirmation here: One of the critiques has been that Sessions should have been replaced with someone who\u2019d received Senate confirmation. Trump whatabouts the issue, noting Mueller was not Senate-confirmed to serve as special counsel. (Which is not mandated by law, though Mueller was twice confirmed by the Senate to serve as FBI director.)\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to note, though, is how Trump goes from a question about Whitaker into a discussion about the Mueller probe, without being prompted. There has been some discussion about whether Trump hired Whitaker specifically because of Whitaker\u2019s stated views about Mueller, which may be what spurs the segue. Trump says Whitaker is respected, catches himself to say he only knew about Whitaker in the context of his work for Sessions and then continues to talk about how the investigation was \u201cillegal.\u201d (It isn\u2019t.)\n\nHow do you go from Sessions to the investigation? Maybe Trump was reiterating his rationale for disliking Sessions, bringing up the investigation and the recusal as a way to justify the firing. Regardless, the point is clear: Trump feels the investigation should not have moved forward, and Whitaker\u2019s appointment and/or Sessions\u2019s firing addresses that problem. The reason for the change was the investigation.\n\nTrump\u2019s first tweet about Mueller on Thursday included an interesting claim. All that \u201cscreaming and shouting at people\u201d was part of the \u201cinner workings of the+\n\nMueller investigation,\u201d an insight into a very closely held process Trump has never hinted at before. Where did Trump learn about the inner workings of the Mueller investigation? Was he simply inventing the insight to disparage Mueller and his team? Or did he receive some information about Mueller\u2019s process he lacked before? And, if he did, was it relayed to him through Whitaker?\n\nThe undercurrent to this analysis is an important question: Why is Trump suddenly so focused on the Mueller probe? Is it simply a function of the midterms having ended? Or \u2014 particularly if Whitaker is reporting back on the probe \u2014 is there something looming that necessitates his renewed effort to undercut Mueller\u2019s work? (For example, multiple people have indicated they expect to be indicted soon, including conservative commentator Jerome Corsi and, reportedly, Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr.)\n\nWhat we know is this: Trump has returned his focus to the Mueller probe and, to some extent, sees his firing of Sessions as addressing his concerns about the probe\u2019s existence. What we do not know is whether Trump has information that is spurring his renewed focus \u2014 but we do know there is reason to believe that, thanks to Whitaker, he has new insights into how the investigation is proceeding."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Brian Fung", "title": "Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX wins FCC approval to put 7,000 Starlink Internet satellites into orbit", "description": "It's part of a new space race to bring Web access to the entire planet.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/15/elon-musks-spacex-wins-fcc-approval-put-starlink-internet-satellites-into-orbit/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5Nx5zaWwsRBhyr9BC2hBXjW3OL0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NHGROJG53EI6RC5MX7QB7TODUY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:43:13Z", "content": "Federal regulators are allowing entrepreneur Elon Musk to use an expanded range of wireless airwaves for his plan to deliver cheap, high-speed Internet access from space.

Proponents say next-generation satellite Internet technology could help developing countries and rural areas connect to economic opportunities currently out of reach for them because they lack competitive Internet access.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see what these services might promise and what these proposed constellations have to offer,\u201d said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. \u201cOur approach to these applications reflects this commission\u2019s fundamental approach to encourage the private sector to invest and to innovate and allow market forces to deliver value to American consumers.\u201d\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Starlink program launched its first test satellites in February. The FCC gave SpaceX approval the next month for its first 4,400 satellites. The company has an initial goal to deploy 1,600 satellites in the next few years, but it has said that it could take more than six years to complete the full network.\n\n[SpaceX launch lights up night sky]\n\nSatellite communications have been in use for decades. But Internet access through the technology is slow and expensive, largely because the satellites responsible for ferrying data to and from the ground orbit at great distances from the earth, increasing lag. SpaceX and its rivals are racing to field a new type of communications network. Instead of sending Internet traffic to just a handful of satellites in geosynchronous orbit, the companies hope to boost satellite Internet speeds by using many cheaper satellites that orbit closer to earth.\n\nOn Thursday, the FCC also approved hundreds of satellites from three other companies: Kepler, Telesat and Leosat. The pressure to be the first and strongest network is fierce: Last month, Musk reportedly fired a number of Starlink managers over the pace of their work.\n\nThe race by so many companies to build new satellite constellations has many policymakers concerned about proliferating space objects.

She appeared to make headway as leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus described their session with her as a \u201cproductive and successful conversation\u201d that they would share with their 70-plus membership.\n\nThe veteran Democratic leader is also relying on an aggressive outside campaign to lobby lawmakers, made up of liberal interest group leaders and high-profile Democrats, including one of former president Barack Obama\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 former chief of staff Denis McDonough.\n\nThe powerful liberal organization, MoveOn, endorsed Pelosi while civil rights leader Rep.

Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) follows through with the challenge. At least a dozen of its members have publicly endorsed Pelosi. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a member of the CBC, said that his bid for majority whip, the No. 3 position, is a unified trifecta with Pelosi for speaker and Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) for majority leader.\n\n\u201cShe would be a threat to me, as well,\u201d Clyburn told reporters after a two-hour meeting of Democrats. \u201cBecause we put together a team, I\u2019m supporting that team, and that team is Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) signaled Thursday that he is willing to consider Fudge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably be for it,\u201d Richmond said, declining to suggest he would vote against Pelosi but in support of a friend. \u201cWhatever Marcia does, I\u2019m very pro-Marcia.\u201d\n\nWhen all the votes are tallied from last week\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats will emerge with a likely majority of 15 to 17 votes. That gives Fudge and the other anti-Pelosi Democrats the rough estimate of how many Democrats they would need to deny her a majority in the January vote.\n\n[Pelosi faces daunting challenge in speaker\u2019s bid as Democratic foes stand firm]\n\nOutside advisers to Pelosi believe that the anti-Pelosi wing needs more than just the bare minimum of votes to prevent her from securing 218 votes, with the far greater threat coming from the freshman class that is dominated by female political stars. If many of them announced opposition to Pelosi, it could be a politically mortal wound.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post on Thursday, Fudge said she has been taken aback by the support from many of her colleagues for her possible bid.\n\n\u201cOver the last 12 hours, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of support I\u2019ve received,\u201d Fudge said, adding \u201cprobably closer to 30\u201d Democrats have privately signaled they are willing to oppose Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThings could change rapidly,\u201d she said.\n\nFudge, 66, a former CBC chair, said she is building a diverse coalition as she considers a run, talking with allies in the CBC, moderate Democrats and newly elected members.\n\n[Democratic Rep.

(Update to my July graphic of @LegiStorm historic data adding in @Redistrict's amazing running tally of 2019 results). pic.twitter.com/UgC7BNT743 \u2014 Bruce Mehlman (@bpmehlman) November 12, 2018\n\nIn January, when the 116th Congress convenes, there will be as many women, of all races, as there are white men in the House Democratic caucus, according to Mehlman\u2019s calculations.\n\nBut what the focus on the historically disproportionate number of white men in political power misses is the trickle-down effect it has on hiring staff.\n\nBuilding off its study released in September that found that of the 1,174 top House staffers on the Hill, 1,103 are white, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies is out Thursday morning with a deeper dive into state delegations and the racial makeup of members' staff.\n\nCongress does not keep demographic data on its staff, so this study was based on publicly available data as of June 1. It may not account for changes in staff since last summer, though the center has asked members to keep them apprised of such changes.\n\nIn an earlier study, the think tank found dozens of House members who represent districts with more than 33 percent people of color who had zero top staffers of color. The six worst offenders were Democrats, including Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.).\n\n\n\nThe percentage of non-white residents of districts for members of Congress who have no top non-white staffers.\n\nThough the new House will look more diverse than it does now (and this House looked more diverse than the one before that), it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their hiring will reflect that. Barrag\u00e1n, Vargas and Hastings are all people of color.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t assume because a member is a person of color that diversity will necessarily flow from that,\u201d said Joint Center President Spencer Overton. \u201cWe all have to make a commitment to this issue. Voters are more likely to elect a person of color than a member of Congress is to hire a person of color.\u201d\n\nTo push that message, the think tank focused on six states to analyze more fully in their latest report.\n\nFor example, in Maryland, where nearly half the state population is people of color, less than 25 percent of the top staff in the congressional delegation is, and Maryland\u2019s two Democratic senators, Benjamin L. Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, have none, according to the new data. The same is true in Pennsylvania, where the percentage of people of color is lower at 23, but the percentage of top staff of color is, too, at 10. And Pennsylvania\u2019s two senators, Robert P. Casey Jr. (D) and Patrick J. Toomey (R), have no top staff of color.\n\nWhy does it matter? For the same reason many are celebrating the increase in diversity among lawmakers \u2014 people of different backgrounds bring a varied perspective to the nation\u2019s problems.\n\nSome congressional offices have taken issue with the Joint Center\u2019s methodologically of only counting chiefs of staff, legislative directors and communications directors among \u201ctop staff,\" arguing its too limited a view. Van Hollen\u2019s office, for example, pointed to a survey the Senate Democrats did in June of all staff that showed 49 percent of his office is nonwhite. That same survey showed Cardin with 50 percent nonwhite and Casey with 23 percent.\n\nBut, Overton has argued that the think tank chose those leadership positions as benchmarks because they are the most high-profile and influential in a congressional office.\n\nDemocratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), said last week she wanted to establish a diversity office to recruit staff from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cEmbracing the value of diversity within our offices, especially in senior positions, will strengthen our ability to represent our constituents and craft solutions that benefit all Americans,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to members. She also told them she hoped to formalize the \u201cRooney Rule,\u201d a guideline borrowed from the NFL requiring members to interview at least one person of color for every top position that is open in their office.\n\nOverton said it\u2019s an encouraging start and is hopeful that at this moment when people are focused on the most diverse Congress ever, they will also demand the same of the people who work behind the scenes on crafting legislation and policy strategy.\n\n\u201cWe have got this great moment, a great opportunity to change the trajectory of this Congress in terms of staff diversity. Right now, we\u2019ve got dozens of new members of Congress and the new Democratic chairs will hire hundreds of new staffers over the next few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a notion of gradual change. We have a window where we can fundamentally change the complexion of mid-level and top-level staff if this is a priority and if members take advantage of this opportunity.\""}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Ex-Chavez bodyguard fights extradition from Spain", "description": "The lawyer for a former bodyguard of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez is arguing to a Spanish court that his client should not be extradited to face money-laundering charges because his home country doesn't respect human rights", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ex-chavez-bodyguard-fights-extradition-from-spain/2018/11/15/47551112-e8f4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:34:11Z", "content": "MADRID The lawyer for a former bodyguard of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez is arguing his client should not be extradited from Spain to face money-laundering charges because his home country doesnt respect human rights.

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)\n\nContributor, DemocracyPost, Global Opinions\n\nIn parts of America, dear reader, things are grim. After the White House revoked the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, and justified its decision by sharing a doctored video from a conspiracy website, CNN sued the White House. During a humiliating weekend trip to France, President Trump sparred with two of America\u2019s closest allies and declined to commemorate a key World War I anniversary \u2014 because of the rain.\n\nLast week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned, raising worries that Trump will end the investigation into his Moscow ties. After the divisive midterms, Washington \u201cplunged into political war,\u201d according to a Post article. And both encapsulating and increasing the political tensions felt across a divided nation, last Wednesday a gunman murdered 12 people in a California bar. \u201cThese are dark times,\u201d Eddie S. Glaude Jr., a Princeton professor and author of the 2016 book \u201cDemocracy in Black,\u201d wrote on Nov. 1, after a different mass shooting. \u201cThe illusion of innocence no longer holds.\u201d\n\nBut darkness \u2014 the destroyer of democracy, according to one masthead \u2014 comes in degrees. And while the illusion of innocence may be gone, the more dangerous illusion of permanent darkness is replacing it. Believing that Sessions\u2019s resignation portends the apocalypse, or that the benighted Trump is destroying America, warps our understanding of the real atrocities that litter history and the world. The United States, for all its troubles, is still a long way from becoming a dictatorship, or a failed democracy. And it makes liberals vulnerable to demagogues, who \u2014 as Trump does to the right \u2014 exploit a bottomless fear of the awful with promises of surety and security. Recognizing how much worse things could get helps prevent us from getting there.\n\nAs a reminder of what that would look like, just try to imagine these latest events occurring in China, the world\u2019s other superpower. People choosing their own representatives! Journalists writing their perceptions of the truth! Open public criticism of the head of state!\n\nInstead, Beijing seems imprisoned by a culture of fear and fealty to Chairman Xi Jinping.\n\nThe day before the Acosta affair, Hu Xin, the former editor of an important Party magazine, plunged 19 floors to her death. What happened? \u201cAnother famous journalist succumbed to despondency and committed suicide by jumping off a building,\u201d wrote the web portal Sohu, the one mainland Chinese news source I could find that covered the event. Another Chinese news website published her story, but the page \u201cgot lost.\u201d Shrug. A Chinese state media journalist told the American government broadcaster Radio Free Asia that \u201cdepression is very common in the media, because the amount of fakery we have to write gets to us psychologically.\u201d Acosta\u2019s ability to ask questions, and CNN\u2019s power to sue the White House \u2014 inspiring a national conversation about the role of the press \u2014 is something that Chinese journalists can only dream about. Instead, on Thursday, China\u2019s largest newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, greeted readers with three pictures of Xi on its front page.\n\nDespite the humiliations experienced by Sessions, they pale in comparison with the fate of Meng Hongwei, the former president of Interpol and vice minister of the Ministry of Public Security, who disappeared in China in late September and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. (His last known message? An emoji he texted his wife of a butcher\u2019s knife.) Like Sessions, Meng\u2019s crime was probably insufficient loyalty to the leader. Sessions can continue his political career, or earn a lucrative living as a lobbyist. Meng will be lucky to see his wife again.\n\nMass shootings, appalling in their senselessness, violate the social fabric. Trump has poisoned American political life by awakening latent racism and xenophobia. But in the northwest Chinese region of Xinjiang, the government has imprisoned roughly a million Muslims in concentration camps. It does not cheapen the memories of American tragedies to call Xinjiang a worse crime. For all the grimness of public life in America today, we still have the freedoms to make things right \u2014 as, indeed, many voters strove to do during the midterm elections.\n\nYes, daily life for most Chinese remains mercifully free of horror, just like life for most in Washington does not resemble the \u201cunremitting political combat\u201d newspapers describe. But that shouldn\u2019t prevent us from keeping even dispiriting events in perspective. Frustrated by the direction in which America is moving? Don\u2019t curse the darkness. Light a candle, and keep fighting."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Aaron Blake", "title": "Matthew Whitaker\u2019s denial about his company\u2019s alleged fraud just suffered a major blow", "description": "A new Post story suggests Whitaker's denial was misleading, at best.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/15/matthew-whitakers-denial-about-his-companys-alleged-fraud-just-suffered-major-blow/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q4UsW1ojyOHnYMIX63nQk77_ols=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRFZSEXIIQI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:05:52Z", "content": "New questions are being raised about alleged fraudulent activity at a company where acting attorney general Matthew G.

Whitaker served as an adviser. And perhaps more important, the new revelations suggest Whitaker\u2019s previous denials were misleading, at best.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig and Rosalind S. Helderman report that Whitaker was aware of such allegations against World Patent Marketing and actually fought back against them when they appeared on a website called the Ripoff Report.\n\nAs a member of the company\u2019s advisory board, Whitaker had been told of complaints about the company\u2019s practices, according to two people familiar with the FTC investigation. He did not appear to take any action in response, they said. In addition, shortly after joining the board in late 2014, Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, personally intervened when a for-profit consumer complaint website posted comments critical of the company. Ed Magedson, the founder of the Arizona-based Ripoff Report, said he received a phone call from Whitaker in early 2015 after the website posted complaints about World Patent Marketing. \u201cHe threatened me, using foul language,\u201d said Magedson, whose website sells companies a program to improve their reputation among consumers. \u201cHe threatened to sue and to ruin my business if I did not remove the \u2018false reports.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNotably, the allegations posted on the Ripoff Report mirror the actual alleged fraudulent activity that had been scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe news represents a blow to Whitaker\u2019s apparent suggestion that he wasn\u2019t aware of the situation \u2014 if not a contradiction. In a carefully worded statement last week, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, \u201cActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker has said he was not aware of any fraudulent activity. Any stories suggesting otherwise are false.\u201d It\u2019s now clear that Whitaker was at least aware of alleged fraudulent activity.\n\nKupec\u2019s denial (which was repeated verbatim to The Post for the new story) doesn\u2019t quite say Whitaker denied knowledge of the allegations. So as long as there was no actual fraud \u2014 which hasn\u2019t been proven and wasn\u2019t admitted to in the company\u2019s FTC settlement \u2014 he can technically argue that it\u2019s accurate to say he \u201cwas not aware of any fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nBut it does epitomize how the nation\u2019s new leading law enforcement officer hasn\u2019t exactly been forthcoming about his own legal questions. The impression left by the statement last week was that this was news to Whitaker, and The Post has sought comment on other questions about the matter that haven\u2019t been answered.\n\nThe lack of clarity is palpable and growing more so. How much did he investigate such claims? If they were bogus, how did he make that determination? Did he just take chief executive Scott J. Cooper\u2019s word for it? How much was he truly involved in this whole controversy? There are no answers, and there needn\u2019t be as long as Whitaker doesn\u2019t have to face Senate confirmation. In the meantime, he could have a huge effect on the course of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nAgain, no actual fraud has been proven, and Whitaker has never been accused of any. Jonathan Perlman, the court receiver who oversaw the FTC settlement, told The Post last week that he had \u201cno reason to believe that [Whitaker] knew of any of the wrongdoing.\u201d The Justice Department has said Whitaker served on an advisory board and worked with the company only in a limited capacity. It says he was not involved in the day-to-day decisions of the company.\n\nBut it also has been conspicuous that the statement attributes the denial directly to Whitaker rather than just saying it in DOJ\u2019s own words. This is a tactic often used by the White House when staff members don\u2019t want President Trump\u2019s false denials and conspiracy theories to blow back on them personally. The inclusion of \u201cActing Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker has said . . . \u201d stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nPerhaps we\u2019re now finding out why it was included."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "http://www.facebook.com/dana.hedgpeth", "title": "'It's worse than what was predicted': DC area hit with first snowfall of the season - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post 'It's worse than what was predicted': DC area hit with first snowfall of the season Washington Post The D.C. region saw its first snowfall of the season Thursday, as a messy mix of snow and sleet caught some commuters and officials a bit off g\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-region-hit-with-first-snowfall-of-the-season/2018/11/15/4c685bae-e8d7-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qGMiHCq6eiKw8mQTCDYbzJ9oqdI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M22DEAHI34I6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:56:21Z", "content": "The D.C. region saw its first snowfall of the season Thursday, as a messy mix of snow and sleet caught some commuters and officials a bit off guard.

Critics say the plan is ill thought-out \u2014 an immigration policy by stealth that will cause problems down the line.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest turning point in postwar Japan,\u201d Akira Nagatsuma of the opposition center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan told parliament, calling the government\u2019s proposal \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201chalf-baked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not saying no to foreign workers,\u201d he said. But he added that there needs to be rigorous planning and a meaningful debate on how to integrate foreigners into Japanese society.\n\n\n\nMembers of the far-right Japan First party stage a protest against immigration while activists accusing them of racism and hate speech hold a counterdemonstration in Yokohama on Oct. 14. (Simon Denyer/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat is not up for debate is the urgency of the situation.\n\nBirthrates are falling across the developed world and populations are aging, but nowhere is this reality hitting harder than in Japan.\n\nIts population is expected to drop from about 127 million to 88 million by 2065. People over 65 already account for 28 percent of the population, and 500 schools close every year because of a lack of students.\n\n[There have never been so few children in Japan (at least, not since they started counting)]\n\nLetting in more people may be the only way to reverse the slide to stagnation and decline, experts say. The problem is what happens then.\n\n\n\nChildren of foreign workers take a Japanese-language class at the YSC Global School in the city of Fussa, in western Tokyo, on Oct. 17. (Simon Denyer/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIf depopulation continues, people will come to Japan somehow,\u201d said Toshihiro Menju, managing director of the Japan Center for International Exchange. \u201cWe need an immigration policy to prevent an immigration problem.\u201d\n\nAbe\u2019s government is conservative, but it is also closely entwined with the business community, and the message it hears from every quarter \u2014 shipbuilding and construction, agriculture and fishing, elder-care establishments and convenience-store owners \u2014 is ever more insistent: We need more workers.\n\nWhile the highly skilled have always been welcome, Abe wants to allow in 345,000 semiskilled workers by 2024, letting them come for a maximum of five years in about a dozen industries, including agriculture and construction. If they pass some still-unspecified tests at the end of that period, they could be allowed to stay for five more years, and even bring relatives.\n\nPrevious efforts to ease Japan\u2019s labor shortage have had mixed results.\n\nAbe initially tried to attract more women and seniors back into the workforce and also sought to boost fertility rates, but those efforts could not overcome overwhelming demographic trends.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japan opened its doors to the descendants of ethnic Japanese who had emigrated at the beginning of the century, and hundreds of thousands came from Latin America, especially Brazil and Peru.\n\nBut even though they looked Japanese, many barely spoke the language and many failed to integrate. In 2009, after the global financial crisis, Japan started offering them money to return home.\n\nWorkers of different ethnicities also came \u2014 but under much more-restrictive policies.\n\nThe main vehicle was the Technical Intern Training Program, or TITP, introduced in 1993, under which workers from other Asian countries were supposed to be given training for three to five years before returning home.\n\n\u201cIt is a sham, pretty much just a way of importing cheap labor from overseas,\u201d said lawyer Yoshihito Kawakami, adding that workers often do not receive any real training.\n\nThe main problem, he said, is that the trainees\u2019 visas are conditional on them not changing employers. If they complain, they face losing their jobs and being deported.\n\nSome 270,000 foreigners, many from Vietnam, China, the Philippines and Myanmar, work in Japan under TITP. Yet, amid abuses inherent in the system, about 4,300 have absconded from the program in the past six months alone, with many going underground as undocumented workers.\n\nA similar number of foreign workers are here ostensibly as language students, officially allowed to work 28 hours a week but in practice often putting in longer hours in the country\u2019s ubiquitous 24-hour convenience stores.\n\nNepalis might be a common sight behind the cash register in 7-Elevens or FamilyMarts in Tokyo, but outside work they often live in dormitories and don\u2019t mix with locals.\n\n[Japan\u2019s employees are literally working themselves to death]\n\nIf Abe\u2019s bill passes, some foreign workers will bring relatives and some may stay long enough to gain permanent residency, as many of the arrivals from Brazil and Peru have done.\n\nIt could represent a sea change for a country where few people speak foreign languages or have much contact with foreigners.\n\nJapan is home to 2.6 million foreigners, about 2 percent of the population, but based on current trends, that number could rise to 12 percent in 50 years, said Makoto Kato, who analyzes the economics of immigration for Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.\n\nThat is approximately the ratio in Germany.\n\nThe problem is that Japan\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge that it is accepting immigrants means no government funds are allocated for integration efforts, and there is no law against hate speech or discrimination against foreigners, Kato and other experts say.\n\nMasashi Ichikawa of the Japan Bar Association likens Japan to Germany in the 1970s, when it brought in \u201cguest workers\u201d from Turkey without much thought to the long term.\n\n\u201cThe idea was that they would not stay in the country permanently, and so it wasn\u2019t necessary for the government to implement social integration policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in reality, they stayed. And now they are having to pay the price for that. I worry Japan will face similar problems.\u201d\n\nA lack of inclusion could be a recipe for social unrest, while an economic downturn could leave Japan regretting how many people it allowed in, some experts warn.\n\n\u201cThe United States let Mexicans in to work, but the time they tried to stop them coming, the economy was already counting structurally on their labor,\u201d Kato said. \u201cOnce you start immigration, it\u2019s hard to stop, and it\u2019s hard to get immigrants to return to their home country.\u201d\n\nGoshi Hosono, an independent member of parliament, says the latest move, if handled strictly but humanely, could prove a positive one for Japan.\n\n\u201cI think immigrants give vigor to the United States, for example,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers see things differently.\n\nThe far-right Japan First party held rallies across Japan in October protesting Abe\u2019s plan, although the demonstrators were often outnumbered by activists accusing them of racism and hate speech.\n\n\u201cWe should protect our own culture,\u201d said Kazuhiro Nakamura, the head of Japan First\u2019s office in Kanagawa. \u201cPeople from different cultures tend to claim their own rights. Just as it has in Europe, that could lead to conflict.\u201d\n\nJapan First commands little public support and has no seats in parliament, but there is a much larger group of Japanese who worry foreigners could disrupt a country where crime rates are low.\n\n\u201cA backlash against immigration should be anticipated,\u201d said Kei Hakata, a professor at Seikei University in Tokyo, adding that hidden sentiments eventually emerge in voting patterns.\n\n\u201cAlthough often criticized as xenophobia, this phenomenon can be understood as a legitimate expression of ordinary people who want to preserve their culture, history and identity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a defense mechanism at work.\u201d\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nVideo: In aging Japan, abandoned burial urns pile up\n\nAs U.S. fertility rates collapse, finger-pointing and blame follow\n\nAs family dynamics change in Japan, more people are living by themselves \u2014 and dying alone\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "U.S. sanctions 17 Saudis allegedly involved in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi", "description": "Treasury Department statement says all 17 people designated \"targeted and brutally killed a journalist.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/2018/11/15/4385a472-e8e8-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Z9FUGUsSZKWhtH7r7u8ul2tnsT0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G5WUOXXI5QI6ROG4M3GKICOBQA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:47:16Z", "content": "The Treasury Department has designated 17 Saudi Arabians for involvement in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, imposing sanctions that freeze any U.S. assets and prohibit any Americans from dealings with them.

It said authorities would seek the death penalty against five of those charged.\n\nProviding a new description of the killing \u2014 which the Saudis initially denied took place and later said was the result of a fistfight \u2014 the prosecutor said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection by Saudi agents who had orders only to bring him to Saudi Arabia through persuasion or, if necessary, with force. His body was then dismembered, carried out of the consulate and disposed of by a Turkish contact, the prosecutor said. He offered no indication of where Khashoggi\u2019s remains could be found.\n\nNeither the administration nor the Saudis implicated Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Turkey has indirectly accused of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s death, or others in the senior Saudi leadership. The extent to which the sanctions and indictment lists overlapped was unclear, because the Saudis did not provide names.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the sanctions were \u201csignificant\u201d but that he hopes for more action. Corker said he has asked for a \u201chigh-level meeting\u201d with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and CIA Director Gina Haspel \u201cto share with us exactly what is happening with the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia\u201d on Yemen and Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for them to be forthcoming given the heightened level of concern and increasing demand for action here in the Senate,\u201d Corker said in a statement.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers issued similar statements. \u201cI am disturbed that following repeated Saudi lies about what happened to Jamal, the administration appears to be following the Saudi playbook of blaming mid-level officials and exonerating its leadership,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) derided the sanctions, saying on Twitter that \u201cthese individuals might lose their heads, do you think they care\u201d about sanctions? \u201cWe are pretending to do something and doing NOTHING,\u201d Paul tweeted.\n\nKhashoggi, who feared for his safety in Saudi Arabia and relocated to Virginia last year, was a contributing columnist for The Washington Post and a critic of some of Mohammed\u2019s policies.\n\nIn a statement, Post publisher Fred Ryan said: \u201cIn announcing actions against \u2018those responsible\u2019 for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the Saudi and U.S. governments are asking the world to take their word for it that this settles the matter. From the start, the Saudi \u2018investigation\u2019 has been an effort to shield those ultimately responsible for this heinous crime when there is every reason to believe that it was authorized at the highest levels of the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nImposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which empowers the United States to sanction human rights abusers abroad, the sanctions freeze any assets of the designated Saudis that are under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from dealings with the 17. Corker led a bipartisan group of senators who called on President Trump last month to determine whether the Saudi government had violated the act and to \u201cconsider any relevant information, including with respect to the highest-ranking officials in the Government of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe most senior person sanctioned was Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to the crown prince. Treasury also named Mohammad al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, in whose diplomatic mission Khashoggi was killed; and Maher Mutreb, described as a Qahtani \u201csubordinate.\u201d Mutreb, a security official who is frequently seen at the side of the crown prince, was photographed entering and leaving the consulate on the day of the killing. The department named 14 others, saying only that they were \u201cmembers of an operations team\u201d who had a role in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nPompeo, the administration\u2019s point man on the Khashoggi matter, said in a statement that \u201cat the time of the killing,\u201d the sanctioned individuals \u201coccupied positions in the Royal Court and several ministries and offices of the Government of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur action today is an important step in responding to Khashoggi\u2019s killing,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\n[In death, Saudi writer\u2019s mild calls for reform grew into a defiant shout]\n\nA U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the 17 were only an \u201cinitial tranche\u201d of people held responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, and that the U.S. investigation remained \u201ca work in progress.\u201d\n\nA number of current and former U.S. officials, and Middle East experts, have said the Istanbul operation would not have been launched without the knowledge and approval of the powerful crown prince, who is the son of King Salman and is considered Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nBut even as he has denounced Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Trump has emphasized Saudi Arabia\u2019s importance to U.S. objectives in the Middle East, including a pending Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and the campaign against Iran, and stressed the economic advantages of American arms sales to the Saudis, the world\u2019s largest purchasers of U.S. defense equipment. During his May 2017 visit to Riyadh, Trump claimed $110 billion in newly agreed-upon sales that he has variously said since then would provide hundreds of thousands or a million U.S. jobs.\n\nAmong the differences between the U.S. and Saudi statements Thursday, Treasury\u2019s account appeared to indicate a planned killing, while the Saudi prosecutor said the decision to kill Khashoggi was made on-site by \u201cthe head\u201d of the Saudi team sent to \u201cnegotiate\u201d with him. The agent \u201cconcluded it would not be possible to transfer the victim by force,\u201d so \u201cdecided to murder\u201d him.\n\n\u201cThe investigation concluded that the crime was carried out after a physical altercation with the victim where he was forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death,\u201d the report said, according to an English translation provided by the Saudi government.\n\nTurkish intelligence officials have said that audio recordings of events in the consulate indicate that Khashoggi was strangled or suffocated in a premeditated killing soon after he arrived.\n\nIn a timeline provided by the prosecutor, and expanded upon by a spokesman at a Riyadh news conference, the original plan to snatch Khashoggi was issued Sept. 29 by Saudi Arabia\u2019s then-deputy intelligence chief, Ahmed al-Assiri, who ordered a 15-man team to \u201cbring back the victim by means of persuasion, and if persuasion fails, to do so by force.\u201d\n\nOne agent assigned to the team \u201cbecause of his previous relationship with the victim\u201d was referred by Qahtani, who among other things has been in charge of media relations in the kingdom.\n\nIn a meeting with the agents before their departure, it said, Qahtani \u201cexpressed his belief that the victim was co-opted by organizations and states hostile to the kingdom, and that the victim\u2019s presence outside of Saudi Arabia represents a threat to national security.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor said the team included \u201ca forensics expert\u201d who was brought to \u201cremove evidence from the scene in the case force had to be used to return the victim.\u201d That person is believed to be Salah Muhammed al-Tubaigy, previously identified by The Post as an expert in rapid and mobile autopsies. Tubaigy\u2019s name appears on the Treasury sanctions list.\n\nThe Saudi government said last month that both Assiri and Qahtani had been fired for their involvement in the case, but did not specify what their role was. Thursday\u2019s statement by the prosecutor said Assiri had been falsely informed by the returning agents that Khashoggi had left the consulate after they failed to persuade or force him to come home with them. It was not known if Assiri or Qahtani were among those indicted.\n\nAssiri, a confidant of the crown prince who also has close relations with the U.S. defense establishment, was not included on the Treasury sanctions list.\n\nFahim reported from Istanbul.

The expanded benefits took effect this fall.\n\nAmong the GI Bill changes was a provision that offered monthly housing stipends to veterans based on the ZIP codes of the campus where they attend the most classes, rather than defaulting to the main campuses. That meant a change to the IT systems for hundreds of thousands of GI Bill recipients.\n\nAccording to VA data provided to The Associated Press, as of this week, about 56,500 veterans had outstanding claims for their GI education benefits, down from 82,000 last week. The numbers include claims recently received, so not all represent a backlog or delayed payment. Out of the 56,500, about 825 were claims pending more than 60 days, the VA said\n\nVeterans were being paid at the 2017 level until IT problems were fixed.\n\nThe department estimated that veterans were likely receiving an average of less than 1 percent of what they should be getting in housing benefits. It said students who were underpaid would receive the remaining amount once IT upgrades are completed. Those who were overpaid due to the change in law would be able to keep the difference.\n\nThe average claim takes approximately 15 days to process, the VA said in a statement.\n\nThe department acknowledged that payment of GI benefits could still experience problems in the months ahead until IT systems are fixed.\n\nStill, the VA said it expected better performance in processing claims next spring and pushed back on suggestions of widespread evictions or students being kicked out of school due to late payments.\n\n\u201cThe allegation of widespread veteran homelessness due to missed payments is false,\u201d Lawrence told a House subcommittee hearing on Thursday.\n\nLast week, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie expressed hope that upgraded IT systems could be put in place sometime \u201cearly next year.\u201d The agency is also working on restoring benefits for students whose college closed down mid-program, Wilkie said. That is the case for thousands of veterans who were hurt by the collapse of for-profit college giants ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that the payments are flowing,\u201d Wilkie said last week.\n\nThe VA said students can contact its call center at 1-888-442-4551 if they are encountering problems with their GI benefits.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hope Yen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Marcia L. Fudge is far from being a national Democratic star. And she knows it.\n\nFudge isn\u2019t a member of her party\u2019s leadership and she\u2019s now a few years removed from her stint as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. She\u2019s a regular on Cleveland\u2019s East Side rather than MSNBC, and she works out of a small office decorated with a painting of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress.\n\nBut Fudge, 66, embraced her relative anonymity on a rainy Thursday morning in her congressional office, casting herself as a symbol of the backbone of her party as she considers challenging longtime party leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) in the race for House speaker.\n\n\u201cWhere are we recognized?\u201d Fudge asked in an interview with The Washington Post, as she discussed black women and the House leadership. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a diverse party, it ought to look like the party.\u201d\n\nFudge this week became the first Democrat to publicly acknowledge a possible bid against Pelosi, rupturing party ranks in the afterglow of this month\u2019s midterm elections and Democrats\u2019 return to power in the House \u2014 and raising fresh questions about the depth of Pelosi\u2019s support.\n\nStill, Fudge faces an uphill climb in the days ahead as she makes a final decision about the speaker race, with the Congressional Black Caucus sharply divided over Fudge\u2019s potential candidacy and Pelosi and her allies confident that she will eventually capture the gavel even as some Democrats grumble.\n\n\u201cI say it to everybody, \u2018Come on in, the water\u2019s warm,\u2019 \u201d a smiling Pelosi told reporters on Thursday when asked about Fudge\u2019s consideration.\n\nAnd Fudge\u2019s record is coming under immediate scrutiny, with Pelosi allies privately arguing to on-the-fence Democrats that Fudge\u2019s refusal to co-sponsor the Equality Act, which focuses on civil rights protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, makes her a non-starter.\n\nWhen asked Thursday about her position, Fudge dismissed the criticism and said that she supports gay rights, but not the way that particular bill was handled.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t find one vote, not one vote, that\u2019s anti\u201d gay rights, Fudge said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to insert it into the civil rights bill. It should be a stand-alone bill and I\u2019d support that.\u201d\n\nFudge, who is close friends with Pelosi critic and fellow Ohio delegation member Tim Ryan (D), is known inside the House for her straightforward demeanor and antiestablishment leanings. She said she is unbothered by the long odds and believes that even her consideration of a bid could rattle Pelosi\u2019s standing.\n\n\n\nMembers-elect of the 116th Congress wait for a group photo outside the U.S Capitol in Washington. Their votes will be critical to the selection of a new speaker. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u201cThings could change rapidly,\u201d Fudge said on Thursday morning as her phone buzzed nearby. \u201cOver the last 12 hours, I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the amount of support I\u2019ve received,\u201d guessing that there are \u201cprobably closer to 30\u201d Democrats who have signaled that they are willing to oppose Pelosi.\n\nThat number of Pelosi defectors is debatable. At least 17 Democrats oppose Pelosi, although Fudge said that many members are keeping their potential opposition under wraps until it becomes evident that she or another contender could be a realistic challenger.\n\nFudge\u2019s potential bid, which she first disclosed to the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Wednesday evening, could force Democrats to confront issues about race and gender in the party.\n\n\u201cIt would say to [the country], \u2018This is not business as usual,\u2019 \u201d Fudge said Thursday when asked about the prospect of becoming the first black female speaker. \u201cNobody wants the status quo. People are weary of who we are as a party. People don\u2019t know who we are anymore.\u201d\n\nDemocrats will hold an internal party vote for speaker on Nov. 28. The full House votes for speaker Jan. 3.\n\nFudge said her life is a story of being undaunted by people who have told her \u201cno\u201d about her options, from her time in law school, to working as a congressional staffer, to being a mayor and then a House member.\n\n\u201cI represent kids who go to schools that are cold, that can\u2019t eat. I can\u2019t play a game with them. This isn\u2019t a game,\u201d Fudge said.\n\nFudge said she is building a diverse coalition, talking with allies, moderate Democrats, and newly elected members.\n\nSome of those moderates, such as Ryan and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), have publicly voiced encouragement.\n\nMoulton, a leader of the resistance to Pelosi, said during an interview on CNN Thursday that Fudge is \u201cthe kind of new leader that we need in this party.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in touch with middle America. She understands what the American people want,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a next-generation leader that people will look to and say, \u2018That\u2019s the future of our party, that\u2019s the future of our country, and that\u2019s exactly the kind of leader that I want to see as our next speaker.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYet the Black Caucus, as a bloc, is not rallying around her possible candidacy. Several prominent members have stepped forward to back Pelosi, including Reps. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).\n\nIts chairman, Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) said on Thursday that if Fudge moves forward, \u201cthen I\u2019d probably be for it.\u201d Richmond said he is \u201cnot anti-Pelosi, but whatever Marcia does, I\u2019m very pro-Marcia.\u201d\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), another member of the caucus who is running for majority whip, said he spoke with Fudge on Thursday and called her moves a \u201cthreat\u201d to the Pelosi leadership team, which he has been part of for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting that team, and that team is Pelosi, [House Minority Whip Steny] Hoyer [D-Md.] and Clyburn.\u201d\n\nClyburn said he did not ask Fudge to bow out: \u201cI don\u2019t tell Marcia anything.\u201d\n\nFudge said she\u2019d be a tough foe for President Trump if she chose to run as speaker and won. She said she\u2019d fight him on core Democratic issues \u2014 and called him \u201cracist\u201d on Thursday. But she said she would also seek to work with a president she sees as transactional and more about \u201cwinning\u201d than ideology.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in government a long time and understand how it works. And he doesn\u2019t.

It said authorities would seek the death penalty against five of those charged.\n\nProviding a new description of the killing \u2014 which the Saudis initially denied took place and later said was the result of a fistfight \u2014 the prosecutor said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection by Saudi agents who had orders only to bring him to Saudi Arabia through persuasion or, if necessary, with force. His body was then dismembered, carried out of the consulate and disposed of by a Turkish contact, the prosecutor said. He offered no indication of where Khashoggi\u2019s remains could be found.\n\nNeither the administration nor the Saudis implicated Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Turkey has indirectly accused of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s death, or others in the senior Saudi leadership. The extent to which the sanctions and indictment lists overlapped was unclear, because the Saudis did not provide names.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the sanctions were \u201csignificant\u201d but that he hopes for more action. Corker said he has asked for a \u201chigh-level meeting\u201d with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and CIA Director Gina Haspel \u201cto share with us exactly what is happening with the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia\u201d on Yemen and Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for them to be forthcoming given the heightened level of concern and increasing demand for action here in the Senate,\u201d Corker said in a statement.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers issued similar statements. \u201cI am disturbed that following repeated Saudi lies about what happened to Jamal, the administration appears to be following the Saudi playbook of blaming mid-level officials and exonerating its leadership,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) derided the sanctions, saying on Twitter that \u201cthese individuals might lose their heads, do you think they care\u201d about sanctions? \u201cWe are pretending to do something and doing NOTHING,\u201d Paul tweeted.\n\nKhashoggi, who feared for his safety in Saudi Arabia and relocated to Virginia last year, was a contributing columnist for The Washington Post and a critic of some of Mohammed\u2019s policies.\n\nIn a statement, Post publisher Fred Ryan said: \u201cIn announcing actions against \u2018those responsible\u2019 for Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the Saudi and U.S. governments are asking the world to take their word for it that this settles the matter. From the start, the Saudi \u2018investigation\u2019 has been an effort to shield those ultimately responsible for this heinous crime when there is every reason to believe that it was authorized at the highest levels of the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nImposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which empowers the United States to sanction human rights abusers abroad, the sanctions freeze any assets of the designated Saudis that are under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from dealings with the 17. Corker led a bipartisan group of senators who called on President Trump last month to determine whether the Saudi government had violated the act and to \u201cconsider any relevant information, including with respect to the highest-ranking officials in the Government of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe most senior person sanctioned was Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to the crown prince. Treasury also named Mohammad al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, in whose diplomatic mission Khashoggi was killed; and Maher Mutreb, described as a Qahtani \u201csubordinate.\u201d Mutreb, a security official who is frequently seen at the side of the crown prince, was photographed entering and leaving the consulate on the day of the killing. The department named 14 others, saying only that they were \u201cmembers of an operations team\u201d who had a role in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nPompeo, the administration\u2019s point man on the Khashoggi matter, said in a statement that \u201cat the time of the killing,\u201d the sanctioned individuals \u201coccupied positions in the Royal Court and several ministries and offices of the Government of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur action today is an important step in responding to Khashoggi\u2019s killing,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\n[In death, Saudi writer\u2019s mild calls for reform grew into a defiant shout]\n\nA U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the 17 were only an \u201cinitial tranche\u201d of people held responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, and that the U.S. investigation remained \u201ca work in progress.\u201d\n\nA number of current and former U.S. officials, and Middle East experts, have said the Istanbul operation would not have been launched without the knowledge and approval of the powerful crown prince, who is the son of King Salman and is considered Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nBut even as he has denounced Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Trump has emphasized Saudi Arabia\u2019s importance to U.S. objectives in the Middle East, including a pending Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and the campaign against Iran, and stressed the economic advantages of American arms sales to the Saudis, the world\u2019s largest purchasers of U.S. defense equipment. During his May 2017 visit to Riyadh, Trump claimed $110 billion in newly agreed-upon sales that he has variously said since then would provide hundreds of thousands or a million U.S. jobs.\n\nAmong the differences between the U.S. and Saudi statements Thursday, Treasury\u2019s account appeared to indicate a planned killing, while the Saudi prosecutor said the decision to kill Khashoggi was made on-site by \u201cthe head\u201d of the Saudi team sent to \u201cnegotiate\u201d with him. The agent \u201cconcluded it would not be possible to transfer the victim by force,\u201d so \u201cdecided to murder\u201d him.\n\n\u201cThe investigation concluded that the crime was carried out after a physical altercation with the victim where he was forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death,\u201d the report said, according to an English translation provided by the Saudi government.\n\nTurkish intelligence officials have said that audio recordings of events in the consulate indicate that Khashoggi was strangled or suffocated in a premeditated killing soon after he arrived.\n\nIn a timeline provided by the prosecutor, and expanded upon by a spokesman at a Riyadh news conference, the original plan to snatch Khashoggi was issued Sept. 29 by Saudi Arabia\u2019s then-deputy intelligence chief, Ahmed al-Assiri, who ordered a 15-man team to \u201cbring back the victim by means of persuasion, and if persuasion fails, to do so by force.\u201d\n\nOne agent assigned to the team \u201cbecause of his previous relationship with the victim\u201d was referred by Qahtani, who among other things has been in charge of media relations in the kingdom.\n\nIn a meeting with the agents before their departure, it said, Qahtani \u201cexpressed his belief that the victim was co-opted by organizations and states hostile to the kingdom, and that the victim\u2019s presence outside of Saudi Arabia represents a threat to national security.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor said the team included \u201ca forensics expert\u201d who was brought to \u201cremove evidence from the scene in the case force had to be used to return the victim.\u201d That person is believed to be Salah Muhammed al-Tubaigy, previously identified by The Post as an expert in rapid and mobile autopsies. Tubaigy\u2019s name appears on the Treasury sanctions list.\n\nThe Saudi government said last month that both Assiri and Qahtani had been fired for their involvement in the case, but did not specify what their role was. Thursday\u2019s statement by the prosecutor said Assiri had been falsely informed by the returning agents that Khashoggi had left the consulate after they failed to persuade or force him to come home with them. It was not known if Assiri or Qahtani were among those indicted.\n\nAssiri, a confidant of the crown prince who also has close relations with the U.S. defense establishment, was not included on the Treasury sanctions list.\n\nFahim reported from Istanbul.

Lebanon, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPresident Trump provided the country with a great service on Wednesday: He showed how utterly inane are the voting fraud hysterics. Asked about voting fraud he said two things: You need an ID to buy cereal (if it has alcohol in it?), a statement so dumb that George H.W. Bush should get another round of apologies for his supermarket scanner observation (which was incorrectly reported).\n\nThat wasn\u2019t nearly as revealing as Trump\u2019s other claim: \u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u201d First, I can hardly wait for the SNL parody. Second, is he kidding? There is no evidence of widespread fraud, but his comical and entirely imaginary scenario (do YOU see people changing hats to vote repeatedly?) makes the point better than opponents of voter ID: The only reason to believe voter ID is essential is if you think people are impersonating other voters. (If they are, don\u2019t they ever get caught when the real voter shows up? Why just drive around the block when they can drive to another polling place?)\n\nWe can have great fun with Trump\u2019s remarks, and we can speculate as to whether he believes it or whether he thinks his cult-following does (or whether he can\u2019t tell truth from Fox News). In any event, it\u2019s serious when Republicans use the myth of voter fraud, the myth of impersonating-your-neighbor voter fraud, to devise barriers to voting. For a few years, voting rights advocates had a tough time showing there was a discriminatory effect from voter ID requirements. They subsequently sharpened their case preparation and successfully found plaintiffs who were impacted by the voting ID laws. Voter ID laws were struck down in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThen the hammer dropped. In 2017, Zoltan L. Hajnal, Nazita Lajevardi and Lindsay Nielson looked at the impact of voter ID laws. The results were compelling:\n\nFirst and most important, we have data from the nation\u2019s most recent elections (2006-2014) and can single out and test the effect of the strict voter ID laws in multiple elections and multiple states. (We define states with \u201cstrict voter ID laws\u201d as states where residents cannot vote without presenting valid identification during or after the voting process.) Second, we have validated voting data so we know whether each of our respondents actually voted. Third, we have a huge sample \u2014 over a third of a million Americans from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study \u2014 which means that we can analyze the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in all states both before and after strict ID laws are implemented . . . Hispanics are affected the most: Turnout is 7.1 percentage points lower in general elections and 5.3 points lower in primaries in strict ID states than it is in other states. Strict ID laws mean lower African American, Asian American and multiracial American turnout as well. White turnout is largely unaffected.\n\nThe results are so stark that we\u2019ve now seen one voter ID law after another fail.\n\nSo, on one side you have the cereal ID and voter impersonation nonsense \u2014 suggesting no rational basis for belief in widespread fraud \u2014 and, on the other, you have one federal ruling after another and a comprehensive voting study that has yet to be rebutted attesting to a significant discriminatory impact of voter ID laws. Believing in massive voter fraud is on a par with climate change denial \u2014 and sadly both show the Trumpized GOP\u2019s willingness to depart from reality."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Mark Jenkins", "title": "How has the selfie evolved?

(Digitized by Mark Gulezian/Patricia Cronin/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution/Gift of Chuck Close)\n\nIn 1839, Philadelphia photographer Robert Cornelius was probably the first to do something that has become a national pastime: take a selfie. The technology has changed a lot since then, as illustrated by \u201cEye to I: Self-Portraits From 1900 to Today.\u201d The attitudes have changed even more.\n\n\u201cEye to I\u201d is the final exhibition of the ones mounted to mark the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s 50th anniversary. Most of the previous exhibitions have featured people who aren\u2019t usually noticed by official portrait galleries: slaves, workers, lynching victims and even those literally invisible to history \u2014 represented by the images in another 50th-anniversary show, \u201cUnSeen: Our Past in a New Light.\u201d\n\nThis show is more traditional, in the sense that many of its subjects are well known and, in some cases, expected. (How could there not be, for example, an Andy Warhol?) Yet some of the 77 artworks, nearly all of them from the museum\u2019s collection, are of less-celebrated figures. The selections are noteworthy for their artfulness, but also for how they illustrate our shifting ideas of self-image.\n\nThe exhibition is arranged in a rough chronology, so the first half is all paintings, drawings, prints and photographs. These include self-renderings of American realist Edward Hopper and Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and a partial view \u2014 austerely formalist, of course \u2014 of geometric abstractionist Josef Albers. There are also pre-digital selfies of such documentary photographers as Walker Evans, Berenice Abbott and Edward Steichen, as well as artier ones such as Man Ray.\n\nA few earlier pieces illustrate themes more common in the later works. The country\u2019s first female photojournalist, Jessie Tarbox Beals, stands with her gear in 1904. Her woman-at-work pose presages the emergence of women in fields that, back then, were mostly off-limits. In a heroic portrait, Thomas Hart Benton strikes a pose that may have been inspired by actor Douglas Fairbanks. The picture was made around 1924, well before most artists \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 started thinking of themselves as the stars of their own biopics.\n\n\n\nThomas Hart Benton\u2019s \u201cSelf-Portrait With Rita,\u201d c. 1924. (Mark Gulezian/Thomas Hart Benton/National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Mr. and Mrs. Jack H. Mooney)\n\nThe recent works include videos and other pieces impossible without contemporary technology. Evan Roth\u2019s \u201cInternet Cache Portrait\u201d reveals the artist himself not as a physical being but as collection of interests, gathered from his computer and printed on a long roll of thin vinyl. It\u2019s another way of depicting presence in absence, and more cutting-edge than Jim Dine\u2019s \u201cBathrobe,\u201d which implies the existence of the artist\u2019s omitted body.\n\nEnrique Chagoya\u2019s \u201cAliens Sans Frontiers\u201d is a lithograph, which is not a new process, but it relies on a recently devised procedure: DNA testing. Inspired by a reading of his genome, the artist depicts six versions of himself, each in a stereotypical setting associated with one of his ancestors\u2019s homelands.\n\nThe closest thing to a smartphone selfie is Molly Soda\u2019s video of herself as she interacts with her phone. She\u2019s not quite her current self, though. Molly Soda is a semi-fictionalized version of 29-year-old artist Amalia Soto as a teenager, buffeted by the emotional and technological stimuli delivered by texts and apps. If Benton imagined himself as a Hollywood swashbuckler, Soto is living a different sort of movie \u2014 one she describes as \u201ckind of sad or dark.\u201d\n\nThe darkness is palpable in the last gallery. As much as it chronicles changing technology and ideas of self-image, \u201cEye to I\u201d illustrates candor about decline and death.\n\nThat\u2019s implicit in Chuck Close\u2019s large 1989 portrait, composed of 16 close-up photos and made the year after a serious injury left him a quadriplegic. Bodily imperfection is depicted more bluntly in Alice Neel\u2019s nude of herself, painted between the ages of 75 and 80. It announces her acceptance of aging while critiquing the female form as male artists\u2019s domain.\n\nPatricia Cronin\u2019s bronze sculpture of herself and her spouse, Deborah Kass, is both traditional and contemporary.

(Ennio Leanza/Keystone via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLUGANO, Switzerland \u2014 It was almost a no-win situation to begin with, and Switzerland certainly didn\u2019t win in the end.\n\nThe Swiss team, which reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups and at the 2016 European Championship, is ranked eighth in the world. So a friendly game against Qatar, ranked 96th and without any sort of standing in the world of soccer, seemed to be an easy proposition, a chance to pile up lots of goals against an inferior opponent.\n\nQatar won, 1-0.\n\n\u201cFor everyone it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri told The Associated Press after Wednesday\u2019s match. \u201cYou can only lose in these games.\u201d\n\nFor Qatar, the victory offered some legitimacy to a country that will compete in its first World Cup when it hosts the tournament in 2022. And for the rest of the world, it was a chance to see what kind of players Qatar has.\n\nEvery member of the team that came to Lugano plays in the Qatari league.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we didn\u2019t know these players at all,\u201d said Shaqiri, who plays for Liverpool. \u201cIt was difficult to know because they play, I think, in their country. But, yeah, I was surprised that they play very well together, very fast players.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland dominated the match as expected, but the hosts failed to convert any of their chances in the southern Swiss city near the Alps.\n\nSwitzerland did hit the woodwork twice, while Qatar threatened with a couple of breakaways. On one of them in the 86th minute, Akram Afif scored the game\u2019s only goal.\n\n\u201cThey were good, organized. I was really surprised that they play very well. They deserved to win,\u201d Shaqiri said. \u201cThey had a few chances (in the) first half and they scored in the second.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were lucky they didn\u2019t concede because we played good in the second half. We created a lot of chances but we didn\u2019t score. The pitch was not so good to play so for them it was better. But they deserved to win.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland had scored six goals in matches against Panama and Iceland this year, and five against Hungary a year ago. All were ranked above the Qataris.\n\nQatar is coached by Felix Sanchez, who worked as a youth team coach at Barcelona for 10 years. The team defended well on Wednesday and played its way out of any danger rather than punting long balls out from the back.\n\n\u201cWe also saw videos that they\u2019d won against Ecuador and Ecuador is a strong team,\u201d said Switzerland midfielder Remo Freuler, who plays for Italian club Atalanta. \u201cAnd moreover, they\u2019ve won a lot of matches recently.\n\n\u201cWe saw that they also have fast players up front and a good defense. I don\u2019t think we undervalued them but we didn\u2019t get into the match.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss team will next play Belgium on Sunday in the UEFA Nations League.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Instead, the lawyers offered a hodgepodge of authoritarian excuses: The media had to be respectful. Acosta was being disruptive. At times, the government\u2019s lawyer sounded Orwellian:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would dispute, if [Trump] wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he clearly has the authority to do that,\u201d [Justice Department attorney James] Burnham argued at one point during the 110-minute hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right \u2026 for journalists to be there.\u201d He also argued that CNN\u2019s and Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights weren\u2019t injured by the decision to exclude Acosta \u2014 as CNN contends \u2014 because the network has dozens of other journalists with White House passes who could report in his place. He also said Acosta was free to keep reporting on Trump by watching television coverage of him outside the White House gates.\n\nWatching TV is the same as reporting, you see. CNN\u2019s rights can be trampled upon because its competitors are in the room. Huh?!\n\nCNN\u2019s lawyer and constitutional law guru Ted Boutrous blasted that reasoning. Having let reporters in, Trump could not exclude one whose reporting he didn\u2019t like. (\u201cThe government\u2019s now taking the position that [the president] can do anything he wants.\u201d)\n\nBurnham tried arguing that CNN wasn\u2019t really harmed, or maybe this was all for the benefit of reporters Trump didn\u2019t find so disruptive. Boutrous slammed the notion that being \u201cdisruptive\u201d was reason to deny Acosta his pass. Nearly all despots claim that criticism is \u201cdisruptive.\u201d Another argument, namely that Acosta wasn\u2019t voicing a viewpoint at all, is belied by Trump\u2019s constant invective against CNN for the substance and tone of its coverage; clearly, it\u2019s CNN\u2019s journalism that Trump hates. He did call the network the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d as I recall.\n\nAs counsel in a case brought on behalf of PEN America challenging Trump\u2019s use of executive power to chill all journalists, Bassin explained: \u201cThe Administration\u2019s continued attempts to block the merger between CNN\u2019s parent company Time Warner and AT&T in retaliation for coverage the president doesn\u2019t like is arguably even more pernicious. But the difference between here and Hungary is that here we have a First Amendment and independent courts to enforce it.\u201d\n\nThe judge promised a ruling on Thursday. Bassin tells me, \u201cI suspect President Trump is going to be reminded of that [Thursday] in the CNN case, and then later in PEN America\u2019s related case to stop this kind of retaliation \u2014 not just against Jim Acosta, but against any reporter.\u201d\n\nTrump has already been slapped down by the judiciary once for banishing critics. In a ruling concerning Trump\u2019s ability to block critics on Twitter, a federal court held: \u201cThe continued exclusion of the individual plaintiffs based on viewpoint is, therefore, impermissible under the First Amendment.\u201d While Trump has his own First Amendment rights, the court held that he cannot trample on others\u2019 rights by blocking them. In the same way, Trump has no obligation to speak to or call on Acosta, but he can no more exclude him from news conferences than he can block \u201cdisruptive\u201d voices on Twitter.\n\nAs reprehensible as the president\u2019s anti-free-speech arguments might be, the silence of \u201cconstitutional conservatives\u201d in Congress and at the Federalist Society is even more troubling. When it\u2019s their political opponents whose rights are at issue, they have been mum, except for a subgroup of Federalist Society conservatives \u2014 those with principles \u2014 dubbed Checks and Balances. Perhaps the sight of the president\u2019s lawyers arguing that the president can deny access to reporters he finds insufficiently deferential will serve as a wake-up call to other conservatives who have been silent, either out of desire for one of those federal court appointments or out of fear of the president\u2019s wrath. It\u2019s a pity that the average Federalist Society member seems to resemble that \u201csummer soldier\u201d and \u201csunshine patriot\u201d whom Thomas Paine excoriated.\n\nWhile the Federalist Society and self-appointed constitutional experts in Congress are AWOL, the free press will defend First Amendment rights that we all enjoy. It\u2019s up to the federal court judge to restrain a president who increasingly thinks of himself as an absolute ruler who can govern by whim rather than as a servant of the people who has taken an oath to protect their rights."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Former Nazi guard testifies he wasn't involved in killings", "description": "A former Stutthof concentration camp guard on trial on hundreds of counts of accessory to murder has testified he was aware that inmates were dying but says he didn't know they were being killed", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/former-nazi-guard-testifies-he-wasnt-involved-in-killings/2018/11/15/acbf723c-e8e4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:42:29Z", "content": "BERLIN A former Nazi concentration camp guard on trial on hundreds of counts of accessory to murder has testified he was aware that inmates were dying but says he didnt know they were being killed.

Puskar / Associated Press)\n\nDespite being a fixture since 2006, \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d remains an imperfect product.\n\nIt\u2019s loathed by players, who need a week to recover from a game that players say leaves them feeling as if they\u2019ve been in a car wreck. Instead, they have to move from Sunday\u2019s game to preparing for Thursday night. It is so detested that Richard Sherman called it a \u201cpoopfest\u201d two years ago.\n\nThe latest example comes Thursday night, when the Green Bay Packers, who played in a 4:25 p.m. Eastern game Sunday in Green Bay, fly to Seattle to play the Seahawks. And the Chicago Bears aren\u2019t going to be happy, either. They play the Lions at 12:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day \u2014 four days after their game against the Minnesota Vikings got flexed into \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\n\nFor the Packers, the game is a must-win with their record at 4-4-1 and the Bears at 6-3 and the Vikings at 5-3-1 in the NFC North.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for the older guys like myself,\u201d Aaron Rodgers told reporters earlier this week. \u201cTuesday [in a normal week] is a great rehab day and a personal day to get your body back and [with a Thursday game] we\u2019re in here most of the day [doing] walk-throughs and meetings and stuff. That\u2019s the way the NFL has done it. They enjoy the Thursday games. Maybe something to talk about when the next CBA comes up.\u201d\n\nBy that he means it\u2019s time for players to flex their muscles when it\u2019s time to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement with owners. Until then, players and coaches make the best of the schedule and the travel required. At least the Packers played a home game Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some tough ones this year,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWest Coast to East Coast. Like I said the other day, we\u2019ve had some years where we don\u2019t go west of Minneapolis. Being a Midwest team, we have kind of the advantage I think in travel, going east and then just having one time zone, and going west, it\u2019s obviously a lot easier to play on your body clocks. When you have a wake up call for 8 a.m., it feels like at 10 a.m. so you\u2019re kind of getting a little sleep in. As John Kuhn used to say, you\u2019re gaining an hour or two at times \u2014 his wisdom. But no, I think that\u2019s the way the schedule goes sometimes. Some years it\u2019s set up pretty good for us and some years they\u2019re making us go a lot.\u201d\n\nSeahawks Coach Pete Carroll, whose team is 4-5 and needs a win after losing to the Rams in Los Angeles on Sunday, admitted that \u201cit\u2019s a challenge,\u201d albeit one that is spread equally among teams. At least the flight from L.A. was a short one for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a physical challenge for the guys. Emotionally, our guys handled it great, I think better than maybe we have in other years and the whole conversation has been about the game and all that kind of stuff,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been anything about the fact that there\u2019s a physical challenge to it. Our guys are not tuned into that end of it. But it is taxing. The other side of it is \u2014 there\u2019s always a good side to it \u2014 we get a break on the weekend. We\u2019ll take full advantage of that.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmini-bye\u201d afterward is nice, but Sherman summed up players' feelings in 2016 on the Players' Tribune.\n\nPlaying four days after a Sunday game, \u201cyour body,\u201d he wrote, \u201cisn\u2019t ready. You\u2019re still sore from Sunday\u2019s game. You\u2019re going to go out there and compete and give everything you have, because that\u2019s what you do. But your body just won\u2019t have as much to give as it would have had on a full week\u2019s rest.\u201d\n\nThat translates into games that may not be competitive. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen blowouts, sloppy play and games that have been almost unwatchable \u2014 and it\u2019s not the players\u2019 faults. Their bodies just aren\u2019t ready to play. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the Cowboys-Vikings game a couple of weeks ago was the best \u2018TNF\u2019 game we\u2019ve seen this season. You know why?

Kevin McCarthy, second in command among House Republicans, watched his party get trounced in the midterms, and was rewarded with a promotion to Republican leader. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer were quickly confirmed by their respective caucuses to stay in charge in the Senate. Yet Nancy Pelosi, who just engineered the biggest Democratic win in the House since the post-Watergate election of 1974, is the one facing a challenge to her leadership:\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday faced solid opposition from at least 17 Democrats and encountered a significant bloc of undecided women in her bid for speaker, setting the stage for an intense battle over who will ascend to one of the most powerful positions in Washington. After a campaign in which some Democrats prevailed in competitive districts by promising to oppose her, a coalition of incumbents and newly elected members have denied her a smooth path to the speakership. Those ranks could swell as more races are called.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly absurd about this is the fact that everyone \u2014 both her supporters and her opponents \u2014 agrees that not only does no one else have Pelosi\u2019s combination of skills and experience, but also that she might be the most effective congressional leader of the past half-century or so. The current speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, had to struggle to pass a tax cut through a Republican-led House; when Pelosi was speaker she passed cap and trade, a huge stimulus, banking reform, and a whole lot else besides. And of course, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the most important issue in the election we just had? It never would have passed in 2010, at a moment when other Democrats were ready to give up, had it not been for Pelosi\u2019s skill and determination. Seriously, look it up.\n\nPerhaps strangest of all is that she\u2019s facing a rebellion from people who don\u2019t seem to have much idea of who they\u2019d like to replace her with. Her opponents never claim that there\u2019s some other Democrat who would do a better job in the position than her, and seldom raise any substantive policy issue they disagree with her on either (though those leading the charge against her do tend to be more conservative Democrats). What they say instead is that she\u2019s a frequent target of Republican attacks, and it would therefore be better for the party if a different leader was chosen, one who could not be so easily demonized.\n\nThis argument was always weak, for the simple reason that Republicans will demonize anyone who leads the Democrats. Demonization is what they do. After a few months of relentless attacks on Fox News and conservative talk radio, Republican voters will be taught to despise even the most unobjectionable figure with an incandescent fury.\n\nBut it\u2019s an even sillier argument now. Republicans just spent a zillion dollars airing thousands of attack ads against Pelosi in races all over the country, and how did that work out for them? They got slaughtered, that\u2019s how.\n\nJust to be clear, I\u2019m not saying that Pelosi is above criticism. As a public performer, she\u2019s pretty mediocre (though I\u2019m told she understands this, which is why she rarely goes on the Sunday shows). Over recent years, she hasn\u2019t done enough to groom the next generation of Democratic leaders in the House. But you\u2019ll notice that when her opponents are asked why they want to replace her, all they can seem to come up with is \u201cIt\u2019s time for new leadership.\u201d Which means essentially nothing if you can\u2019t explain why some particular other leader would do a better job at the task of planning legislative strategy, keeping the caucus together on critical votes, and preparing the ground for a Democratic takeover of power, as Pelosi did when she was in exactly this position in 2006.\n\nDoes the rebellion have a chance to succeed? It does, but when you walk through the process of electing a speaker, it becomes clear how much of a task Pelosi\u2019s opponents have in front of them. The first stage is a vote within each party\u2019s caucus, at which one person will be selected to be the party\u2019s nominee. While there might be other Democrats who put themselves up \u2014 Rep. Marcia Fudge is considering it \u2014 the idea that one of them will be able to garner not a few dozen supporters but a majority of the 235 or so Democrats who will be in Congress come January seems all but impossible.\n\nWhen Pelosi and whomever the Republicans put up for speaker \u2014 presumably Kevin McCarthy \u2014 go to the floor for a vote, it\u2019s possible that enough Democrats will vote for someone else to deny Pelosi the majority. But they certainly aren\u2019t going to vote for McCarthy. So what happens then?\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that Pelosi doesn\u2019t need the votes of 218 of the 435 members to become speaker; she needs only a majority of those casting a vote on the floor, which wouldn\u2019t include those voting \u201cpresent,\u201d as members can do. That points a way toward what I suspect will be the final outcome here. Let\u2019s say that once the last few races still outstanding are settled, Democrats have a 235-200 margin in the House. Now imagine that Pelosi can persuade 20 of the members who at one time or another said they wouldn\u2019t support her to not cast a ballot for someone else but to vote \u201cpresent.\u201d That means the total number of votes would be 415, and Pelosi would need only 208 to win, meaning 27 Democrats could decline to support her and she could still become speaker.\n\nBut if no one gets a majority of the votes cast, they just keep voting over and over until someone does. Pelosi\u2019s opponents could be hoping that in a stalemate of repeated votes, Pelosi will step aside in favor of another Democrat who could get the support of the whole caucus. But that isn\u2019t really her style.\n\nThis is all a tricky business, and it will come down to who can do a better job of wrangling votes: Pelosi or a small group of conservative Democrats who have long opposed her. Who do you think is going to come out on top in that fight?\n\nBut let\u2019s return to where we started. Democrats have a complex task in front of them, figuring out how best to act as a single, determined force. They need to bring accountability to President Trump and his administration, promote their agenda for change, and position themselves for the moment, they hope two years from now, when they actually have the opportunity to implement it. At least some of them want to say to Pelosi, \u201cSorry, we know you\u2019re obviously the most capable person for the job and you just led us to a historic victory, but since the other side says nasty things about you, even though they don\u2019t seem to work we\u2019re going to pick someone else \u2014 anybody else, it doesn\u2019t really matter who.\u201d\n\nNo member of Congress has a divine right to a position of leadership. But if the anti-Pelosi side wants to force out one of the most successful leaders in their party\u2019s history, they really ought to come up with a better argument than that."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "How October\u2019s nine-figure federal deficit compares historically", "description": "It's another sign of surging annual deficits, something Trump excoriated before his election.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/15/how-octobers-nine-figure-federal-deficit-compares-historically/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fgN2RUiY79tArwTELq4X1hnI-4s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKKPPF4NUI6RB4SPBYZC5ZFB4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:05:50Z", "content": "During his pre-presidential period, when his contribution to the political discourse was made up almost entirely of tweeted criticism of Barack Obama, Donald Trump had a few consistent complaints.

He was mad at the trade disparity with China; he objected to Obama\u2019s efforts to curb climate change; he felt that Obama took too much time off.\n\nBut few complaints were as common as his stated frustration about the federal budget deficit and the debt to which it contributed.\n\nThe Debt is our nation's greatest threat. @BarackObama is out of touch. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2011\n\nIn 2011, he embraced the backronym \u201cTEA\u201d from the tea party -- \u201ctaxed enough already\u201d -- lamenting that President Obama had \u201camassed over $4 trillion in debt.\u201d On the campaign trail, the debt was a constant feature of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, complaining that the debt would top $20 trillion by the time Obama left office.\n\nIt didn\u2019t actually hit that level until Trump himself was president.\n\nAs president, Trump\u2019s aversion to deficits seems to have been quelled a bit. This week, the Treasury Department announced that the federal deficit in the month of October would exceed $100 billion, helping to contribute to what is expected to be an annual deficit topping $1 trillion.\n\nSo how does that stack up historically? How does any one month predict the rest of the year? Well, here. This is what the monthly deficit or surplus looks like going back to the start of the Clinton administration.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nIf the month has a deficit, the red line moves to the left. If the next month has a surplus, the blue-green line, starting from the end of the red one, moves back to the right. Where the last line ends in a fiscal year (which runs from October to September) is the cumulative deficit (or, rarely, surplus) for the year.\n\nThe strong economy during the administration of Bill Clinton meant an increase in tax revenue that helped power surpluses. That reversed with the recession early in George W. Bush\u2019s first term; in short order, the government was again running in the red.\n\nObama\u2019s first term coincided with massive deficits -- largely a function of government spending meant to soften the effects of the recession during which he was elected. By late in his second term, the annual deficit had dropped significantly.\n\nAnd then it started to go back up. During Trump\u2019s first full fiscal year as president, the deficit was the fifth-largest in history, topped only by those post-recession years in Obama\u2019s first term. This year, the deficit is projected to surpass $1 trillion, exceeding last year.\n\nThe October deficit itself wasn\u2019t unusually high. The deficit in October 2015, for example, was higher. Last year\u2019s would have been higher had Oct. 1 not fallen on a weekend, pushing some payments into September. But the trend to a higher annual deficit is expected to continue, in part thanks to decreased revenue from the tax cuts passed last December. The annual deficit during Trump\u2019s first three years in office will include two of the six largest figures in history -- and two that are not a response to a financial crisis that pushed spending higher.\n\nSomewhere, perhaps, the next president is angrily tweeting about how out of touch Trump is on matters of fiscal policy."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "German woman charged with Islamic State membership", "description": "Federal prosecutors say they've charged a 26-year-old German woman with membership in a terrorist organization on allegations she joined the extremist Islamic State", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/german-woman-charged-with-islamic-state-membership/2018/11/15/789a8e4c-e8df-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:05:14Z", "content": "BERLIN Federal prosecutors say theyve charged a 26-year-old German woman with membership in a terrorist organization on allegations she joined the extremist Islamic State.

(Eric Gay/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe Associated Press reports:\n\nThe Democratic Party says a $30 million investment in engaging Latino and other minority voters helped the Democrats achieve a net gain of 34 House seats and improve on 2014 turnout numbers. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that in early voting, compared to the previous midterm election, Latinos increased their participation by 174 percent in 2018 while Pacific Islanders increased their numbers by 218 percent and African-Americans by 157 percent. . . . The Hispanic community will have a record level of representation on Capitol Hill with at least 42 members: 34 Democrats and eight Republicans in both chambers. One House race featuring a Hispanic candidate has yet to be decided.\n\nThere are a few takeaways.\n\nFirst, the results should not be surprising considering the high level of Latino engagement before the election. Pew Research found just before the Nov. 6 vote:\n\nOverall, 52% of Latino registered voters say they have given the coming November election \u201cquite a lot\u201d of thought, a 16-percentage-point increase from what they said about the last midterm election in 2014. In addition, a majority (55%) of Latino registered voters in 2018 say they are more enthusiastic about voting compared with previous congressional elections . . . About six-in-ten Hispanic voters (62%) identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, compared with 27% who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party.\n\nPart of this is attributable to outreach to young Latino voters. (\u201cVoto Latino registered 202,339 young voters for 2018. Maria Teresa Kumar, the founding president, said the group\u2019s 58,000 registrations in Texas were 15 percent of all registrations.\u201d)\n\nSecond, this endeavor is expensive and cannot be accomplished in a single election cycle. (\u201cThe engagement effort included an investment of at least $21 million in Latino candidates and in 17 Spanish-language district specific ads.\u201d) Despite the gains for Latino voters, their percentage of the electorate (11 percent) was exactly the same in 2018. (According to Pew, \u201cmore than 29 million Latinos are eligible to vote nationwide in 2018, making up 12.8% of all eligible voters.\u201d) Efforts of groups such as UnidosUS (formerly National Council of La Raza) are critical, given that 1 million Latino voters turn 18 each year.\n\nThird, it is not clear how much of this gain we can attribute to Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.), who became a national phenomenon and who helped turnout Latino voters. In Texas, Latinos were 26 percent of the electorate, slightly up from 24 percent in 2016. Instead of plunging into a possible presidential run or running against the other Texas senator, John Cornyn, in 2020, O\u2019Rourke might consider doing a nationwide Latino and youth engagement effort. He would be building an electorate that he and his party could rely on for a generation.\n\nFourth, we also don\u2019t know how much Trump\u2019s virulent anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies (e.g., child separation, deporting \u201cdreamers\u201d) contributed to Latino turnout. If Trump is a primary reason for the bump in Latino voting, chances are he\u2019ll prove to be the gift that keeps on giving \u2014 to Democrats. There is no sign he\u2019s going to let up on his xenophobic appeals; indeed, he appears convinced that this message accounted for his big \u201csuccess\u201d (I know, it wasn\u2019t) on Election Day. By the same token, Trump will be around for a finite time, so this may be an ideal, but brief, interval to reel in Latino voters. He is undoubtedly one of the Democratic Party\u2019s greatest recruiting tools.\n\nFinally, success should build on success. One critical factor in increasing nonwhite voter participation is having diverse candidates to vote for. That certainly happened in 2018. A look at the photos of the incoming class of representatives shows a dramatic difference between the parties. Last weekend, David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report tweeted, \u201cStaggering: if every uncalled race breaks as I expect, House Dems\u2019 class of 61 freshmen would include *35* women & just 19 white men. By contrast, Republicans\u2019 class of 31 would include 29 white men & just *one* woman.\u201d As Latino Democrats elected to Congress go back to their districts, they\u2019ll be seeking not only to grab a larger share of the existing Latino vote but also to increase political involvement, expand the Latino electorate and recruit more Latino candidates to run at all levels of government.\n\nSadly, all this contrasts with the GOP, which is becoming more dependent on white, older and rural voters and is losing women and nonwhite office holders. Appeals to white grievance and chicanery to keep minority voting low won\u2019t be enough. (It was barely enough in Georgia for Brian Kemp, who currently leads in a race against Stacey Abrams that has yet to be called.) As Congress begins to look more like America, Republicans look less like America. And that\u2019s a problem for the GOP and for America."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Caitlin Gibson", "title": "\u2018Cry It Out\u2019 offers an unflinching look at the painful choices new parents face", "description": "\u201cThe most dramatic moment of my life was when I had to leave my daughter and go back to work,\u201d says playwright Molly Smith Metzler.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/theater-dance/cry-it-out-offers-an-unflinching-look-at-the-painful-choices-new-parents-face/2018/11/14/6c89ce1e-e44e-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T14:00:00Z", "content": "Playwright Molly Smith Metzler was seven months pregnant when she moved with her husband to Long Island in the summer of 2012.

(Daniel Corey)\n\nPlaywright Molly Smith Metzler was seven months pregnant when she moved with her husband to Long Island in the summer of 2012. She was struck by her new seaside home \u2014 a socioeconomic melting pot where working-class families in rental units lived below posh cliffside mansions owned by New York\u2019s glitterati \u2014 and right away, she knew: She had to write about this place.\n\nThen her daughter, Cora, was born, and her husband returned to work, and Metzler found herself spending long days alone at home \u2014 without a car, without a job and without a social circle, as a bitterly cold winter settled over the island. And the story brewing inside her began to change.\n\n\u201cMy plays are always about class, so that much was clear,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know, before Cora was born, was how much I was going to have to say about motherhood.\u201d\n\nThat defining period of her life became the inspiration for \u201cCry It Out,\u201d Metzler\u2019s poignant comedy about three women and one man fumbling their way through the fog of new parenthood in the frigid coastal hamlet of Port Washington on Long Island\u2019s north shore. The play made its area debut at Studio Theatre this week.\n\n\u201cAs a playwright, our job is to find moments of incredible drama in people\u2019s lives and then put them onstage,\u201d Metzler says. \u201cAnd I can tell you for a fact that the most dramatic moment of my life was when I had to leave my daughter and go back to work.\u201d\n\nBefore she had Cora, Metzler says, there were certain questions she couldn\u2019t have fully fathomed: when to work again, whether to work again, how to balance a career with a child, and how a family\u2019s financial status affects absolutely everything about those choices.\n\n\u201cI looked into my options in Port Washington for child care, and the option that I could afford was to leave her in a basement apartment with six other babies who were in carseats, and I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m not doing this, I\u2019d rather eat ramen,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIt was very eye-opening for me that one mile away was the most dreamy day-care situation you could ever imagine, that cost $45,000 a year. And the people who lived above me on the cliff could take their children there. How did no one warn me that this was going to rip my heart out of my chest?\u201d\n\n\n\nPlaywright Molly Smith Metzler. (Carolyn Fong)\n\nMetzler ultimately returned to work full-time when her daughter was a toddler, and her career soon took off. Her plays have been produced off-Broadway and in theaters across the country, and she has also written for television, including Hulu\u2019s \u201cCasual,\u201d Showtime\u2019s \u201cShameless\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d on Netflix.\n\nAs Metzler\u2019s work grew more demanding, she says, she often struggled with juggling her profession and her parenting. So \u201cCry It Out\u201d still resonates deeply, to the point that Metzler can\u2019t quite bring herself to sit through the final scene, when the main character makes a tough decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always very reluctant to put myself in a play, but in \u2018Cry It Out,\u2019 I am all four of these characters,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re all me, but they\u2019re also all of the parents I came to know very well.\u201d\n\nBefore there was a play, there was a journal.\n\n\u201cI had no friends, no job, no nothing, and I had a newborn, and I had to figure out postpartum life completely alone,\u201d Metzler recalls. \u201cWhat I did do was write everything down. And I mean everything.\u201d\n\nHer writing chronicled both the aching isolation of being home with an infant, no car and a tight budget, and the salvation that came when Metzler ultimately made a friend \u2014 another new mom who offered commiseration and a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cShe saved my life,\u201d Metzler says. \u201cShe got me out, she introduced me to the things in that community that were free that I could enjoy, like story time at the library, or we\u2019d go to the YMCA and let the babies watch basketball. There was a church playgroup that you could go to for one dollar.\u201d\n\nThey made a lasting bond, and Metzler says she thinks of her friend every time she watches their story play out onstage.\n\n\u201cI always text her afterward and tell her I love her,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the heart of the play is a looming, impossible question: What is the right choice, the right balance between self and sacrifice \u2014 for a parent, a child, a family?\n\nBut don\u2019t expect a tidy resolution on Metzler\u2019s stage.\n\n\u201cWhat are parents supposed to do? I felt I couldn\u2019t answer that question, because I don\u2019t have the answer.

And he continues to insist publicly that Trump would never fire Mueller so the whole issue is moot.\n\n-- Some lawmakers hope they might be able to include language protecting the special counsel in an end-of-year spending bill that must pass. They argue that Trump would be hard pressed to veto such a package. But they probably underestimate how determined Trump is to avoid giving Mueller such a safeguard.\n\n-- Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said yesterday that McConnell has \u201cmade a commitment\u201d that he will not let the Senate leave for the year without clearing the deck of all pending judicial nominees, even if that means forcing the Senate to stay in session on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve. Cotton even told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he thinks the GOP can push through Neomi Rao, who Trump just nominated on Tuesday to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit, before the end of the year. It\u2019s the second most important court in the country because of the nature of the cases that wind up there. As a top official at OMB, Rao is a leading architect of Trump\u2019s effort to consolidate power at the White House, deconstruct the administrative state and reduce the independence of rulemaking agencies to make them more beholden to the president.\n\n\u201cRegardless, when we come back in January, we\u2019re going to have two more senators,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be 51-49.

He\u2019s spoken out repeatedly against what he sees as a stream of unconstitutional moves by his wife\u2019s boss. \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse,\u201d says the group\u2019s mission statement. \u201cWe believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power.

Most of the charter members of Checks and Balances are also members in good standing of FedSoc, as it\u2019s known by everyone who goes. Lori Meyer, one of the signatories, is even married to Federalist Society President Eugene Meyer. They all remain committed to the conservative cause, and they say they want to stimulate a discussion among conservatives during the next few days.\n\nThe Federalist Society has long wielded immense influence in GOP politics, but it\u2019s at the apex of its power in the Trump era because the neophyte president has given the group\u2019s leaders an outsized role in the judicial selection process. The membership list isn\u2019t public, but it seems reasonable to guess that most, if not all, of the people on Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court nominees are part of the group.\n\n-- The agenda for the conference underscores the coziness between the Trump administration and the Federalist Society. Indeed, most of the people on Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court picks, who he might still nominate if he gets to choose a third justice, have prominent speaking roles. Among them:\n\nSen.

The conference will conclude Saturday afternoon with a panel discussion on John Marshall that will be moderated by William Pryor of the 11th Circuit. Pryor was another of the finalists last year for the slot that Neil Gorusch got and then this year for the opening that went to Kavanaugh.\n\n-- This is an ironic finale because Marshall, as chief justice, penned the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison that established the principle of judicial review. It\u2019s a cornerstone of the American system. But Matt Whitaker, the acting attorney general Trump elevated to replace Sessions last week, called Marbury one of the worst decisions in Supreme Court history in 2014. As Ruth Marcus wrote last week, \u201cThis is lunacy. For any lawyer \u2014 certainly for one now at the helm of the Justice Department \u2014 to disagree with Marbury is like a physicist denouncing the laws of gravity.\u201d\n\nActing attorney general Matt Whitaker attends a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S MAIN MAN AT JUSTICE:\n\n-- Matt Whitaker\u2019s scattershot resume makes him the Trump administration\u2019s latest unusual appointment to a key post. Shawn Boburg and Robert O'Harrow Jr. report: \u201cOver the past two decades, Whitaker ... has owned a day-care center, a concrete supply business and a trailer manufacturer, state records show. He led a taxpayer-subsidized effort to build affordable housing in Des Moines, but he walked away from the stalled project two years ago after the city threatened him with a lawsuit. In 2004, when he started a five-year stint as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Iowa, Whitaker cited a personal-injury case and a dispute involving a dry-cleaning business as some of his most consequential legal work. When he left office, he started a modest legal practice and a short-lived lobbying and consulting firm. Whitaker, 49, stands in vivid contrast to his predecessors, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s typically boast judgeships, partnerships at prestigious firms and senior roles in the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n-- Whitaker received early fraud complaints against an invention-marketing company he advised, but continued to defend the company and remained on its board. Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \u201cSince [his appointment], Whitaker has said through a Justice Department spokeswoman that he was unaware of allegedly fraudulent activities at Miami-based World Patent Marketing. \u2026 As a member of the company\u2019s advisory board, Whitaker had been told of complaints about the company\u2019s practices, according to two people familiar with the FTC investigation. He did not appear to take any action in response, they said. In addition, shortly after joining the board in late 2014, Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, personally intervened when a for-profit consumer complaint website posted comments critical of the company.\u201d\n\n-- Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics and a big Trump critic, called the firing of Jeff Sessions and Whitaker\u2019s appointment to replace him parts of a \u201cpiecemeal Saturday Night Massacre.\u201d From an op-ed for Slate: \u201c[Trump] first fired FBI Director James Comey last year for his handling of the Russia probe, then he fired the attorney general for failing to protect him from the Russia probe. His intent to undermine an investigation of his campaign has been clear throughout\u2014he barely tried to hide it\u2014but the difference this time is that he has acted with impunity. What comes next could be anything.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone speaks to reporters after appearing before a closed House Intelligence Committee hearing. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Roger Stone provided text conversations with his then-friend, radio host Randy Credico, showing the pair discussed WikiLeaks days before the website started releasing emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. NBC News\u2019s Anna Schecter reports: \u201c\u2018Big news Wednesday,\u2019 [Credico] wrote on Oct. 1, 2016, according to the text messages provided by Stone. \u2018Now pretend u don\u2019t know me.\u2019 \u2018U died 5 years ago,\u2019 Stone replied. \u2018Great,\u2019 Credico wrote back. \u2018Hillary\u2019s campaign will die this week.\u2019 Credico turned out to be wrong on one count \u2014 nothing incriminating about Clinton came out that Wednesday. But two days later, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released its first dump of emails stolen from Podesta, altering the trajectory of the 2016 presidential election. \u2026\n\n\u201c[The texts] show that Credico appeared to be providing regular updates to Stone on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s plans in the days before the hacked emails were released. In the texts, Credico told Stone he had insights into Assange's plans through a longtime friend, who was also Assange\u2019s lawyer, according to the text messages. \u2026 Stone said the messages support the story he's been telling all along. \u2018These text messages prove beyond dispute that Randy Credico was the source who told me of the significance of the material that Julian Assange told CNN he had and would publish in June 2016 and that Credico\u2019s source was indeed a woman attorney who worked for WikiLeaks,\u2019 Stone said. \u2018If Randy said anything different to the grand jury, he perjured himself under oath.\u2019\u201d Credico insisted the texts do not prove he had any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019s plans.\n\n-- Mueller is investigating whether Stone engaged in witness intimidation against Credico. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shelby Holliday and Aruna Viswanatha report: \u201cIn grand jury sessions and interviews, prosecutors have repeatedly asked about emails, text messages and online posts involving Mr. Stone and [Credico] \u2026 Filmmaker David Lugo, who knows both men, said in an interview he has testified before [Mueller\u2019s] grand jury about a blog post Mr. Stone helped him draft that was harshly critical of Mr. Credico. Another witness, businessman Bill Samuels, said he was questioned by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team about Mr. Credico\u2019s reaction to allegedly threatening messages sent by Mr. Stone.\u201d\n\n-- Continuing fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal --> \u201cDelay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis,\u201d by the New York Times\u2019s Sheera Frenkel, Nicholas Confessore, Cecilia Kang, Matthew Rosenberg and Jack Nicas: \u201cWhen Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem. And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack. While [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, [COO Sheryl] Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh. (Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Saudi Arabia said it had indicted 11 people in the killing of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi and would seek the death penalty against five of them for allegedly defying orders to bring him home alive. Kareem Fahim and Zakaria Zakaria report: \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had no knowledge of the operation, Shaalan al-Shaalan, a spokesman for the [public] prosecutor, said during a news conference in Riyadh \u2026 The order to kill [Khashoggi] had come from the leader of the Saudi team in Istanbul, Shaalan said, without naming any of the suspects. Prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the murder was authorized by a minor official \u2014 contradicted assertions by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has said that the orders to kill Khashoggi had come from \u2018the highest levels of the Saudi government,\u2019 without specifying exactly who was responsible. ... Officials in several countries have said it is unlikely Khashoggi could have been killed without the knowledge of [the crown prince].\"\n\n-- Stormy Daniels\u2019s lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, allegations that he called \u201ccompletely bogus.\u201d Elise Viebeck and Eli Rosenberg report: \u201cThe Los Angeles Police Department said he was booked on a felony domestic violence charge, with a $50,000 bail. \u2018This is an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available,\u2019 the department wrote on Twitter. The incident happened Tuesday, department spokesman Jeff Lee said. \u2026 \u2018I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated,\u2019 [Avenatti said in a statement]. TMZ, which first reported the arrest, had written that Avenatti was arrested after his \u2018estranged wife\u2019 filed a felony domestic violence report, but later amended its story after his ex-wife, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, said through a lawyer that the assertion was not true.\u201d\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab waits at E.U. headquarters in Brussels.

Raab\u2019s departure raises the possibility that May won't nab the necessary support to pursue a slower-moving Brexit deal that has drawn criticism from many U.K. citizens. Esther McVey, May's work and pensions secretary, announced her own resignation shortly after Raab quit.

(Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel is leaving the White House for \u201ca new role within the Administration\u201d after a very public spat with Melania Trump that began with the first lady\u2019s Africa trip last month. Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey and Emily Heil have an incredible play-by-by of how Ricardel\u2019s departure came to pass: \u201cAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, [Ricardel] became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath. Policy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt. \u2026\n\n\u201cBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing. \u2026 Soon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused. Bolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\u201d Amazingly, Melania Trump and Ricardel have never met, several people said.\n\n-- Lawyers for Trump and CNN appeared in federal court to make their arguments about the revocation of Jim Acosta\u2019s White House pass. Paul Farhi reports: \u201cThe judge overseeing a lawsuit brought by CNN said he would decide by Thursday afternoon whether to grant CNN\u2019s motion for a restraining order that would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s access to the White House. \u2026 Precisely who made the decision to bar Acosta was unclear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Justice Department attorney James Burnham, representing the White House, said he didn\u2019t know who made that call when asked by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly. Burnham argued, however, that the president could exclude any reporter from the White House\u2019s grounds, just as he has the right to exclude them from interviews in the Oval Office or to ignore their questions during news conferences. \u2026 [CNN lawyer Ted Boutrous] said the government had \u2018a warped view\u2019 of journalism and due process.\u201d\n\n-- Fox News filed an amicus brief in support of CNN. \u201cSecret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\u201d Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\u201d (LA Times)\n\n-- Trump continued to berate Acosta as his administration spoke out against efforts abroad to stifle the press and political dissidents. David Nakamura reports: \u201cAcosta and others like him are \u2018bad for the country,\u2019 Trump told a conservative news outlet. In a fundraising email, his campaign highlighted Trump\u2019s move last week to strip Acosta\u2019s White House pass and declared that the president \u2018will NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect.\u2019 \u2026 In Singapore on Wednesday, Vice President Pence told Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to release two Reuters journalists jailed for covering brutal ethnic violence against the minority Rohingya Muslims. At the State Department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert called on Chinese leaders to respect \u2018fundamental freedoms\u2019 amid a crackdown on political activism in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n-- A long profile of Donald Trump Jr. just posted by David Fahrenthold and Jonathan O\u2019Connell: \u201cFrom Rebellious to Reliable.\u201d\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Trump announced his support of a bipartisan Senate bill to overhaul the nation\u2019s prison sentencing laws. Seung Min Kim reports: \u201cAt an afternoon event at the White House, Trump officially endorsed the First Step Act, which he said included \u2018reasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets.\u2019 He urged lawmakers to send him a bill, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll be waiting with a pen.\u2019 \u2026 The new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u2018three strikes\u2019 penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats. It also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate in favor of the compromise, although advocates are optimistic that with Trump\u2019s endorsement giving cover to Republicans, they can reach that threshold.\u201d\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will soon release a rewrite of rules outlining how colleges and universities must respond to sexual assault allegations, with an emphasis on bolstering the rights of the accused. Laura Meckler reports: \u201cThe new rules would reduce liability for universities, tighten the definition of sexual harassment, and allow schools to use a higher standard in evaluating claims of sexual harassment and assault. \u2026 Last year, DeVos rescinded the 2011 Obama guidance, denouncing it as overly prescriptive and lacking due process for the accused. She promised to write a regulation to replace it. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe most significant change would guarantee the accused the right to cross-examine their accusers, though that would have to be conducted by advisers or attorneys for the people involved, rather than by the person accused of misconduct.\u201d\n\n-- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended Trump\u2019s \u201cabsolutely legal\u201d deployment of U.S. troops to the southern border while visiting some of the service members there. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Vera Bergengruen reports: \u201c\u2018The eyes of the world right now, certainly of all the Americans, are on you,\u2019 he told a gathering of troops stationed near the Texas town of Donna near the border with Mexico ... \u2018This is a mission that\u2019s nontraditional because it\u2019s here in our country. Generally, we do homeland security overseas.\u2019 \u2026 He then echoed the Trump administration\u2019s talking points in a way that seemed unusual for the typically calculated and camera-shy Pentagon chief, who has said little publicly about the deployment amid rumors that the president is looking to replace him.\u201d\n\n-- The Pentagon ordered senior military leaders several months ago to cut back on public appearances. Defense One\u2019s Kevin Baron reports: \u201cThe new rule: only one senior military leader and one civilian leader are allowed to appear at each \u2018outside\u2019 non-government events, per day. Leaders must coordinate their appearances through a central DOD personnel management office and must seek waivers to break the one-per-day rule. The directive has changed how defense leaders participate in nearly every kind of public event, from global policy conferences to intimate academic panel discussions to on-camera press interviews. \u2026 [Some critics] called the rule a blatant attempt to keep the military quiet and avoid drawing attention, or conflict, with the president.\u201d\n\n-- The Senate will hold a confirmation hearing today for Ron Vitiello, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead ICE. From Maria Sacchetti: \u201cVitiello, a 30-year Border Patrol veteran, is ICE\u2019s acting director. Trump tapped him in August to replace Thomas D.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP RACES:\n\n-- Critics of Nancy Pelosi appear to be consolidating their power as a potential challenger arose in the California Democrat\u2019s speakership bid. Erica Werner, Mike DeBonis and Elise Viebeck report: \u201cPelosi on Wednesday faced solid opposition from at least 17 Democrats \u2026 Those ranks could swell as more races are called. \u2026 The defections, if they stand, would leave Pelosi several votes short of the 218 she would need when the full House votes for speaker Jan. 3. \u2026 Pelosi and her allies worked furiously Wednesday, rolling out endorsements from several major unions while she made her case to the Congressional Black Caucus, a crucial bloc. At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats, a newly elected lawmaker from Pelosi\u2019s home state shut down an attempted rules change advanced by one of her critics.\n\n\u201cPelosi, who has led the Democrats for more than 15 years, has put her gender front and center in the campaign, arguing that a woman must be at the table to do business with [Trump] and male congressional leaders. \u2026 But some of [the women Pelosi campaigned for] were unwilling Wednesday to say definitively that they would back Pelosi \u2014 despite suggestions from some of her allies that it would be an insult to female voters to do anything less. \u2026 [Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Tex.), a Pelosi critic,] said there are several women in the caucus who would be well-prepared to take the reins, among them Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (Ohio), who told reporters that she\u2019s being encouraged to stand for speaker if Pelosi doesn\u2019t have the votes. \u2018I\u2019ve not talked to any of the new members. I\u2019m not sure that I will. But I think that if in fact we were elected on change, then we should have change,\u2019 Fudge said.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) easily defeated a challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to become minority leader. Felicia Sonmez, Elise Viebeck and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cMcCarthy prevailed over [Jordan], 159 to 43 \u2026 \u2018We took a beating inside the suburban areas. We\u2019re going to have to work harder,\u2019 McCarthy said at a news conference following Wednesday\u2019s vote, acknowledging Republican losses. \u2026 The No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed Wednesday by Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. \u2026 [Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.)], who first won election in 2016 and is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney, won the No. 3 spot of House Republican Conference chair.\u201d\n\n-- Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were both reelected to lead their parties in the Senate. John Wagner and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cRepublicans, meeting behind closed doors, selected Sen. John Thune (S.D.) as the majority whip. ... Thune succeeds Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) in the No. 2 GOP slot. Cornyn was term-limited. \u2026 Besides maintaining Schumer as minority leader, Senate Democrats also decided Wednesday to keep the rest of their leadership team in place, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings. That includes Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) as minority whip and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as assistant minority leader.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He\u2019s succeeding Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner, who is up for reelection in 2020. Roll Call\u2019s Niels Lesniewski reports on the other side: \u201cThe Democrats do not elect the leader of their party campaign committee. Instead, [Schumer] gets to make an appointment to the post. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto appears to be the most desired candidate for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The Democrat from Nevada was elected in 2016, and the state Democratic party in the Silver State has been among the most successful in recent election cycles.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators gather outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections headquarters during the vote recount for three statewide races in Lauderhill, Fla. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nFLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA:\n\n-- A federal judge extended the deadline for voters whose ballots were rejected due to signature inconsistencies to resolve the issues and possibly get their votes counted. Sean Sullivan, Beth Reinhard and Amy Gardner report: \u201cThe decision by Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee came hours ahead of the Thursday afternoon deadline for elections officials to complete a machine recount. Early Thursday, officials in Broward County finished their count and prepared to release a new vote total for Florida\u2019s second-largest jurisdiction. It was not clear how the judge\u2019s decision would affect the timing of recount, which was expected to move to a manual canvass Friday in the too-close-to-call Senate race, in which Gov. Rick Scott (R) leads Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by fewer than 13,000 votes.\n\n\u201cThe decision affects Floridians who cast mail-in ballots, or voted provisionally, but whose signatures did not match records maintained by state officials. More than 4,000 ballots across 45 counties in Florida were set aside because of inconsistent signatures, he wrote in his opinion. In the other 22 counties, the number is unknown. While the ruling gives Nelson new hope for chipping away at his deficit, it falls short of the more sweeping decision his lawyers sought and is probably not enough to change the outcome of the race on its own.\u201d\n\n-- The Florida lawsuits have shone a spotlight on voting laws that require ballot signatures to match existing records. Amy Gardner reports: \u201cVoter signatures have taken on outsize importance because they are typically required on absentee and mail-in ballots, which more and more Americans are using to vote. \u2026 The issue is acute in close races where absentee ballots could sway the outcome \u2014 and in states where voting by mail has exploded without a standardized system for checking the validity of a signature, the most common way to verify that a mail-in ballot is legal. All of it has created an uproar among voting-rights advocates, who say that untrained election workers are tossing eligible ballots, often with no chance for the voter to object or fix the ballot.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cFor all its dim echoes of the 2000 Bush vs. Gore election recount saga, the daily follies are, in many respects, a dry run for the next presidential contest,\u201d Manuel Roig-Franzia reports. \u201cIt is an opportunity for partisan lawyers to burrow into the arcana of the process in hopes of tweaking the rules in their favor and for activists to sharpen their rhetoric for the next fight.\u201d\n\n-- Trump offered two false assertions about voter fraud, including suggesting you need to present an ID to buy cereal \u2014 and that voter fraud can easily occur when a voter leaves the polling station to change their hat. \u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on,\u201d Trump told the Daily Caller. He added, \u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2014 you have a voter ID. They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.\u201d (Philip Bump)\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp speaks during a news conference as Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal listens in the Governor's ceremonial office at the Capitol in Atlanta. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP)\n\nMORE RESULTS COMING IN:\n\n-- A Georgia federal judge ruled that absentee ballots with minor discrepancies must be counted in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race, as Democrat Stacey Abrams continues to insist she can force a runoff against Republican Brian Kemp. But it was not immediately clear how many ballots would be affected by the judge\u2019s ruling. Vanessa Williams reports: \u201cKemp, a Republican whose lead has shrunk a bit each day since the Nov. 6 election, continued to demand that [Abrams] concede, arguing that there are not enough outstanding votes for her to force a runoff. \u2026 Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, accused Kemp, the former secretary of state, of using that office \u201cas a taxpayer-funded arm of his campaign.\u2019 \u2026 On Wednesday, the campaign said Abrams needed more than 17,700 additional votes to force a runoff or more than 15,400 to force a recount. The secretary of state could certify the results Friday.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) is suing the Salt Lake County Clerk, demanding that her campaign be allowed to verify voter signatures on ballots. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cAs of Wednesday evening, Love was trailing Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams (D) by 873 votes, or 0.36 percentage point, in the race for Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District. \u2026 In the lawsuit, \u2026 Love\u2019s campaign argues that the Salt Lake County clerk has allowed poll monitors to observe the ballot-counting process but has denied them the ability to challenge signatures on ballot envelopes. \u2026 McAdams denounced Love\u2019s move, saying, \u2018Utah voters deserve better than this.\u2019 He took aim at the fact that her lawsuit targets Salt Lake County, McAdams\u2019s home base.\u201d\n\n-- Democrat Andy Kim was officially declared the winner against Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who revived GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. Bloomberg News\u2019s Sahil Kapur reports: \u201cIn 2017, MacArthur co-authored an amendment to the Republican Obamacare replacement bill with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows that handed Democrats a potent campaign weapon. The measure allowed states to waive Obamacare rules prohibiting insurers from charging sick people more. Party leaders reluctantly adopted it to win conservative holdouts who tanked an earlier version of their bill \u2014 and it passed the House.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump insisted the White House was running \u201cvery smoothly\u201d amid many reports of internal turmoil:\n\nThe White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) announced Wednesday that he won\u2019t support any of President Trump\u2019s 32 pending judicial nominees during the lame-duck session unless he gets a vote on his legislation that would allow special counsel Bob Mueller to appeal to a three-judge panel if he gets fired. Flake, retiring next month, made the threat after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a bipartisan effort to bring the bill up for consideration on the floor.\n\nRepublicans have 51 seats right now, which means they could still confirm these judges to lifetime appointments if Flake defects because Vice President Pence can cast the tie-breaking vote. Flake\u2019s move now puts the spotlight on GOP senators who have said Mueller should be allowed to do his work without interference, such as Maine\u2019s Susan Collins \u2014 who said last week that there should be a vote on the bill after Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with an outspoken critic of the probe.\n\n\u201cThe president now has this investigation in his sights, and we all know it,\u201d Flake said in a speech on the Senate floor. \u201cWhy?!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2018\n\n-- McConnell is up for reelection this cycle in Kentucky, where Trump is more popular than him, which could make him even more reluctant to poke the president during the next Congress than he has been over the past two years. He has argued to his colleagues that the GOP-controlled House won\u2019t pass the bill during the lame duck, and Trump would certainly veto it even if they did. And he continues to insist publicly that Trump would never fire Mueller so the whole issue is moot.\n\n-- Some lawmakers hope they might be able to include language protecting the special counsel in an end-of-year spending bill that must pass. They argue that Trump would be hard pressed to veto such a package. But they probably underestimate how determined Trump is to avoid giving Mueller such a safeguard.\n\n-- Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said yesterday that McConnell has \u201cmade a commitment\u201d that he will not let the Senate leave for the year without clearing the deck of all pending judicial nominees, even if that means forcing the Senate to stay in session on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve. Cotton even told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he thinks the GOP can push through Neomi Rao, who Trump just nominated on Tuesday to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the D.C. Circuit, before the end of the year. It\u2019s the second most important court in the country because of the nature of the cases that wind up there. As a top official at OMB, Rao is a leading architect of Trump\u2019s effort to consolidate power at the White House, deconstruct the administrative state and reduce the independence of rulemaking agencies to make them more beholden to the president.\n\n\u201cRegardless, when we come back in January, we\u2019re going to have two more senators,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be 51-49. We\u2019re going to be at 53-47, and we\u2019ll start once again confirming judges as soon as the president sends them up.\u201d\n\n-- Meanwhile, several prominent attorneys on the right unveiled a new group yesterday called \u201cChecks and Balances\u201d to reaffirm the conservative movements\u2019 support for the rule of law \u2014 which they believe is both under assault by the Trump administration and being ignored by many of their fellow travelers who they believe have prioritized power over principle.\n\nThe lead organizer of this new coalition is George Conway, the husband of White House counselor and former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. He\u2019s spoken out repeatedly against what he sees as a stream of unconstitutional moves by his wife\u2019s boss. \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, the power of truth, the independence of the criminal justice system, the imperative of individual rights and the necessity of civil discourse,\u201d says the group\u2019s mission statement. \u201cWe believe these principles apply regardless of the party or persons in power.

It\u2019s the hottest event of the year on the conservative legal calendar. Most of the charter members of Checks and Balances are also members in good standing of FedSoc, as it\u2019s known by everyone who goes. Lori Meyer, one of the signatories, is even married to Federalist Society President Eugene Meyer. They all remain committed to the conservative cause, and they say they want to stimulate a discussion among conservatives during the next few days.\n\nThe Federalist Society has long wielded immense influence in GOP politics, but it\u2019s at the apex of its power in the Trump era because the neophyte president has given the group\u2019s leaders an outsized role in the judicial selection process. The membership list isn\u2019t public, but it seems reasonable to guess that most, if not all, of the people on Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court nominees are part of the group.\n\n-- The agenda for the conference underscores the coziness between the Trump administration and the Federalist Society.

Shawn Boburg and Robert O'Harrow Jr. report: \u201cOver the past two decades, Whitaker ... has owned a day-care center, a concrete supply business and a trailer manufacturer, state records show. He led a taxpayer-subsidized effort to build affordable housing in Des Moines, but he walked away from the stalled project two years ago after the city threatened him with a lawsuit. In 2004, when he started a five-year stint as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Iowa, Whitaker cited a personal-injury case and a dispute involving a dry-cleaning business as some of his most consequential legal work. When he left office, he started a modest legal practice and a short-lived lobbying and consulting firm. Whitaker, 49, stands in vivid contrast to his predecessors, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s typically boast judgeships, partnerships at prestigious firms and senior roles in the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n-- Whitaker received early fraud complaints against an invention-marketing company he advised, but continued to defend the company and remained on its board. Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig and Rosalind S. Helderman report: \u201cSince [his appointment], Whitaker has said through a Justice Department spokeswoman that he was unaware of allegedly fraudulent activities at Miami-based World Patent Marketing. \u2026 As a member of the company\u2019s advisory board, Whitaker had been told of complaints about the company\u2019s practices, according to two people familiar with the FTC investigation. He did not appear to take any action in response, they said. In addition, shortly after joining the board in late 2014, Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, personally intervened when a for-profit consumer complaint website posted comments critical of the company.\u201d\n\n-- Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics and a big Trump critic, called the firing of Jeff Sessions and Whitaker\u2019s appointment to replace him parts of a \u201cpiecemeal Saturday Night Massacre.\u201d From an op-ed for Slate: \u201c[Trump] first fired FBI Director James Comey last year for his handling of the Russia probe, then he fired the attorney general for failing to protect him from the Russia probe. His intent to undermine an investigation of his campaign has been clear throughout\u2014he barely tried to hide it\u2014but the difference this time is that he has acted with impunity. What comes next could be anything.\u201d\n\nRoger Stone speaks to reporters after appearing before a closed House Intelligence Committee hearing. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Roger Stone provided text conversations with his then-friend, radio host Randy Credico, showing the pair discussed WikiLeaks days before the website started releasing emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. NBC News\u2019s Anna Schecter reports: \u201c\u2018Big news Wednesday,\u2019 [Credico] wrote on Oct. 1, 2016, according to the text messages provided by Stone. \u2018Now pretend u don\u2019t know me.\u2019 \u2018U died 5 years ago,\u2019 Stone replied. \u2018Great,\u2019 Credico wrote back. \u2018Hillary\u2019s campaign will die this week.\u2019 Credico turned out to be wrong on one count \u2014 nothing incriminating about Clinton came out that Wednesday. But two days later, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released its first dump of emails stolen from Podesta, altering the trajectory of the 2016 presidential election. \u2026\n\n\u201c[The texts] show that Credico appeared to be providing regular updates to Stone on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s plans in the days before the hacked emails were released. In the texts, Credico told Stone he had insights into Assange's plans through a longtime friend, who was also Assange\u2019s lawyer, according to the text messages. \u2026 Stone said the messages support the story he's been telling all along. \u2018These text messages prove beyond dispute that Randy Credico was the source who told me of the significance of the material that Julian Assange told CNN he had and would publish in June 2016 and that Credico\u2019s source was indeed a woman attorney who worked for WikiLeaks,\u2019 Stone said. \u2018If Randy said anything different to the grand jury, he perjured himself under oath.\u2019\u201d Credico insisted the texts do not prove he had any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019s plans.\n\n-- Mueller is investigating whether Stone engaged in witness intimidation against Credico. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shelby Holliday and Aruna Viswanatha report: \u201cIn grand jury sessions and interviews, prosecutors have repeatedly asked about emails, text messages and online posts involving Mr. Stone and [Credico] \u2026 Filmmaker David Lugo, who knows both men, said in an interview he has testified before [Mueller\u2019s] grand jury about a blog post Mr. Stone helped him draft that was harshly critical of Mr. Credico. Another witness, businessman Bill Samuels, said he was questioned by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team about Mr. Credico\u2019s reaction to allegedly threatening messages sent by Mr. Stone.\u201d\n\n-- Continuing fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal --> \u201cDelay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis,\u201d by the New York Times\u2019s Sheera Frenkel, Nicholas Confessore, Cecilia Kang, Matthew Rosenberg and Jack Nicas: \u201cWhen Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem. And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack. While [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, [COO Sheryl] Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.

Kareem Fahim and Zakaria Zakaria report: \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had no knowledge of the operation, Shaalan al-Shaalan, a spokesman for the [public] prosecutor, said during a news conference in Riyadh \u2026 The order to kill [Khashoggi] had come from the leader of the Saudi team in Istanbul, Shaalan said, without naming any of the suspects. Prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the murder was authorized by a minor official \u2014 contradicted assertions by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has said that the orders to kill Khashoggi had come from \u2018the highest levels of the Saudi government,\u2019 without specifying exactly who was responsible. ... Officials in several countries have said it is unlikely Khashoggi could have been killed without the knowledge of [the crown prince].\"\n\n-- Stormy Daniels\u2019s lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, allegations that he called \u201ccompletely bogus.\u201d Elise Viebeck and Eli Rosenberg report: \u201cThe Los Angeles Police Department said he was booked on a felony domestic violence charge, with a $50,000 bail. \u2018This is an ongoing investigation and we will provide more details as they become available,\u2019 the department wrote on Twitter. The incident happened Tuesday, department spokesman Jeff Lee said. \u2026 \u2018I have never been physically abusive in my life nor was I last night. Any accusations to the contrary are fabricated and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated,\u2019 [Avenatti said in a statement]. TMZ, which first reported the arrest, had written that Avenatti was arrested after his \u2018estranged wife\u2019 filed a felony domestic violence report, but later amended its story after his ex-wife, Lisa Storie-Avenatti, said through a lawyer that the assertion was not true.\u201d\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab waits at E.U. headquarters in Brussels.

(Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel is leaving the White House for \u201ca new role within the Administration\u201d after a very public spat with Melania Trump that began with the first lady\u2019s Africa trip last month. Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey and Emily Heil have an incredible play-by-by of how Ricardel\u2019s departure came to pass: \u201cAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, [Ricardel] became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath. Policy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt. \u2026\n\n\u201cBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing. \u2026 Soon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused. Bolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\u201d Amazingly, Melania Trump and Ricardel have never met, several people said.\n\n-- Lawyers for Trump and CNN appeared in federal court to make their arguments about the revocation of Jim Acosta\u2019s White House pass. Paul Farhi reports: \u201cThe judge overseeing a lawsuit brought by CNN said he would decide by Thursday afternoon whether to grant CNN\u2019s motion for a restraining order that would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s access to the White House. \u2026 Precisely who made the decision to bar Acosta was unclear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Justice Department attorney James Burnham, representing the White House, said he didn\u2019t know who made that call when asked by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly. Burnham argued, however, that the president could exclude any reporter from the White House\u2019s grounds, just as he has the right to exclude them from interviews in the Oval Office or to ignore their questions during news conferences. \u2026 [CNN lawyer Ted Boutrous] said the government had \u2018a warped view\u2019 of journalism and due process.\u201d\n\n-- Fox News filed an amicus brief in support of CNN. \u201cSecret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\u201d Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\u201d (LA Times)\n\n-- Trump continued to berate Acosta as his administration spoke out against efforts abroad to stifle the press and political dissidents. David Nakamura reports: \u201cAcosta and others like him are \u2018bad for the country,\u2019 Trump told a conservative news outlet. In a fundraising email, his campaign highlighted Trump\u2019s move last week to strip Acosta\u2019s White House pass and declared that the president \u2018will NOT put up with the media\u2019s liberal bias and utter disrespect.\u2019 \u2026 In Singapore on Wednesday, Vice President Pence told Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to release two Reuters journalists jailed for covering brutal ethnic violence against the minority Rohingya Muslims. At the State Department, spokeswoman Heather Nauert called on Chinese leaders to respect \u2018fundamental freedoms\u2019 amid a crackdown on political activism in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n-- A long profile of Donald Trump Jr. just posted by David Fahrenthold and Jonathan O\u2019Connell: \u201cFrom Rebellious to Reliable.\u201d\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Trump announced his support of a bipartisan Senate bill to overhaul the nation\u2019s prison sentencing laws. Seung Min Kim reports: \u201cAt an afternoon event at the White House, Trump officially endorsed the First Step Act, which he said included \u2018reasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets.\u2019 He urged lawmakers to send him a bill, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll be waiting with a pen.\u2019 \u2026 The new Senate package includes language that lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u2018three strikes\u2019 penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. That provision would not be allowed to take place retroactively, a major concession from Democrats. It also would include Senate language that retroactively applies the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. And it would reduce mandatory minimum sentences that go into effect when a firearm is used during a violent crime or drug offense. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate in favor of the compromise, although advocates are optimistic that with Trump\u2019s endorsement giving cover to Republicans, they can reach that threshold.\u201d\n\n-- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will soon release a rewrite of rules outlining how colleges and universities must respond to sexual assault allegations, with an emphasis on bolstering the rights of the accused. Laura Meckler reports: \u201cThe new rules would reduce liability for universities, tighten the definition of sexual harassment, and allow schools to use a higher standard in evaluating claims of sexual harassment and assault. \u2026 Last year, DeVos rescinded the 2011 Obama guidance, denouncing it as overly prescriptive and lacking due process for the accused. She promised to write a regulation to replace it. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe most significant change would guarantee the accused the right to cross-examine their accusers, though that would have to be conducted by advisers or attorneys for the people involved, rather than by the person accused of misconduct.\u201d\n\n-- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended Trump\u2019s \u201cabsolutely legal\u201d deployment of U.S. troops to the southern border while visiting some of the service members there. BuzzFeed News\u2019s Vera Bergengruen reports: \u201c\u2018The eyes of the world right now, certainly of all the Americans, are on you,\u2019 he told a gathering of troops stationed near the Texas town of Donna near the border with Mexico ... \u2018This is a mission that\u2019s nontraditional because it\u2019s here in our country. Generally, we do homeland security overseas.\u2019 \u2026 He then echoed the Trump administration\u2019s talking points in a way that seemed unusual for the typically calculated and camera-shy Pentagon chief, who has said little publicly about the deployment amid rumors that the president is looking to replace him.\u201d\n\n-- The Pentagon ordered senior military leaders several months ago to cut back on public appearances. Defense One\u2019s Kevin Baron reports: \u201cThe new rule: only one senior military leader and one civilian leader are allowed to appear at each \u2018outside\u2019 non-government events, per day. Leaders must coordinate their appearances through a central DOD personnel management office and must seek waivers to break the one-per-day rule. The directive has changed how defense leaders participate in nearly every kind of public event, from global policy conferences to intimate academic panel discussions to on-camera press interviews. \u2026 [Some critics] called the rule a blatant attempt to keep the military quiet and avoid drawing attention, or conflict, with the president.\u201d\n\n-- The Senate will hold a confirmation hearing today for Ron Vitiello, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead ICE. From Maria Sacchetti: \u201cVitiello, a 30-year Border Patrol veteran, is ICE\u2019s acting director. Trump tapped him in August to replace Thomas D.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP RACES:\n\n-- Critics of Nancy Pelosi appear to be consolidating their power as a potential challenger arose in the California Democrat\u2019s speakership bid. Erica Werner, Mike DeBonis and Elise Viebeck report: \u201cPelosi on Wednesday faced solid opposition from at least 17 Democrats \u2026 Those ranks could swell as more races are called. \u2026 The defections, if they stand, would leave Pelosi several votes short of the 218 she would need when the full House votes for speaker Jan. 3. \u2026 Pelosi and her allies worked furiously Wednesday, rolling out endorsements from several major unions while she made her case to the Congressional Black Caucus, a crucial bloc. At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats, a newly elected lawmaker from Pelosi\u2019s home state shut down an attempted rules change advanced by one of her critics.\n\n\u201cPelosi, who has led the Democrats for more than 15 years, has put her gender front and center in the campaign, arguing that a woman must be at the table to do business with [Trump] and male congressional leaders. \u2026 But some of [the women Pelosi campaigned for] were unwilling Wednesday to say definitively that they would back Pelosi \u2014 despite suggestions from some of her allies that it would be an insult to female voters to do anything less. \u2026 [Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Tex.), a Pelosi critic,] said there are several women in the caucus who would be well-prepared to take the reins, among them Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (Ohio), who told reporters that she\u2019s being encouraged to stand for speaker if Pelosi doesn\u2019t have the votes. \u2018I\u2019ve not talked to any of the new members. I\u2019m not sure that I will. But I think that if in fact we were elected on change, then we should have change,\u2019 Fudge said.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) easily defeated a challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to become minority leader. Felicia Sonmez, Elise Viebeck and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cMcCarthy prevailed over [Jordan], 159 to 43 \u2026 \u2018We took a beating inside the suburban areas. We\u2019re going to have to work harder,\u2019 McCarthy said at a news conference following Wednesday\u2019s vote, acknowledging Republican losses. \u2026 The No. 2 spot of House minority whip was claimed Wednesday by Rep. Steve Scalise (La.), who serves in the third-ranking role in House GOP leadership. \u2026 [Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.)], who first won election in 2016 and is the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney, won the No. 3 spot of House Republican Conference chair.\u201d\n\n-- Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were both reelected to lead their parties in the Senate. John Wagner and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cRepublicans, meeting behind closed doors, selected Sen. John Thune (S.D.) as the majority whip. ... Thune succeeds Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) in the No. 2 GOP slot. Cornyn was term-limited. \u2026 Besides maintaining Schumer as minority leader, Senate Democrats also decided Wednesday to keep the rest of their leadership team in place, according to an individual familiar with the proceedings. That includes Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) as minority whip and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as assistant minority leader.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He\u2019s succeeding Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner, who is up for reelection in 2020. Roll Call\u2019s Niels Lesniewski reports on the other side: \u201cThe Democrats do not elect the leader of their party campaign committee. Instead, [Schumer] gets to make an appointment to the post. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto appears to be the most desired candidate for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The Democrat from Nevada was elected in 2016, and the state Democratic party in the Silver State has been among the most successful in recent election cycles.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators gather outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections headquarters during the vote recount for three statewide races in Lauderhill, Fla. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nFLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA:\n\n-- A federal judge extended the deadline for voters whose ballots were rejected due to signature inconsistencies to resolve the issues and possibly get their votes counted. Sean Sullivan, Beth Reinhard and Amy Gardner report: \u201cThe decision by Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee came hours ahead of the Thursday afternoon deadline for elections officials to complete a machine recount. Early Thursday, officials in Broward County finished their count and prepared to release a new vote total for Florida\u2019s second-largest jurisdiction. It was not clear how the judge\u2019s decision would affect the timing of recount, which was expected to move to a manual canvass Friday in the too-close-to-call Senate race, in which Gov. Rick Scott (R) leads Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by fewer than 13,000 votes.\n\n\u201cThe decision affects Floridians who cast mail-in ballots, or voted provisionally, but whose signatures did not match records maintained by state officials. More than 4,000 ballots across 45 counties in Florida were set aside because of inconsistent signatures, he wrote in his opinion. In the other 22 counties, the number is unknown. While the ruling gives Nelson new hope for chipping away at his deficit, it falls short of the more sweeping decision his lawyers sought and is probably not enough to change the outcome of the race on its own.\u201d\n\n-- The Florida lawsuits have shone a spotlight on voting laws that require ballot signatures to match existing records. Amy Gardner reports: \u201cVoter signatures have taken on outsize importance because they are typically required on absentee and mail-in ballots, which more and more Americans are using to vote. \u2026 The issue is acute in close races where absentee ballots could sway the outcome \u2014 and in states where voting by mail has exploded without a standardized system for checking the validity of a signature, the most common way to verify that a mail-in ballot is legal. All of it has created an uproar among voting-rights advocates, who say that untrained election workers are tossing eligible ballots, often with no chance for the voter to object or fix the ballot.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cFor all its dim echoes of the 2000 Bush vs. Gore election recount saga, the daily follies are, in many respects, a dry run for the next presidential contest,\u201d Manuel Roig-Franzia reports. \u201cIt is an opportunity for partisan lawyers to burrow into the arcana of the process in hopes of tweaking the rules in their favor and for activists to sharpen their rhetoric for the next fight.\u201d\n\n-- Trump offered two false assertions about voter fraud, including suggesting you need to present an ID to buy cereal \u2014 and that voter fraud can easily occur when a voter leaves the polling station to change their hat. \u201cWhen people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It\u2019s really a disgrace what\u2019s going on,\u201d Trump told the Daily Caller. He added, \u201cIf you buy a box of cereal \u2014 you have a voter ID. They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.\u201d (Philip Bump)\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp speaks during a news conference as Georgia Gov.

But it was not immediately clear how many ballots would be affected by the judge\u2019s ruling. Vanessa Williams reports: \u201cKemp, a Republican whose lead has shrunk a bit each day since the Nov. 6 election, continued to demand that [Abrams] concede, arguing that there are not enough outstanding votes for her to force a runoff. \u2026 Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019s campaign manager, accused Kemp, the former secretary of state, of using that office \u201cas a taxpayer-funded arm of his campaign.\u2019 \u2026 On Wednesday, the campaign said Abrams needed more than 17,700 additional votes to force a runoff or more than 15,400 to force a recount. The secretary of state could certify the results Friday.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah) is suing the Salt Lake County Clerk, demanding that her campaign be allowed to verify voter signatures on ballots. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cAs of Wednesday evening, Love was trailing Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams (D) by 873 votes, or 0.36 percentage point, in the race for Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District. \u2026 In the lawsuit, \u2026 Love\u2019s campaign argues that the Salt Lake County clerk has allowed poll monitors to observe the ballot-counting process but has denied them the ability to challenge signatures on ballot envelopes. \u2026 McAdams denounced Love\u2019s move, saying, \u2018Utah voters deserve better than this.\u2019 He took aim at the fact that her lawsuit targets Salt Lake County, McAdams\u2019s home base.\u201d\n\n-- Democrat Andy Kim was officially declared the winner against Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who revived GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare.

Reversing drugmakers' extra \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d contributions.\n\nThe drug industry has been fighting tooth and nail to reverse part of a February spending bill requiring them to give deeper discounts to Medicare enrollees whose spending on drugs is high enough to reach a coverage gap known as the \u201cdoughnut hole.\u201d The discount is currently 50 percent for brand-name drugs but is set to rise to 70 percent next year.\n\nThe aim of the provision was to reduce out-of-pocket spending for seniors \u2014 who are often on a fixed income and struggle to pay for their medications \u2014 but it also represented an unusual financial hit for the powerful pharmaceutical industry.\n\n2. Passing the CREATES Act.\n\nLegislators have floated passing this popular bill as a way to get Democrats on board with making the doughnut-hole fix that drugmakers want so badly. As I wrote in February, the CREATES Act tried to even the playing field for generic drug developers who often run up against blockades from branded pharmaceutical companies seeking to keep their competition at bay.\n\nIt would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed for testing and has an unusually wide range of support from lawmakers, although the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of American predictably hates it.\n\n3. Repealing the medical device tax.\n\nThis tax nearly always comes up in discussions about the ACA because the device industry has spent considerable energy trying to chip away at it. The 2.3 percent sales tax was included in the 2010 health-care law as a way to help pay for its insurance subsidies, but Congress has delayed its implementation until 2020. Because that's still a year away, the long timeline might remove a sense of urgency that could otherwise push Congress to repeal it.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAndy Kim, the Democrat who won the House race in New Jersey's 3rd District, speaks during a debate against Republican incumbent Tom MacArthur in Newark. (Julio Cortez/AP)\n\nAHH: New Jersey Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur has officially lost his reelection bid, according to the AP, more than a week after Election Day and days after his opponent, Democrat Andy Kim, declared victory in the race.\n\nMacArthur was instrumental in helping House Republicans negotiate a way to push through their bill last summer to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He was the co-author of an amendment with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) that would have allowed states to apply for waivers from Obamacare\u2019s ban on higher premiums for people with preexisting conditions. In effect, some Americans with these illnesses would have seen their premiums go up as a result of the waiver, as Paige noted in The Health 202 this week.\n\nThe effort to repeal the ACA died in the Senate, but it became a flashpoint in the campaign. Both sides repeatedly insisted they would maintain protections for preexisting conditions. But MacArthur faced ire from his constituents over the bill, and Democrats said Republicans\u2019 vote to repeal the ACA contradicted some of their promises.\n\nFor his part, Kim told the Associated Press that MacArthur's vote to repeal the ACA helped push him to run. \u201cThe moment that was most important in this district over the last two years was the health-care vote and the town hall that MacArthur did,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat was what got me into the race, that\u2019s what just turned this district on its head and why people got so fired up.\u201d\n\nPeople gather to pray for the victims of the mass shooting at a country music bar during a candlelight vigil Nov. 8 in Thousand Oaks, Calif. (Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP)\n\nOOF: A group from the American College of Surgeons has weighed in on the debated role of medical professionals surrounding gun control, releasing a new set of gun-safety recommendations. What\u2019s particularly notable about the list of surgeons who authored the report is that a majority of them are \u201cpassionate firearms owners,\u201d our Post colleague Frances Stead Sellers reports.\n\nThe list \u201caims to bridge the political divide,\u201d Sellers writes, and follows a debate that broke out over social media when the National Rifle Association chided doctors, telling them to \u201cstay in their lane,\u201d rather than weigh in on gun safety.\n\n\u201cThe recommendations, which include robust background checks, enhanced gun-safety training, mandatory reporting requirements for people considered a threat to themselves or others, and the use of innovative technologies to prevent accidental firearms discharge, are striking not so much for their content as their authorship,\u201d Sellers writes.\n\nJeremy Faust, an emergency physician at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the report, told Sellers the list represents two key perspectives: \u201cAs surgeons, they know firsthand the havoc that guns can impart. As gun owners, they understand the issues that non-gun owners might not fully appreciate.\u201d\n\nA plume of smoke rises above the Camp Fire as it moves through the area on November 8, 2018 in Paradise, California.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThe White House has teased a pivot to infrastructure so often that it\u2019s become a running joke about the administration\u2019s inability to stay on message: \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d now stands for whatever the Trump team would rather be talking about besides the latest headlines about West Wing intrigue.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 midterm performance has revived prospects for addressing the nation\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges, highways and transit systems. Odds of a breakthrough remain long. Yet those working on the issue say there is a path forward. And it is widened by the administration\u2019s eagerness to notch a bipartisan win after a bruising election \u2014 while jolting a slowing economy heading into the next one.\n\nThe biggest roadblock is how to pay for it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who discussed the issue with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after the midterms, said Wednesday that any package would need to be funded:\n\nMcConnell on infrastructure: \"Republicans are not interested in a $900 billion stimulus.\" \u2014 Ylan Q. Mui (@ylanmui) November 14, 2018\n\nOne big caveat: Republicans love to talk about offsetting the cost of big-spending legislation, but they eagerly got behind the GOP tax overhaul that is expected to add $1 trillion to the deficit and they also embraced a $1.3 billion budget deal last March that was heavily panned for its rampant spending. The deficit grew by $100 billion in October, a 60 percent increase from a year earlier \u2014 and it is projected to top $1 trillion a year by 2020.\n\nAdvocates of a big infrastructure deal from both business and labor groups say increasing the gas tax provides the simplest solution. Congress hasn\u2019t touched the levy since 1993. And a plan the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rolled out earlier this year to phase in a 25-cent increase would raise $394 billion over ten years, by the group's math. That would provide a significant down payment on the $1 trillion in spending that both President Trump and House Democrats have called for.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to be a challenge in the sense that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s politically easy to get done,\u201d says Ed Mortimer, the chamber\u2019s vice president of transportation and infrastructure. \u201cAll these members keep saying they want more infrastructure. If it\u2019s so important to invest in, let\u2019s have a serious discussion about the investments that need to be made.\u201d\n\nMortimer says the issue will be a top priority for the chamber in the next Congress, and it will press for a \u201clong-term sustainable funding source \u2026 One-time budget gimmicks or talk of repealing any part of the tax reform bill are nonstarters.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Democrats in the House, where a bill is expected to originate, will be willing to embrace a tax increase that lower-income people are likely to feel more acutely.\n\nRolling back some of the GOP\u2019s tax cuts for businesses and upper-income earners would be an easier sell for the party, forcing Republicans to choose between rebuilding public works and protecting the wealthiest. And Democrats got a taste of how dicey a gas tax can be in June when California Republicans knocked off a Democratic state senator in a recall campaign that focused on his vote for a 12-cents-per-gallon levy. (Then again, as the American Road & Transportation Builders Association points out, 96 percent of state lawmakers who voted for such a tax and then faced primaries this year advanced to the general election.)\n\nFor now, House Democratic leaders are looking to the White House, trying to evaluate whether the administration is \u201cwilling to play ball,\u201d one top House aide tells me. Trump discussed the issue with Pelosi; and in a potential sign of the Trump team\u2019s seriousness, administration officials have also reached out to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the likely House Transportation Committee chairman, and Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the likely Ways and Means Committee chairman, per people close to the process.\n\nThe Merchants Bridge crosses the Mississippi River in St. Louis.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nSenate Republicans, 21 of whom will be up for reelection in 2020, are no more eager to raise taxes. \u201cThis might be the only thing left on the table that can get done,\u201d says Mike Friedberg, a transportation and infrastructure lobbyist at Holland & Knight. \u201cBut neither party wants to have an increase in the gas tax going into the presidential election, and they\u2019ve said that.\u201d\n\nTrump himself endorsed the idea in a meeting with lawmakers earlier this year. Whether he will hew to that position is another question.\n\n\u201cIf the mutual will is there politically, then the funding will be there. If you can broker a deal in principle, the rest will work itself out,\u201d says Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist who lobbies on infrastructure issues. But he said cooperation could break down as a new set of House Democratic chairmen use their subpoena power to launch probes of the Trump administration. \u201cHow do you get there with this political cold war in the background?\u201d\n\nThe president made the point in his post-election news conference. He said House Democrats could investigate him, \u201cor we can work together. You can\u2019t do them simultaneously, by the way.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s stated unwillingness to follow then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s strategy of compartmentalization \u2014 boxing off Republican probes so he could devote most of his attention to pushing his agenda amid divided government \u2014 bodes badly for an infrastructure breakthrough.\n\nThose rooting for one agree Trump will need to rally support for a package. Otherwise, \u201cInfrastructure Week\u201d will persist as a punchline about what the administration could be accomplishing.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May in London on Nov. 15.

The Washington Post's William Booth and Karla Adam: \u201cThe minister in charge of helping Britain leave the European Union, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, abruptly resigned from Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government on Thursday morning, saying he could not support the withdrawal agreement approved by her cabinet the night before. It was a stinging setback for May. Also quitting their posts were two other ministers and a junior minister in the Brexit ministry. The rapid-fire resignations sent shudders through London and E.U. headquarters in Brussels, raising the possibility that May does not have the support she needs to pursue her deal for a softer, slower-moving Brexit, a plan loaded with compromises that few in Britain like. In his resignation letter, Raab wrote, \u2018I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 World's economy weakens while America's flourishes. The Wall Street Journal's William Boston and Nina Adam: \u201cSigns are mounting of a slowdown in the global economy, indicating a deceleration in China and trade tensions are beginning to take a broader toll on much of the rest of the world. . . . The raft of weakening data stands in contrast with a U.S. economy that expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5% in the quarter, underpinned by robust consumer and government spending. Though few economists predict a global downturn, the economic data increasingly show that the global economic cycle is entering a mature phase.\n\n\"One reason is a slowdown in demand from consumers and companies in China, the world\u2019s second-largest consumer. A months-long slowdown there, driven in part by a crackdown on risky financing and jitters over the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington, is hurting spending on cars, other consumer products and property, according to official data released Wednesday. That is rippling through the world, hurting some of China\u2019s major economic partners.\u201d\n\nThe Fed is tracking it. WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was closely monitoring a modest deceleration in global growth, whose strength last year had provided an important tailwind for the U.S. economy. \u2018This year has seen a gradual chipping away at that picture. You\u2019ve seen a bit of a slowdown\u2014not a terrible slowdown,\u2019 Mr. Powell said Wednesday evening. \u2018You still see solid growth, but you see growing signs of a bit of a slowdown. And it is concerning.\u2019\u201d But it's not concerning enough, he added, to change the Fed's rate-hiking path.\n\nPowell also defended the Fed. NYT's Binyamin Appelbaum writes he \"countered [Trump\u2019s] loud and repeated attacks on the Fed without mentioning Mr. Trump by name. Mr. Powell hammered on two simple themes during an hourlong question-and-answer session in front of several hundred people at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Fed is doing its job, he said, and the economy is doing really well. 'I\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,' Mr. Powell said. 'There\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.' He added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. 'Our policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,' he said.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve in Washington on May 2. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 Inflation stays muted. Bloomberg News's Sho Chandra: \u201cU.S. inflation showed little sign of breaking out in October despite strength in the economy and wages, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on its path of gradual interest-rate increases. Excluding food and energy, the core consumer-price index rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday, slightly short of the median estimate of economists for a 2.2 percent increase, which was also the gain in September. . . \u2018These are pretty steady inflation prints,\u2019 with \u2018nothing in here that argues inflation is going to overshoot,\u2019 said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale. Also, there\u2019s little to concern policy makers, so they\u2019ll \u201ccontinue to stay gradual\u201d with interest-rate hikes, he said.\u201d\n\n\u2014 GE goes through rough patch. WSJ's Matt Wirz: \u201cWall Street has a GE problem. General Electric Co. raised $115 billion of debt on a reputation as one of the U.S.\u2019s safest borrowers. Now, revelations of losses and questions about its accounting have shaken investors\u2019 confidence, driving bond prices sharply lower in recent weeks. The impact is rippling through financial markets as investors scramble to reassess the company\u2019s risk, bearish hedge funds bet prices will fall further and banks move to limit their exposure. . . . Prices of GE\u2019s various bonds have tumbled about 5% to 18% since late October to junk levels, according to MarketAxess, showing that some investors expect further downgrades . . . A slide below investment grade by GE \u2014 a name many Americans associate with safe and boring investing \u2014 could become a pivotal moment in the U.S. credit market\u2019s nine-year bull run, forcing fund managers to question how well they understand the risk in their investments.\u201d\n\nGE Credit Crunch Ripples Across Wall Street A steep fall in GE\u2019s bonds to junk levels is roiling credit markets, spreading pain and gain among investors and banks.

There needs \u2018to be not only changes in the legislation but more enforcement\u2019 if the Trump administration wants votes from Democrats, said New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, who is positioned to chair the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee, in an interview on Wednesday.\n\n\"Democrats\u2019 concerns wouldn\u2019t require a major rewrite of the deal and likely could be addressed by putting strong \u2018enforcement mechanisms,\u2019 especially over labor and environmental rules, in the U.S. law that brings the deal into force, said Pascrell . . . While the lawmaker didn\u2019t outline specific changes his party is seeking to the deal, Democrats have been consistent in pushing for tougher labor provisions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 White House reins in Navarro. CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Eamon Javers: \u201cThe White House has deliberately curtailed trade advisor Peter Navarro's public profile amid a clash with top economic advisor Larry Kudlow . . . Despite the tensions, neither official is expected to leave the administration soon . . . [Trump] could also change his mind at any time about Navarro's role. On Tuesday, Kudlow slammed Navarro for his remarks on the White House's ongoing trade negotiations with China. . . . Last week, Navarro said a potential deal with China \u2018will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd Trump holds his fire. The Post's David Lynch: \"After several months of tough talk and even tougher tariffs, [Trump] may be pulling some punches in his 'America First' global trade offensive. The president has deferred until next year a decision on imposing 25 percent tariffs on imported automobiles and is considered likely to hold off on new trade restraints on Chinese imports when he meets China\u2019s President Xi Jinping later this month at the Group of 20 summit \u2014 refraining for now from moves that would mean higher prices for American consumers.\" One multinational executive tells David that market turmoil and the midterm elections have rattled Trump's trade team.\n\n\u2014 China outlines concessions. Bloomberg's Shawn Donnan and co.: \"Chinese officials have outlined a series of potential concessions to the Trump administration for the first time since the summer as they continue to try to resolve a trade war, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The commitments for now fall short of the type of major structural reforms that [Trump] has been demanding, two of the people said, cautioning that a long road lies ahead in negotiations. One person said that talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies are continuing and constructive. As a result, one of the people said, it raised doubts over how substantive a deal Trump could make with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet later this month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires. Most of the document appeared to be a rehash of previous changes already made by Beijing, such as raising equity caps on foreign investment in certain industries.\"\n\nAs it struggles to seal regional trade pact. WSJ's Ben Otto and Jake Maxwell Watts: \u201cChina has cast itself as a champion of free trade and multilateralism in the \u2018America-first\u2019 era, but the world\u2019s second-largest economy is finding that turning such talk into outcomes is substantially more difficult. At meetings of global leaders in Singapore, negotiators working on a sweeping, 16-nation trade pact backed by Beijing said Wednesday they couldn\u2019t finish the deal this year, citing its size and the complexity of talks among a range of economies. That leaves Beijing without a major deal to its name at a time when a trade fight with the U.S. is beginning to bite and some of its Asian partners are pushing back against Chinese investments they believe come loaded with crippling debt or other burdens.\u201d\n\nMercedes-Benz sedans sit inside a car carrier before being hauled away for distribution from the company's vehicle processing center in Baltimore on March 27, 2014.

WSJ's Josh Zumbrun: \u201cInternational companies in the U.S. rate potential tariffs on automobile and auto-parts imports as the most damaging of the Trump administration\u2019s trade actions, a new survey finds, surpassing the tariffs that have been imposed between the U.S. and China, and the global tariffs on steel and aluminum. Companies, even outside the automobile industry, are closely watching as the administration debates whether to impose the auto tariffs, the survey shows. None of the automobile-related tariffs have yet been implemented, but [Trump] has repeatedly threatened to deploy the tariffs to obtain leverage in negotiations with trading partners like the European Union and Japan.\"\n\nThis chart of soybean prices signals traders see US-China trade deal progress Soybean prices may be signaling some optimism about trade, ahead of President Donald Trump's meeting at the G20 with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

NYT's Sheere Frenkel and co.: \"When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to [Trump], Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem. And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack. While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Times's blockbuster, Facebook announced Thursday it has cut ties with Definers Public Affairs, a Washington-based firm that helped it trash its competitors and critics, including by alleging the Soros link, the paper reports.\n\nDark mood at Facebook.

(Patrick Seeger/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nEurope\u2019s top human rights court ruled Thursday that Russian arrests of anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny have been politically motivated, delivering a broad-ranging if mainly symbolic rebuke of the Kremlin\u2019s methods of keeping domestic opposition at bay.\n\nThe upper chamber of the European Court of Human Rights said seven arrests of Navalny from 2012 to 2014 violated his rights and appeared to be part of a broader effort \u201cto bring the opposition under control.\u201d The court ordered Russia to pay Navalny about $72,000 in damages and expenses and called on the country to extend greater legal rights to people protesting peacefully.\n\nThe Russian government had no immediate comment. Even though Russia is one of the 47 countries within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, it has found ways to avoid following the court\u2019s rulings in the past.\n\nNevertheless, the ruling was significant and more far-reaching than many of the court\u2019s past decisions against Russia. It endorsed the position of Navalny, perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s most vocal and well-organized critic inside Russia. And unlike a lower chamber that delivered an opinion last year, the court found Navalny\u2019s arrests to be politically motivated.\n\nReferring to terms set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, the court found beyond reasonable doubt that two of the arrests were meant to \u201csuppress that political pluralism which forms part of \u2018effective political democracy\u2019 governed by \u2018the rule of law.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe Court called on Russia to provide a legal mechanism for the authorities to take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly and show the necessary tolerance for unauthorised, peaceful gatherings,\u201d said a news release announcing the verdict.\n\nNavalny referred to the ruling as a \u201cbig victory.\u201d He said he had expected a narrower decision that did not determine his arrests to have been politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThis has huge significance not even for me but for a huge number of people across Russia who are regularly caught and put in prison for clearly political reasons,\u201d Navalny said in a blog post. \u201cThe Russian government was always able to say: even the ECHR doesn\u2019t see these cases as political. They can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\nNavalny has spent more than four months in total behind bars in the past two years, serving 30 days or less at a time, largely on charges of organizing unpermitted protests. Analysts say that such arrests allow the Kremlin to disrupt Navalny\u2019s efforts to build anti-Putin sentiment while avoiding the public outcry that would ensue if he were sentenced to a longer jail term.\n\nNavalny, who has built a large online following with viral videos spotlighting corruption in Russia\u2019s ruling elite, was barred from running in the presidential election this year. But he has built a nationwide network of campaign offices able to organize protests across the country, including rallies in September against Putin\u2019s unpopular plan to raise the retirement age.\n\nRead more:\n\nUnder rare pressure at home, Putin pledges to ease hike in retirement age\n\nWar games and business deals: Russia, China send a signal to Washington\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine spill over into byzantine world of Orthodox church\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "John Wagner", "title": "Trump blasts Mueller probe a week after installing new acting attorney general", "description": "The president called the team of lawyers working for the special counsel \u201ca disgrace to our Nation.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-blasts-mueller-probe-a-week-after-installing-new-acting-attorney-general/2018/11/15/f36f4784-e8d0-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lt12GCcz59MJIa-GgkRLmB2QRLg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZSQH5JWLBUI6RLIKBYA67OR4YE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:07:00Z", "content": "President Trump on Thursday lashed out anew at the investigation of special counsel Robert S.

And, in his final act in office before resigning last week, Sessions issued a memo making it more difficult for federal officials to broker consent decrees.\n\nThe Justice Department could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nBut the commission concluded that federal investigations resulting in consent decrees remain the most effective means of transforming departments and ensuring constitutional policing.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is very strong that having federal oversight in terms of a court decree has dramatically improved the quality of life in communities with those agreements,\u201d said Lhamon, a former assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department. \u201cThe turn away that we\u2019re seeing in this administration is a turn against civil rights.\u201d\n\nThe commission\u2019s two conservative members voted against the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations.\n\nCreated in 1957, the commission is a bipartisan panel of presidential and congressional appointees who conduct investigations and issue federal policy recommendations on civil rights matters. The panel, which has changed its focus with each presidential administration, provided recommendations crucial to the eventual passages of the civil rights acts of 1960 and 1964, the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nThe commission\u2019s members voted unanimously to investigate police use of force in December 2014, at a time when the police killings of Eric Garner in New York City, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Tamir Rice in Cleveland had prompted massive protests nationwide. The panel held a public hearing in April 2015 that included testimony from activists, police officials and criminologists.\n\nThe new report includes summaries and analysis of major investigations of police use of force and accountability conducted by media outlets including The Post, the Guardian, BuzzFeed News, as well as dozens of reports by criminologists and other experts that have been published in recent years.\n\nThe commission\u2019s findings echo several areas of growing consensus among criminologists: that it is possible to reduce the frequency with which police officers use deadly force, that disproportionate rates of police use of force in minority communities erodes their trust in law enforcement and that current federal data-collection efforts are highly inadequate.\n\n[In Sacramento, trying to stop a killing before it happens]\n\nThe report recommends that Congress pass legislation requiring local police departments to provide reliable data about police use of force and that federal funding be denied to those that refuse. The commission notes that the most comprehensive data about how often police officers use fatal force is in databases maintained by The Post and other media outlets.\n\n\u201cWe need to have better data,\u201d Lhamon said. \u201cWe need to be able to know what it is that communities are experiencing.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, The Post and the Guardian created separate databases to track fatal police shootings and other deaths in custody to make up for the lack of reliable data collected by the Justice Department. Following those efforts, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced in 2016 that the department would begin collecting and releasing more reliable data. Those efforts have not been fruitful.\n\nThe Post\u2019s database has documented nearly 3,800 fatal police shootings since January 2015 \u2014 including at least 841 people killed by police in 2018.\n\nTo fill the gap in federal data collection, the commission recommended that Congress make reporting use-of-force data to the DOJ a condition for local police departments' receipt of federal funding. That data should then be maintained in a public national database maintained by DOJ, the report recommends, and federal officials should publicly name any department that does not provide data.\n\nThe report makes additional recommendations, including congressional funding for new research into police oversight, more police training for de-escalation and local reforms that would change the grand jury process for police killings \u2014 having local judges, not prosecutors, oversee them and creating an open record of their proceedings.\n\nIn a dissent to the report, Commissioner Gail Heriot wrote that not enough of the public conversation about criminal justice focuses on the rates at which black Americans commit crime and expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of federal oversight of local police departments. She also voiced the theory popular among some conservatives and police officials that increased scrutiny of police will result in them abandoning their obligations to protect the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to insist both that police officers vigorously protect the public from crime and that they refrain from using force when they believe it is to be necessary for their own self-defense,\u201d wrote Heriot, a law professor at the University of San Diego who was appointed to the commission in 2007. \u201cTraining is helpful, but all the training in the world will not resolve the underlying tension between those two aspirations. Instead, the more likely result is that police officers will avoid engaging with individuals they regard as dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn his dissent, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican lawyer from Cleveland who has been on the commission since 2006, wrote that the fact that a Justice Department investigation found that Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, probably did not have his hands up in surrender when he was killed by an officer in Ferguso in 2014 \u2014 a widely believed account that propelled the street protests and national outrage \u2014 should prompt skepticism of allegations of unnecessary force by police officers.\n\n\u201cThe events that prompted this report were based on a lie,\u201d Kirsanow wrote, referring to the \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d chant protesters adopted. \u201cThere are certainly individuals like Walter Scott who are completely innocent of wrongdoing, but it is far more common that individuals are killed by police after they have escalated a situation to a point where it is a life-or-death struggle.\n\nLhamon, the committee chairman, said that dissenting opinions are not uncommon on the bipartisan committee. She said that the majority of the commission\u2019s members think the issues of police use of force and accountability remain urgent, citing a fatal police shooting days ago in Chicago in which a black man who had helped stop a shooting by a drunk bar patron was killed by responding police officers.\n\n\u201cThese issues are incredibly urgent to Americans today and every day,\u201d Lhamon said. \u201cThe time is well past that we need to, as a country, turn a corner on the perceived schism between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RickNoackTWP/", "title": "Kick out May?

(Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTheresa May\u2019s premiership has been declared dead before. After her election losses last year, the British prime minister appeared to be on the brink of resigning.\n\nAs she left 10 Downing Street on Thursday morning, members of her own party again wondered: How long can she last? In the early morning hours, several of her cabinet ministers resigned over May\u2019s draft deal to leave the European Union, which was released Wednesday. May probably expected some resignations, but one was unexpected: Dominic Raab, her second Brexit minister.\n\nWith the official who negotiated May\u2019s Brexit deal writing that he \u201ccannot support the proposed deal,\u201d the government was suddenly thrown into jeopardy. In an evening news conference, May vowed to fight for her deal and rejected any suggestions that she might be on the way out of office.\n\nBut May is under attack from both sides of the political spectrum. Staunch pro-Brexiteers argue the deal does not go far enough and would keep Britain under the sway of the E.U. while taking away all powers to shape that bloc. Pro-European members of Parliament (MPs), meanwhile, think that Britain should stay more closely aligned with E.U. laws and within the bloc\u2019s customs union.\n\nWhen May told Parliament on Thursday that \u201cwe will leave the E.U. in a smooth and orderly way,\u201d her remarks were met with laughter by lawmakers.\n\nSo, what could be next? Here are some of the likely scenarios.\n\nTwo key choices ahead\n\n1) MPs vote in favor of May\u2019s deal\n\nEven though May\u2019s deal pleases neither pro-European nor pro-Brexit MPs, the prime minister may still have leverage to push through her deal or a modified version of it. The most powerful argument in her favor would be that the problem might not be her, but Brexit itself.\n\nWhile her deal is imperfect on many levels, it would still help Britain avoid a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit that could cost jobs and trigger a recession. At the same time, there has been cross-party agreement to respect the results of the 2016 referendum to leave the E.U. Many MPs who want to uphold that promise but are scared of a no-deal Brexit will back May.\n\nStill, the prime minister is not believed to have the necessary votes for that to happen, and with every minister resignation, chances are getting slimmer.\n\n2) MPs vote against May\u2019s deal or dump her\n\nShe can\u2019t bank on much support from the opposition. The Scottish National Party is disgruntled that it was left out of the negotiations, and the Liberal Democrats will vote against the deal out of principle. Most Labour Party members are expected to also reject the agreement, partially because a May defeat increases the likelihood of a future Labour prime minister.\n\nWorse even, May is facing a rebellion among her own allies. Pro-Brexiteers will vote against her deal, and the party that has kept her in power since last year \u2014 the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) \u2014 might join them. The DUP leadership fears May\u2019s deal could create a de facto border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That\u2019s a red line for a party committed to keeping Northern Ireland fully within the U.K.\n\nLabour cannot topple May by itself, but the prime minister\u2019s own allies may help with that. Moreover, if the DUP were to withdraw from its agreement to keep the Conservative Party \u2014 led by May or any successor \u2014 in power, then new general elections would be almost inevitable. Without the DUP, the Tories lack a majority in Parliament.\n\nWhat it means for Brexit\n\nA no-deal Brexit is unpopular but may be inevitable\n\nIf May\u2019s deal is rejected, chances of a no-deal Brexit rise. While leading pro-Brexiteers have said that they would prefer this scenario over a bad deal, a no-deal Brexit would probably not be a deliberate choice but instead an accidental outcome of a government unable to obtain a majority for any better solution.\n\n\n\nMost people in London voted against exiting the European Union. (Bryn Colton/Bloomberg News)\n\nMost stakeholders know very well that a no-deal Brexit could have catastrophic repercussions on the British economy. As an island, Britain is dependent on its trade with the E.U., and a no-deal Brexit would disrupt all those ties overnight. The government may have to ship in goods to keep supermarkets stocked, and nobody knows for sure what the effect of a no-deal Brexit would be on the millions of Europeans working in Britain.\n\nNothing really changes\n\nGiven the risks of a no-deal Brexit, Parliament could theoretically reject May\u2019s deal until Christmas and still approve a similar document next year.\n\nBut even then, it would be unclear what sort of relationship Britain would have with the E.U. in the long term. What would Britain\u2019s immigration policy look like, especially as think tanks predict that the country will face a severe labor shortage going forward? Could it stay in the customs union permanently to prevent a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country?\n\nTheoretically, Britain could extend the agreed transition period \u2014 in which Britain would continue to abide by E.U. rules without having a say on shaping them \u2014 year after year, arguing that Britain isn\u2019t ready to fully withdraw, yet. But in that case, Britain would be outside the E.U. only on paper.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Thursday that he cannot accept having to choose between no deal and May\u2019s deal.\n\nGoing back to Brussels\n\nThe question is what other choices there are. Corbyn has implied that going back to Brussels to get a better agreement could be one way out of the dilemma. But the E.U. has proved over the past year that it is bound by its own treaties and has little interest in adapting its rules to British demands.\n\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the British opposition Labour Party. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why that would change under Corbyn, unless he agreed to stick to staying in the single market and the customs union. This would mean Britain would essentially still be subject to E.U. laws, which has been rejected many times by all parties. Such a solution would probably be possible only in the unlikely scenario that Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party campaigned on that promise in general elections and won an overwhelming mandate for it \u2014 or supported a second referendum.\n\nA second referendum\n\nSupporters of a new vote on Britain\u2019s E.U. membership argue that a second referendum is not only an option but also a must, given that the promises on which pro-Brexit politicians campaigned have largely proved to be misleading. Critics maintain that posing the same question again because MPs didn\u2019t like the British people\u2019s response would ruin trust in British democracy.\n\nAmid all the confusion, there\u2019s one certainty, though: Britain has only four more months left to figure it all out. It\u2019s set to either leave or crash out of the E.U. by March 29.\n\nRead more:\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit secretary resigns over Theresa May\u2019s plan to exit European Union"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Going Out Guide staff", "title": "13 things to do in the D.C. area this weekend", "description": "The National Gallery of Art's outdoor ice rink opens this weekend.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2018/11/15/things-do-dc-area-this-weekend/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WTeHIrkD8oSCQUAwO9w6500swTI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZZ43LCVJII6HPN7BF5LFI64FM.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:00:44Z", "content": "Friday, Nov. 16 Home/Brewed at Heurich House : Way before DC Brau and 3 Stars Brewing Company, there was the Chr.

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nFashion critic\n\nDespite all the advances in photography and video, nothing compares to seeing the beautifully crafted dresses from the Rodarte fashion label in real life and mere inches away from your inquiring eyes at a new exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.\n\nThe gowns that fashion fans might have viewed in runway photography, or that celebrity-watchers might have swooned over in red-carpet videos, look far more glorious in person when the hand-embroidery comes into focus, the magic of a nearly invisible infrastructure is revealed, and the remarkable amount of fabric required to drape, twist and wrap an evening gown around even the teeny-tiniest body becomes clear. And even if a visitor has no particular interest in catwalks or the wardrobes of actresses, it\u2019s hard to argue against the pleasure of seeing imaginatively conceived garments rendered with obsessive care.\n\n\u201cRodarte\u201d is the first fashion exhibition mounted by the National Museum of Women in the Arts, but the decision to bring fashion into its galleries should not be read as surprising or risky. For all the ways that fashion can alienate shoppers, it can be welcoming to museumgoers who find a universal kinship with what, ultimately, are frocks. Indeed, \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d the recent exhibition at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ranks as the most popular show in the museum\u2019s history, with more than 1.6 million visitors, surpassing the former top draw, \u201cTreasures of Tutankhamun.\u201d\n\n\n\nA pleated gown on view in the \u201cRodarte\u201d exhibition. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe plainly titled \u201cRodarte\u201d is an exploration of one brand. The work is not juxtaposed with other cultural touchstones. No existential questions are posed. It\u2019s simply a survey of a women\u2019s fashion label launched in 2005, whose impact on the broader fashion landscape is arguably minimal at best.\n\nIs the visual pleasure of these clothes enough to justify an exhibition featuring almost 100 direct-from-the-runway looks? Perhaps. It\u2019s hard to underestimate the value of beauty for beauty\u2019s sake at a time when our culture is oozing ugliness.\n\nBut do you learn anything beyond the fact that many Rodarte collections have been inspired by gardens and that one collection included fabric that had been burned? Does any piece of the exhibition linger in your mind or reveal some larger truth? Does it pack an emotional punch, if not an intellectual one? If the work of Rodarte is not so much rooted in the realm of fashion but in fine art, is there a dialogue with a community of artists or an attempt to deliver an expansive message? Not really. Aesthetics are the primary consideration. Rodarte is a brand that looks inward. Its preoccupations are personal to its founders.\n\nRodarte is the passion project of sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy, self-taught designers who founded their brand while working out of their parents\u2019 Pasadena, Calif., home. From the first small collection they presented to editors, the sisters have focused on handwrought, labor-intensive techniques. Their trajectory in the fashion industry has been akin to a rocket launch. Within days after arriving in New York during Fashion Week, the Mulleavys were hailed for the inventive, fanciful, complex nature of their clothes. In 2010, they were the subject of a \u201cquicktake\u201d exhibition at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. Last year, the designers wrote and directed \u201cWoodshock,\u201d their first feature-length film. They are exuberantly creative and, as a result, award-winning.\n\n[Does Rodarte actually exist? The vaporous business plan of a fashion industry darling.]\n\nThe dominant characteristic of the Rodarte brand is intimacy. The collections are inspired by events and places that have particular meaning in the sisters\u2019 lives: the California landscape, the wood paneling and blue porcelain in their family home, the horror movies that fascinated them. They excavate those memories and use them as building blocks to collections. Often ideas flow in a stream-of-consciousness style. A collection that included references to Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cStarry Night\u201d was inspired not by the artist, but rather by a visit to the Mount Wilson Observatory, not far from the Mulleavy home. The designers\u2019 minds hopscotched their way to Van Gogh from astronomer Edwin Hubble.\n\nWhatever the inspiration, the story of the collections always seem to come back to the sisters. That\u2019s much of what makes their work so captivating. It is so personal that it exists on its own terms, not tied to the ebb and flow of fashion trends. The designers have not fallen under the spell of streetwear, denim or athleisure \u2014 and for that, they should be applauded. The Mulleavys\u2019 world exists inside a snow globe, where it is beautiful, fragile and isolated.\n\nThe new exhibition is organized thematically, based on inspiration. So it\u2019s possible to explore at length the designers\u2019 willingness to wreak havoc on their materials by burning, fraying, beating and unraveling them. The garden room is filled with dresses adorned with handmade silk flowers, realistic sprays of faux baby\u2019s breath and embroidery that mimics the honeycomb of bumblebees.\n\n\n\nCostumes worn by the dancers in the film \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nHandmade flowers on dresses inspired by gardens. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nDespite the breadth of this show, though, not every collection is represented. There are no garments, for instance, from their spring 2014 collection, which was inspired by Los Angeles and its hard-edge youth culture. It was not a critically praised collection (I was blunt in my dislike for it), yet in a survey of a designer\u2019s work, it\u2019s important to see collections that were not well received in order to better understand what ultimately makes the work soar. Here there are no collection sketches, no rough drafts, no preliminary studies \u2014 only the final, perfected end result.\n\nOne also wishes that more of the sisters\u2019 fall 2014 collection were on display. The headlines from that season focused on a group of gowns emblazoned with characters from Star Wars. But it also included ephemeral trousers that floated around the body like a cloud and metallic coats with a sci-fi edge. The Star Wars gowns were more gimmick than grand artistry and were not especially adept at illustrating the designers\u2019 complicated relationship with film as both a medium and an inspiration. The Mulleavys, for example, for fall 2011, explored the transformative properties of light in dresses informed by the Terrence Malick film \u201cDays of Heaven.\u201d Their costumes for Natalie Portman in 2010\u2019s \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d with their molded bodices and feathers that do not flutter, are a compelling expression of both the grace and pain that propel ballet.\n\nFashion is, by its nature, a distillation of the times in which it\u2019s created. It\u2019s the culture \u2014 or some small part of it \u2014 in silk and satin. Placed into the context of a museum, fashion takes on other obligations. It should tell a deeper, more nuanced story of who we are. It should speak to our collective humanity. Fashion can do that. It has done that.\n\n\u201cRodarte\u201d is a beautiful exhibition. But sometimes, beauty is not enough."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "With pushes, kicks and shoves, Sri Lanka's Parliament descends into chaos", "description": "The brawl came as the turmoil in Sri Lanka reached a critical stage, leaving it unclear who is prime minister.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/15/with-pushes-kicks-shoves-sri-lankas-parliament-descends-into-chaos/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fL_l-k0K_HNwwyIcIWmeSDcB9ZE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q4DMFIXIYEI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:53:07Z", "content": "NEW DELHI Since late last month, politicians in Sri Lanka have engaged in a war of words over who is the countrys rightful prime minister.

On Thursday, their battle turned physical.\n\nA scuffle broke out on the floor of Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament after the speaker attempted to call the body for a vote, the latest maneuver in a three-week-old power struggle that has pitted the country\u2019s president, Maithripala Sirisena, against its sitting prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nLawmakers pushed and grabbed one another. One threw a garbage can at the speaker. Another clutched the speaker\u2019s microphone and tried to take it away, injuring his hand in the process and requiring a trip to the hospital.\n\nThe fight came as the turmoil in Sri Lanka reached a crucial stage. Sirisena first moved to oust Wickremesinghe as the prime minister on Oct. 26, replacing him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, a controversial former president.\n\nSirisena then suspended Parliament, preventing it from holding any votes. Last week, when it became clear that his faction could not muster majority support in the chamber, Sirisena attempted to dissolve it altogether, a move blocked by Sri Lanka\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Parliament finally reconvened, and in a chaotic voice vote, a majority of legislators rejected Rajapaksa as prime minister (they later presented a signed letter confirming their votes). But Sirisena refused to accept the vote as valid, saying lawmakers had not followed proper procedure.\n\nThe result is a highly tense stalemate that has made it unclear who is in charge in Sri Lanka. After Thursday\u2019s scuffle in Parliament, thousands of Wickremesinghe\u2019s supporters took to the streets of Colombo, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHarsha de Silva, a lawmaker in Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party, said the crowds demonstrated that \u201cwe have power both inside and outside\u201d the Parliament. He urged Rajapaksa to end his quest for the prime minister\u2019s post. \u201cGo for God\u2019s sake Go!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nRajapaksa served as the country\u2019s president for a decade and put a brutal end to Sri Lanka\u2019s long-running civil war in 2009. He was ousted in 2015 and more recently has been maneuvering to return to power. On Thursday, he gave a speech in Parliament calling for fresh elections to resolve the crisis.\n\n\u201cI suggest that we take this matter before the 15 million-plus voters in the country instead of trying to resolve this among the 225 persons sitting in this House,\u201d said Rajapaksa. He accused the speaker of acting \u201chand in glove with certain Western embassies.\u201d Not long after Rajapaksa stopped speaking, the pushing and shoving began. The Parliament is expected to reconvene Friday."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Morning Bits: Unwelcome partisanship puts Mueller at risk", "description": "Must-read links to start the day", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/15/morning-bits-unwelcome-partisanship-puts-mueller-at-risk/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VE1qgBBuOtPCdLvptyZKZeaqmOQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MC4XRRAWJUZJFHV4DCPGAUYUMY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:45:36Z", "content": "Hardly a welcomed sign for Republicans.

Republican Sen. Jeff Flake \u201chas long been a critic of Trump but has mostly declined to use his leverage in the razor-thin Senate to hold up Republican judges.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused, blocking the bill.\u201d Once more, party above country.\n\nFinally, something both sides should welcome. \u201cFlanked by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, President Donald Trump on Wednesday endorsed what could be the most major rewrite of federal prison and sentencing laws in more than a decade.

Bill Nelson (D), enters a phase reminiscent of the state\u2019s 2000 presidential recount \u2014 in which local elections officials will examine tens of thousands of ballots that may not have been filled out or tallied correctly to assess voters\u2019 intentions.\n\nThe process was triggered because Scott\u2019s lead, 12,603 votes out of more than 8 million cast, remained within the 0.25 percent legal threshold for a manual recount, which must be completed by noon Sunday.\n\nThat narrow margin appeared too much for Nelson to overcome. Scott called for Nelson to bow out as Nelson\u2019s attorney expressed confidence that the second recount, plus court cases, would let Nelson overtake Scott.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,\u201d Nelson\u2019s lead recount attorney, Marc Elias, said on a call with reporters.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAlso going to a hand recount is the race for state agriculture commissioner, which has emerged as a potential bright spot for Democrats. The party\u2019s nominee, Nikki Fried, a medical marijuana advocate who also promised to tighten that agency\u2019s processing of concealed weapons permits, holds a lead of 5,307 votes over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nThe path to this new stage of the recount was rocky, as mechanical errors plagued the machine tally in several large counties, contentious legal disputes raised questions about the path forward, and the Scott and Nelson campaigns traded attacks.\n\nUndergirding the fight has been a steady stream of attacks, claims and counterclaims \u2014 some led by Trump, who has accused the Democrats and the top elections official in heavily Democratic Broward County of fraud.\n\n\u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible \u2014 ballots massively infected,\u201d Trump tweeted this week.\n\nThe scrutiny of the state\u2019s elections system intensified Thursday when three of the state\u2019s biggest counties \u2014 Broward, Palm Beach and Hillsborough \u2014 failed to get new counts to the state by the 3 p.m. deadline and were required to stick with their pre-recount totals.\n\nWorkers in those counties saw days of marathon work prove fruitless.\n\n\u201cBasically I just worked my a \u2014 off for nothing,\u201d Joe D\u2019Alessandro, election planning and development director in Broward County, said after the office had stayed open overnight to recount ballots.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans seized on reports that at least four Democratic voters had been given forms with the wrong deadline to fix ballots that had been flagged as having issues. The date on the form was after the actual deadline, so it\u2019s not clear how using the altered form benefited Democrats.\n\nThe state Democratic Party said in a statement that it has hired \u201can independent investigator to review the issues at hand.\u201d\n\nNelson appeared to score a legal victory early Thursday, when U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker ruled that thousands of voters across the state have until Saturday to resolve issues with signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots and get their previously rejected votes counted.\n\nBut even as a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied Scott\u2019s request to stop Walker\u2019s ruling from taking effect, it was clear the decision was not enough to make up Nelson\u2019s deficit.\n\nNevertheless, the Senate recount was expected to be contentious \u2014 as both sides see the legal rulings laying the groundwork for a potentially tight presidential vote in 2020.\n\nVoting rights advocates cited the signature ruling \u2014 as well as another in Broward County denying Scott\u2019s request to halt the counting \u2014 as positive steps for voters. In the Broward ruling, the judge called for the count to go on because there is recourse for campaigns to challenge votes they believe are ineligible.\n\nBoth Senate campaigns have continued to stockpile cash for the costly legal battles and staffing in the recount. Scott\u2019s campaign announced Thursday that it had raised more than $1.4 million for its recount efforts. Nelson\u2019s campaign estimates that it raised about $2.5 million.\n\nThe hand count in Broward probably will capture much of the attention. There will be 100 tables set up with two election workers, two campaign representatives and two party representatives at each, according to instructions distributed by election officials. Only the election workers are allowed to handle ballots, while wearing gloves.\n\nThe recount is scheduled for 11-hour days Friday and Saturday, with two 30-minute breaks each day.\n\nReinhard reported from Lauderhill, Fla., Sullivan reported from Tallahassee, Gardner reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Rozsa reported from Palm Beach, Fla."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "John Wagner", "title": "Trump insists White House is running smoothly, bashes media", "description": "The president\u2019s comments follow the dismissal of a national security official who clashed with the first lady.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-insists-white-house-is-running-smoothly-bashes-media/2018/11/15/5d1bbfb2-e8ce-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/v4YcCBpFp0tZH-RzcrUUFN0ToOs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSGC77HIMUI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:39:00Z", "content": "President Trump insisted Thursday that the White House is running very smoothly, seeking to play down media reports about infighting a day after a senior national security official was reassigned following a clash with his wifes staff.

You won\u2019t want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nAmazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos in Washington on Sept. 13. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nWith its decision to open half of its HQ2 in Crystal City, Va., Amazon will be the Pentagon\u2019s newest neighbor - putting the company in a strong position to expand its business opportunities with the federal government.\n\nThe company\u2019s new address will be on the doorstep of some of the government\u2019s largest contractors. Amazon already provides services for a wide range of government entities, including the Central Intelligence Agency. The prime real estate for the technology giant right across the bridge from the nation's capital means that contractors like the Defense Department, which is already considering a bid from Amazon for its cloud computing services, might be even more likely to count on their new neighbor's offerings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a potential game changer now that they have their headquarters in the shadows of the Pentagon,\u201d said Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and equity analyst. \u201cThis is really Bezos planting his flag and saying the federal government is going to be a big piece of our business.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nWith HQ2 soon housed near both government agencies and prominent defense contractors, Amazon will also be able to recruit people with technical talent who are open to working on government projects. Amazon arrives inside the Beltway as tech workers largely living in Silicon Valley have protested their companies\u2019 business ties to the military as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this year, Google announced it would not renew its AI contract with the Pentagon, known as Project Maven, after widespread backlash and employee resignations.\n\nBezos has taken a harder line, saying company leadership can\u2019t let employees call the shots. He said at a Wired conference last month that Amazon would continue to support the Defense Department.\n\n\u201cIf big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s commitment to the public sector apparently has been lucrative. Wedbush estimated that federal business has accounted for well over $2 billion in revenue for the technology company so far in 2018. It\u2019s a major area of growth for Amazon, the Wedbush analysts said, up from between $200 and $300 million in 2015.\n\nAbout $20 billion in federal cloud projects will be \u201cup for grabs\u201d in the next five years as the government transforms its systems, according to Wedbush. The firm predicted in a recent note that Amazon and Microsoft will be the front-runners vying against each other to win those deals.\n\nEven before confirming its HQ2 plans, Amazon was widely seen as the favorite to land one of the largest government IT contracts in years: a $10 billion effort to build a department-wide cloud computing infrastructure for DoD, known as the \"Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure\" or JEDI. Ives said the decision to open HQ2 in Crystal City is \u201ca potential ingredient\u201d that could sweeten Amazon\u2019s chances of winning the deal. He said JEDI is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d in the company\u2019s ambitions as a federal IT provider.\n\nBut continuing to win government contracts could be a double-edged sword for Amazon, whose business practices could come under increasing scrutiny from President Trump and federal regulators.\n\nTrump, in a November interview with Axios aired on HBO, said the administration is continuing to study Silicon Valley giants \u2014 including Amazon, Google and Facebook \u2014 for potential violations of antitrust laws.\n\nJohn Weiler, the managing director of the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, said he is concerned about Amazon\u2019s growing power and influence in Washington. He said the company\u2019s decision to open part of HQ2 in the Washington metro area was \u201ca cornerstone\u201d to its broader political strategy.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a book called, \u2018How to Take Over the Government,\u2019 \u201d Weiler said. \u201cThey perfectly played the game.\u201d\n\nWeiler was among the critics of the Pentagon\u2019s decision to go with a single cloud provider for the competitive $10 billion JEDI contract. On Wednesday, the Government Accountability Office ruled against a bid protest filed by Oracle, which criticized that decision, my colleagues Aaron Gregg and Christian Davenport reported.\n\nIBM also protested the bid, which the GAO is reviewing. A decision on the bid protest is expected by January, Aaron and Christian reported.\n\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, at a Washington Post Live Cybersecurity Summit on Oct. 31, 2012.\n\nPINGED: Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, told senators the Pentagon ought to switch the focus of its cybersecurity efforts from hygiene to \u201ccontinuously hunting\u201d hackers in its systems. \u201cImplementing security controls is hygiene. Patching vulnerabilities is hygiene. Building an asset inventory is hygiene,\u201d Alperovitch said in opening remarks at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Cybersecurity subcommittee. \u201cNo matter how good the department gets at these tasks, they alone will not accomplish the most important mission: Stopping foreign intelligence and military services from countries such as Russia and China from breaking into our networks.\u201d\n\nAlperovitch said the DoD's emphasis on cyber hygiene \u201ctoo often\u201d gets in the way of rooting out hackers from the agency's networks. He also said the Pentagon should emulate private companies' approach to cybersecurity, which includes \u201crapidly detecting and ejecting adversaries.\u201d\n\nIn his written statement to the committee, Alperovitch elaborated: \u201cHunting is assuming that adversaries are in your network and proactively searching for them by looking across your assets for indicators of malicious activity,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply investigating alerts generated by security tools is not hunting. Good hunters have an offensive mind-set and think like the adversary.\u201d\n\nKevin Mandia, chief executive of FireEye, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on March 30, 2017. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nPATCHED: FireEye said it expects increased activity from Chinese and Iranian hackers. In a report outlining several trends for 2019, the company predicted that Chinese espionage will accelerate over the next few years after Beijing reshuffled its cyber capabilities starting at least in 2016. \u201cWe assess that this reorganization will inform the growth and geographic expansion of Chinese cyber espionage activity through 2020 and beyond,\u201d the report said.\n\nFireEye also warned that Iranian threats could escalate following the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal. The firm said it expects Iran-linked hackers to \u201cresume probing critical infrastructure networks in preparation for potential operations in the future.\u201d However, \u201cdisruptive or destructive attacks on private companies\u201d in the United States appear unlikely \u201cin the immediate or near-term,\u201d according to FireEye.\n\nAdditionally, Kevin Mandia, FireEye's chief executive, said he anticipates that more governments across the world will seek to acquire offensive cyber capabilities. \u201cIn my travels, I have the privilege of meeting with government officials from around the globe, and in nearly every conversation I inevitably get the same question within the first 10 minutes,\u201d Mandia said in the report. \u201cWhether it be in the Middle East, Europe, Asia or North America, they ask how they can develop an offensive capability for their own nation.\u201d\n\nSheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, testifies during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 5. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nPWNED: Facebook's leaders largely failed to grasp the extent of Russia's disinformation efforts on the social network during the 2016 presidential election and then sought to play down the issue, according to a wide-ranging investigation by the New York Times's Sheera Frenkel, Nicholas Confessore, Cecilia Kang, Matthew Rosenberg and Jack Nicas. The reporters described a September 2017 meeting of top Facebook executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, during which Sandberg berated \u201cthe social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Sandberg lobbied Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who leads the panel's investigation into Russian interference, according to the Times. \u201cThe two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall,\u201d Frenkel, Confessore, Kang, Rosenberg and Nicas reported. \u201cWhile critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.\u201d Facebook said in a blog post that the Times story contains \u201ca number of inaccuracies.\u201d You can read Facebook's response here.\n\nFrom Confessore:\n\nPoint here: It's no accident Facebook has been slow to respond to abuse and disinformation on the platform.

Large cybersecurity conference like RSA in San Francisco or Black Hat in Las Vegas already attract thousands of attendees and influential cybersecurity leaders. But Ackerman says the summit aims to improve the dialogue around cybersecurity issues at a time when many conferences have become focused on marketing new cybersecurity products. Ackerman say he has a rule: no selling.

The sites are located in nine governorates including the capital Sanaa, Aden, and the eastern governorate of Marib.\n\n\u201cThe war in Yemen has impacted everything and has not spared the lives of Yemenis and their cultural property, including their rich history, unifying culture and collective memory,\u201d said Radhya al-Mutawakel, who heads Mawatana. \u201cIt is not only a loss for Yemenis, but also for the cultural heritage of all peoples.\u201d\n\nThe report covers airstrikes and other attacks since mid-2014, when Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels descended from their highlands and occupied most of the northern region. Houthis forced the legitimate government to flee the country and seek military intervention from gulf neighbors. In March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition backing the government waged an extensive air campaign against Houthis and imposed a land, sea and air embargo. Within a few months, the coalition pushed the Houthis out of the southern region while the north remained in the Houthis\u2019 grip.\n\nAmong the sites that have been damaged is the Old City section of the capital Sanaa, which is on the UNESCO list of world heritage sites. It has come under heavy airstrikes several times that have demolished many of the area\u2019s ancient buildings.\n\nIn many cases, Houthis turned some of the archaeological sites into army barracks, resulting in the Saudi-led coalition striking the sites, causing heavy damage to the ancient monuments.\n\nOn other occasions, extremist groups operating in the country blew up churches, temples and ancient Sufi shrines, exploiting the state of lawlessness and the breakdown of order in the country after years of the war.\n\nThe Mawatana organization accused all parties to the conflict of having \u201ca hostile attitude toward history.\u201d It urged the international community to take responsibility for the protection of the cultural heritage of Yemen saying that parties are acting with impunity because of a lack of accountability. It added there is a need to place archaeological sites and monuments on an \u201cenhanced protection\u201d list adopted by the 1999 Hague Convention to prevent attacks against them and protect them from being used as military barracks or sites.\n\nThe report also points to the war\u2019s impact on the massive Marib dam, which is nearly 3,000 years old and one of the world\u2019s oldest. Built of stone cut from the mountains, Yemenis take pride in the dam because it is a symbol of their ancient civilization. The northern gate of the dam was struck in May 2015 by coalition forces as Houthis took positions near the site.\n\nBaraqish was a religious and commercial hub in the 5th century B.C. It features prominent temples and was a center for Yemen\u2019s famed frankincense trade. Houthis took control of the site in mid-August 2015. Mawatana quoted witnesses as saying they turned the site into a place for weapons caches, causing the coalition to target it more than once. The Houthis also booby-trapped the sites, according to the report.\n\nKnown as the Manhattan of the Desert, the ancient site of Shibam in the southern governorate of Hadramawt sustained damage after Islamic State insurgents rammed a bomb-laden car through a checkpoint outside the city and the explosions caused damage to some of the buildings.\n\nOther sites mentioned in the report include the fortress at Kawkaban, the al-Hadi mosque in Saada and the military museum in Aden. Two Taiz landmarks \u2014 the al-Sudi and al-Rumaymeh domes \u2014 were totally destroyed by extremist groups, according to the report. In Dar al-Hajar palace in Lahj, Houthi rebels used artillery and tanks to shell the sites, causing extensive damage.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn Sunday, the Vatican ordered U.S. bishops to stop considering proposals about how to respond when bishops are accused of sexual abuses. Those proposals were on this week\u2019s agenda at the fall gathering of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore.\n\nWhy were the bishops considering action now? For several reasons. This summer, the Vatican removed retired Archbishop Theodore McCarrick from ministry after finding that allegations that he had sexually abused young men were credible. In August, the Pennsylvania attorney general released a grand jury report revealing extensive clerical sex abuse in the state, prompting several other state attorneys general to investigate church abuse records. The resulting public outcry put tremendous pressure on the bishops to act decisively.\n\n[Regular churchgoing doesn\u2019t make Trump voters more moderate. It makes them more enthusiastic for Trump.]\n\nWhat were the bishops going to do?\n\nOn Monday, the bishops planned to address a key gap in their response to clerical sex abuse: how to deal with allegations against bishops. The U.S. Roman Catholic Church had, in 2002, released a directive on best practices for reporting and responding to sex abuse, called the \u201c Dallas Charter. \u201d But it did not include rules for bishops.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 Baltimore agenda , according to the Jesuit magazine America, included:\n\nApproving new \u201cStandards of Episcopal Conduct\u201d for bishops, the creation of a new commission to handle allegations of abuse against bishops, and new protocols for bishops who are removed or who resign from office due to sexual misconduct with adults or minors.\n\nWhy did the Vatican halt the vote?\n\nThe many possible reasons all arise from the complicated dynamics of Catholic Church governance. For one, the church has come to see clerical sex abuse as a global issue , not a problem isolated in a few countries such as Ireland or the United States. The church has thus increasingly seen the need for a global solution. The Vatican might be hoping that a more united front will emerge from a February 2019 meeting of bishops that it has called on this issue.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 proposals might also have run afoul of the clergy/laity distinction in the Catholic Church, as one proposal would assign a lay commission the authority to investigate allegations against bishops \u2014 which the Vatican may have considered as going too far. While many U.S. and European Catholics regularly call for lay people to be more directly involved in church governance, many Vatican leaders think the bishops themselves should oversee reforms .\n\nBut what is most likely is that the pope, and the pope alone, has the responsibility of overseeing the bishops. The Vatican would want to seriously scrutinize any proposals to dilute that papal authority. Some Catholic reporting outlets have suggested that Vatican insiders think the bishops\u2019 proposals may violate church law or that the Vatican did not have enough time to review the proposals. Those suggest concerns about the pope\u2019s primacy.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the Vatican is trying to shift the bishops away from seeing new institutions as a solution to the crisis. Pope Francis tends to play down the importance of institutions; for instance, he argues in his letter Evangelii Gaudium that it is fruitless to create institutions without engendering \u201cnew convictions and attitudes.\u201d The Vatican commission set up to investigate clergy sexual abuse has itself been criticized for controversy and inactivity. As one U.S. bishop noted, the pope could be asking the bishops to take greater account of the bishops\u2019 own \u201cneed for personal conversion\u201d that would lead them from \u201cecclesial power\u201d to \u201ctrue servant leadership.\u201d In other words, Pope Francis may think the resolution will come through changes in attitudes, not only or primarily through new institutions.\n\n[The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is trying to withdraw from Moscow\u2019s control. The Kremlin is not happy.]\n\nWhat does this say about the relationship between the Vatican and the U.S. bishops?\n\nThroughout his papacy, Francis has advocated a \u201csound \u2018decentralization\u2019 \u201d of the church\u2019s power, at two levels. First, he has increased the consultative role of cardinals and bishops in his governance as pope, an approach known as \u201c collegiality .\u201d The pope has even explored giving bishops more decision-making authority, particularly through meetings known as \u201csynods.\u201d\n\nSecond, the pope has advanced a notion of \u201c synodality \u201d: the idea that all of the church \u2014 parishioners along with priests and bishops \u2014 should be integral agents in its mission and governance. This pushes against the \u201cclericalism\u201d that values clergy more than lay people. Francis, for instance, included many young lay people in a recent meeting of bishops.\n\nSome saw his September decision not to intervene in the U.S. abuse crisis as evidence of this desire to devolve more decision-making to the bishops. But the Vatican appears to be signaling that issues surrounding papal authority or the role of the laity might be nonnegotiable. The Vatican, in other words, seems to be setting a limit to synodality and collegiality \u2014 and reemphasizing its own supremacy.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThis complication raises expectations for the February meeting of bishops at the Vatican. But that meeting will not deliver a final decision. Its conclusions will probably be subject to review and debate by national conferences of bishops.\n\nThis delay also risks further loss of public trust in the Catholic Church. In January 2018, 45 percent of U.S. Catholics felt that Francis was doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job of handling the sex abuse crisis, according to the Pew Research Center, while 46 percent felt his performance was \u201conly fair\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d By September 2018, after the devastating summer revelations, the approval rating had dropped to 31 percent and disapproval had risen to 62 percent. Already, activists are protesting the Vatican\u2019s decision to halt the bishops\u2019 deliberations. Francis remains popular, but this scandal may be starting to diminish that popularity.\n\n[Most news coverage of Muslims is negative. But not when it\u2019s about devotion.]\n\nAmid this uncertainty, one thing is clear. The relationship between the pope and the bishops will continue to play a large role in the Catholic response to those abuses.\n\nBill McCormick (@BMcCSJ) is an assistant professor of political science at Saint Louis University and works on religion and politics."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Veterans aren't getting their GI Bill payments \u2014 because VA's 50-year-old computer system broke", "description": "Thousands of veterans using the GI Bill have been put under financial strain after VA's computer systems buckled under complex new rules.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2018/11/15/veterans-arent-getting-their-gi-bill-payments-because-vas-year-old-computer-system-broke/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:00:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nDaniel Gorman in Iraq.

As a result, scores of veterans waited weeks or months to be paid, and have fallen victim to the agency\u2019s decades-old technology that advocates and lawmakers have warned for months would do precisely what it did \u2014 fail.\n\nNow some veterans are still struggling to overcome financial straits after they took out loans or put expenses on credit cards. And advocates are concerned veterans are taking on financial burdens on top of other challenges, such as mental health and balancing school with family.\n\nThe House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Thursday raked VA for \u201cmassive failures\u201d as agency officials struggled to articulate what progress they made since the problems materialized in August.\n\nPaul R. Lawrence, VA\u2019s top benefits official, told lawmakers it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to provide earlier estimates for completing the fixes and said that VA would not provide another timetable for when its technology issues would be resolved.\n\n\u201cDr. Lawrence, not very encouraging,\u201d Rep.

He declined to elaborate, citing privacy issues.\n\n[The Army is trying to find criminal conduct among immigrant recruits, email shows]\n\nVA has sought to downplay the issue, saying it has returned to a normal workload processing GI Bill benefit claims. But the number of veterans waiting more than 60 days for their payments \u2014 1,000 \u2014 ballooned 10 percent since Wednesday, according to updated figures the agency presented to lawmakers. VA has said it focused on addressing older claims first.\n\nAbout 10,000 student veterans have waited between one and two months to receive payments, VA said.\n\nOther student veterans, such as Gorman, have been underpaid. He was set to receive $631 a month while studying full-time.

Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), the committee\u2019s chairman, said Thursday.\n\nIn October alone, 1,000 students under financial hardship called a VA hotline for immediate help, said Curt Cashour, VA\u2019s spokesman.\n\nThe issue stems from two changes to how claims are processed, Cashour said. Payments are now tied to campus Zip codes, eliminating many overpayments. Other recalculations were designed to offset costs of additional education programs.\n\nBut those formulas proved too much for VA systems to handle.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the law requires a 50-year-old IT platform that was designed to do the equivalent of basic math to instead perform something akin to calculus in short order,\u201d Cashour said.\n\nAbout 450,000 veterans have been affected, although VA hasn\u2019t explained the depth of their issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking myself, are we destined to live with these IT problems regardless of how much taxpayer money we invest? It\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s shameful,\u201d J.

He is relocating from the agency\u2019s central offices in Washington to become executive director of VA\u2019s regional office in Houston, a move that\u2019s expected to take place in January. \u201cRob chose to take this opportunity,\u201d Cashour said.\n\nThe title of the July hearing \u2014 \u201cIs VA Ready for August 1st?\u201d \u2014 reflected a concern over the hundreds of thousands of veterans heading to school.\n\nIt was also a question.\n\n\u201cThe resounding answer was no,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, the assistant director of policy at Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie acknowledged the widespread failures in a Sept. 27 hearing, telling lawmakers that \u201ceven something as simple as changing the percentages broke the system.\u201d\n\nVA, which received nearly $200 billion in funding this year, delayed implementation until it could solve its issues.\n\n[U.S. military edge has eroded to \u2018a dangerous degree,\u2019 study for Congress finds]\n\nProblems have persisted. Roe told Wilkie in a Nov. 5 letter that his staff\u2019s visit to a VA processing center yielded disturbing findings. Crashes and latency problems over six months wasted 16,890 man hours, according to the letter.\n\nThat totals nearly two years.\n\nWhen asked why VA relies on ancient computer systems, Cashour pointed to the Veterans' Affairs committees, suggesting it was a funding issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that VA is blaming Congress for its IT issues, especially given the fact that Congress just passed the largest VA budget in history,\u201d said Molly Jenkins, a House VA committee spokeswoman, calling the agency\u2019s IT failures \u201cinexcusable, decades-long and well-documented.\"\n\nVA was allotted $30 million to improve its system, Jenkins said, adding that the agency was six months late with a required progress update.\n\n\"[VA] sounded no alarms in their May 2018 report that there would be any delays at all,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nConsulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton helped implement the processing system. Richard Crowe, a senior vice president at the firm, told lawmakers the company has not invoiced VA for its work on the project.\n\nAssociated costs have soared. VA marshaled a battalion of 202 additional employees to process education claims at a cost of $4.5 million since August, Stars and Stripes reported, although the problems remain unsolved.\n\nVeterans have left scores of angry messages on VA social media channels.\n\n\u201cHow long can this take to fix?\u201d Jon Shirah asked on the agency\u2019s GI Bill Facebook page Nov. 5. \u2033It\u2019s been over 2 months without pay.\u201d\n\nA staffer for the American Legion, rather than VA, contacted Shirah to help.\n\nAdvocates have criticized VA for waiting months to alert veterans of the problem and suggest the agency could have warned veterans to prepare for financial challenges.\n\n[U.S. hostage envoy urges Iran and Russia to help free journalist taken captive in Syria 6 years ago]\n\nVA issued an alert Oct. 10, apologizing for delays and conceding it caused \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d for veterans. The bulletin also included a plea to universities not to penalize veterans for late payments.\n\nVA\u2019s announcements were news to former Navy helicopter pilot Stephanie Erwin, now a doctoral candidate at George Washington University. She first heard from her school \u2014 not VA \u2014 that massive problems were occurring.\n\nHer housing payments of around $2,300 did not show up for two months. She relied on savings to stay afloat. \u201cA lot of veterans are hesitant to raise their hand and ask for help,\u201d she said.\n\nBut her savings dwindled, and grants awarded to her were locked by the school because VA had not paid her tuition. Those grants helped pay for food and medical insurance. Erwin asked for help from the American Legion on Nov. 5.\n\nVA issued her payments around Veterans Day.\n\nAgency officials told lawmakers that VA was confident the agency could resolve its technology issues by the spring semester.\n\nRoe, the committee chairman, was asked if the hearing changed his certainty that VA could finish the mission by then.\n\n\u201cI was not confident,\u201d Roe told The Washington Post by phone after the hearing concluded. \u201cAnd I am not confident it will be solved.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDecades after \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 Pentagon looks back to the future on missile defense\n\nAt the border, uncertainty about the migrant caravan and military concertina wire"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Hungary: No help given Macedonia ex-leader to leave homeland", "description": "The Hungarian government says it did not assist the fugitive former prime minister of Macedonia in leaving his homeland", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/hungary-no-help-given-macedonia-ex-leader-to-leave-homeland/2018/11/15/2f1fda72-e8cd-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:54:20Z", "content": "BUDAPEST, Hungary The Hungarian government says it did not assist the fugitive former prime minister of Macedonia in leaving his homeland.

(AP)\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor released the findings of a long-awaited investigation of the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Thursday, saying that a team of Saudi agents dispatched to Istanbul with orders to bring him home alive had instead killed the journalist and dismembered his body.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had no knowledge of the operation, Shaalan al-Shaalan, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said at a news conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n\nHe said that 11 suspects have been indicted and that authorities are seeking the death penalty for five of them. None of the suspects were named. The order to kill Khashoggi, who had criticized the Saudi monarchy over the past year, came from one of the leaders of the Saudi team in Istanbul, Shaalan said.\n\nProsecutor Saud al-Mojeb\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the killing was authorized by relatively low-level officials who disobeyed orders and acted on the fly \u2014 contradicted assertions by Turkish investigators, who have said it was a meticulously planned operation, with elaborate preparations to cover up the crime that included scouting locations where Khashoggi\u2019s body could be disposed of in secret.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the slaying was premeditated and the orders came from \u201cthe highest levels of the Saudi government,\u201d without specifying exactly who was responsible.\n\n[U.S. announces sanctions against 17 Saudis for alleged roles in killing of Jamal Khashoggi, including senior aide to crown prince]\n\nTurkey has called for an international investigation into the killing. On Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that some of the latest Saudi statements about the killing were not \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not something that happens instantaneously,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople and tools were brought to dismember the body.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post, was killed Oct. 2, soon after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents he needed to remarry.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said Thursday that it would impose sanctions on 17 individuals linked to the \u201cabhorrent killing.\u201d On the list was Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the consul general of the Istanbul mission, Mohammad al-Otaibi.\n\n\u201cThese individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement.\n\nOfficials in several countries have said it is unlikely that Khashoggi was killed without the knowledge of the crown prince, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader. But there is no definitive evidence that Mohammed ordered the operation. Saudi officials deny that the crown prince was in any way responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHe did not have any knowledge,\u201d Shaalan said Thursday.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir described the killing as a \u201cmistake\u201d and denied any involvement on the part of Mohammed. \u201cHis royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue,\u201d Jubeir he told reporters in Riyadh.\n\nMojeb\u2019s statement Thursday implicated two higher-level officials in what the prosecutor said was an operation intended either to persuade or force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia. One of them, Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of intelligence, issued an order for Khashoggi\u2019s return on Sept. 29, the prosecutor said. That was one day after Khashoggi first visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and was told to return the following week.\n\nQahtani, on the U.S. sanctions list Thursday, was also involved in planning Khashoggi\u2019s repatriation, according to the prosecutor.\n\n[Crown prince under scrutiny in journalist\u2019s killing as Saudis search for explanation]\n\nSaudi officials have changed their story about Khashoggi\u2019s killing several times since he disappeared, first denying any knowledge of his whereabouts and then saying that he was killed during a fistfight.\n\nIn the latest version laid out by the prosecutor, a 15-member team was formed to bring Khashoggi back from Istanbul, \u201cby means of persuasion, and if persuasion fails, to do so by force.\u201d The team included a forensic expert \u201cfor the purpose of removing evidence from the scene in case force had to be used to return the victim,\u201d according to a summary of the prosecutor\u2019s statement that was emailed to reporters.\n\nThe leader of the Saudi team also contacted a collaborator in Turkey to secure a safe house in case Khashoggi was forcibly removed, the statement said. But after deciding that moving Khashoggi to a safe house would not be possible, a team leader decided to kill the journalist, according to the prosecutor.\n\n\u201cThe investigation concluded that the crime was carried out after a physical altercation with the victim where he was forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death, may Allah bless his soul,\u201d the statement said.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s body was dismembered and then taken by one of the Saudi agents to the \u201clocal collaborator,\u201d according to the prosecutor, who said a sketch of the collaborator has been produced.\n\nTurkish officials have complained repeatedly about Saudi Arabia\u2019s refusal to identify the collaborator and said they suspect that such a person does not exist. They have also demanded that the Saudis reveal the whereabouts of Khashoggi\u2019s remains.\n\nTurkey\u2019s prosecutor said late last month that Khashoggi was strangled or suffocated as soon as he entered the consulate, in line with \u201cpremeditated plans.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s eldest son, Salah Khashoggi, announced Thursday on Twitter that the family would receive condolence visits beginning Friday.\n\nLouisa Loveluck and Zeynep Karatas contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nErdogan says audio of Khashoggi killing given to U.S., Saudis, Europeans\n\nSaudi attempts to distance crown prince from Khashoggi killing not quieted uproar\n\nRead Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s columns for The Washington Post\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Messy mix of light snow, freezing rain and sleet hits DC region - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Messy mix of light snow, freezing rain and sleet hits DC region Washington Post The Washington region awoke Thursday morning to a messy mix of light snow, freezing rain and sleet, as several area schools closed or delayed their openings.

Along with Morris, the breakout country star, and Staples, the gospel legend, the group lent their powerhouse vocals to \u201cFriendship\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There.\u201d Stapleton\u2019s wife, Morgane, joined in, along with Marty Stuart and a gospel choir.\n\nThe crowd went wild: While \u201cFriendship\u201d is a track on Stapleton\u2019s CMA-nominated album, it was originally recorded by Staples\u2019s father, Pops Staples. \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There\u201d is the 1972 hit from Staples\u2019s family band, the Staple Singers. And now we have likely broken a record for the number of times a variation on the word \u201cstaple\u201d has been used in a single news story.\n\n\n\nChris Stapleton, from left, Maren Morris, Mavis Staples and Morgane Stapleton perform \"I'll Take You There\" at the 52nd annual CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena on Wednesday in Nashville.

So Brooks was all, \u201cCool, then I just won\u2019t perform anything.\u201d Lo and behold, the CMA producers apparently changed their mind, because Brooks appeared on stage, and debuted a song called \u201cStronger Than Me.\u201d What a power move!\n\nAlthough sleepy acoustic ballads can be mood-killers, this was actually pretty sweet. (Sample lyrics: \u201cIf I have a choice, I\u2019d pray God takes me first, cause you\u2019re stronger than me.\u201d) The camera panned back and forth between Brooks and Yearwood to the point where it felt almost too intimate of a moment.

Except it didn\u2019t make sense, because the show had just started, and no one was bored; both Urban and Stapleton looked confused when they were called out.\n\nEven a cameo from viral country sensation Mason Ramsey couldn\u2019t help. There were also far too many lame jokes about Underwood\u2019s pregnancy, such as guessing the identity of the father. When they were poking fun at the many country singers opening bars in downtown Nashville, Paisley said, \u201cIn 2019, I hear Carrie is going to be opening her very own milk bar.\u201d (\u201cFor a very exclusive clientele!\u201d she added.)\n\nHowever, we will give them credit for the joke about trying to copy the Emmys, and have someone propose on stage.\n\n\u201cCarrie, that\u2019s not our style.

(AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChina is now in full celebration mode, commemorating four decades since it turned away from Mao Zedong Thought and toward Reform and Opening Up \u2014 the blend of market and socialist policies initiated in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping that the Communist Party credits for \u201cgiving the Chinese people growth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nAround China, state media, schools, museums, even the Beijing Symphony Orchestra, are hailing the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the country\u2019s development path.

Here\u2019s what that means.]\n\nBeyond the pomp, for more than a decade scholars have been raising questions about the official narrative that credits policies adopted after 1978 for China\u2019s rapid economic growth. Along with Chris Bramall, Lynn T. White III, Huaiyin Li, Louis Putterman, Marc Blecher, Mobo Gao, Han Dongping and Sigrid Schmalzer, this year I, too, joined the growing chorus.\n\nUsing previously inaccessible data, my book, \u201cRed China\u2019s Green Revolution,\u201d reveals that the foundations of China\u2019s rapid growth trace back to its rural collectives, known as the People\u2019s Communes, which spurred a green revolution in agriculture in the 1970s. This new scholarship has identified three widely accepted myths about the Reform and Opening Up narrative:\n\nMyth No. 1: Low commune productivity led farmers to abandon collective agriculture and return to household farming.\n\nThis simply wasn\u2019t the case. Newly uncovered national, provincial and county-level data on grain and pig production reveal that sizable and sustained increases in agricultural productivity began after the 1970 Northern Districts Agricultural Conference. Under Premier Zhou Enlai\u2019s leadership, this six-week gathering initiated extensive reforms of the collective remuneration and agricultural research and extension systems that made the commune far more productive in the 1970s than it was in the previous decade.\n\n[Xi Jinping is visiting Africa this week. Here\u2019s why China is such a popular development partner.]\n\nNor was the decision to launch agricultural reforms made by farmers, as the official account claims, but rather by China\u2019s top leaders, because it helped them consolidate their political power. In December 1978, Communist Party Chairman Hua Guofeng and his pro-commune allies lost a bitter power struggle to Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping and his pro-reform faction. The reformers ended Maoist indoctrination and collective remuneration, reintroduced household family farming and ultimately destroyed the communes. Just as rural residents were forced into communes in 1958, they were forced out of them after 1978.\n\nMyth No. 2: The government allowed rural markets and private enterprises only after Reform and Opening Up.\n\n\u201cThe private economy disappeared in China for more than two decades until the Third Plenum \u2026 in 1978, which approved the restoration of a non-public economic sector,\u201d the South China Morning Post recently reported. This too is incorrect. After 1961, private household production, small-scale animal husbandry and cottage industries, and rural markets (\u8d76\u96c6), collectively known as the Three Small Freedoms (\u4e09\u81ea), were legal and commonplace throughout the Chinese countryside. Rural markets were an important outlet for excess sideline production (except grain), which was households\u2019 primary source of vegetables, protein, and cash. After 1978, rural markets and private enterprises were greatly expanded in size and scope.\n\nMyth No. 3: Reform and Opening Up launched an ethos of development that industrialized rural China.\n\nThe nationwide propagandization of economic development began with the disastrous Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) and continued with the Dazhai Model until 1978. Under Dazhai, cadres used Mao\u2019s collectivist ideology to create a national ethic of self-sacrifice for national development. After 1970, a worker\u2019s industriousness, expertise and willingness to sacrifice for the collective became key determinants of his or her redness.\n\nRather than cash payments, communes used \u201cworkpoints\u201d to disguise the extraction of household resources to support investments in tractors, fertilizer, hybrid seeds, irrigation networks and other \u201cproduction costs\u201d (\u751f\u4ea7\u8d39\u7528). Between 1976 and 1979, rural investment averaged more than 7 billion RMB annually, but by 1982 it had fallen to below 5 billion RMB. By 1986, investment in agriculture was at the lowest point since 1949 and, notes economist Nicholas Lardy, can \u201cclearly be ruled out as a source of growth acceleration in agriculture since 1978.\u201d\n\nWhy do these myths matter?\n\nChina\u2019s national amnesia regarding the sources of its own material success means that those who came of age during or after the 1980s generally regard their elders as part of the \u201clost\u201d Cultural Revolution generation and thus undervalue their contributions and sacrifices.\n\n[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]\n\nAt the highest level, this means that nationwide rural reforms advanced by Deng and his supporters 40 years ago have received too much credit for China\u2019s rapid economic growth, while extensive investments made under his predecessors (e.g., Zhou Enlai and Hua Guofeng) have received too little. But there\u2019s a far bigger problem at the grass-roots level. In 2013, China had 50 million \u201cleft behind\u201d elderly \u2014 an aging rural population largely abandoned as their children left to work in cities.\n\nA study by Liu Yanwu at Wuhan University examined this population in 40 villages in 11 provinces and found the suicide rate among the rural elderly had risen from 100 per 100,000 to 500 per 100,000 over the past two decades. The suicide rate for elderly rural residents is now 50 times higher than the general population \u2014 a phenomenon Liu associates with a lack of social security.\n\nThere are consequences for China\u2019s foreign relations as well. Every day the country welcomes more foreign students eager to learn about China\u2019s development experience, and in September more than 50 African presidents were feted at the development-driven Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Dispelling the myths of China\u2019s development story means acknowledging that China\u2019s success was born out of painstaking investments in agricultural modernization, and a nationwide commitment to vocational education and basic health care.\n\nAn economy that can top $30 billion in a single day of online sales is not the product of a \u201cChina miracle,\u201d or a unique \u201cChinese model,\u201d as Zhang Weiying at Peking University expertly observed. Rather, China in 2018 is the result of a national development saga that began \u2014 as it did in Britain, the United States and other developed countries \u2014 with a green revolution in agriculture.\n\nJoshua Eisenman is assistant professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at University of Texas at Austin and Senior Fellow for China Studies at the American Foreign Policy Council."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Saudi prosecutor seeks death penalty in Khashoggi's killing", "description": "Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor seeks death penalty for 5 charged with ordering, killing Saudi writer Khashoggi", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-in-khashoggis-killing/2018/11/15/146ca5d2-e8c5-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:56:19Z", "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabias top prosecutor is recommending the death penalty for five suspects charged with ordering and carrying out the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.

Saud Al-Mojeb, Saudi Arabia\u2019s top prosecutor, is recommending the death penalty for five suspects charged with ordering and carrying out the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi. Al-Mojeb told a press conference in Riyadh Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018, that Khashoggi\u2019s killers had been planning the operation since September 29, three days before he was killed inside the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. (J. Scott Applewhite, File/Associated Press)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Saudi Arabia will seek the death penalty against five men suspected of killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its top prosecutor said Thursday, while the U.S. slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi officials in the toughest action it has taken against the kingdom since the slaying.\n\nThe Saudi moves failed to appease Turkey, which has put increasing pressure on its regional rival since Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul last month, but they could be enough for some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Western allies to move on and press for key demands, such as an end to the war in Yemen.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom\u2019s leadership, primarily Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officials and analysts say an operation of this kind could not have happened without the prince\u2019s knowledge.\n\nPressed by Western journalists in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s top diplomat said the crown prince had \u201cabsolutely\u201d nothing to do with the slaying of The Washington Post columnist, who was sharply critical of the heir to the throne.\n\nThe Saudi investigation pointed the finger at some members of the crown prince\u2019s inner circle but stopped short of accusing them of ordering the writer\u2019s death. Those closest to the prince are instead accused of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s forced return in an operation at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul that the Saudis allege went awry.\n\nIn a news conference, Sheikh Shalan al-Shalan, the deputy attorney general, said the killing was ordered by an individual whom he did not identify but said was responsible for negotiating Khashoggi\u2019s return back to Saudi Arabia from Turkey. The individual was part of a 15-man team that was made up of negotiators, intelligence officers and logistics officials.\n\nThat team was formed by Saud al-Qahtani, who was one of the crown prince\u2019s closest aides, and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, the prosecutor said. Both men were close to the crown prince and fired from their posts after the killing.\n\nThey deemed Khashoggi\u2019s presence abroad as \u201ca threat to national security,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nKhashoggi had gone for a scheduled visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fianc\u00e9e waited outside.\n\nAl-Shalan said that on that morning, the leader of the negotiating team that confronted Khashoggi inside the consulate saw that he would not be able to force him to return, \u201cso he decided to kill him in the moment.\u201d\n\nThis appears to contradict a previous Saudi statement quoting Turkish intelligence as saying the killing had been premeditated \u2014 one of several shifting narratives about the case that have come from the kingdom.\n\nThe Saudi investigators stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s killing, bolstering previous Saudi assertions it was carried out by rogue agents who overstepped their authority.\n\nThe prosecutor said the agents sent in Istanbul drugged and killed the writer in the consulate before dismembering the body and giving it to an unidentified local collaborator for disposal. The body has not been found.\n\nChief prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb said that of the 21 people in custody, 11 have been indicted and referred to trial, adding that he would seek the death penalty against five of the suspects. It\u2019s not unusual for a Saudi prosecutor to seek the death penalty before a trial.\n\nIn Washington, the U.S. Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials whom it said were responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those targeted for sanctions were al-Qahtani and Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate. Also named was Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince\u2019s entourage on trips abroad.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, appearing at a news conference after the prosecutor spoke, told reporters the crown prince had nothing to do with the killing.\n\nAl-Jubeir said the kingdom is investigating and holding those responsible to account \u201cto make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes mistakes happen ... sometimes people exceed their authority,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid the international outrage over the killing, Saudi Arabia has faced increased calls from the West to end the war in Yemen, which the crown prince launched as defense minister with other Arab countries in March 2015.\n\nSimon Henderson, who has written extensively on the crown prince for The Washington Institute, said that despite the horrific killing, the West still must deal with Saudi Arabia because of its strategic position in terms of oil exports and the crucial role that plays in the stability of the world economy.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the case that MBS is still the present and the future for Saudi Arabia, which I think it is, we have to maintain a working relationship with him,\u201d Henderson said, referring to the crown prince by his initials.\n\nSome Saudi allies appear ready to accept the narrative put forth by the kingdom in the absence of any \u201csmoking gun\u201d directly linking the crown prince to the murder, said H.A. Hellyer, an expert with the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about plausible deniability. If you can have plausible deniability, then I think a lot of Riyadh\u2019s partners will go for it,\u201d Hellyer said.\n\nThe latest Saudi account, however, did little to satisfy Turkish officials, who insist the killing and its cover-up were carried out by the highest levels of government. Through a series of orchestrated leaks, including audio of the killing shared with Western intelligence, Turkey has tried to keep pressure on the crown prince.\n\n\u201cThose who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The attack almost wiped out the company of American soldiers, killing 48 of them in a rare victory in a war that the Philippines would end up losing.\n\nThe U.S. commander\u2019s response was swift. He ordered the killing of all Filipino males above the age of 10 who were involved in fighting U.S. forces. The Americans razed the town of Balangiga, which had been abandoned, and took home the three church bells as war booty.\n\nMore than a century after one of the most gruesome clashes of the Philippine-American war, the \u201cBalangiga Bells\u201d are officially being returned to the Philippines.\n\nSpeaking at an Air Force base close to Cheyenne, Wyo., where two of the three bells are located, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the return of the bells will \u201csmooth the bonds that were tested but never broken by war.\u201d\n\n\u201cBear these bells home back to their Catholic Church, confident that America\u2019s ironclad alliance with the Philippines is stronger than ever,\u201d Mattis said to Jose Manuel Romualdez, the Philippine ambassador to the United States, who was present at the ceremony. The last of the three bells, located at a U.S. Army museum in South Korea, has already been prepared for its return.\n\nThe two bells in Wyoming will first be shipped to a facility in Philadelphia, before joining the third bell in South Korea. All three are expected back in the Philippines by the end of the year.\n\nThe Philippines, a close U.S. ally, has been urging the United States for decades to return the bells, a symbol of national pride. Campaigners who lobbied to return the bells told Philippine television networks that U.S. veterans' organizations eventually came around to the belief that the bells belonged in the Philippines, and their support helped facilitate the eventual return.\n\nBut the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, the strongman Philippine leader who has tried to move his country away from its traditional alliance with the United States, has already started claiming the victory as his own.\n\nDuterte has lobbied for the return of the bells and has said he would not visit the United States until they were back. Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of regional summits in Singapore, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teddy Locsin Jr., who was previously his country\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said he had brought up the issue with Nikki Haley, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nHe also told Haley that Duterte would not visit the United States until the bells were returned.\n\n\u201cLater on, throughout the year, she\u2019d call me aside and say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve brought it up with Mattis, and Mattis said as far as the Defense Department goes, we are okay,\u2019\u201d Locsin said, recounting a conversation he had with Haley earlier in the year.\n\nThe diplomatic gesture comes at a pivotal time for relations between the Philippines and the United States. Duterte, a populist president, has cozied up to China since his election in 2016, and he will host Chinese President Xi Jinping in Manila later this month on Xi\u2019s first visit to the country. Meanwhile, Duterte has described the United States as \u201clousy\" and vowed to never go there during his term. His brand of politics has marked a major turning point for the United States in the Philippines, a country that was once its most reliable ally in the region.\n\nNow that the bells are on their way back though, Locsin said, Duterte may have to visit Washington after all.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming back, so he will have to go there, to the United States, if that was the condition he made,\u201d Locsin said. he added that he had reminded the Philippine president of the exchange with Haley.

(Matthew Gage and Martin Taylor)\n\nOne of the ways that heat kills is by increasing pressure in the skull, constricting blood flow to the brain. Damaged tissue can also enter the bloodstream and cause kidney failure. At a certain point, an elevated internal temperature simply incinerates cells in the body.\n\nIn contrast to extreme weather events so visible and violent that they hardly escape public notice, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, heat waves are more of a \u201csilent killer,\u201d as the National Weather Service has called the prolonged periods of hot weather.\n\nBut kill they certainly do. Heat fatalities in the United States exceed all other weather-related deaths in the 30 years since such data has been available. In the U.K., Parliament\u2019s Environmental Audit Committee recently warned of 7,000 annual deaths by heat by 2050 unless quick action is taken, the need for which was underscored by last month\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.\n\nHeat doesn\u2019t just kill. It is also diminishes the vitality of sperm, curtailing the capacity to reproduce, as scientists have documented.\n\n\u201cHeatwaves reduce male fertility and sperm competitiveness, and successive heatwaves almost sterilise males,\u201d wrote the authors of a study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed Nature Communications.\n\nBut the research points newly to an even longer-lasting effect. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, found that heat stress appears to be associated with transgenerational fertility problems.\n\nThat means that organisms may bear the effects of elevated temperatures long after the initial exposure \u2014 in the form of reduced lifespans, reproductive challenges and other types of defects passed to offspring.\n\nThe scientists found that heat waves undermine sperm production and viability, and also interfere with movement through the female. They further discovered that extreme heat \u201creduced reproductive potential and lifespan of offspring when fathered by males, or sperm, that had experienced heatwaves.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used red flour beetles to test sensitivity to temperature in cold-blooded ectotherms, species that don\u2019t regulate their own body temperature, in contrast to endotherms, such as humans. Warm-blooded mammals have been the primary focus of existing research on warming and sperm quality, their paper noted.\n\nThey set out to fill this gap, while nevertheless finding applications to the human case. Most terrestrial species are insects, and most life on Earth is cold-blooded, making the findings especially relevant to the question of climate change\u2019s effect on biodiversity. As the lead author, Matthew Gage, observed in an accompanying blog post on the study, \u201cwe know that insect numbers are crashing, but we understand remarkably little about the particular mechanisms driving population declines.\u201d\n\nTo examine one possible mechanism, reproduction, the scientists exposed mature adult beetles to experimental heat waves lasting five days at about 40 to 42 degrees Celsius, or about 104 to 107.5 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 above their optimum by about 10 degrees. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that these temperatures have been exceeded in the natural environment in half the world\u2019s countries over recent years,\u201d Gage wrote. Each male was paired with a female for 15 minutes, before being transferred to the next mate.\n\nMale reproductive reproductive performance halved after a first heat wave. After a second, males became almost completely sterile \u2014 contradicting theories of acclimation or hardening as a response to environmental stress.\n\nMeanwhile, female potential was unchanged. However, inseminated sperm already within the female tract were vulnerable to elevated heat, and caused a reduction in female fertility by one-third.\n\nMost surprising, Gage told The Post, was the effect they observed across generations.\n\n\u201cIt suggests there could be problems for sons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that in humans, heat can damage sperm DNA, and we know that men with damaged DNA in their sperm have problems with fertility, but you can\u2019t really do an experiment to heat males up and look at whether that damages human offspring performance, so this is one way to get at that.\u201d\n\nThe results, he said, primarily indicate problems with fertility \u2014 with the clearest implications for insect biodiversity \u2014 but there is also evidence of an \u201cunderlying, longer-term damage as a result of damaged sperm DNA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn much the same way that radiation causes damage, and that can lead to offspring problems, there could be that kind of damage operating as a consequence of heat conditions,\u201d Gage said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at possible population viability problems, which need to be studied more.\"\n\nWhen it comes to humans, not all populations will be equally affected, studies have shown. The elderly, low-income people, those who are immobile or have other preexisting health issues, are especially vulnerable.\n\nWhile the results of the experiment don\u2019t offer conclusions about population viability, they offer insight into how a particularly sensitive trait, sperm function, reacts to heat waves, which scientists say will continue to be among the severe effects of global climate change.\n\n\u201cIf sperm function goes down, reproduction goes down,\u201d Gage said. \u201cIf reproduction goes down, you\u2019re looking at population viability problems.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nThe girl in the wheelchair said she was critically ill.

But there is no definitive evidence that Mohammed ordered the operation. Saudi officials deny that the crown prince was in any way responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHe did not have any knowledge,\u201d Shaalan said Thursday.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir described the killing as a \u201cmistake\u201d and denied any involvement on the part of Mohammed. \u201cHis royal highness the crown prince has nothing to do with this issue,\u201d Jubeir he told reporters in Riyadh.\n\nMojeb\u2019s statement Thursday implicated two higher-level officials in what the prosecutor said was an operation intended either to persuade or force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia. One of them, Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of intelligence, issued an order for Khashoggi\u2019s return on Sept. 29, the prosecutor said. That was one day after Khashoggi first visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and was told to return the following week.\n\nQahtani, on the U.S. sanctions list Thursday, was also involved in planning Khashoggi\u2019s repatriation, according to the prosecutor.\n\n[Crown prince under scrutiny in journalist\u2019s killing as Saudis search for explanation]\n\nSaudi officials have changed their story about Khashoggi\u2019s killing several times since he disappeared, first denying any knowledge of his whereabouts and then saying that he was killed during a fistfight.\n\nIn the latest version laid out by the prosecutor, a 15-member team was formed to bring Khashoggi back from Istanbul, \u201cby means of persuasion, and if persuasion fails, to do so by force.\u201d The team included a forensic expert \u201cfor the purpose of removing evidence from the scene in case force had to be used to return the victim,\u201d according to a summary of the prosecutor\u2019s statement that was emailed to reporters.\n\nThe leader of the Saudi team also contacted a collaborator in Turkey to secure a safe house in case Khashoggi was forcibly removed, the statement said. But after deciding that moving Khashoggi to a safe house would not be possible, a team leader decided to kill the journalist, according to the prosecutor.\n\n\u201cThe investigation concluded that the crime was carried out after a physical altercation with the victim where he was forcibly restrained and injected with a large amount of a drug resulting in an overdose that led to his death, may Allah bless his soul,\u201d the statement said.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s body was dismembered and then taken by one of the Saudi agents to the \u201clocal collaborator,\u201d according to the prosecutor, who said a sketch of the collaborator has been produced.\n\nTurkish officials have complained repeatedly about Saudi Arabia\u2019s refusal to identify the collaborator and said they suspect that such a person does not exist. They have also demanded that the Saudis reveal the whereabouts of Khashoggi\u2019s remains.\n\nTurkey\u2019s prosecutor said late last month that Khashoggi was strangled or suffocated as soon as he entered the consulate, in line with \u201cpremeditated plans.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s eldest son, Salah Khashoggi, announced Thursday on Twitter that the family would receive condolence visits beginning Friday.\n\nLouisa Loveluck and Zeynep Karatas contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nErdogan says audio of Khashoggi killing given to U.S., Saudis, Europeans\n\nSaudi attempts to distance crown prince from Khashoggi killing not quieted uproar\n\nRead Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s columns for The Washington Post\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Mattis, defending troop deployment against caravan, cites Pancho Villa's raid into US that killed 18 Americans - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Mattis, defending troop deployment against caravan, cites Pancho Villa's raid into US that killed 18 Americans Washington Post While en route to McAllen, Tex., to meet with some of the 5,900 troops recently deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border b\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/15/mattis-defending-troop-deployment-against-caravan-cites-pancho-villas-raid-into-us-that-killed-americans/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5ajnBcCcnFedNx8gj1DUoBGB6Rs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O53TJT5RKFB4NIAYTO253JRDO4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:36:20Z", "content": "While en route to McAllen, Tex., to meet with some of the 5,900 troops recently deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border by President Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis offered a history lesson of sorts on Wednesday in defense of the hastily arranged military resp\u2026 [+5302 chars]", "fulltext": "While en route to McAllen, Tex., to meet with some of the 5,900 troops recently deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border by President Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis offered a history lesson of sorts on Wednesday in defense of the hastily arranged military response to the caravan of migrants called an \u201cinvasion\u201d by Trump.\n\nBefore citing the active-duty troops sent by the Clinton administration to the border in the \u201990s and the National Guardsmen deployed by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama as reasons for why the deployment was needed, Mattis reminded the press gaggle aboard his plane of the lengths to which President Woodrow Wilson went to counteract the forces led by Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa more than a century ago.\n\n\u201cI think many of you are aware that President Wilson 100 years ago \u2014 a little over 100 years ago deployed the U.S. Army to the Southwest border,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cThe threat then was Pancho Villa\u2019s troops, a revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States, New Mexico in 1916.\u201d\n\n[Mattis calls deployment to the border \u2018great training\u2019 as he visits troops in Texas]\n\nAs a lifelong student of military history with a personal library that reportedly once had more than 7,000 volumes, Mattis citing Wilson\u2019s action against Villa in the context of a caravan of men, women and children immediately raised eyebrows.\n\nWe\u2019re comparing this caravan of predominantly women and children to Pancho Villa? https://t.co/mDeXcPs26E \u2014 Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) November 14, 2018\n\nThe threat that Trump said would come in the form of a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants, many of them women and children, moving north through Mexico has not materialized. Critics saw the dispatch of active-duty troops to the border as a pre-election stunt.\n\nVilla, on the other hand, did actually lead a cross-border raid that killed 18 Americans in the small town of Columbus, N.M. His actions caused thousands of U.S. troops, led by Gen. John J. Pershing, to pursue him for close to a year, nearly starting a war. Villa\u2019s attack is considered by historians one of the first, if not the first, acts of terrorism on U.S. soil.\n\n\u201cThe comparison makes absolutely no sense,\u201d tweeted Univision anchor Le\u00f3n Krauze.\n\nAfter initially earning the support of Wilson around 1913, who once called Villa \u201ca sort of Robin Hood,\u201d the rebel leader felt betrayed by the U.S. government when Mexican leader Venustiano Carranza came back into the president\u2019s favor during the early part of the Mexican Revolution. The rebel leader then targeted the United States in January 1916. A group of Villistas, the common word for Villa\u2019s army, killled 18 U.S. passengers on a train in Mexico.\n\n\n\nGen. John J. Pershing, at the head of his men, fords a stream in Mexico in 1916 while leading U.S. troops there in pursuit of Pancho Villa. (AP)\n\nVilla\u2019s next move came in the early-morning hours of March 9, 1916. Villa was joined by hundreds of Villistas in a raid on Columbus, a bustling New Mexico town of 250 residents located three miles north of the border. The Villistas \u2014 reportedly shouting \u201cViva Villa!\u201d and \u201cViva Mexico!\u201d \u2014 burned the town, looted the homes, hotel and stores, and killed 18 civilians and U.S. soldiers.\n\n\u201cI was awake, they were asleep,\u201d Villa later bragged, according to historian Mitchell Yockelson in the Daily Beast, \u201cand it took them too long to wake up.\u201d\n\nWilson moved swiftly to pursue Villa, wrote Yockelson, author of \u201cForty-Seven Days: How Pershing\u2019s Warriors Came of Age to Defeat the German Army in World War I.\u201d Almost a week after the attack in Columbus, Pershing led a punitive expedition (later referred to as the Mexican Expedition) of more than 14,000 troops to Mexico in hope of capturing the terrorist.\n\nPerhaps one of the only common elements between now and then was that it was an election year. Wilson\u2019s 1916 presidential reelection campaign trumpeted the slogan \u201cHe kept us out of war\u201d in hope that his antiwar image would appeal to those against conflict with Mexico or Europe, according to \u201cWoodrow Wilson: A Biography.\u201d (He narrowly won a second term over Charles Evans Hughes.)\n\nWith the United States close to entering World War I, the expedition would officially end nearly a year later in February 1917 without capturing Villa. (He was assassinated in 1923.)\n\nGen Mattis says trump sending troops is nothing new. Just like Pres Wilson sending them 100 yrs ago....to combat Pancho Villa\u2019s army. Seriously?

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nOn The Hill\n\nDEAL OR NO DEAL?: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) this week wrote a much-ridiculed op-ed for Fox News. \u201cWill Dems work with us, or simply put partisan politics ahead of the country?\u201d the headline asked. He then assured readers, channeling Mark Twain, that \u201creports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Even with divided government \u2014 and maybe because of it \u2014 some Trump-style deal making might be possible in the new post-midterms Washington. McConnell himself pointed to three areas of possible agreement yesterday:\n\nCriminal Justice Reform: Trump endorsed \u201cthe First Step Act\u201d yesterday afternoon, which includes \u201creasonable sentencing reform while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off our streets.\u201d He said he'd be \u201cwaiting with a pen\u201d to sign the measure.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and is working on getting legislation to overhaul Congress's woefully outdated sexual harassment policies \"done before the end of the year.\u201d\n\nMcConnell said he's \u201ctalked at length\u201d with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and is working on getting legislation to overhaul Congress's woefully outdated sexual harassment policies \"done before the end of the year.\u201d Infrastructure week, but maybe for real this time?: \u201cI hope so,\u201d McConnell said about getting an infrastructure bill done next year. The \u201csticking point?\u201d How to pay for it. \u201cRepublicans are not interested in doing another $900 billion stimulus,\u201d he added.\n\nThere's another unresolved whopper that McConnell is putting off for next year: NAFTA 2.0 or the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). A senior GOP House aide told Power Up the general consensus is the deal that Trump rushed to negotiate with Mexico and Canada before midterm elections \u201cisn't feasible in the lame duck,\u201d in part because Democrats now have leverage.\n\nProblem No. 1: Labor activists are no fans of NAFTA 2.0.\n\nThat's primarily because while the minimum hourly wage requirement for Mexican autoworkers was raised to $16, it's not slated to rise with inflation \u2014 meaning that U.S. jobs could still be shifted abroad.\n\nThat's not a good look for a party looking to win back the American worker from Trump. Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic & International Studies: \u201cDemocrats will say the deal isn't good enough on labor \u2014 that way they check the AFL- CIO box and tell [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer to go back to Mexico and do better. And I think he actually can do that. So he does that and he comes back and then the Democrats can say, 'It's no good and we forced them to fix it and now some of us will vote for it,'\" Reinsch told us.\n\nProblem No. 2: Are the provisions enforceable?\n\n\u201cEnforcement, enforcement, enforcement\u201d: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) released a statement on USMCA to the New York Times last week calling the agreement a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d She added: \u201cWithout enforcement you don\u2019t have anything.

Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding NAFTA . . . Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201d Rep.

So yes, I do think that is a possibility,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said when asked if like-minded Democrats would take advantage of the USMCA debate to seek tariff concessions. \u201cIf you look at some of the seats that Republicans lost in this last election, they came in the Midwest, where the pain from the president's tariffs are being felt the most.\u201d\n\nProblem No. 4: Politics.\n\n2020: \u201cThere's this assumption that once the three countries came together for an agreement, that was the biggest hurdle, but I think what's important to watch is how politics play here . . . on [Democrats] giving the president a win on trade when he's up for reelection in 2020,\u201d Marc Short, Trump's former director of legislative affairs, told us.\n\n\u201cThere's this assumption that once the three countries came together for an agreement, that was the biggest hurdle, but I think what's important to watch is how politics play here . . . on [Democrats] giving the president a win on trade when he's up for reelection in 2020,\u201d Marc Short, Trump's former director of legislative affairs, told us.

Navalny, arguably the most prominent foe of President Vladimir Putin, has spent a total of more than 140 days behind bars in the past year and a half.\n\nSpeaking in Strasbourg, Navalny hailed the ruling as an example of \u201cgenuine justice\u201d and said it is an important signal for many people in Russia who face arbitrary detentions for their political activities.\n\nThe ruling which also ordered the Russian government to pay Navalny 63,000 euros ($71,000) in damages is final and binding on Russia as a member of the Council of Europe, the continent\u2019s human rights watchdog.\n\n____\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russian authorities\u2019 arrests of opposition leader Alexei Navalny were politically driven.\n\nThe European court found Thursday that Russian authorities violated Navalny\u2019s rights in arrests from 2012 to 2014, and that two of them were expressly aimed at \u201csuppressing political pluralism.\u201d\n\nIt ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros ($71,000) in damages, and to fix legislation to \u201ctake due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly.\u201d\n\nThe ruling is final and binding on Russia as a member of the Council of Europe, the continent\u2019s human rights watchdog.\n\nNavalny has faced fraud charges viewed as political retribution for investigating corruption and leading anti-government protests. The Kremlin dismisses Navalny as a trouble-maker with no political backing.\n\n____\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nRussia is awaiting a European court ruling on whether it violated the rights of opposition leader Alexei Navalny when arresting him on repeated occasions.\n\nA leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny is expected to appear at the European Court of Human Rights in the French city of Strasbourg to hear the ruling Thursday, after a last-minute legal problem delayed his arrival.\n\nThe court ruled last year that seven of his arrests were unlawful and ordered Russia to pay 63,000 euros ($67,000) in compensation. But the court didn\u2019t rule on Navalny\u2019s arguments that the arrests were politically motivated.\n\nThe Russian government and Navalny appealed, and the case went to the court\u2019s Grand Chamber, which issues its final, binding ruling later Thursday.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIsrael and Hamas again approached the brink of war this week. This latest conflagration began Sunday night when Israeli special forces carried out a covert operation into the Gaza Strip, Hamas fighters caught them, and a gunfight ensued. In the 25 hours that followed, Hamas fired hundreds of rockets at southern Israel, and Israel pounded Gaza with airstrikes. By the time a truce took hold Tuesday, one Israeli and 14 Gazans had been killed, in addition to one West Bank Palestinian killed by a Hamas rocket in Israel.\n\nThe rapid pace of escalation leaves observers with many questions. Why did Israel carry out this military operation at a time when many were heralding novel progress in diplomatic steps toward alleviating tensions between Israel and Hamas?\n\nWhy is yet another Israel-Hamas flare-up puzzling?\n\nSince the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel has imposed a suffocating blockade on Gaza\u2019s 2 million inhabitants. Three wars since 2008 have taken a devastating human and material toll. Israeli gunfire on Gazans\u2019 protests at the border has killed at least 210 Palestinians and wounded more than 18,000 since March. The south of Israel has also faced rocket attacks and incendiary kites and balloons.\n\nRecent weeks, however, have yielded negotiated breakthroughs. Egyptian envoys have visited Gaza and Israel in an effort to seal a three-year cease-fire that would alleviate some of Gaza\u2019s economic impoverishment. Since October, Israel has allowed Qatar to buy millions of dollars of fuel from Israel and deliver it to Gaza\u2019s power plant, increasing the electricity supply from the prior few hours a day. Just last Thursday, Israel also permitted Qatar to deliver $15 million in cash to Gaza, the first of a planned series of payments to civil servants who have gone months without salaries. Indeed, just a few hours before the Gaza operation, Netanyahu declared that he was doing \u201ceverything\u201d possible to prevent renewed war with Gaza.\n\nThat context explains why Sunday\u2019s raid seems inconsistent. Such incursions, otherwise, are not uncommon. According to the United Nations, the Israeli army carried out 262 known operations inside the Gaza Strip from 2015 until late October 2018. But why would Israel carry out an incursion given the diplomatic and political imperative to avoid unnecessary provocations?\n\nLetting tactics trump strategic interests\n\nSunday\u2019s incursion, like other such operations, is characteristic of Israel\u2019s long-standing propensity to prioritize tactical considerations in disregard \u2014 and often to the detriment \u2014 of long-term strategic interests. In other words, Israel has a history of pursuing short-term gains in military operations on the ground, even when they risk undermining the larger national goals claimed by its political leadership.\n\nOur new book, \u201cTriadic Coercion: Israel\u2019s Targeting of States That Host Nonstate Actors,\u201d explores how this propensity has deep roots in Israel\u2019s strategic culture. Strategic culture is the system of beliefs, values and practices that guide a state\u2019s behavior in security affairs. Examining Israel\u2019s conduct vis-a-vis nonstate actors and their host states from 1949 until the present, we focus on two components of Israeli strategic culture: decision-making processes related to security policy and ideas about security threats and solutions. We see each of these elements at play in the current flare-up with Gaza.\n\nSecurity decision-making processes\n\nIsrael\u2019s army has developed modes of operation that prioritize \u201caction\u201d over cautious and deliberate thinking. The Israel Defense Forces has historically regarded grand concepts and abstract discussions as useless. They instead praised \u201cno-nonsense\u201d talk that is direct and to the point and being a \u201cdoer\u201d rather than an armchair theorist.\n\nThis ethos may have served Israel well in the 1960s and \u201970s, when it prided itself on daring commando operations or battlefield innovations in combat against Arab state armies. Yet this tendency to put the tactical cart before the strategic horse has run Israel into a strategic impasse with the Palestinians. The military establishment\u2019s \u201canti-intellectualism\u201d keeps it from reevaluating inherited assumptions and habits. Such critical self-reflection is necessary today, as a decade of recurrent wars shows that Israel\u2019s conflict with Gaza cannot rest on military force.\n\nSecurity ideas\n\nIsrael\u2019s military approach has long been grounded in the conviction that, given its territorial and demographic vulnerability, Israel has \u201cno choice\u201d but to build military supremacy and prove that superiority to enemies. In our research, we trace how over time this belief has evolved into a valorization of the inherent, rather than the merely instrumental, utility of demonstrating military might. Increasingly, both the Israeli leadership and public seem to laud military prowess nearly as an end in itself, rather than a means to the end of other security goals. This equates a show of force with deterrence, regardless of whether that force actually prevents the enemy from taking actions that it intended to take.\n\nThis logic may have infused Sunday\u2019s raid, as the IDF\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson told Al Jazeera on Monday. \u201cThere was an Israeli operation inside the Gaza strip,\u201d he said, \u201cin order to entrench Israel\u2019s military superiority.\u201d Yet pursuit of military superiority is different than pursuit of security, as the escalatory effects of the operation lay bare.\n\nCounterproductive policies\n\nFrom Israel\u2019s perspective, incursions into Gaza might have their own tactical rationales, be they to gather intelligence, expose a tunnel, destroy a Hamas position or, as the IDF spokesperson suggested, grow Israel\u2019s military preeminence. Yet in winning these battles, Israel risks igniting a war that no one can win.\n\nSuch counterproductive outcomes are predictable when a strategic culture elevates short-term tactics over longer-term strategic thinking and conflates the inherent value of military actions with their actual effectiveness in enhancing security. To the degree that Israel resists reevaluating the ingrained assumptions and institutionalized practices that invite provocative moves, it is unlikely to achieve its own stated goals of making its citizens safer. Both Israelis and Palestinians will pay the price.\n\nBoaz Atzili is associate professor and director of the doctoral studies program at the School of International Service in American University.\n\nWendy Pearlman is the Martin and Patricia Koldyke outstanding teaching associate professor of political science at Northwestern University, where she specializes in Middle East politics."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "David Streit", "title": "D.C.-area forecast: A slippery wintry mix gradually changes to a cold, wind-swept rain", "description": "Conditions deteriorate north and west of Interstate 95, with increasing chances of accumulation and slick roads.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/15/dc-area-forecast-slippery-wintry-mix-gradually-changes-cold-driving-rain/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HpHppIKvAtUHRWswkmp5xGVsoTk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZCQC4GGE5FBHMNWZNUEHSI5B4.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:00:22Z", "content": "* Winter weather advisory from 4 a.m. to 1 p.m. | Flood watch noon through this evening | School closings and delays * TODAYS DAILY DIGIT 1/10: Rain mixed with snow and ice will not suffice.

Into the early evening, some colder areas north and west of Washington will have patchy freezing rain. In northern Maryland, snow will change to sleet and freezing rain through late afternoon.\n\nMost snow accumulation has ended with totals around 1 to 2 inches in the immediate area, 1 to 3 inches in our north and west suburbs, and 3 to 6 inches toward northern Maryland and Interstate 81. This was the boom scenario.\n\nTemperatures are mostly above freezing along and east of Interstate 95 and should remain steady into the evening with mostly wet roads. But temperatures will hover around freezing north and west of Washington and a few slick spots are possible. Locations far to the west and northwest may remain at or below 32 degrees into tonight, prolonging freezing rain and slick conditions.\n\n1.4 inches of snow was posted in Washington today. This is the first measurable November snow in the District since 1996 (when 0.2 inches fell) and the biggest November snow event since 1989, when 3.5 inches fell before Thanksgiving (Nov. 22-23).\n\n4:00 p.m. update: A cold, drenching rain is now falling over much of the immediate area with temperatures between 33 and 36 degrees. Winds have picked up as well - sustained at 15 to 20 mph with some higher gusts. Overall, a very nasty late afternoon.\n\nIn our outlying areas to the northwest, west of Poolesville and Sterling, and north of Gaithersburg and Columbia, temperatures hover between 30 and 32 degrees, meaning some freezing rain is occurring. Especially as it gets dark, use caution on sidewalks and untreated roads in these areas as slick spots could develop. These are the same areas where slippery conditions may linger through the night.\n\n\n\nTemperatures at 4 p.m. Thursday. (Weather Underground)\n\nPatchy rain and freezing rain will continue into the overnight hours, ending between 3 and 5 a.m. from southwest to northeast. Some sleet and snow may briefly mix back in - especially in our colder areas - before ending.\n\nThis is the last update in this post. For the detailed outlook through Friday, see our PM Update.\n\n2:45 p.m. update: The immediate metro region has now transitioned to rain and sleet with no more snow, and the changeover has also reached much of Loudoun, Montgomery, and Howard County. However, we still have reports of some flakes in our far northwest areas around Frederick and Hagerstown. But even these areas should flip to sleet and freezing rain over the next hour or two.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen some very impressive snow totals in northern Maryland, in Carroll and Frederick counties, with a few locations topping 6 inches.\n\n7\u201d and still coming down in Catoctin Mts near @ThurmontMD.

Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Thursday): A mix of rain/snow/sleet arrives before the dawn and makes for a tricky commute. The worst conditions, when precipitation is heavy and temperatures are cold, lasts through late morning. The good thing is the ground is not that cold, which allows for melting, but heavier bursts of sleet and snow could cause slick spots. A shift to just rain is anticipated in the late morning downtown but may take until the afternoon in our north and west suburbs, where odds of more significant snow and ice accumulation increase.\n\nThe rain this afternoon could be heavy, and some pockets of flooding cannot be ruled out. On top of that, winds from the northeast gust over 25 mph, making umbrellas of limited use against the chilly, driving rain. Temperatures hold mainly in the mid-30s through the day. Confidence: Medium\n\n\n\n(The Washington Post Staff/Washington, D.C.)\n\nTonight: Cold rain continues through the evening, and most areas end up with the equivalent of an inch (adding together the rain and melted wintry mix). Gusty winds shift to come out of the northwest overnight, potentially cooling our north and northwest areas enough for snow and sleet to mix back in with the rain in the predawn hours. Refreezing concerns are minimal overnight, however, with lows temperatures mostly above freezing (32 to 36 degrees). Confidence: Medium\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Friday): Precipitation should quickly diminish at daybreak but very early commuters need to be cautious of slick spots. West winds continue to gust up to 25 mph and, as skies clear, roads should dry out. Cold air still pours in as the storm moves away, and highs do no better than the mid- to upper 40s. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Winds die down in the evening, taking an edge off the chill. Mostly clear skies allow most areas to fall into the 20s for lows, with downtown areas settling in the low 30s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSaturday benefits from mostly sunny skies and very light winds, but temperatures are still cold, with highs doing no better than mid-40s in most of the area. Clear, calm conditions overnight again push lows below freezing in most areas, from 25 to 30, except the low 30s downtown. Confidence: Medium\n\nDry weather persists into Sunday, with partly sunny skies. Cold air just won\u2019t stop oozing into the area, and this keeps highs parked in the mid- to upper 40s for most. That is about 10 degrees below normal. Overnight lows fall into the mid- to upper 20s in our colder areas, and low to mid-30s downtown under starry skies. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nMonday sees mainly high level clouds increase across the area, and this is enough to keep highs only in the mid- to upper 40s. Confidence: Medium\n\nSNOW POTENTIAL INDEX\n\nA daily assessment of the potential for at least 1 inch of snow in the next week, on a 0-10 scale.\n\n5/10 (\u2191): Snow is likely to take a back seat to the rain and sleet Thursday but if an early morning burst occurs an inch or so is not out of the question.\n\nEarlier storm updates...\n\n1:00 p.m. update: Temperatures have risen to 32 to 34 degrees inside the Beltway, and precipitation has changed to sleet and rain. No additional accumulation is expected and ice and slush on roads should gradually melt this afternoon.\n\nNorth and west of the Beltway, where sleet and snow are still falling, temperatures are 30 to 33 degrees, so slick conditions are likely to persist there for another couple of hours. However, these areas should also rise above freezing by mid-to-late afternoon and only patchy slick spots should linger into the afternoon commute.\n\n\n\nTemperatures at 1 p.m. Thursday. (Weather Underground)\n\nIn some zones well north and west of the Beltway, toward northern Maryland and Interstate 81, where temperatures are currently near 30, it may not rise above freezing until tonight and some sheltered valleys may not rise above freezing at all. So, while snow may end in this region in the next couple of hours, frozen precipitation (sleet and then freezing rain) may continue through this evening, meaning a continuation of slick conditions.\n\n12:20 p.m. update: The winter storm warning has now been further expanded to cover all of Loudoun County and western Montgomery County, as well as northern Baltimore County. Four to six inches of snow is likely in this zone, and many locations are already closing in on such amounts. However, the window for snow should close over the next couple of hours as precipitation transitions to sleet.\n\nInside the Beltway, precipitation has shifted to all sleet for the most part with even some plain raining creeping into our southern suburbs. Even as far north as Rockville snow has flipped to sleet, so hours are numbered for the snow part of this storm.\n\n11:20 a.m. update: The winter storm warning has been expanded into western Loudoun, Frederick and Carroll counties, and in effect through 4 a.m. Friday.\n\nSnow is falling heavily in western Loudoun, Frederick. and Carroll counties and amounts are piling up. The Weather Service now indicates 4 to 6 inches of snow could fall in this area, with a glaze of ice (0.1 to 0.2 inches) on top of that. Your best bet is stay put and not travel unless absolutely necessary in this area.\n\n10:40 a.m. update: When will the changeover from snow/sleet to more sleet and then rain occur?\n\nWe think the snow/sleet mix should stick around in the immediate area through midday, gradually becoming more sleety than snowy. Areas inside the Beltway should transition to mostly rain by 3 p.m. This will take another hour or two in our north and west areas.\n\n\n\nForecast radar through this evening from HRRR model.\n\n10:15 a.m. update: A new round of snow reports is in.\n\nAbout 1.5 inches in Clifton, VA as it begins the change to sleet. @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/UHOs5BNpq7 \u2014 Nick Walker (@NickWal70943870) November 15, 2018\n\nSnow totals continue to build somewhat this morning. A general range of about half an inch to two or more inches is now common.\n\nSeveral two inch or greater reports have arrived from Loudoun County, with 2.2 inches in Leesburg as of 9:30 a.m. Even in the immediate area, 1.7 inches was reported in Lake Barcroft in Falls Church as of 9 a.m.\n\n\n\nPreliminary snow reports so far this morning. (NWS)\n\nThe whole list is available on the NWS D.C./Baltimore site.\n\n2.5 in Ashburn as of 10:15, still snowing @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/aZYYNGAady \u2014 Gary John Jr (@marmo518) November 15, 2018\n\n10:05 a.m. update: While the area has largely flipped from pure snow, we are still seeing some bursts of big flakes with heavier precipitation.\n\n9:58 am: That big morning snow band is mostly to our north now, but some can still mix in at times. We are really just getting started with this storm. Still seeing sleet much of the area. Heaviest precipitation comes this afternoon into evening. pic.twitter.com/55Zgv4txsL \u2014 Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) November 15, 2018\n\nThis storm is still in the early phases and we have a long way to go until it finishes. Sleet appears to be the primary precipitation type in the area at this time, although it does seem that a change to more of a liquid form is trying to move north from southern Md. As temperatures only very slowly rise from near and below freezing at present, precipitation types may bounce around for a while yet, but the trajectory is toward a less frozen state with time.\n\n9:15 a.m. update: The worst of the conditions are moving on from the morning band.\n\n9:15 am: Changeover seems to mostly match the southern end of the largest band over northern MD now. Could still see a few flakes south but not many. Near and below freezing most of the area still. Take it slow even as roads clear up a bit. pic.twitter.com/dValJDQ44C \u2014 Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) November 15, 2018\n\nA changeover from snow is now progressing through northern suburbs. Sleet is falling most spots locally, although some freezing rain and rain is mixed in. This precipitation will continue to slowly transition toward more of the liquid variety as temperatures crawl upward this morning. It is still near or below freezing most spots, so do continue to take it slow even as road conditions improve overall.\n\n9:05 a.m. update: This is the first accumulating snowfall in November in D.C. since 1996.\n\nAn early list of snow totals is out from the NWS. Most numbers are in the half inch to 1.5 inch range so far. National Airport has picked up at least 0.1 inches, which was as of 7 a.m., so it seems likely there is more to that total.\n\n8:40 a.m. update: Here\u2019s another look around the area.

As this front-end activity moves on or tapers for a bit, we should see more and more of this snow change to other precipitation types.\n\n8:16 am: Current temperatures show most of the area at or below freezing. Need to get south and east of the city for slightly milder readings. Heavy snow will stick in above freezing conditions as well. Rough conditions out there this morning. pic.twitter.com/5kSti8ygav \u2014 Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) November 15, 2018\n\nAs precipitation lightens up a bit for a time, we should see temperatures begin to warm up a little. We\u2019re talking very little, but perhaps enough to get the I-95 corridor back to freezing and above in the next several hours. This should coincide with an eventual turn to rain in the cities and southeast, with mixed precipitation including sleet and freezing rain continuing longer to the west.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the way out or out now. It remains rough out there. Take it easy.\n\n7:52 a.m. update: It looks like this storm will fall into the \u201cboom\u201d category. A heavy band of precipitation is dragging the temperature down, allowing snow and sleet to accumulate even on the roads. The worst road conditions are west and north of the Beltway, but snow is starting to coat streets in the District. We\u2019re seeing a lot of major streets in the suburbs that look like they haven\u2019t been treated.\n\n7:30 a.m. update: Several school districts have decided to close instead of delay. You can check the full list here.\n\n7:20 a.m. update: Snow and sleet are accumulating on the roads in Fairfax and Loudoun. Coming down hard in these areas so it\u2019s piling up, even though the ground is relatively warm. Air temperatures have dropped below freezing in our far western and northern areas.\n\n7 a.m. update: With temperatures running a little colder than expected, the National Weather Service has extended the wintry weather advisory into Charles County, where sleet and a little bit of snow has been reported. Calvert and St. Mary\u2019s are still only in a flood watch.\n\nSnow and sleet are sticking to untreated surfaces in the District. Roads are still okay in the Beltway, based on reader reports.\n\nRoof already sleet-covered, snow now mixing in here in Woodley Park @capitalweather pic.twitter.com/hy71HQOn0Z \u2014 Lindsay (@lschattenstein) November 15, 2018\n\n6:45 a.m. update: The morning weather balloon went up around 6 a.m. at the National Weather Service near Dulles airport. Looks like temperatures are below freezing through the atmosphere, with a shallow layer of air that hovers right above freezing near the ground. Temperatures range from 32 degrees in the outer suburbs of Fairfax, Loudoun, Frederick and Howard to 35-36 degrees in Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel.\n\nSince the air is below freezing from the clouds to near the ground, we\u2019re seeing snowflakes fall across much of the metro -- even in the District and areas east of I-95.\n\n6:15 a.m. update: The Washington area woke up to light sleet mixed with rain as precipitation spread north starting around 4 a.m. Reports indicate roads are okay in the Beltway, but could be slippery in parts of Fairfax, Loudoun and Frederick. We expect snow in the colder suburbs, with a snow-sleet mix in the warmer suburbs east of I-95.

Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), whose reelection contest against Republican Gov. Rick Scott is still undecided, speaks at a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s historic recount was thrown once more into uncertainty Thursday when a federal judge ruled that voters whose mail-in and provisional ballots were rejected because of issues with their signatures will have two more days to resolve the problems and possibly have their votes counted.\n\nThe decision by Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee came just hours ahead of the Thursday afternoon deadline for elections officials to complete a machine recount. It is particularly notable in the too-close-to-call Senate race, in which Gov. Rick Scott (R) leads Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by fewer than 13,000 votes.\n\nWalker\u2019s decision affects Floridians who cast their ballots by mail, or voted provisionally, but whose signatures did not match records maintained by state officials. More than 4,000 ballots across 45 counties in Florida were set aside because of inconsistent signatures, he wrote in his opinion. In the other 22 counties, the number is unknown.\n\nThe judge concluded that mail-in voters weren\u2019t notified of the discrepancy until it was too late to fix, while state law gives provisional voters no opportunity to resolve apparent signature irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe precise issue in this case is whether Florida\u2019s law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures \u2014 with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection \u2014 passes constitutional muster,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe answer is simple. It does not.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling gives Nelson new hope for chipping away at his deficit, it falls short of the more sweeping decision his lawyers sought and is probably not enough to change the outcome of the race on its own. The judge, in a decision released early Thursday, stopped short of invalidating the signature-match requirement, concluding instead that the directive had been applied unlawfully. He also declined Nelson\u2019s demand that all the mismatched ballots be counted \u201csight unseen,\u201d as the judge put it.\n\nDrawing an analogy to the rules governing football, he declined to throw out the regulation just because there had been a faulty call, observing, \u201cFootball fans may quibble about the substance of the rules, but no one quibbles that rules are necessary to play the game.\u201d\n\nStill, the order raises new questions about next steps in the recount in three statewide contests \u2014 the races for governor and agriculture commissioner, in addition to Nelson\u2019s reelection bid. Unofficial results in the bitter contest over the governor\u2019s mansion showed Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) leading Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, by nearly 34,000 votes, or roughly .4 percentage points. Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was .14 percentage points.\n\n[Does your vote count in Florida? It might depend on your signature.]\n\nIn his ruling, Walker said the plaintiffs, the Florida Democratic Party and the Nelson campaign, had established \u201cirreparable injury\u201d to the constitutional right of citizens \u201cto cast their ballots and have them counted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, potentially thousands of voters have been deprived of the right to cast a legal vote \u2014 and have that vote counted \u2014 by an untrained canvassing board member based on an arbitrary determination that their respective signatures did not match,\u201d wrote the judge, appointed to the federal bench in 2012 by President Barack Obama. \u201cSuch a violation of the right to vote cannot be undone.\u201d\n\nWalker emphasized that the court was not instructing county canvassing boards to \u201ccount every mismatched vote.\u201d But he said the state\u2019s process for curing ballots with irregular signatures had been applied improperly, robbing voters of the chance to make corrections before Nov. 5. State law requires canvassing boards to notify voters \u201cimmediately\u201d if they determine that a mail-in ballot contains a signature inconsistent with the one on file.\n\nOfficials were therefore required, he argued, to allow voters another opportunity to have their ballots counted before the second official results are certified. \u201cThe county supervisors are directed to allow those voters who should have had an opportunity to cure their ballots in the first place to cure their votes-by-mail and provisional ballots now,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe court dismissed the state\u2019s argument that an additional delay would erode faith in the election. There was no reason, the judge observed, why giving all eligible voters the chance to be included would threaten the process.\n\n\u201cRegardless, any potential hardship imposed by providing an actual opportunity to challenge the determination that a signature does not match, and thus, a vote does not count, is outweighed by the risk of unconstitutionally depriving eligible voters of their right to vote and have that vote counted,\u201d Walker found.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign is expected to appeal the decision.\n\nThe ruling was part of a flurry of courtroom activity that could influence the high-stakes Senate race, even as local election officials scrambled to meet the Thursday deadline to complete their work. The dispute over signatures recalls the scrutiny of hanging chads by the same three-member canvassing boards after the contested presidential election in 2000. Florida is again the focal point of a contest over voting and electoral legitimacy.\n\nElection officials in Broward County, a populous Democratic stronghold, maintained that they would meet the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline for completing a machine recount. Officials in Palm Beach County faced problems with the counting machines themselves and have said they can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll be done Thursday.\n\nRepresentatives of the Republican and Democratic parties attended a \u201cwalk-through\u201d at the Broward elections office to prepare for the manual recount expected to follow in the Senate race.\n\n[Read the full decision]"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Asian Cup to get video review starting in quarterfinals", "description": "Video review will be used at the Asian Cup starting in the quarterfinals", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/asian-cup-to-get-video-review-starting-in-quarterfinals/2018/11/15/d83d8840-e8bc-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T09:57:22Z", "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia Video review will be used at the Asian Cup starting in the quarterfinals.

British Prime Minister Theresa May says if politicians reject her Brexit deal, it will set the country on \u201ca path of deep and grave uncertainty.\u201d Defiant in the face of mounting criticism, May said Thursday she believed \u201cwith every fiber of my being\u201d that the deal her government struck with the European Union was the right one. (Matt Dunham, Pool/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May defied mounting calls to quit or change course Thursday over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, warning that abandoning her Brexit plan would plunge the country into \u201cdeep and grave uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s long-simmering divisions over its future in the EU erupted into turmoil just a day after the government agreed to a divorce deal with the bloc. Two Cabinet ministers resigned and some lawmakers from May\u2019s own party called for her to be replaced. The crisis threatened to destroy the Brexit agreement, unseat the prime minister and send the U.K. hurtling toward the EU exit without a plan.\n\nIn an evening news conference aimed at regaining some control, May said she believed \u201cwith every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to see this through? Yes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hard-won agreement with the EU has infuriated pro-Brexit members of May\u2019s divided Conservative Party. They say the agreement, which calls for close trade ties between the U.K. and the bloc, would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU rules it has no say in making.\n\nMay insisted that Brexit meant making \u201cthe right choices, not the easy ones\u201d and urged lawmakers to support the deal \u201cin the national interest.\u201d\n\nBut she was weakened by the resignation of two senior Cabinet ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. Hours after he sat in the meeting that approved the deal, Raab said he \u201ccannot in good conscience\u201d support it.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey followed Raab out the door. She said in a letter that it is \u201cno good trying to pretend to (voters) that this deal honors the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA handful of junior government ministers also quit, and leading pro-Brexit lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called for a vote of no-confidence in May.\n\nRees-Mogg said May\u2019s deal \u201cis not Brexit\u201d because it would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, potentially for an indefinite period. He said May was \u201closing the confidence of Conservative members of Parliament.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg called for May to be replaced by a more firmly pro-Brexit politician, naming ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Raab as potential successors.\n\nUnder Conservative rules, a confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers \u2014 currently 48 \u2014 write a letter to the party\u2019s 1922 Committee of backbenchers, which oversees leadership votes.\n\nOnly committee chairman Graham Brady knows for sure how many missives have been sent, but Rees-Mogg\u2019s letter is likely to spur others to do the same.\n\nIf a confidence vote is held and May loses, it would trigger a party leadership contest in which any Conservative lawmaker \u2014 except her \u2014 could run.\n\nThe turmoil is the latest eruption in the Conservative Party\u2019s long-running civil war over Europe. Ever since Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the party has been split between supporters and opponents of Britain\u2019s membership. In 2016, then-Prime Minister David Cameron called a referendum \u201cto settle this European question in British politics\u201d once and for all.\n\nHe was confident the country would vote to remain, but voters opted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the EU, a result that left both the Conservatives and the country more divided than ever. Cameron\u2019s successor, May, has been struggling ever since to deliver a Brexit that satisfies those who want to leave, reconciles those wanting to remain and doesn\u2019t rock the economy \u2014 a near-impossible balancing act.\n\nThursday\u2019s political mayhem prompted a big fall in the value of the pound, which was trading 1.5 percent lower at $1.2797 as investors fretted that Britain could crash out of the EU in March without a deal. That could see tariffs on British exports, border checks and restrictions on travelers and workers \u2014 a potentially toxic combination for businesses.\n\nBusiness groups have warned that if there is no deal by next month, companies will have to enact contingency plans that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, and relocating production overseas.\n\nMay and her supporters say the alternatives to her deal \u2014 leaving the bloc without a deal or a second vote on Brexit \u2014 are not realistic options.\n\nIf the agreement was abandoned, \u201cnobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow,\u201d May said. \u201cIt would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.\u201d\n\nNews that a deal had been struck after a year and a half of negotiations was welcomed in Brussels, and EU chief Donald Tusk called for a Nov. 25 summit of leaders so they can rubber-stamp the agreement.\n\nThe deal requires the consent of the European Parliament, whose chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, welcomed it as \u201cthe best agreement we could obtain.\u201d\n\nIt also needs approval from Britain\u2019s Parliament before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29 \u2014 and even if May survives as leader, the chances of that look slim.\n\nHer Conservative government doesn\u2019t have a parliamentary majority, and relies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the DUP has rejected the deal, saying its provisions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland would impose new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., weakening the bonds that hold the United Kingdom together.\n\nOpposition parties also signaled they would vote against the agreement.\n\nMain opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May should withdraw the \u201chalf-baked\u201d Brexit deal and that Parliament \u201ccannot and will not accept a false choice between this deal and no deal.\u201d\n\nIan Blackford, who heads the Scottish National Party in Parliament, said the deal was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d and urged May to \u201cstop the clock and go back to Brussels.\u201d\n\nAn EU official warned that Britain was unlikely to get a better deal. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is still ongoing, the official said both sides \u201cexhausted our margin of maneuver under our respective mandates.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels, where some EU officials hold out hope that Britain will change its mind about Brexit, officials watched the political upheaval with interest.\n\nTusk said it was \u201cnot for me to comment on the latest developments in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that the EU is prepared for a final deal with the U.K. in November,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also prepared for a no deal scenario \u2014 but of course we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCasert reported from Brussels.

She was accused of soliciting 187.5 million ringgit ($44.8 million) in 2016 from a manager at Jepak Holdings for her help in securing the contract and later receiving 1.5 million ringgit ($358,400) in 2017.\n\nThe Education Ministry awarded Jepak the contract without any open tender.\n\nThe charges came over a month after Rosmah, 66, pleaded not guilty to laundering illegal proceeds and tax evasion in a multibillion-dollar graft scandal that led to her husband\u2019s shocking electoral loss in May.\n\nRosmah\u2019s former aide, Rizal Mansor, was also charged with requesting and receiving bribes for himself and on behalf of Rosmah for the same project. He pleaded not guilty to four counts of corruption, including allegedly receiving 5 million ringgit ($2 million) on Rosmah\u2019s behalf and another 500,000 ringgit ($119,400) for himself as a reward for helping Jepak obtain the contract.\n\nIn a separate case, former Federal Territories Minister Adnan Mansor pleaded not guilty to receiving bribes worth 3 million ringgit ($716,400) related to several land deals in Kuala Lumpur. The three defendants are not related.\n\nRosmah, who was escorted by her husband Najib at the courthouse, was calm and waved to reporters but didn\u2019t speak. The three were released on bail.\n\nNajib, his former deputy and several high-ranking former officials have already been charged with corruption. Najib has accused the new government of seeking political vengeance.\n\nThe May 9 election outcome ushered in the first change of power since Malaysia\u2019s independence from Britain in 1957.

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nThere was no determination of crimes against humanity. The State Department assessment was held back, and a summary was quietly released in late September \u2014 a month after the United Nations took the lead in calling for possible prosecution against Myanmar\u2019s generals.\n\nNow, months later, major questions persist over Pompeo\u2019s handling of the Myanmar report, a $1.4 million undertaking.\n\nA bipartisan push in Congress seeks to obtain the full version of the report and get explanations on why Pompeo did not follow the memo\u2019s recommendation for a crimes-against-humanity designation.\n\n[Perspective: U.S. knows a lot about Myanmar\u2019s abuses. Why won\u2019t it share?]\n\nAt the State Department, meanwhile, officials initiated a diplomatic security investigation seeking to identify the person who leaked to a Politico reporter details of the deliberations on the crimes-against-humanity label, said the people familiar with the process. A State Department spokesman declined to comment on the leak investigation or the internal memo.\n\nMyanmar and its de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, faced strong pressure last week at regional summits in Singapore.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday took direct aim at Suu Kyi, saying she was trying to \u201cdefend the indefensible\u201d over the Rohingya abuses. A day later, Vice President Pence, in a tense meeting with Suu Kyi, said violence against the Rohingya was \u201cwithout excuse\u201d and pressed her on accountability for those responsible. He was the most senior U.S. official to meet the Myanmar leader since the crisis.\n\nStill, Pence and other officials have shied away from labels that could force the United States to act more strongly \u2014 giving Myanmar continued breathing room at a critical time.\n\nInside the State Department, meanwhile, regional specialists and human rights experts grimaced at what they viewed as a missed opportunity for the United States to throw its full weight behind growing international denunciations of Myanmar for the abuses, which drove out more than 700,000 Rohingya to refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.\n\nThe report, packed with damning details, was ready to go Aug. 17, the same day the United States sanctioned Myanmar generals and military units responsible for the atrocities.\n\nIts delay and quiet after-hours release over a month later launched another round of criticism of the Trump administration as unpredictable and erratic on human rights issues on the global stage.\n\n[Myanmar\u2019s reply to world outrage: Denial, defiance and propaganda]\n\nIn late August, a U.N. fact-finding mission found that Myanmar\u2019s campaign against the Rohingya bore the hallmarks of genocide and called for military generals to be investigated and prosecuted.\n\nFollowing the U.N. report, Canada\u2019s legislature in September voted unanimously to call the actions there genocide, and the European Union is considering removing Myanmar from a preferential trade status.\n\nThe United States, however, has struggled to define its position on Myanmar and decide on action to take in response.\n\nThe part of the State Department report made public \u2014 a 20-page executive summary released after hours on Sept. 24 \u2014 does not hold back.\n\nIt noted a \u201cpattern of planning and premeditation,\u201d punching holes in Myanmar\u2019s narrative that it was simply responding to attacks by Rohingya militants. Almost half of the Rohingya interviewed witnessed rape, and almost all witnessed killings.\n\n\u201cIn some areas, perpetrators used tactics that resulted in mass casualties, for example, locking people in houses to burn them, fencing off entire villages before shooting into the crowd, or sinking boats full of hundreds of fleeing Rohingya,\u201d the report said.\n\nStill, some lawmakers demand to see the full report, not just the summary. Rights groups, meanwhile, complain that it fails to spell out any next steps against Myanmar\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cWhile the facts of the State Department investigation are strong, what\u2019s missing is a clear indication of how the U.S. government intends to respond,\u201d said Sarah Margon, Washington director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn a rare bipartisan initiative, Sens. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) have taken the lead in calling for more answers from the Trump administration.\n\nIn late September, the two senators sent a letter to Pompeo noting that the State Department report \u201cdid not specifically define these atrocities as genocide or crimes against humanity.\u201d It went on to request a formal legal determination regarding the \u201cactions of the Burmese military to Congress without delay.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has not yet responded to the letter, a committee aide said.\n\nWhen asked about why the report included no determination on crimes against humanity, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told reporters in September \u201cthere weren\u2019t legal judgments expressed in it because that wasn\u2019t the point of the report.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was basically a forensic examination of what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral people familiar with the report, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media, speculated that Pompeo was upset by a leak of a speech intended to coincide with the report\u2019s planned release in August and that it prompted him to cancel the rollout.\n\n[Facebook blocks accounts of Myanmar\u2019s top general, other military brass]\n\nThe same day the report was released, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, announced $185 million in aid to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and those who remain in Myanmar. Haley announced on Oct. 9 that she would be resigning from her post by the end of the year.\n\nSome congressional aides attributed the change of State Department thinking to national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s hard-line opposition to the International Criminal Court. The United States is among several dozen nations, including China, India and Israel, that do not recognize the ICC, based in The Hague.\n\nIf the United States had formally accused Myanmar of crimes against humanity, Washington would have come under pressure to refer the allegations to the ICC through a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve put the administration in an awkward position, that it\u2019s okay for the ICC to go after Burma but not the United States,\u201d said a congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss government deliberations. Myanmar is also known as Burma.\n\nA State Department spokesman denied that the United States had stumbled, pointing to Pompeo\u2019s call for Myanmar to take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to investigate the human rights abuses chronicled in the U.S. and U.N. reports.\n\n\u201cThe United States will continue to work with our allies and partners to help promote . . . justice for victims, and [ensure] that those responsible for mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities are held accountable,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nJohn Hudson reported from Washington.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. sanctions Myanmar military commanders for their role in \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019\n\nU.N. report calls for Myanmar generals to be prosecuted over genocide, war crimes\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "China says foreign concerns over Muslim rights unwarranted", "description": "China says 15 foreign ambassadors exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country's Muslim minorities in re-education camps", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-says-foreign-concerns-over-muslim-rights-unwarranted/2018/11/15/281a8d30-e8b4-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T08:55:10Z", "content": "BEIJING China says 15 foreign ambassadors exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the countrys Muslim minorities in re-education camps.

(CCTV via AP Video, File) (Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China said Thursday that 15 foreign ambassadors exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country\u2019s Muslim minorities in re-education camps.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that it would be \u201cproblematic\u201d if the diplomats were attempting to put pressure on local authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the detentions have taken place.\n\nHua said the letter violated the terms of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations and that the ambassadors should not \u201cinterfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs ambassadors, they are supposed to play positive roles in promoting mutual understanding, mutual trust and cooperation ... rather than making unreasonable requests to the countries where they are based,\u201d Hua said.\n\nShe said the letter issued this week and reportedly spearheaded by Canada was based on hearsay, despite widely distributed reports from detainees, relatives and officials documenting the sweeping and seemingly arbitrary detentions.\n\nInmates and relatives say the camps impose military-style discipline and punishments and force detainees to renounce their religion and culture while swearing fealty to President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party.\n\nAsked about the letter, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had \u201chighlighted the questions and concerns that we have\u201d surrounding the issue in his bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore.\n\n\u201cCanada will continue to look for ways to advance and promote human rights in partnership with our likeminded allies everywhere around the world,\u201d Trudeau said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nThe letter to the Chinese government has not been made public, but the Reuters news agency said it was signed by 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, and Australian envoys.\n\nDiplomats from the countries named in the report either did not reply to requests for confirmation or said they had no comment.\n\nHua\u2019s comments came as a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is bringing a measure to urge President Donald Trump to help Chinese Muslims respond to the crackdown.\n\nThe legislation would urge Trump to condemn \u201cgross violations\u201d of human rights in Xinjiang, where the U.N. estimates that as many as 1 million Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities are being held in arbitrary detention.\n\nIt would also support an existing push for sanctions against Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo and other officials under the Magnitsky Act, which prevents foreign officials from entering the U.S. and freezes any assets they have in U.S. banks.\n\nOther sanctions raised for consideration by the act include a ban on sales of U.S.-made goods or services to Xinjiang state agents such as those that could be used for surveillance and suppression.\n\nChinese authorities have denied that the internment camps exist, but say petty criminals are sent to \u201cemployment training centers.\u201d The Xinjiang government has revised regulations to officially permit the use of \u201ceducation and training centers\u201d to reform \u201cpeople influenced by extremism.\u201d\n\nThe rules direct the centers to teach the Mandarin language, occupational and legal education, as well as \u201cideological education, psychological rehabilitation and behavior correction.\u201d\n\nXinjiang\u2019s native Uighur and Kazakh ethnic groups are culturally, religiously and linguistically distinct from China\u2019s Han majority and the region has been home to a low-intensity rebellion against rule from Beijing. Many of the region\u2019s natives say their culture is under threat from Chinese policies aiming to assimilate them and that they face disadvantages in education and employment from Han migrants from other parts of China.\n\nMembers of the Muslim Hui ethnic group \u2014 culturally and linguistically closer to the Han \u2014 have also been ensnared in the campaign that has drawn comparisons to Mao Zedong\u2019s radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\n\nAlso on Thursday, China\u2019s Cabinet released a report entitled \u201cProtection and Development of Xinjiang Culture,\u201d that stressed the importance of adopting Mandarin Chinese among ethnic groups and referred to their Islamic faith as \u201creligious culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cXinjiang adheres to the historical tradition of the Sinosization of religion and actively adapts religion to socialist society,\u201d the report said.\n\n___\n\nMcNeil reported from Singapore.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The DUP says the plans would treat Northern Ireland different to the rest of the U.K. in trade terms with the EU, weakening the bonds that hold the U.K. together.\n\nThe DUP leader in Parliament, Nigel Dodds, said the \u201cchoice is now clear: we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom, or we vote for a vassal state with the breakup of the United Kingdom, that is the choice.\u201d\n\n___\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nRomania\u2019s government says the deal Britain struck to leave the European Union will provide security for hundreds of thousands of Romanians living in the country.\n\nThe foreign ministry welcomed the deal which \u201cguarantees the protection of the rights,\u201d of Romanians in Britain who\u2019ll be able to keep on working, living and studying there after Dec. 2020 when Britain is set to leave the European single market that guarantees the free movement of anyone in the EU.\n\nIn a statement sent to The Associated Press, the ministry said the deal \u201climits the negative consequences\u201d of Brexit for business and foreigners living in Britain.\n\nRomanian officials estimate about half a million Romanians live in Britain, although just 190,000 are officially registered there.\n\n___\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nBritish opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn says Prime Minister Theresa May must withdraw her \u201chalf-baked\u201d Brexit deal with the European Union or Parliament will reject it.\n\nLabour Party leader Corbyn says Parliament \u201ccannot and will not accept a false choice between this deal and no deal.\u201d\n\nMay is fighting to keep the divorce agreement with the EU alive.

They follow Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey.\n\nAll are staunch supporters of Brexit and say the deal agreed between Britain and the bloc does not deliver the firm break with the EU that voters chose in a 2016 referendum.\n\nMay says the deal honors the referendum result while also maintaining close ties with the EU, Britain\u2019s main trading partner. But her ability to get it through Parliament \u2014 and to remain as prime minister \u2014 are now in doubt.\n\n___\n\n10:10 a.m.\n\nA second British Cabinet minister has resigned in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s proposed Brexit deal with the European Union.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey quit, saying the deal \u201cdoes not honor the result of the referendum\u201d in which Britain voted to leave the EU.\n\nShe resigned an hour after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab also quit, saying he could not \u201cin good conscience\u201d support the deal.\n\nThe resignations leave May\u2019s Brexit deal, and her leadership of the Conservative Party, in peril.\n\n___\n\n9:15 a.m.\n\nThe pound has fallen sharply after Britain\u2019s Brexit minister resigned from the government, saying he did not agree with the deal the country had struck with the European Union over the terms of its departure next March.\n\nThe currency dropped 1 percent, a relatively large decline for an established currency, to $1.2870 within minutes of a tweet by Dominic Raab saying he \u201ccannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May faces a political backlash over the deal, which is considered insufficient by Brexit backers as well as those who wanted to remain in the EU.

Many in her own party oppose the deal for leaving Britain too closely tied to the European bloc and opposition parties have said they\u2019ll vote against.\n\nPacifying some in her own party will be a challenge and on Thursday Shailesh Vara quit as Northern Ireland Minister, saying he could not support May\u2019s agreement, which he said \u201cleaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation.\u201d\n\n___\n\n7:45 a.m.\n\nEuropean Union chief Donald Tusk has called for a summit of leaders to take place on Nov. 25 so they can endorse a draft Brexit deal that has been reached with the British government.\n\nFollowing an early Thursday meeting, Tusk heaped praise on the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who had \u201cachieved the two most important objectives\u201d \u2014 limiting the damage caused by Britain\u2019s impending departure and maintaining the interests of the other 27 countries that will remain in the bloc after Brexit.\n\nWhile British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to win support within her fractured party as well as Parliament, the EU has held the line behind Barnier during the negotiations.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Gerry Broome/Associated Press)\n\nDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 Drake has already been spotted wearing Zion Williamson\u2019s high school jersey.\n\nLet that be proof: Duke\u2019s season is just starting, and the Blue Devils\u2019 freshmen have already arrived.\n\nJust three games into their college careers, the youngsters have made top-ranked Duke the top story in college basketball. But Williamson said it\u2019s not all about the freshmen.\n\n\u201cThis is a team, and there are other players \u2014 there are upperclassmen, and they lead us, because they\u2019ve been through this,\u201d said the 6-foot-7, 285-pound Williamson who wows fans with his athletic ability and acrobatic dunks. \u201cWe can sit here and say we know what away games will be like, but we really don\u2019t until we experience it.\u201d\n\nEveryone seems to want to take that journey with them.\n\nIt\u2019s early, but the youngsters are becoming a must-see phenomenon while their highlights take social media by storm and even their pregame layup lines draw oohs and aahs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so much more than just highlight plays and dunks,\u201d co-captain Jack White said. \u201cThese guys are great basketball players.\u201d\n\nIt all started, of course, with that season-opening 118-84 rout of then-No. 2 Kentucky, turning the Champions Classic into their personal and collective showcase.\n\nA group that showed up on campus as the consensus No. 1 recruiting class in the nation has done nothing to disprove that evaluation. Tre Jones, at 6-2, runs the point. The 6-8 Cameron Reddish spots up for 3-pointers. Then there\u2019s 6-7 RJ Barrett, the top-rated player in the class, does a little bit of everything. And Williamson runs the floor and finishes strong at the rim \u2014 often dazzling the crowd in the process.\n\n\u201cAs long as we play unselfish and play together,\u201d Reddish said, \u201cwe\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\n\nAccording to Duke officials, the team\u2019s Instagram videos during the first week of the season were viewed more than 2 million times \u2014 more than fellow blueblood programs Kentucky (412,000) and North Carolina (172,000).\n\nThe highlights kept coming throughout an 84-46 beatdown of Eastern Michigan on Wednesday night.\n\nOne in particular \u2014 perhaps Williamson\u2019s signature dunk , at least so far \u2014 stood out.\n\nReddish lofted an alley-oop pass that at first seemed headed for the Duke pep band. Williamson leaped so high to grab it that his armpits and eyes were level with the rim, and he slammed it home. By that point, Williamson had more dunks (four) than Eastern Michigan had field goals (three).\n\nWilliamson acknowledged that he even surprises himself sometimes.\n\nIn the locker room after Wednesday night\u2019s game, he broke into a hearty laugh when teammate Joey Baker pulled out his cellphone to show a photo proving that Williamson did, in fact, soar to eye-level with the rim.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get super-hyped,\u201d he quipped, \u201cbut I had to get back on defense.\u201d\n\nHaving one-and-done players roll through the program has become commonplace in recent years \u2014 Duke replaced four one-year players from last season with this group \u2014 and Barrett and Williamson are popular projections as the first two picks in next June\u2019s NBA draft. Both of them have scored at least 20 points in all three games.\n\nNor is Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski a stranger to the spotlight that always glares on the Duke program he\u2019s led to five national championships.\n\nBut college stardom is a new experience for these freshmen, and what Krzyzewski has described as \u201cexceptional noise\u201d surrounding the team became exponentially louder after the 34-point rout of Kentucky \u2014 now arguably no longer the capital of one-and-done.\n\nIn the days after that victory, Scott paid the freshmen a visit , and they learned to come to grips with just how their accomplishments resonated throughout the sport. Reddish said that putting the Kentucky win in the past and moving on was \u201cdefinitely tough\u201d but that \u201cwe can\u2019t dwell on any win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep getting better every day,\u201d he added.\n\nIf that happens, it may be impossible to drown out that \u201cexceptional noise.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Lieberman announced his resignation Wednesday over the Gaza cease-fire, making early elections likely. (Ariel Schalit/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s defense minister officially submitted his resignation on Thursday, leaving the government with the narrowest of parliamentary majorities and paving what looks like a clear path to early elections.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman dispatched a once-sentence letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, informing him of his decision to step down. The move, which takes effect in 48 hours, leaves Netanyahu with the support of just 61 out of 120 lawmakers.\n\nWith other coalition partners also flexing their muscles and the opposition parties demanding an early election, the days of Netanyahu\u2019s current government seem to be numbered.\n\nNetanyahu was meeting with coalition partners on Thursday. Two of them, Moshe Kahlon of the centrist Kulanu Party and Arye Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, both urged him to call early elections.\n\nKahlon told the prime minister that holding elections would be the \u201cright thing to do\u201d in the current environment, and that a new, strong and stable government should be formed, his office said.\n\nLate on Thursday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry announced that Netanyahu had canceled a planned trip to Austria next week amid the deepening crisis.\n\nLieberman\u2019s abrupt resignation came in protest to a cease-fire reached with Gaza militants that ended two days of intense fighting. The hard-liner had demanded a far harsher Israeli response to the widest wave of Gaza rocket fire against Israel since a 50-day war in 2014, but was overruled by Netanyahu.\n\nIn his live TV announcement on Wednesday, Lieberman lashed out the government\u2019s weakness and termed the cease-fire \u201csurrender to terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe move immediately set off furious political jockeying, with insiders predicting it marked the opening salvo of a new political campaign.\n\nParliamentary elections are schedule for a year from now but Israeli governments rarely serve out their full terms. The last time that happened was in 1988. Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s fiercest coalition rival, Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, was the first to pounce, threatening to leave the coalition too if he wasn\u2019t appointed defense minister in Lieberman\u2019s place. That, however, appeared unlikely given the bad blood between the two and the overall shaky nature of such a slim coalition. The two were expected to meet on Friday.\n\nThe government also faces a looming Supreme Court-dictated deadline to pass a contentious new law mandating the military draft of ultra-Orthodox men. It has deeply divided the coalition and threatened to break it up even before Lieberman bolted.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult yesterday evening to find anyone in the political establishment who would say that elections are far off. Any date between March and May 2019 appears logical,\u201d wrote columnist Ben Caspit in the Maariv daily. \u201cThe Netanyahu government is stumbling toward its end.\u201d\n\nWith such uncertainty, the major players are already positioning themselves.\n\n\u201cThis government has failed to establish deterrence. This is not a right-wing government and there is no point to its existence,\u201d Bennett\u2019s party colleague, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, told Israel\u2019s Army Radio. \u201cBennett could be a big help to the prime minister as defense minister.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself, but the current timing is not ideal for him. He has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his ruling Likud Party.\n\nA poll aired Wednesday on Israel\u2019s top-rated TV newscast after Lieberman\u2019s resignation showed 74 percent of Israelis to be displeased with Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the recent Gaza crisis.\n\nNetanyahu still appeared to have little competition for the post of prime minister, though support for his Likud party dipped compared to previous polls. If elections were held today, Likud looked to win 29 seats, followed by the centrist Yesh Atid party at 18 and Labor at 11.\n\nThe Midgam poll surveyed 500 Israelis and had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nNetanyahu is also vulnerable to a potential corruption indictment that could rattle the entire political campaign.\n\nPolice have already questioned Netanyahu a dozen times and recommended that he be indicted on bribery and breach of trust charges in two cases. The first involves allegedly taking gifts from billionaires and the second for allegedly discussing legislation that favored a major newspaper in exchange for positive media coverage. Netanyahu has also been grilled about a corruption case involving Israel\u2019s telecom giant.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, is expected to make a decision on charges in the coming months.\n\nNetanyahu has angrily rejected the accusations against him as part of a media-orchestrated witch-hunt that is obsessed with removing him from office.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Because 4 percent unemployment means an 8 or 9 percent unemployment in some cities for black women. It means a 16 percent unemployment rate for black men. It means young veterans coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan, a 20 percent unemployment rate. So our work really isn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), remarks at the National Action Network Conference, Nov. 14, 2018\n\nFor 2020 presidential hopefuls, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years is a challenge. So prospective candidates have acknowledged it but argued that it is still not good enough.\n\nReaders may recall that in October, we noted that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was traveling around Iowa with a line in stump speech that suggested the unemployment rate was so low because people were working two or three jobs. Her staff said she was not asserting a fact, simply raising something she had heard anecdotally. But the day the fact check ran, the line was suddenly gone from her speech.\n\nNow, another prospective 2020 candidate is taking a different tack. Speaking before the National Action Network, the civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Gillibrand decided to focus on the fact that, for some people \u2013 African American men, women and young veterans, specifically \u2013 the unemployment rates are still high.\n\nBut her numbers seemed off. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe overall unemployment rate was 3.7 percent in October, the lowest since December 1969. Here are the claims Gillibrand made:\n\n8 or 9 percent unemployment in some cities for black women\n\n16 percent unemployment rate for black men\n\n20 percent unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in October, the unemployment rate was 6.2 percent for African American men and 4.9 percent for African American women.\n\nGillibrand spokesman Alex Phillips said the senator accidentally dropped a word \u2013 \u201cyoung\u201d \u2013 from her prepared remarks and meant to say \u201cyoung black men\u201d and \u201cyoung black women.\u201d\n\nUsing detailed, but not seasonally adjusted, BLS data for October, one can calculate that the unemployment rate for African American men and women ages 18 to 24 was 16.4 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively. Those are, indeed, the numbers used by Gillibrand. She just failed to use the word \u201cyoung.\u201d The BLS breaks out the numbers as 18 to 19 years old and 20 to 24 years old, but the raw numbers are presented, so a calculation combining those two categories is possible.\n\n(During the 2016 campaign, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used to falsely claim the unemployment rate for black youths was 58 percent. His staff came up with that statistic by including not only people seeking work, but everyone who was not in the labor force at the time, such as students. He also included 16- and 17-year-olds, who are mostly students. That statistic was wildly off base and earned Four Pinocchios.)\n\nUnemployment figures for African Americans are even higher than the national average in some cities, such as in Buffalo and Erie, N.Y.\n\nAs for \u201cyoung veterans,\u201d BLS data that is not seasonally adjusted shows that for \u201cGulf War-era II veterans\u201d ages 18 to 24, the unemployment rate in October was 12.6 percent. (Seasonally adjusted data is only available for all Gulf War II veterans, showing a rate of 2.7 percent.)\n\nHere again, Gillibrand got it wrong. Phillips said Gillibrand used 20 percent because \u201cshe misspoke the stat off the cuff,\u201d but \u201cher point remains unchanged\u201d that the numbers are unusually high for young veterans. She noted that as recently as March, it was 16.4 percent for veterans 18 to 24 years old.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nRegular readers know that we generally do not award Pinocchios when a politician admits error. We certainly can understand a slip of the tongue, but it is never a clever idea to try to ad-lib a statistic.\n\nSomehow, Gillibrand managed to mangle three statistics in three consecutive sentences before a large audience. If you are trying to make the case that you can provide better economic stewardship, you need to get the numbers right first.\n\nReaders have the option of offering their own rating below.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Sean Sullivan", "title": "Federal judge gives Florida voters until Saturday to correct signature problems roiling close races", "description": "A federal judge has ordered more time for Florida voters and elections officials to clear up mismatched signatures on about 4,000 rejected ballots.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/morning-mix/federal-judge-gives-florida-voters-until-saturday-to-correct-signature-problems-roiling-close-races/2018/11/15/169a2d35-3a27-474d-8045-e2e6e634c61a_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:55:19Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nSen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), whose reelection contest against Republican Gov. Rick Scott is still undecided, speaks at a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s historic recount was thrown once more into uncertainty Thursday when a federal judge ruled that voters whose mail-in and provisional ballots were rejected because of issues with their signatures will have two more days to resolve the problems and possibly have their votes counted.\n\nThe decision by Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court in Tallahassee came just hours ahead of the Thursday afternoon deadline for elections officials to complete a machine recount. It is particularly notable in the too-close-to-call Senate race, in which Gov. Rick Scott (R) leads Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by fewer than 13,000 votes.\n\nWalker\u2019s decision affects Floridians who cast their ballots by mail, or voted provisionally, but whose signatures did not match records maintained by state officials. More than 4,000 ballots across 45 counties in Florida were set aside because of inconsistent signatures, he wrote in his opinion. In the other 22 counties, the number is unknown.\n\nThe judge concluded that mail-in voters weren\u2019t notified of the discrepancy until it was too late to fix, while state law gives provisional voters no opportunity to resolve apparent signature irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe precise issue in this case is whether Florida\u2019s law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures \u2014 with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection \u2014 passes constitutional muster,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe answer is simple. It does not.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling gives Nelson new hope for chipping away at his deficit, it falls short of the more sweeping decision his lawyers sought and is probably not enough to change the outcome of the race on its own. The judge, in a decision released early Thursday, stopped short of invalidating the signature-match requirement, concluding instead that the directive had been applied unlawfully. He also declined Nelson\u2019s demand that all the mismatched ballots be counted \u201csight unseen,\u201d as the judge put it.\n\nDrawing an analogy to the rules governing football, he declined to throw out the regulation just because there had been a faulty call, observing, \u201cFootball fans may quibble about the substance of the rules, but no one quibbles that rules are necessary to play the game.\u201d\n\nStill, the order raises new questions about next steps in the recount in three statewide contests \u2014 the races for governor and agriculture commissioner, in addition to Nelson\u2019s reelection bid. Unofficial results in the bitter contest over the governor\u2019s mansion showed Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) leading Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, by nearly 34,000 votes, or roughly .4 percentage points. Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was .14 percentage points.\n\n[Does your vote count in Florida? It might depend on your signature.]\n\nIn his ruling, Walker said the plaintiffs, the Florida Democratic Party and the Nelson campaign, had established \u201cirreparable injury\u201d to the constitutional right of citizens \u201cto cast their ballots and have them counted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, potentially thousands of voters have been deprived of the right to cast a legal vote \u2014 and have that vote counted \u2014 by an untrained canvassing board member based on an arbitrary determination that their respective signatures did not match,\u201d wrote the judge, appointed to the federal bench in 2012 by President Barack Obama. \u201cSuch a violation of the right to vote cannot be undone.\u201d\n\nWalker emphasized that the court was not instructing county canvassing boards to \u201ccount every mismatched vote.\u201d But he said the state\u2019s process for curing ballots with irregular signatures had been applied improperly, robbing voters of the chance to make corrections before Nov. 5. State law requires canvassing boards to notify voters \u201cimmediately\u201d if they determine that a mail-in ballot contains a signature inconsistent with the one on file.\n\nOfficials were therefore required, he argued, to allow voters another opportunity to have their ballots counted before the second official results are certified. \u201cThe county supervisors are directed to allow those voters who should have had an opportunity to cure their ballots in the first place to cure their votes-by-mail and provisional ballots now,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe court dismissed the state\u2019s argument that an additional delay would erode faith in the election. There was no reason, the judge observed, why giving all eligible voters the chance to be included would threaten the process.\n\n\u201cRegardless, any potential hardship imposed by providing an actual opportunity to challenge the determination that a signature does not match, and thus, a vote does not count, is outweighed by the risk of unconstitutionally depriving eligible voters of their right to vote and have that vote counted,\u201d Walker found.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign is expected to appeal the decision.\n\nThe ruling was part of a flurry of courtroom activity that could influence the high-stakes Senate race, even as local election officials scrambled to meet the Thursday deadline to complete their work. The dispute over signatures recalls the scrutiny of hanging chads by the same three-member canvassing boards after the contested presidential election in 2000. Florida is again the focal point of a contest over voting and electoral legitimacy.\n\nElection officials in Broward County, a populous Democratic stronghold, maintained that they would meet the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline for completing a machine recount. Officials in Palm Beach County faced problems with the counting machines themselves and have said they can\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll be done Thursday.\n\nRepresentatives of the Republican and Democratic parties attended a \u201cwalk-through\u201d at the Broward elections office to prepare for the manual recount expected to follow in the Senate race.\n\n[Read the full decision]"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "EU sets Nov. 25 as summit day to endorse Brexit", "description": "European Union chief Donald Tusk calls for Nov. 25 summit to endorse draft Brexit deal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-sets-nov-25-as-summit-day-to-endorse-brexit/2018/11/15/fa961e00-e8aa-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T07:49:29Z", "content": "BRUSSELS European Union chief Donald Tusk has called for a summit of leaders to take place on Nov. 25 so they can endorse a draft Brexit deal that has been reached with the British government.

British Prime Minister Theresa May says if politicians reject her Brexit deal, it will set the country on \u201ca path of deep and grave uncertainty.\u201d Defiant in the face of mounting criticism, May said Thursday she believed \u201cwith every fiber of my being\u201d that the deal her government struck with the European Union was the right one. (Matt Dunham, Pool/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May defied mounting calls to quit or change course Thursday over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, warning that abandoning her Brexit plan would plunge the country into \u201cdeep and grave uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s long-simmering divisions over its future in the EU erupted into turmoil just a day after the government agreed to a divorce deal with the bloc. Two Cabinet ministers resigned and some lawmakers from May\u2019s own party called for her to be replaced. The crisis threatened to destroy the Brexit agreement, unseat the prime minister and send the U.K. hurtling toward the EU exit without a plan.\n\nIn an evening news conference aimed at regaining some control, May said she believed \u201cwith every fiber of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to see this through? Yes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hard-won agreement with the EU has infuriated pro-Brexit members of May\u2019s divided Conservative Party. They say the agreement, which calls for close trade ties between the U.K. and the bloc, would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU rules it has no say in making.\n\nMay insisted that Brexit meant making \u201cthe right choices, not the easy ones\u201d and urged lawmakers to support the deal \u201cin the national interest.\u201d\n\nBut she was weakened by the resignation of two senior Cabinet ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. Hours after he sat in the meeting that approved the deal, Raab said he \u201ccannot in good conscience\u201d support it.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey followed Raab out the door. She said in a letter that it is \u201cno good trying to pretend to (voters) that this deal honors the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA handful of junior government ministers also quit, and leading pro-Brexit lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called for a vote of no-confidence in May.\n\nRees-Mogg said May\u2019s deal \u201cis not Brexit\u201d because it would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU, potentially for an indefinite period. He said May was \u201closing the confidence of Conservative members of Parliament.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg called for May to be replaced by a more firmly pro-Brexit politician, naming ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Raab as potential successors.\n\nUnder Conservative rules, a confidence vote in the leader is triggered if 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers \u2014 currently 48 \u2014 write a letter to the party\u2019s 1922 Committee of backbenchers, which oversees leadership votes.\n\nOnly committee chairman Graham Brady knows for sure how many missives have been sent, but Rees-Mogg\u2019s letter is likely to spur others to do the same.\n\nIf a confidence vote is held and May loses, it would trigger a party leadership contest in which any Conservative lawmaker \u2014 except her \u2014 could run.\n\nThe turmoil is the latest eruption in the Conservative Party\u2019s long-running civil war over Europe. Ever since Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the party has been split between supporters and opponents of Britain\u2019s membership. In 2016, then-Prime Minister David Cameron called a referendum \u201cto settle this European question in British politics\u201d once and for all.\n\nHe was confident the country would vote to remain, but voters opted by 52 percent to 48 percent to quit the EU, a result that left both the Conservatives and the country more divided than ever. Cameron\u2019s successor, May, has been struggling ever since to deliver a Brexit that satisfies those who want to leave, reconciles those wanting to remain and doesn\u2019t rock the economy \u2014 a near-impossible balancing act.\n\nThursday\u2019s political mayhem prompted a big fall in the value of the pound, which was trading 1.5 percent lower at $1.2797 as investors fretted that Britain could crash out of the EU in March without a deal. That could see tariffs on British exports, border checks and restrictions on travelers and workers \u2014 a potentially toxic combination for businesses.\n\nBusiness groups have warned that if there is no deal by next month, companies will have to enact contingency plans that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, and relocating production overseas.\n\nMay and her supporters say the alternatives to her deal \u2014 leaving the bloc without a deal or a second vote on Brexit \u2014 are not realistic options.\n\nIf the agreement was abandoned, \u201cnobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow,\u201d May said. \u201cIt would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it.\u201d\n\nNews that a deal had been struck after a year and a half of negotiations was welcomed in Brussels, and EU chief Donald Tusk called for a Nov. 25 summit of leaders so they can rubber-stamp the agreement.\n\nThe deal requires the consent of the European Parliament, whose chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, welcomed it as \u201cthe best agreement we could obtain.\u201d\n\nIt also needs approval from Britain\u2019s Parliament before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29 \u2014 and even if May survives as leader, the chances of that look slim.\n\nHer Conservative government doesn\u2019t have a parliamentary majority, and relies on the support of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the DUP has rejected the deal, saying its provisions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland would impose new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., weakening the bonds that hold the United Kingdom together.\n\nOpposition parties also signaled they would vote against the agreement.\n\nMain opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said May should withdraw the \u201chalf-baked\u201d Brexit deal and that Parliament \u201ccannot and will not accept a false choice between this deal and no deal.\u201d\n\nIan Blackford, who heads the Scottish National Party in Parliament, said the deal was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d and urged May to \u201cstop the clock and go back to Brussels.\u201d\n\nAn EU official warned that Britain was unlikely to get a better deal. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is still ongoing, the official said both sides \u201cexhausted our margin of maneuver under our respective mandates.\u201d\n\nIn Brussels, where some EU officials hold out hope that Britain will change its mind about Brexit, officials watched the political upheaval with interest.\n\nTusk said it was \u201cnot for me to comment on the latest developments in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that the EU is prepared for a final deal with the U.K. in November,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also prepared for a no deal scenario \u2014 but of course we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCasert reported from Brussels.

Since late March, thousands of Gazans have joined the Hamas-led demonstrations in a bid to end a crippling Israeli blockade.\n\nProtesters frequently lob grenades, flaming tires and firebombs toward Israeli troops, who respond with tear gas and live fire. Some 170 Palestinians, many of them unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire. Israel says it is defending its border against militant attackers.\n\nHamas had lowered the intensity of the protests in recent weeks as U.N. and Egyptian mediators made progress toward an unofficial agreement with Israel.\n\nBut then this week\u2019s fighting erupted after a botched Israeli undercover military operation in Gaza.\n\nGaza militants fired 460 rockets into Israel, while the Israeli air force struck 160 targets in Gaza. The fighting left a total of 14 Palestinians, including 12 militants, dead. An Israeli officer was killed during the Gaza raid, while a Palestinian laborer who worked in Israel was killed in a rocket attack.\n\nIn their announcement, protest organizers in Gaza urged people to demonstrate Friday \u201cto thank the resistance\u201d for battling Israel.\n\nBut in statements on Facebook, organizers also urged demonstrators to stay away from the border fence, a sign that Friday\u2019s protest would be restrained.\n\nIn another sign of quiet, Hamas announced Thursday that Egyptian mediators had arrived in Gaza to work on promoting a deeper cease-fire arrangement with Israel.\n\nHamas and its supporters have celebrated the cease-fire as a victory against the powerful Israeli military.\n\nIn Israel, the cease-fire has triggered a political crisis. Israel\u2019s defense minister, who favored a much harsher response, resigned to protest the truce, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could soon be forced to call an early election.\n\nAngry Israelis in rocket-scarred southern communities near Gaza have protested against the cease-fire in recent days. Another demonstration was being held Thursday night in Tel Aviv.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Israeli police said that a knife-wielding Palestinian attacker sneaked into a Jerusalem police station and lightly wounded four police officers before he was shot and apprehended.\n\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the knife-wielding attacker climbed over the station\u2019s fence late on Wednesday night and began stabbing officers inside.

(Massoud Hossaini/Associated Press)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 A blistering overnight attack by the Taliban on an Afghan police outpost in western Farah province killed 30 policemen, Afghan officials said Thursday.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of brutal and near-daily Taliban assaults on the military and police forces, government and other installations throughout the country. The resurgent Taliban, who in recent years have taken over nearly half of Afghanistan, did not comment on the attack in Farah.\n\nThe attacks have been so relentless that authorities no longer regularly provide casualty figures, but unofficial estimates say that about 45 Afghan policemen or soldiers are killed or wounded on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to provincial council member Dadullah Qani, the overnight onslaught on the outpost in Farah\u2019s district of Khaki Safed began late on Wednesday and continued for more than four hours.\n\nIn Kabul, lawmaker Samiullah Samim told The Associated Press that the Taliban killed all 30 policemen \u2014 members of both the national and local police force \u2014 who were deployed at the outpost, including the district police commander, Abdul Jabhar.\n\nRetaliatory airstrikes killed 17 Taliban fighters but the insurgents still managed to get away with a large amount of weapons and ammunition, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting with the Taliban in two districts of central Ghazni province has displaced thousands of people in the past two weeks, most of them minority ethnic Hazaras, who are Shiites, said Mohammad Arif Rahmani, a lawmaker from Ghazni.\n\nAlso, about 100 Afghan policemen, local pro-government militiamen and soldiers have been killed in the bitter clashes there, Rahmani told the AP. Currently, Afghan security forces are battling insurgents in 22 of the country\u2019s 34 provinces, he added.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s protracted war has also become increasingly deadly for civilians. A United Nations report issued earlier this year said more civilians died in the first six months of 2018 than in any year since 2009, when the U.N. mission first began monitoring civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cEvery day in the first six months of 2018, an average of nine civilians, including two children, were killed in the conflict in Afghanistan,\u201d said the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network in its own report.\n\nSecurity forces at outposts throughout the country routinely face shortages of weapons, ammunition and even food supplies, said military analyst Javed Kohistani, blaming government mismanagement.\n\nMore senior and experienced generals have been replaced with younger officers whose inexperience is compromising the strength of the security forces.\n\nThere are fewer and fewer recruits and in some areas, a battalion which should have 400 to 600 troops barely has 100 to 200 soldiers, he said.\n\n\u201cNobody is joining the army,\u201d he said.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Defense Minister Gen.

(Jung Yeon-je/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCHEORWON, South Korea \u2014 South Korea exploded one of its own front-line guard posts Thursday, sending plumes of thick, black smoke into the sky above the border with North Korea, in the most dramatic scene to date in the rivals\u2019 efforts to reduce animosities that sparked last year\u2019s fears of war.\n\nLast week, the two Koreas finished withdrawing troops and firearms from some of the guard posts along their border before dismantling them. The steps are part of agreements signed in September during a meeting between their leaders in Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital.\n\nOn Thursday, South Korea\u2019s military invited a group of journalists to watch the destruction of a guard post with dynamite in the central border area of Cheorwon. The journalists were asked to stay hundreds of meters (yards) away as black smoke enveloped the hilly border area. They later watched soldiers and other workers bulldoze another guard post.\n\nMost of the South Korean guard posts are being destroyed with construction equipment for environmental and safety reasons, but dynamite was used for the first structure because of its location on a high hill where it was difficult to use excavators, the Defense Ministry said.\n\nNorth Korea is demolishing its guard posts with explosives, according to South Korean media.\n\nThe guard posts are inside the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide border called the Demilitarized Zone. Despite its name, it\u2019s the world\u2019s most heavily fortified border with an estimated 2 million land mines planted in and near the zone.\n\nThe area has been the site of violence and bloodshed since the 1945 division of the Korean Peninsula, and civilians need special government approval to enter the zone.\n\nThe Koreas each agreed to dismantle or disarm 11 of their guard posts by the end of this month before jointly verifying the destruction next month. South Korea had about 60 posts inside the DMZ guarded by layers of barbed wire and manned by troops with machine guns. North Korea was estimated to have 160 such front-line posts.\n\nUnder the September agreements, the Koreas are also disarming the shared border village of Panmunjom and clearing mines from another DMZ area where they plan their first-ever joint searches for Korean War dead. They\u2019ve also halted live-fire exercises along the border.\n\nThe deals are among a set of steps they have taken since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to Seoul and Washington early this year with a vague commitment to nuclear disarmament. The fast-improving inter-Korean ties have raised worries among many in South Korea and the United States as global diplomacy on the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program has produced little recent progress.\n\nSpeaking in Washington on Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon acknowledged that criticism and offered reassurance that the South would not pursue economic cooperation with the North until there\u2019s \u201csignificant progress\u201d on denuclearization.\n\nBut he argued that improving inter-Korean relation would help, not hinder that process. He said another summit between South and North Korea could still take place this year. If it happens, Cho said it would break a \u201cglass ceiling\u201d in inter-Korean relations and could pave the way for another U.S.-North Korea summit.\n\n\u201cChairman Kim\u2019s visit to Seoul and South Korea is something that we have agreed upon, something that we can implement and something that is possible,\u201d Cho said at the Wilson Center think tank.\n\nThe two Korean leaders have already met three times this year, most recently in North Korea\u2019s capital in September. But a lack of progress in U.S.-led efforts to get the North to give up its nukes has added to doubts about whether plans for South Korean President Moon Jae-in to host Kim in the South Korean capital during 2018 can be realized.\n\nIf Kim, a third-generation hereditary ruler, visits Seoul, he would be the first North Korean leader to do so since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.\n\n___\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea.

(Associated Press)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 As Sri Lanka\u2019s president met with opposition lawmakers over a no-confidence vote against his newly appointed prime minister, thousands rallied in support of the prime minister he ousted, burning coffins representing what they called the death of democracy in the Indian Ocean nation.\n\nEarlier Thursday, rival lawmakers exchanged blows in Sri Lanka\u2019s Parliament after disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed the speaker had no authority to remove him from office by a voice vote. That happened Wednesday when lawmakers convened for the first time since a political crisis began Oct. 26 with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s ouster.\n\nSpeaker Karu Jayasuriya told the chamber that the country had no government and there was no prime minister.\n\nRajapaksa disagreed, saying \u201ca vote should have been taken. Such important motions should not be passed by a voice vote.\u201d He accused the speaker of partiality toward his party, the United National Party, led by Wickremesinghe.\n\nRajapaksa also repeated his call for new elections, suggesting that it was the best way to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe brawl erupted after the opposition asked for a vote on Rajapaksa\u2019s statement, with some lawmakers supporting him gathering in the middle of the house while others rushed Jayasuriya, tussling for his microphone.\n\nRajapaksa ally Dilum Amunugama was taken to a hospital with injuries to his hand incurred while trying to take the microphone from the speaker\u2019s table.\n\nSeveral dozen lawmakers in white robes in the 225-member house engaged in the melee, some throwing water bottles, pitching trash cans and landing kicks. Those opposed to Rajapaksa surrounded Jayasuriya to protect him. The commotion went on for about half an hour before Jayasuriya adjourned the house.\n\n\u201cThe speaker was under complete siege, he came very close to being physically assaulted by MPs supporting Rajapaksa,\u201d said Chandani Kirinde, a senior correspondent of the Sunday Times, a weekly paper in Sri Lanka. \u201cWhile clashes have happened in the house, this is probably the first time the speaker came under so much intimidation and abuse.\u201d\n\nSimilarly on Wednesday, Jayasuriya took a voice vote on the no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa after the chamber descended into chaos.\n\nHours after the parliamentary clashes, President Maithripala Sirisena held an emergency meeting with the leaders of the opposition parties that voted for the no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa.\n\nSirisena asked that Parliament take up the no-confidence motion again, striking the part that decried Wickremesinghe\u2019s ouster and Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment as unconstitutional and allow it to be debated and a roll call vote to be taken.\n\nSri Lanka has been in crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena suddenly fired Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena also had suspended Parliament, apparently to allow Rajapaksa time to gather support among lawmakers. But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena\u2019s order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections next month.\n\nThe political turmoil in Sri Lanka has drawn statements of concern from Western governments since Sirisena ousted Wickremesinghe. The United States said Thursday that it was closely following developments and urged all parties \u201cto adhere to the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is much at stake, and a prolonged crisis will jeopardize Sri Lanka\u2019s democracy, economic progress and international reputation,\u201d the State Department said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nOn Monday, BBC journalist Chris Mason summed up the state of Brexit talks with a blunt admission. \u201cPeople like me are paid . . . to have insight and foresight and hindsight about these things,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking at things right now, I haven\u2019t got the foggiest idea what is going to happen in the coming weeks.\"\n\nBy Wednesday evening, there was only slightly more clarity. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her cabinet had, following a \u201clong, detailed and impassioned debate,\u201d agreed on a draft withdrawal plan with the European Union. The outlines of the divorce were finalized with E.U. counterparts earlier this week following months of fitful negotiations.\n\nMay framed the day\u2019s developments as a \u201cdecisive step\u201d toward an orderly separation from the European Union, hoping to assuage fears that Britain could exit the continental bloc without any deal in place. The draft agreement, which is hundreds of pages long, leaves open the possibility that Britain could remain indefinitely in a customs union with the European Union. It also has provisions preventing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, one of the biggest sticking points in the talks.\n\nIn a news conference in Brussels, Michel Barnier, the E.U.'s chief negotiator on Brexit, welcomed signs of progress in London. \u201cThe United Kingdom will remain our friend, our partner, our ally,\u201d Barnier added.\n\nEven so, Brexit is hardly a fait accompli. \"Whatever happens, this deal is just the first stage of the lengthy process of ratifying Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. To follow are negotiations over Britain\u2019s future trade, security and economic relations with Europe \u2014 including side deals about immigration levels,\u201d noted my colleagues.\n\nThe deal with the European Union requires endorsement from European heads of state. Far more difficult will be a vote in Britain\u2019s Parliament, where May\u2019s plan may yet falter. At least a third of May\u2019s own cabinet members balked over the draft agreement, and the right-wing Northern Irish party that joined May\u2019s Conservatives in a ruling coalition will likely resist measures that legally separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the country.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement is the worst deal in history. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 13, 2018\n\nIn histrionic language, proponents of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit decried May\u2019s accommodation with the E.U. as a \u201cbetrayal\" that left Britain in thrall to \u201ccolonial rule from Brussels.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vassal state stuff,\u201d said Boris Johnson, who resigned as May\u2019s foreign secretary this summer after disagreeing with the course of negotiations. \u201cFor the first time in 1,000 years, this place, this Parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.\u201d There was rampant speculation on Wednesday that disgruntled hard-liners may force a vote of confidence on May\u2019s leadership within days.\n\nModerate voices lashed back, asking Brexiteers what they expected. \u201cThere was never any prospect of a good deal. Brexit is a salvage operation; even when it is done well, the boat is not in the condition it was before it sank,\u201d wrote Alex Massie in the center-right Spectator. He added that \u201cthere is a piquant irony in seeing committed Brexiteers complaining that if this is the deal, it\u2019s worse than remaining a full member of the E.U.\u201d\n\nBrexit was a defining moment for Western politics. It prefigured the rise of anti-immigrant parties elsewhere in Europe. President Trump, then considered a long shot against Hillary Clinton, seized upon its victory as a good omen for his own insurgency against a liberal establishment. British politicians like Johnson and Trump ally Nigel Farage offered visions of returning the country to its glory days, taking back control of its laws and its future from bureaucrats across the Channel.\n\nBut it was never as simple as that. May, who tepidly opposed Brexit before the referendum, has found it nearly impossible to navigate around both the demands of Brexit cheerleaders and the vastly superior negotiating position of the E.U. And the chaotic attempts to forge an agreement have led to growing calls for a new referendum on whether Brexit should happen at all.\n\nNew polls suggest a majority of Britons would favor holding another referendum on the final Brexit deal. Last month, some 700,000 pro-E.U. protesters marched through London demanding a second vote.\n\nA choice between a dodgy deal & no deal is no choice at all.\n\n\n\nThe British public deserve a real choice between leaving the EU on these terms or sticking with the deal we\u2019ve got inside the EU.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not buying this dodgy deal. Only the people can sort this out #PeoplesVote \u2014 People's Vote UK (@peoplesvote_uk) November 14, 2018\n\nBut that would require quite a few parliamentary twists and turns. For now, attention is focused on the scale of the potential rebellion against May. Not only is a significant portion of her own party angry, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has decried the \u201cshambolic handling\u201d of the Brexit negotiations and is also likely to reject her plan if it reaches a vote.\n\nThere\u2019s still the prospect of some Labour MPs \u201cbreaking the party whip to bail out Theresa May\u2019s deal,\" explained the left-leaning New Statesman. \u201cMany of their number want to avert a no-deal Brexit and worry that voting against May\u2019s deal will trigger one, and others are worried what will happen to them if they get on the wrong side of their constituents.\u201d\n\nBut if May\u2019s gambit fails, the ensuing weeks and months could produce ministerial resignations, a putsch against May and snap elections. \u201cThe impression is of a never-ending Brexit crisis, one that erodes trust in democracy,\u201d observed an editorial in the Guardian.\n\nAnd beyond that, there\u2019s the already mounting economic and social impact of this sundering of the union.\n\n\u201cBrexit is a human tragedy. Lost jobs, lost prospects and not a few lives (Brits in the EU, Europeans in the UK) genuinely wrecked,\u201d tweeted the Economist\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe. \u201cAnd all for a fantasy vision of an absolute, unlimited, all-or-nothing sovereignty that never existed and never will exist.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump and Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen never quite clicked personally as the president chafed at her explanations of complicated immigration issues and her inability to bring about massive changes at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWith Nielsen\u2019s departure now considered inevitable, her eventual replacement will find there\u2019s no getting around the immigration laws and court challenges that have thwarted the president\u2019s hard-line agenda at every turn \u2014 even if there\u2019s better personal chemistry.\n\nThe list of potential replacements for Nielsen includes a career lawman, two military officers and former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement head Thomas Homan \u2014 a tough-talker who echoes Trump\u2019s border rhetoric.\n\n\u201cA good DHS person ought to be able to scare America\u201d about heroin coming over the border and illegal crossings, former Trump campaign adviser Barry Bennett said. \u201cBut, the system is so against you legally and structurally.\u201d\n\nTrump soured on Nielsen in part over frustrations that she has not been able to do more to address what he has called a \u201ccrisis\u201d at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has seized on statistics about illegal border crossings that have grown on her watch after reaching a record low early in his term. More than 50,000 people were detained at the southwest border in October \u2014 the highest monthly total since 2014 and up dramatically from 11,000 in April 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough job. You\u2019re someone who has to get good numbers on border crossing. He\u2019s always looking for that and it\u2019s tough,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nBut illegal border crossings could also be tied to the seasons \u2014 some experts argue that more migrants make the dangerous journey through the desert when it\u2019s not as hot. And Nielsen has largely carried out the president\u2019s wishes, including pushing for funding for his border wall and defending the administration\u2019s now-abandoned practice of separating children from parents.\n\nShe also moved to abandon long-standing regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and was working to find space to detain all families who cross the border. She limited what public benefits migrants can receive, and last week put regulations in place that circumvent immigration law to deny asylum to anyone caught crossing the border illegally. Nearly everything has been challenged or watered down by the courts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get the magic person,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies migration issues. \u201cNielsen had been fairly hard-line implementing what Trump wants, but she\u2019s not willing to skirt around the law to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about policy.\n\nTrump has also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he has told those close to him that he feels, at times, that she has stronger loyalty to her mentor \u2014 chief of staff John Kelly \u2014 than to the president. On occasions when she has tried to explain the complicated legal challenges associated with instituting some of his policies, Trump has exploded, belittling her in front of colleagues and blaming her for not being able to skirt the law.\n\nTrump had been expected to dismiss Nielsen as soon as Tuesday as part of a post-midterm elections shakeup that is likely to include a slew of other departures.\n\nBut her departure has been postponed for now in part because there was no obvious successor, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. She has no deputy secretary, and the next in line would be Claire Grady, the undersecretary of homeland security for management.\n\nTrump said in an interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday that he\u2019d make a decision on homeland security \u201cshortly.\u201d\n\nPotential candidates include U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, and two military officers \u2014 Transportation Security Administration head David Pekoske, formerly of the Coast Guard, and Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese, who runs the Marine Corps Installations Command, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nA Customs official didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for Coglianese said he had not been approached by anyone regarding a position with DHS and was focused on his current job.\n\nPekoske said at an unrelated news conference that Nielsen was a strong leader.\n\n\u201cI have an outstanding relationship with Secretary Nielsen,\u201d he said.\n\nHoman is regarded as a top pick, according to people familiar with the discussions. He was nominated by Trump to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but stepped down before he was confirmed, and it\u2019s not clear if his nomination would pass the Senate or if he\u2019d even be up for the job. He left in part because he wanted to spend more time with his family.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t speculate what the president will do,\u201d he said on Fox News, but praised Nielsen as a \u201cstrong secretary\u201d and said she was succeeding in a difficult job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 24/7/365 job,\u201d Homan said. \u201cFifty percent of America hates you 100 percent of the time, you can\u2019t win on this topic because it is so divisive.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

South Korea\u2019s hugely popular Olympic curlers have accused their coaches of ruining the team with abusive treatment in a dispute that has spoiled one of the year\u2019s feel-good sports stories. (Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The Garlic Girls, South Korea\u2019s hugely popular Olympic silver medalist curlers, accused their coaches Thursday of ruining the team with abusive treatment in a dispute that has spoiled one of the year\u2019s feel-good sports stories.\n\nThe women\u2019s claims, if confirmed, suggest a familiar tale of abuse, corruption and nepotism that has regularly marred South Korea\u2019s highly hierarchical elite sports scene. Men often run South Korean sports efforts, and while the team\u2019s head coach is a woman, men in her family, including her father, a former leading figure in South Korean curling, play a prominent part in the team\u2019s accusations of abuse.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer work with a coaching staff that is trying to divide the team,\u201d Kim Seon-yeong said in a glum news conference in Seoul. The players also accused the coaching staff of skipping training sessions, holding back prize money and trying to force a married member off the team.\n\n\u201cWe need a coaching staff that can train and lead us properly. We want to continue our curling careers and aim for bigger goals at the Beijing Olympics,\u201d Kim said.\n\nThe news conference came a day after South Korea\u2019s Sports Ministry and National Olympic Committee announced a joint investigation into allegations that became public after the athletes sent a letter outlining their complaints to sports authorities last week.\n\nThe five-member women\u2019s curling team became an overnight sensation after their improbable silver medal run in February\u2019s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They enthralled a country that barely recognized curling before they made their run and became sought-after spokeswomen in commercials. Their nickname is a nod to the famous garlic produced in their hometown in Uiseong, in southern South Korea, where they met and began playing together as teenagers.\n\nIn their letter to the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee last week, Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong, Kim Cho-hee, and sisters Kim Yeong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi accused former Korean Curling Federation vice-president Kim Kyung-doo of verbal abuse and team coaches of giving unreasonable orders and subjecting their lives to excessive control.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s news conference, the curlers said coaches told them what to say in interviews and closely monitored their private lives after training hours, scolding them if they met with athletes from rival teams. Letters and presents sent by fans \u201cwere already ripped open\u201d before they reached the curlers, Kim Seon-yeong said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t understand why the head coach had to rip open and check the presents and letters sent to individuals before they reached the athlete,\u201d she said.\n\nThe curlers said the coaches withheld prize money and tried to sideline the married captain Kim Eun-jung after learning of her plans to start a family. They said the coaches also tried to force Kim Cho-hee off the team ahead of the Olympics to open a spot for head coach Kim Min-jung to participate as an athlete. They also said they had to endure a tirade from Kim Kyung-doo after they decided to stick with their teammate.\n\nKim Kyung-doo and his family had extensive control over the team with his daughter, Kim Min-jung, being the head coach and his son-in-law, Jang Ban-seok, the mixed doubles coach. The curlers organized the news conference after the coaching staff publicly denied the accusations.\n\n\u201cWe had thought we could go together with that family, but after going through the Olympics, it became clear to us they were a family that cared only about themselves,\u201d Kim Eun-jung said in the news conference. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the athletes to grow and get better. ... They don\u2019t want the athletes to become bigger than the organization.\u201d\n\nJang denied funds were withheld from the athletes, saying the team had agreed prize money would be spent on overseas training and competitions, but Kim Eun-jung said the curlers were kept in the dark about how the money was used.\n\n\u201cWe were already receiving (state) training funds as members of the national team, and we couldn\u2019t understand why the prize money was not being distributed to us,\u201d she said.\n\nSouth Korea, which has long associated Olympic achievements with national pride, has struggled to root out abuse and corruption bred by factionalism and nepotism from its highly-competitive elite sports scene, where such problems have often been overlooked as long as the athletes produce.\n\nBut the pressure for change is increasingly coming from a younger generation of athletes, who have shown less tolerance for unjust or unreasonable treatment. The Korea Skating Union in January imposed a lifetime ban on a male coach who was later sentenced to 10 months in jail for assaulting short-track speed skater Shim Suk-hee, an incident that would more likely have been kept in-house in previous years.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I said goodbye to him on Father's Day. The grief hits in waves and is getting harder as we approach the first holiday season without him. My 4-year-old son is very empathetic and notices when I'm feeling down. He often asks, \"Are you sad about Grandpa now?\" and will sometimes cry with me. I try to end those times talking about how Grandpa's gone but will always be with us in our hearts, and to share stories about the short time my son got to spend with him.\n\nI go back and forth about how much I should show my grief to my son.

Danis, a training partner of McGregor who was working in his corner for the lightweight title bout, was the target of Khabib Nurmagomedov\u2019s ire when the latter leaped out of the octagon after defeating the Irishman, an act that sparked the brawl.\n\nAmid the commotion at Las Vegas\u2019s T-Mobile Arena, Abubakar Nurmagomedov, a cousin of the undefeated Russian champion and a Bellator fighter, climbed up the fencing of the octagon and briefly tussled with McGregor. Tukhugov, a UFC fighter and fellow Russian who was working in Nurmagomedov\u2019s corner, entered the cage and attacked McGregor.\n\nTukhugov subsequently posted to social media a video in which he crowed about making McGregor pay for the insults the latter had hurled at Nurmagomedov during the run-up to the fight. \u201cI slapped him as promised,\u201d Tukhugov said, adding. \u201cI promised to make him answer for his words, and I did.\u201d\n\nUFC President Dana White had vowed to fire anyone in his company who took part in the attack on McGregor, but thus far he has not done so, possibly because he may be waiting for the NAC to announce its findings. However, Tukhugov was removed from a UFC Fight Night card later in October in which he was set to face a teammate of McGregor\u2019s, Artem Lobov.\n\nDanis issued a statement last month denying a media report that he had incited Nurmagomedov during the fight by calling him a \u201cf---ing Muslim rat.\u201d Saying that \u201cKhabib fans are attempting to smear me in an effort to justify his actions,\u201d Danis added, \u201cI have never and would never denigrate anyone\u2019s religion. I look forward to the results of the Nevada Gaming Commission investigation which will reject this [B.S.] claim and put the blame where it belongs.\u201d\n\nNevada Chief Deputy Attorney General Caroline Bateman said Wednesday (via MMA Junkie) that video evidence showed Danis helped provoke the incident as he \u201crepeatedly motioned to Khabib Nurmagomedov with his arm to come over towards him \u201cas soon as the fight ended. Abubakar Nurmagomedov was said to have \u201cscaled the cage . . . and exchanged punches with McGregor while straddling the cage,\u201d and Bateman claimed that Tukhugov \u201cunlawfully entered the cage by climbing over the fence . . . and punched McGregor one or more times before he was restrained by commission officials.\u201d\n\nThe cases of McGregor and Nurmagomedov are set to be heard at an NAC meeting on Dec. 10, but it is unclear whether the three other men will also be on the docket. Two other members of Nurmagomedov\u2019s entourage allegedly involved in the fracas, Esedulla Emiragaev and Rizvan Magomedov, were scratched from Wednesday\u2019s agenda; the NAC said it was still gathering evidence on them.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nDivision III basketball player suspended indefinitely after brutal sucker punch\n\n\u2018What happened, happened\u2019: Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant addresses his heated exchange with Draymond Green\n\nA very early 2019 NFL mock draft: Picks for Raiders, 49ers, Giants and rest of the top 10\n\nMac McClung buzz is growing.

Their mysterious features and bioluminescent glow have caused some scientists to dub them the \u201cbizarre unicorns of the sea. They reportedly feel \u201clike an exquisitely soft feather boa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was beyond excited. This is like finding something that you\u2019ve dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Hathaway said.\n\nAlthough they\u2019re often described as wormlike creatures, pyrosomes are actually more closely related to humans. Some of the earliest reports of pyrosomes came from sailors in the 1800s who noticed their bright glow while sailing.\n\nHathaway said he and his friend Andrew Buttle were shooting underwater footage for a promotional video about New Zealand\u2019s White Island when they encountered the sea creature. Buttle\u2019s family has owned the island since the 1930s; it contains an active volcano and diverse flora and fauna.\n\nEven though the bulk of his 11-year filming career has taken place underwater \u2014 and he\u2019s swum with animals such as whales \u2014 Hathaway said he\u2019d never encountered a pyrosome of any size until that moment.\n\nWhen he became aware that one was lying on the ocean floor beneath him, he knew he had to move quickly to film it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been underwater a lot, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of animals,\u201d he said. \u201cI know nature waits for nobody, and I couldn\u2019t let this opportunity pass me by.\u201d\n\nHathaway said springtime on the island brings an abundance of phytoplankton, which pyrosomes feed upon, possibly explaining the reason he encountered one now.\n\n\u201cThe fish in general get bigger at White Island than they do in other places in New Zealand,\u201d said Hathaway, a lifelong New Zealand resident. \u201cThe location is rich in food for animals around the island.\u201d\n\nLinsey Sala, a scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, said that while not all pyrosomes grow to be the size of the one Hathaway encountered, some found near New Zealand and Australia can \u201cget quite large,\u201d in some cases reaching 45 to 60 feet long.\n\nPyrosomes are composed of thousands of smaller beings, called zooids, which help the pyrosome feed and navigate the ocean via jet propulsion, Sala said. Although pyrosome sightings are not necessarily rare, they typically are seen by divers and other people who spend a lot of time in the water.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s remarkable and exciting to come across a pyrosome colony that size,\u201d Sala said.\n\nFascinated by the world\u2019s oceans as a boy, Hathaway said he would read stories of people embarking on oceanic adventures with a sense of envy and was particularly fascinated by the marlin, which \u201che used to have dreams about.\u201d\n\nHe went on to found Young Ocean Explorers, an entertainment and storytelling platform for children that encourages them to love the oceans and marine life. Hathaway said he hopes catching the pyrosome on video will spark an interest for others, similar to how images of marlins intrigued him as a child.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been about wanting to go see these things for myself and then sharing them with others,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cEven the most articulate person in the world couldn\u2019t describe that creature that we filmed.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Asian stocks lower after Wall Street fall, Brexit approval", "description": "Asian stocks lower after Wall Street falls for fifth day and British Cabinet endorses Brexit deal", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/asian-stocks-lower-after-wall-street-fall-brexit-approval/2018/11/14/262dc956-e887-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T03:33:00Z", "content": "BEIJING Most Asian stock markets declined Thursday after Wall Street fell for a fifth day and Britains Cabinet endorsed a draft agreement to leave the European Union.

(Richard Drew, File/Associated Press)\n\nU.S. stocks recovered from an early slide Thursday, placing the market on course to break a five-day losing streak. Gains in technology companies, banks and industrial stocks outweighed losses among big retailers, homebuilders and utilities. Energy stocks rose along with crude oil.\n\nEuropean indexes finished mostly lower as the British pound slumped amid discord over a new deal for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union next Spring. A disorderly exit could result in economic disruption for Britain and threaten London\u2019s status as a global financial hub.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index rose 24 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,726 as of 2 p.m. Eastern Time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 175 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,256. The Nasdaq composite climbed 105 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,242. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 13 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,516.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 has declined five straight days. The indexes are now on track to finish the month with a loss.\n\nMARKET LEADER: Technology sector stocks accounted for much of the market\u2019s gain. Cisco Systems rose 4.7 percent to $46.41 a day after the company reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.\n\nBANKING ON BANKS: Financial sector stocks rebounded Thursday after taking heavy losses a day earlier. Bank of America gained 2.2 percent to $27.82.\n\nINDUSTRIALS RALLY: Flour was among the big gainers in the industrial sector. The stock added 3.4 percent to $46.29.\n\nROTTEN RETAIL: Several big retailers slumped. Dillard\u2019s slid 14.5 percent to $63.09 after the retailer\u2019s quarterly earnings fell far short of what investors were expecting. Macy\u2019s gave up 3.1 percent to $32.20. Nordstrom dropped 3 percent to $59.27.\n\nHOUSE OF PAIN: KB Home had its steepest drop in more than three years after the homebuilder said new-home orders are down sharply in its current quarter versus a year ago. The Los Angeles-based company\u2019s revenue projection for the quarter also fell below analysts\u2019 estimates. The stock plunged 17.2 percent to $17.22. Shares in other major homebuilders also skidded. Lennar declined 5.9 percent to $39.14, while PulteGroup lost 3.4 percent to $23.70.\n\nWhile a strong economy and job market helped boost home sales earlier this year, rising mortgage rates and home prices are becoming hurdles for many would-be buyers. The annual rate of new U.S home sales has dropped 15.3 percent since May, eliminating much of the strength in sales from the first five months of 2018.\n\nBIG DECLINER: Shares in Pacific Gas & Electric extended their steep slide, posting the biggest decline in the S&P 500. Investors are concerned over whether the power company can sustain potential losses related to a deadly blaze in Northern California. PG&E is facing a lawsuit claiming it is responsible for the devastating blaze that broke out last week. PG&E shares were down 28.5 percent to $18.30. The company\u2019s market value has dropped 60 percent since Nov. 8.\n\nAnother utility, Edison International, is down about 30 percent in the same period. Edison\u2019s shares were off 7.4 percent to $49.91.\n\nENERGY: Oil prices were headed higher for the second straight day. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.9 percent to $56.75 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 1.1 percent to $66.83 a barrel in London. Despite the latest pickup, U.S. crude oil is still down 13.1 percent for the month. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. has dropped to $2.67 from $2.89 a month ago, according to AAA.\n\nNatural gas, which spiked Wednesday amid forecasts calling for a cold snap across much of the Northeast and South, slumped 14.8 percent to $4.12 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nEnergy stocks got a boost from the pickup in oil prices. Noble Energy gained 3.1 percent to $25.51.\n\nBOND YIELDS: Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury fell to 3.11 percent from 3.12 percent late Wednesday.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 113.64 yen from 113.51 yen on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.1329 from $1.1338. The pound plunged to $1.2755 from $1.3038 on concerns that a new deal to enable the United Kingdom to separate from the European Union will not get approved by Britain\u2019s parliament.\n\nOVERSEAS: Major European stock indexes closed mostly lower following a flare-up in discord over British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union next year. She persuaded a majority in her Cabinet to back an agreement that would allow Britain to stay in a customs union while a trade treaty is negotiated, but the deal faces an uncertain fate in Parliament and two of her Cabinet ministers, including the Brexit minister, resigned in protest.\n\nThe disarray surrounding the process, which is throwing London\u2019s future as a financial center into doubt, sent the pound lower against other currencies and hit British bank stocks. Barclay\u2019s slid 5.7 percent to $8.49 and Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 10.3 percent to $5.85.\n\nAll told, Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 0.5 percent and France\u2019s CAC 40 shed 0.7 percent. London\u2019s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 1.7 percent and Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 gave up 0.2 percent. Seoul\u2019s Kospi gained 1 percent.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies picked up 21.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,524.12.\n\nThursday\u2019s market rebound coincided with a Financial Times report citing unnamed sources that said the United States\u2019 trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has told some executives that a planned escalation in January of U.S. tariffs on imported goods from China are now on hold.\n\n\u201cThis bit of information helped to move the market higher today, especially technology stocks,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods over complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of market access. That tariff had been due to rise to 25 percent in January. Another $50 billion of Chinese goods already is subject to 25 percent duties. Beijing has responded with penalty duties on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nWashington and Beijing resumed talks over their spiraling trade dispute this week ahead of a meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said Thursday.\n\nTechnology sector stocks accounted for much of the market\u2019s gain. Cisco Systems rose 5.5 percent to $46.77 a day after the company reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.\n\nFinancial sector stocks rebounded after taking heavy losses a day earlier.

The fear was justified \u2014 two co-defendants died before the trial was completed.\n\nOn Friday, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan will be judged on additional charges of crimes against humanity, such as murder, extermination, enslavement, torture and persecution on political, racial, and religious grounds; genocide, for the killings of members of the Vietnamese and Cham ethnic groups; and more breaches of the Geneva Conventions, including willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nAs members of the Khmer Rouge leadership under the late Pol Pot, they have been prosecuted under the legal doctrine of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nCases launched against four additional, middle-ranking Khmer Rouge officials have been scuttled or frozen and are unlikely to be revived.\n\nIf the current trial is the last staged by the U.N.-assisted international tribunal \u2014 officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \u2014 it will have convicted three individuals at a cost of more than $300 million.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 after a bloody five-year civil war. They immediately attempted a radical transformation of Cambodia into a peasant society, emptying cities and forcing the population to work the land.\n\nThey backed up their rule with ruthless elimination of perceived enemies, and were driven from power in early 1979 by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam, which had suffered border attacks from Khmer Rouge forces.\n\nAlthough atrocities were carried out on a massive scale, political realities \u2014 specifically the repeated demands by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen that no more suspects be prosecuted \u2014 appear to preclude further cases being pursued by the tribunal. Hun Sen insists that further prosecutions could cause unrest.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal can lay claim to only one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nHun Sen himself was a midlevel Khmer Rouge commander before defecting while the group was still in power, and several senior members of his ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party share similar backgrounds. He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nThe ground rules under which the tribunal was established in 2005 are complicated, providing for hybrid courts pairing Cambodian judges and prosecutors with international counterparts.\n\nCambodian court officials, known for their loyalty to Hun Sen\u2019s government, are in a position to base their judgments on the tribunal\u2019s inexact guidelines limiting prosecutions to senior leaders or persons considered \u201cmost responsible\u201d for atrocities, or simply cease cooperation.\n\nAlthough Nuon Chea had an especially low profile in the already secretive group, his importance can be gauged by his nom de guerre of \u201cBrother Number Two,\u201d reflecting his position as Pol Pot\u2019s right-hand man.\n\nAccording to a 2001 study by Cambodia scholar Stephen Heder and legal expert Brian D. Tittemore, there was \u201csubstantial and compelling evidence\u201d that Nuon Chea devised and implemented the Khmer Rouge\u2019s execution policies.\n\nKhieu Samphan had at one point been the smiling, polite figurehead who nominally was the head of state in the Khmer Rouge regime. He was able to trade on his reputation as an honest left-wing academic and lawmaker in 1960s Cambodia before repression drove him underground and into the jungle with the then-nascent Khmer Rouge movement.\n\nThe Heder and Tittemore study acknowledged that evidence against Khieu Samphan was not as extensive as against Nuon Chea and others, but nevertheless suggested he \u201cencouraged lower level (Khmer Rouge) officials to perpetrate executions and, at least in some instances, monitored and contributed to the implementation of Party policies by regional authorities.\u201d\n\nHeder, who for a time was an investigator for the tribunal, charged in a 1990 paper that Khieu Samphan was promoted up the ranks of the Khmer Rouge \u201cbecause he remained steadfastly loyal to his leadership and policies while others who had earlier cooperated with Pol Pot and his Communist Party were detained or killed because they disagreed with or were suspected of disagreeing with what Pol Pot was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhieu Samphan\u2019s political star rose literally on heaps of corpses,\u201d Heder wrote.\n\nConfronted in court with such charges, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan showed little remorse. Khieu Samphan denied knowing about matters including forced marriages and violent oppression of minorities, and both men mounted political defenses.\n\nKhieu Samphan described the claim of genocide as \u201cVietnamese propaganda,\u201d a defense he and other former Khmer Rouge leaders have made previously.\n\nCambodians have long been suspicious of Vietnam, their much bigger eastern neighbor, and prejudice against Vietnamese is widespread.\n\nKhieu Samphan also cast blame on the United States for Cambodia\u2019s problems. The U.S. heavily bombed the Cambodian countryside during the 1970-75 civil war that led to the Khmer Rouge\u2019s seizure of power.\n\n\u201cI want to bow to the memory of all the innocent victims but also to all those who perished by believing in a better ideal of the brighter future and who died during the five-year war under the American bombardments and (in) the conflict with the Vietnamese invaders,\u201d Khieu Samphan said. \u201cTheir memory will never be honored by any international tribunal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPeck reported from Bangkok.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Was Acosta grandstanding when he declared the he wanted to \u201cchallenge\u201d Trump on his caravan rhetoric? Would a more traditional approach have worked better? Is there a place for crusading at the White House?\n\nWednesday reminded us of the irrelevance of these questions.\n\nJustice Department lawyers, defending the Trump administration\u2019s revocation of Acosta\u2019s credentials, submitted a brief on Wednesday responding to CNN\u2019s lawsuit seeking their restoration. The network is seeking a restraining order against the White House, an action that government lawyers are opposing on a number of grounds, including:\n\nThe threshold for the issuance of a restraining order is high.\n\nThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t \u201crestrict the President\u2019s ability to determine the terms on which he does, or does not, engage with particular journalists,\u201d reads the brief. The argument here draws on the often haphazard nature of media access. Presidents, mayors, town council members, congressional representatives \u2014 they all make selections about who will get to interview them and when. \u201cThat discretion extends to his White House staff; the President is free to instruct White House officials to respond positively to particular journalists\u2019 requests for information, interviews or questions, and he is equally free to instruct White House officials to do the opposite by declining similar requests from a different journalist,\u201d notes the argument.\n\nCNN is wrong to rely on the 1977 case in Sherrill v. Knight, in which U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on a White House-access case involving Robert Sherrill of the Nation. As a story in The Post summarizes: \u201cDenial of White House credentials was a sufficiently grave infringement on the freedom of the press that it couldn\u2019t just be done by fiat. It required, at the very least, \u2018notice of the factual bases for denial, an opportunity for the applicant to respond\u2019 and \u2018a final written statement of the reasons for denial.\u2019 Notably, the court prohibited \u2018content-based criteria for press pass issuance.\u2019 \u201d The government\u2019s pushback stresses that Sherrill pertained to a situation in which a reporter was denied access for security reasons. The rationale for revoking Acosta\u2019s hard pass, suggests the brief, is more pressing. \u201cIn stark contrast to Sherrill, Mr. Acosta\u2019s access has been denied at a different stage in the decisional process (the White House\u2019s discretionary decision about which journalists to speak with), ratified by a much higher-level decisionmaker (the President), and is based on a personal interaction between the President and Mr. Acosta (the November 7 press conference),\u201d argues the brief.\n\nAnd so on. In a hearing before U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly on Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham was forced to expound upon these arguments. It was unsightly. The White House, Burnham argued, has been \u201cconsistent\u201d throughout the drama revolving around the revocation of Acosta\u2019s hard pass, even though the record indicates otherwise. The triggering issue, he contended, was Acosta\u2019s \u201crefusal to comply with general standards of a press conference.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s argument that the revocation was a capricious act didn\u2019t impress Burnham, who said, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that disrupting a press conference isn\u2019t an arbitrary\u201d basis for the White House\u2019s actions. Another plank of the government\u2019s case is essentially this: What\u2019s the big deal here? After all, both parties agree the president wouldn\u2019t be violating anyone\u2019s rights if he ignored Acosta every single day. \u201cNo reporter has a right to get answers to any questions from any officials. . . . If the president said, \u2018No one speaks to Jim Acosta ever again\u2019 . . . If the president gave that directive to the White House staff and said, \u2018No one acknowledge his presence if he\u2019s in the building\u2019 \u2014 that would be totally fine under the First Amendment,\u201d said Burnham.\n\nAnother non-right, argued the Justice Department lawyer, is access to the White House grounds: \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s official residence, it\u2019s his personal office.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to see what the hard pass adds beyond the right to get answers, which I think is clear the reporter doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nThere was more. In seeking to uphold the revocation, Burnham argued that the First Amendment harm suffered by both Acosta and CNN were minimal. After all, Acosta can monitor proceedings at the White House through other means. He could work the phones, and so on. Plus: Even if Acosta did get back in, the president would be within his rights to diss him at all times. Here, Burnham actually spun out what might well serve as an authoritarian fantasy: \u201cThe First Amendment injury, I guess, is Mr. Acosta\u2019s ability to be in a room where he has no right to speak,\u201d said Burnham. \u201cThe vast majority of these events, in fact all of these events . . . are televised live, so he could watch all of them on CNN and report on it just as effectively.\u201d This government lawyer is a government lawyer, not a journalist.\n\n\u201cAs for CNN, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm at all,\u201d said Burnham, again making the argument that CNN has multiple hard passes to the White House. Of course, it is tantamount to asserting control over who represents news outlets at the White House.\n\nIn a sound bite that\u2019ll surely please the president\u2019s most dedicated supporters, Burnham disputed the idea that the revocation was an act of viewpoint suppression. \u201cGrandstanding . . . is not a viewpoint,\u201d he said. Another good one: \u201cA single journalist\u2019s attempt to monopolize a press conference is not a viewpoint.\u201d\n\nTheodore Boutrous, a lawyer representing CNN, recited Trump\u2019s long-standing grudge against the cable network, dating all the way back to that Jan. 11, 2017, news conference during which the president dubbed Acosta \u201cfake news.\u201d There were many other moments of presidential bullying as well. \u201cNever will there be more evidence of facial discrimination and animus\u201d against CNN, argued the network\u2019s lawyer.\n\nKelly, the district judge, seemed hung up on the idea that, well, Trump has been slapping CNN around for months, for years: What about Nov. 7 pushed the matter to this point? What about the argument that Acosta was rude and disruptive? Boutrous argued that the president has mused for some time about the possibility of revoking credentials and, as to the rudeness complaint, Trump is \u201cthe most aggressive, dare I say, rude person in the room,\u201d said Boutrous. The \u201ctenor\u201d comes from him, not from some guy from CNN.\n\nCiting the network\u2019s due-process argument in the case, Boutrous noted that the White House has set up credentialing procedures for reporters to follow in seeking hard passes. It exists, it\u2019s been formalized \u2014 and it\u2019s a significant consideration: \u201cHaving given access, having created this process, the First Amendment is triggered,\u201d said Boutrous.\n\nBoutrous, from the Los Angeles firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, verily spoke in all-caps when he answered the judge\u2019s inquiries about the sufficiency of CNN\u2019s due process. \u201cThere was no process,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter listening to arguments from both sides, Kelly said he\u2019d mull over the arguments and reconvene on Thursday at 3 p.m. As he shuffles through papers and transcripts and precedents, he might consider hovering on a paragraph in the government\u2019s reply brief. It\u2019s right here:\n\nFinally, Plaintiffs fail to reckon with the extraordinarily intrusive nature of the judicial relief they seek \u2014 a decree ordering the President to grant access to facilities in his official residence and personal offices to a specific journalist he has decided to exclude. At this preliminary stage, that hardship is far more significant than any hardship on Plaintiffs. For that reason, too, emergency relief is unwarranted.\n\nBolding is added to insert an obvious hijacking of \u201cthe People\u2019s House\u201d for the private pleasure of some guy.

(Yong Teck Lim/Associated Press)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 The rivalry between the U.S. and China in the Asia-Pacific is proving \u201cawkward\u201d for Southeast Asian nations that do not want to have to choose between their friends, Singapore\u2019s prime minister said Thursday as he wrapped up a regional summit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easiest not to take sides when everybody else is on the same side. But if you are friends with two countries which are on different sides, then sometimes it is possible to get along with both, sometimes it\u2019s more awkward if you try to get along with both,\u201d Lee Hsien Loong said when asked about the competition between the U.S. and China in the region at a news conference.\n\nLee, who hosted the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said countries whose economies and strategic interests are deeply entwined with both powers would prefer not to have to decide, \u201cbut the circumstances may come where ASEAN may have to choose one or the other. I hope it does not happen soon.\u201d\n\nThe comments appeared intended to send a message to the U.S., represented this week by Vice President Mike Pence in place of President Donald Trump, and to China, whose growing influence across the region is abundantly clear at such international gatherings.\n\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China over Beijing\u2019s technology policy and other market access issues have added to strains within the region, especially since Trump took office in early 2017. The two sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s products in a standoff that has shown no sign of easing.\n\nLee also remarked on Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d deal-oriented diplomacy, saying it was a departure from the past, when \u201cthey were generous, they opened their markets, they made investments, they provided regional security, and in the indirect benefits of a prospering region, the U.S. prospered along.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now they say \u2018no, that\u2019s not good enough. I want every deal to come,\u2019 and that will mean a different kind of relationship and we will have to get used to it if the U.S. decides that this is the direction which they would go in the long term,\u201d Lee said.\n\nIn comments to the gathering earlier in the day, Pence stressed the American commitment to the region, where he said there was no room for \u201cempire or aggression.\u201d\n\nIn a veiled swipe at China\u2019s growing influence and military expansion in the South China Sea, he said that \u201cOur vision for the Indo-Pacific excludes no nation. It only requires that every nation treat their neighbors with respect, they respect the sovereignty of all nations and the international rules of order.\u201d\n\nThe ASEAN meetings focus on enhanced trade and security in a region of more than 630 million people. They ended with commitments to work toward a regional free trade agreement and enhance cybersecurity, counter-terrorism efforts, e-commerce, disaster preparedness and environment protection.\n\nMany of the same leaders will head to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea, where many of the same issues will be on the agenda.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sought to reassure China\u2019s neighbors over its expanding reach, both economic and military, across the region and urged fellow Asian leaders to help reassure world markets roiled by trade tensions.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries and others in the region share China\u2019s consternation over the Trump administration\u2019s rejection of multilateral trade regimes and the global trade system that have helped them modernize and enrich their economies. Many of the leaders attending the meetings in Singapore have emphasized the need to fight protectionism and safeguard the rules that help govern global trade.\n\nThe region needs to \u201ctake concrete action to uphold the rules-based free trade regime and to send a message \u2014 a positive message \u2014 to the market to provide stable, predictable and law-based conditions for the market,\u201d Li said.\n\nSecurity issues, in particular managing conflict in the South China Sea, were another major focus of the meetings. The sea is a potential flashpoint, and a huge concern for the U.S. and other countries that rely on the right of passage for shipping.\n\nChina is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nASEAN leaders said they discussed the need for restraint in the area.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed on ways and means not to increase tensions in the South China Sea. And that means not bringing in warships and allowing for freedom of navigation,\u201d Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed told reporters. \u201cSmall patrol boats are needed to deal with piracy, mainly, but big warships may cause incidents and that will lead to tension.\u201d\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has relaxed his country\u2019s stance on Chinese claims to islands also claimed by Manila, said it also was crucial that the countries involved finish work on a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d to help prevent misunderstandings that could lead to conflict.\n\n\u201cChina is there. That is the reality,\u201d he told reporters before joining the day\u2019s meetings. \u201cStrong military activity will prompt a response from China. I do not mind everybody going to war, but except that the Philippines is just beside those islands. If there is shooting there my country will be the first to suffer.\u201d\n\nThe sessions Thursday followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders.\n\nWhile the gathering was typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp, public comments both by Pence and Mahathir to the country\u2019s leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from western Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state to escape killings and destruction of their homes by the country\u2019s military and vigilantes, drawing widespread condemnation and international accusations of genocide against Myanmar.\n\nAsked if Suu Kyi had agreed to his direct request that she pardon two Reuters\u2019 journalists imprisoned in Myanmar, Pence replied, \u201cWe did not get a clear answer on that.\u201d He said Suu Kyi had given some details on the appeals process and judicial handling of their cases.\n\nASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

(Christian Palma, File/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he will continue to rely heavily on the military for internal security and appeared to dismiss aspirations of Mexico someday having effective civilian police forces.\n\nIn announcing his security plan for the next six years, Lopez Obrador said he would seek a constitutional change for the creation of a 50,000-strong National Guard initially composed of members of the army, navy and federal police that would be operational within three years.\n\nMexico\u2019s previous two administrations have relied heavily on the military to combat drug cartels and perform policing duties, in some cases after local police forces deemed deeply corrupt were disbanded.\n\nLopez Obrador noted there has been \u201cdecomposition\u201d at all levels of civilian police. Alfonso Durazo, the pick as security minister for the new administration taking office Dec. 1, said it would be disastrous to relieve the military of its public safety role.\n\nBut Lopez Obrador also promised to redirect resources to addressing the root causes of Mexico\u2019s violence. He said that 80 percent of his plan would be aimed at those social problems.\n\n\u201cA thousand and one times we\u2019ve repeated in the country\u2019s public plazas that you can\u2019t confront violence with violence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to deal with the causes of the violence.\u201d\n\nSocial programs would focus on economic development and strengthening the values of Mexico\u2019s youth.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the billions of dollars invested, the military resources consumed, the intelligence and surveillance spent in the war on drugs, the Mexican government has not been able to defeat the cartels,\u201d Durazo said.\n\nDurazo said that in addition to combating corruption that permits impunity for organized crime, the new administration will embark on reforms that could offer sentence reductions and even limited amnesty in some cases for those involved in nonviolent crimes.

Those ranks could swell as more races are called.\n\nRep.-elect Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, who ran on an explicit pledge to oppose the 78-year-old California lawmaker, said Wednesday she was determined to keep her word to constituents and back someone else.\n\n\u201cI think there are some great people that will be coming forward, and I\u2019m excited to see who those people might be,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t identified themselves yet, but we have such a deep bench of talent in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe defections, if they stand, would leave Pelosi several votes short of the 218 she would need when the full House votes for speaker Jan. 3. However, no Democrat has stepped forward to run against her.\n\nPelosi and her allies worked furiously Wednesday, rolling out endorsements from several major unions while she made her case to the Congressional Black Caucus, a crucial bloc. At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats, a newly elected lawmaker from Pelosi\u2019s home state shut down an attempted rules change advanced by one of her critics.\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) talks to journalists before heading into a Democratic caucus meeting at the Capitol. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPelosi, who has led the Democrats for more than 15 years, has put her gender front and center in the campaign, arguing that a woman must be at the table to do business with President Trump and male congressional leaders. She raised millions of dollars and campaigned hard for dozens of women who will be part of a record number in the House.\n\nBut some of those women were unwilling Wednesday to say definitively that they would back Pelosi \u2014 despite suggestions from some of her allies that it would be an insult to female voters to do anything less.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to having a conversation to make sure that we\u2019re all aligned on an agenda,\u201d Rep.-elect Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) said. \u201cThat\u2019s really important when thinking about who to support as leader.\u201d\n\nIf Pelosi is to take back the speakership, a job she held from 2007 through 2010 as the first woman in the post, she will need support from many of these women. And as she and her allies worked to ensure that she gets it, some argued that after an election season with women at the fore, a female speaker is paramount.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that we have won the House majority because of women candidates with huge women turnout, to then deny the first woman speaker who led us to that victory the gavel I think would be a slap in the face of a lot of voters who sent us here,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).\n\nPelosi succeeded in winning over at least one female newcomer in the course of the day: Jennifer T. Wexton of Virginia, who went from declaring herself undecided around noon to announcing her support for Pelosi by day\u2019s end, calling her \u201cthe best qualified to lead our caucus in a productive way.\u201d\n\nThere are 34 women among the 54 newly elected House Democrats, although a handful of races remain uncalled. As of now, there are 17 current and incoming lawmakers who have declared their intent to oppose Pelosi; among them are five women. If the current leads hold in uncalled House races and Democrats end up controlling 232 seats next year, Pelosi could afford to lose only 14 of those 17 Democrats on the floor \u2014 presuming every Republican votes against her and no one votes \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nMembers of the small group of incumbent Democrats who are plotting against Pelosi said Wednesday that they are continuing to solicit signatures to a letter declaring that its signers will not support her in the Jan. 3 floor vote. Three \u2014 Reps. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) and Filemon Vela (D-Tex.) \u2014 said they have gathered the requisite number of signatures, but they have yet to release the total. A House aide familiar with the effort but not authorized to speak publicly about it said the informal goal is to release it by week\u2019s end.\n\nThe math may look daunting, but many of Pelosi\u2019s supporters expressed confidence that she will be elected speaker. Allies circulated criticism of her opponents on Twitter with the hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys on Wednesday, picturing five leaders of the anti-Pelosi Democratic movement in the House who are all white men and comparing them to conservative dissidents in the House Republican conference.\n\nEven though her opponents include women, such arguments reinforce one of the rationales advanced by Pelosi for why she should be returned as speaker. She has said that had Hillary Clinton won the presidency instead of Donald Trump, she would have been content to step aside. But because Clinton lost, the presence of a woman is crucial in congressional and White House negotiations.\n\nFar from rejecting that argument, some of her opponents have echoed it even while calling for change at the top of the Democratic caucus.\n\n\u201cAmongst our group, there is wide consensus that our intent is, when we get to the point of seeking a new leader, that we have a woman in either the top leadership spot or the second spot,\u201d Vela said.\n\nHe said there are several women in the caucus who would be well-prepared to take the reins, among them Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (Ohio), who told reporters that she\u2019s being encouraged to stand for speaker if Pelosi doesn\u2019t have the votes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not talked to any of the new members. I\u2019m not sure that I will. But I think that if in fact we were elected on change, then we should have change,\u201d Fudge said.\n\nDemocrats will vote internally on their nominee for speaker on Nov. 28. Pelosi is likely to win that vote easily, but the real test will come in the floor vote by the full House in January, where the margin Pelosi can lose will be much slimmer.\n\nAddressing a scenario in which Pelosi cannot command the needed floor votes and yet there still is not anyone running against her, Fudge said: \u201cSomeone will emerge, if no one has emerged before that. We\u2019re not going to allow the Republicans to have a speaker.\u201d\n\nRep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), a Pelosi opponent who said she had been in touch with newly elected women, said she did not appreciate the efforts to put these incoming lawmakers on the spot by suggesting that it would be anti-woman to oppose Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThese are all strong, intelligent women who got into a race who had never been in politics before and won really difficult races,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThey should not be disrespected that way. There are other women to support in this caucus who are perfectly capable of being in leadership.\u201d\n\nThe maneuvering among House Democrats took place as House Republicans elected their new slate of leaders for next year. Apart from the retirement of the current speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Republicans are sticking with familiar faces despite their midterm losses. The current majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, easily turned back a challenge from conservative Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan of Ohio to serve as minority leader, while the current whip, Steve Scalise (La.) will serve in the same role in the minority next year.\n\nPelosi extended words of welcome to her potential opponents. \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s warm,\u201d she said when asked about them before a caucus meeting.\n\nBefore addressing the session, Pelosi met with the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 among the most important blocs inside the party \u2014 at Democratic National Committee headquarters. She promised to take quick action to shore up the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and pledged to give committee chairs a free hand to move legislation through their panels, a major issue for the CBC, which counts five incoming chairs in its ranks.\n\nPelosi stayed focused on the coming agenda and did not ask directly for speaker votes, but an attendee said the impression was clear: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate the two.\u201d\n\nLater, at a closed-door meeting of House Democrats in which newly elected lawmakers met with returning members for the first time, Perlmutter sought to advance a rules change that could help the anti-Pelosi group to their goal.\n\nBut as he laid out his case, Rep.-elect Katie Hill of California spoke up, asking Perlmutter and his allies to step back from the \u201cinternal strife.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe freshmen here would like to move forward,\u201d she said, effectively shutting down the debate, according to a person in the room and confirmed by Hill.\n\nHill, who flipped a seat from Republicans north of Los Angeles, said she was likely to support Pelosi.\n\n\u201cWe need to hit the ground running, Day One. And that\u2019s really what it boils down to: I think we need to minimize any internal party strife; we need to get going,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest year for women candidates that we have ever seen,\u201d Hill added, \u201cand I think our leadership needs to reflect that.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Meeting of US bishops in Baltimore closes with no action after sexual abuse crisis - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Meeting of US bishops in Baltimore closes with no action after sexual abuse crisis Washington Post BALTIMORE \u2014 In the first meeting of U.S. bishops since a national sexual abuse crisis hit the Catholic Church in June, no name came up more than\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2018/11/14/49e22ad4-e852-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zVXAgqKfeR-fSk0qonORf8N4oVU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3DIRC7XIJUI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:19:20Z", "content": "BALTIMORE In the first meeting of U.S. bishops since a national sexual abuse crisis hit the Catholic Church in June, no name came up more than that of an ex-cardinal shut away in a remote Kansas friary: Theodore Mc\u00adCarrick.

(Theresa Keil/Reuters)\n\nIn the first meeting of U.S. bishops since a national sexual abuse crisis hit the Catholic Church in June, no name came up more than that of an ex-cardinal shut away in a remote Kansas friary: Theodore Mc\u00adCarrick.\n\nIn debate and comments over the three-day conference in Baltimore, the now-resigned former Washington archbishop became a proxy for excessive clericalism, corruption and for those who see homosexuality as the core sin for which the church is being punished.\n\nAnd then in the final hours on Wednesday, the bishops representing 196 American archdiocese and dioceses took a vote on a measure to simply \u201cencourage\u201d the Vatican to share documents related to its investigation of McCarrick.\n\nIt was shot down, 137 to 83.\n\nAnd thus closed the gathering of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which opened dramatically with the Vatican\u2019s insistence that the body delay a vote on reform measures until a major Vatican synod in the winter and wound down with an almost complete lack of the kind of contrition and decisive action parishioners have been demanding since summer.\n\nTerry McKiernan, co-director of the research site and advocacy group BishopAccountability.org, said Wednesday evening that he hopes the \u201cdeference to the Vatican and the paralysis seen at this meeting raise the stakes for the U.S. bishops in the months ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\nA woman prays the rosary Tuesday at a rally organized by a coalition of conservative Catholic groups near the bishops\u2019 annual fall meeting in Baltimore. (Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more urgent that they demonstrate some resolve and act,\u201d rather than just wait docilely for the synod, he said.\n\nThe previous week, the bishops had signaled their plans to devote almost an entire day to prayer to seek spiritual guidance before voting on measures meant to hold themselves more accountable on the topic of clergy sex abuse. The agenda, which in an unusual move was focused almost entirely on clergy sex abuse, included the establishment of a lay commission that would receive complaints against bishops and a code of conduct that would be the first such ethical guidelines for bishops on sex abuse.\n\nBut just minutes after the meeting opened, top Vatican officials instructed the U.S. bishops to hold off a vote until the pope and national leaders from around the world met on the matter. Conference President Daniel DiNardo said Rome did not want the U.S. church to get too far ahead and fracture global Catholic unity, but several close church-watchers said U.S. and Vatican leaders were also worried about rule changes that would subvert the usual hierarchy with the Vatican at the top, then the bishops, then lay Catholics.\n\nIn hours of open sessions, bishops took the microphone at a meeting that revealed how divided they are about everything from the role of laypeople to how confrontational it is permissible to be with Rome. They disagreed over whether to blame or praise the media, whether it was okay for other accused bishops to be in their midst during the meeting and whether there should be more agreement on what constitutes a \u201ccredible\u201d allegation of misconduct.\n\nWhat they seemed to all agree upon: the extreme damage to the church that has resulted from the case of McCarrick, who was suspended and then forced out this summer after allegations of harassment by seminarians and young priests as well as at least two men who say he sexually abused them as boys. McCarrick was moved from the D.C. area to Kansas as the Vatican considers the case against him.\n\nFort Worth Bishop Michael Olson rose to say the U.S. bishops must make clear that McCarrick is no longer welcome at any Conference events. DiNardo said he\u2019d received thousands of letters from Catholics since summer about abuse, and \u201cthe one thing that nags at everyone is the Archbishop McCarrick issue. It just seems to be ubiquitous. This is one that needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nAfter canceling all the action votes related to abuse, the bishops on their final day debated a measure proposed by Bishop Earl Boyea of Lansing, Mich., asking the Vatican to make public what it can about its investigation into McCarrick.\n\nThe measure did not detail what kind of information the bishops were seeking from the Vatican, but in previous days, multiple bishops spoke about the mystery concerning exactly what McCarrick had done over the years, who in the church hierarchy knew and what was done about it.\n\nThe proposed measure read: \u201cRecognizing the ongoing investigation of the Holy See into the case of Archbishop McCarrick be it resolved that the bishops of the U.S. Conference for Catholic Bishops encourage the Holy See to release soon all the documentation that can be released consistent with canon and civil law regarding the allegations of misconduct of Archbishop Mc\u00adCarrick.\u201d\n\nThen 30 minutes of debate ensued about whether to add the word \u201csoon\u201d to their request and whether they could say \u201cmisconduct\u201d about accusations that the Archdiocese of New York and the Vatican have at least in part validated or if they needed to include the word \u201calleged.\u201d Some bishops said the measure wasn\u2019t worth passing because it didn\u2019t really do anything, while others said it seemed too confrontational.\n\n\u201cThis is a statement of distrust,\u201d said Bishop Steven Bielger of Cheyenne, Wyo., who felt the measure was too vague.\n\nThe bishops paused from debating the measure, which later failed, to pass what the Conference said was its first major statement on racism in decades \u2014 since around the civil rights era \u2014 called \u201cOpen Wide Our Hearts.\u201d\n\nThe 32-page statement called racism \u201can attack on human life \u2014 a life issue\u201d and pledges that the Catholic Church will \u201cjoin others in advocating and promoting policies at all levels that will combat racism and its effects in our civil and social institutions.\u201d\n\nMcKiernan urged individual bishops to take steps they can in the months ahead to reassure lay Catholics, such as releasing lists of accused clergy, and adding more detail to lists that have already been made public.\n\nA news conference after the meeting Wednesday evening focused on specific actions DiNardo plans to propose in Rome in February.\n\nAmong them: a process for investigating complaints against bishops reported through a third-party hotline, and finalizing the code of conduct, a protocol for removed bishops and a proposal for a single lay commission on abuse.\n\nSeveral bishops said they were focused ahead on the meeting in Rome and were not discouraged.\n\n\u201cI agree, this conference has to be a leader, globally, and in many ways the Dallas Charter and good things in the past 16 years have to be replicated across the world,\u201d San Jose Bishop Oscar Cant\u00fa said, referring to the document the bishops created in the early 2000s to guide how the church handles accused priests \u2014 not bishops.\n\nBishop Shawn McKnight, a new bishop from Jefferson City, Mo., said he saw a shift among more conservative bishops, who are often more guarded against efforts to elevate the power of laypeople.\n\n\u201cLeft to right, there is a desire to find a way to incorporate lay genius,\u201d McKnight said at the news conference.\n\nSeparately, on Tuesday, two groups of victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy members launched lawsuits against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. One, a class-action suit filed in federal court in Washington, also names the Holy See as a defendant. That suit accuses the Catholic Church of conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal enterprise under federal racketeering statutes, and attempts to be the first to hold the Vatican liable in the United States for the actions of its clergy.\n\nThe six plaintiffs in each suit are men from different states, and the suits do not discuss the individual abuse any of the plaintiffs suffered. Judy Keane, a spokeswoman for the Conference of Bishops, said the bishops would not comment on pending litigation. The Holy See, which is the government of the Roman Catholic Church and maintains the equivalent of an embassy in Washington, did not respond to a request for comment."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "A phone call at Wendy's meant half of Amazon's new headquarters and an economic triumph for Virginia - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post A phone call at Wendy's meant half of Amazon's new headquarters and an economic triumph for Virginia Washington Post Virginia learned it had won the biggest economic development contest in U.S. history when a low-profile state official got a p\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-phone-call-at-wendys-meant-half-of-amazon-hq2-and-an-economic-triumph-for-virginia/2018/11/14/05ece20c-e847-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KdYhQ5UwdEDvNvFMxk1pT1JwVFU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XMFFKIHHTAI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T01:19:20Z", "content": "Virginia learned it had won the biggest economic development contest in U.S. history when a low-profile state official got a phone call in the parking lot of a Wendys restaurant in the Shenandoah Valley at 2 p.m. Monday.

At one point, Arlington economic development chief Victor Hoskins was convinced that the state didn\u2019t have a chance because rivals such as Maryland and New Jersey were offering vastly larger subsidies and other incentives.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question in our mind \u2014 really until the end \u2014 was how would [Amazon] weigh the availability of talent versus cost,\u201d said Moret, chief executive of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and the state\u2019s top negotiator with Amazon.\n\nMoret noted that one of Amazon\u2019s corporate \u201cleadership principles\u201d is \u201cfrugality.\u201d\n\n[Amazon HQ2 decision: Amazon splits prize between Crystal City and New York]\n\nAmazon was little help.

(Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nInstead of the blustering and promises by top state officials such as New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) or the shiny perks others offered such as street renamings and free airport parking and museum admission, Virginia\u2019s more straightforward bid was handled by bureaucrats such as Moret. State officials said Amazon was particularly impressed by the state\u2019s willingness to kick in an additional $1.1 billion over 20 years to expand tech higher education.\n\nThe Virginians gradually grew more confident, beginning in the summer, as Amazon asked for increasingly detailed information about availability of office buildings and the size of government subsidies.\n\n\u201cThey really drilled down on the real estate and on the economic development package,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we knew it was serious.\u201d\n\n[Amazon HQ2 to benefit from more than $2.4 billion in incentives from Virginia, New York and Tennessee]\n\nA turning point occurred in late July when Amazon officials made the second of their three group visits to Northern Virginia. They wanted to visit only the Arlington site and an adjoining property at Potomac Yard in Alexandria, shunning other Northern Virginia sites they had toured during their initial visit in February. They spent all day touring about a dozen office spaces with a group of executives from JBG Smith, Crystal City\u2019s top real estate developer.\n\nJBG Smith CEO Matt Kelly said that before the group visited, \u201cthey said to wear comfortable shoes: \u2018We want to see everything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDespite a prolonged tug of war over incentives and transportation investments, both Virginia and Amazon said the most important advantages offered by Arlington were in place at the start of the negotiations. Those were the availability of a highly educated workforce and a diverse, citylike environment with good public transportation, likely to attract the young, upscale tech professionals who are Amazon\u2019s most valuable resource.\n\n\u201cThey ultimately determined that the single most important thing was the best talent in the world, and where could they get that,\u201d Moret said.\n\nThat assessment was confirmed, albeit indirectly, in comments from some of the losers after the announcement. Dallas Mayor Michael Rawlings (D) said an Amazon official told him his city lost out largely because it didn\u2019t have as many high-tech workers as the company needed immediately. (It wasn\u2019t enough that Dallas offered to appeal to Amazon\u2019s pet lovers by waiving Amazon employees\u2019 pet adoption fees at a city animal shelter and providing free microchipping for all Amazon pets until 2022, according to the Dallas Business Journal.)\n\n[In Crystal City, news of Amazon\u2019s arrival inspires yearnings for a facelift]\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), whose offer included larger subsidies than those offered by Virginia, told the Chicago Tribune, \u201cThere are some things we need to continue to build on, and that is making sure that we have a tech economy that is . . . actually world class.\u201d\n\nAmazon declined to comment for this story, beyond what it said publicly Tuesday at the time of its announcement. A company spokesman declined to say whether chief executive and founder Jeffrey P. Bezos has visited Crystal City. Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nFrom the beginning of Virginia\u2019s effort, when it offered three regional bids of the 238 submitted nationwide, the state emphasized its eagerness to help Amazon attract top tech talent.\n\nIn its original proposal in October 2017, Virginia offered a higher education technology plan that ended up being a $1.1 billion commitment over 20 years to expand computer science and related fields at the state\u2019s universities and community colleges. About a quarter of the money will go to help Virginia Tech build a $1 billion technology campus in Alexandria.\n\nThe education proposal was not formally part of the Amazon incentives package, and Amazon did not refer to it in its news releases. It apparently did not want to be accused of asking the state for such a large investment and thus give ammunition to critics of government subsidies to huge, rich corporations.\n\n[Crystal City workers, residents contemplate the benefits \u2014 and nightmares \u2014 that come with Amazon]\n\nBut Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced the technology education and Amazon incentives packages at the same time, and state officials said the former played an important role in Amazon\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis was part of the conversation with Amazon,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Brian Ball said. \u201cThis is something that they wanted and we wanted.\u201d\n\nThe process really got going in January, when Amazon trimmed the list of 238 to 20 finalist jurisdictions. One was Northern Virginia, which offered four sites.\n\nIn late February, Sullivan and other Amazon officials had dinner with Moret, Hoskins and other state and local officials at the Torpedo Factory in Old Town Alexandria and spent the next day touring all of Northern Virginia\u2019s sites.\n\nSullivan, who previously worked in economic development for Montgomery County, knew the region well. She and Moret also worked together when Amazon Web Services added 1,500 jobs in Herndon in early 2017.\n\n\u201cAt that point, they had not really homed in on Crystal City,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cThey were asking about the community: What kind of people live in Arlington?\u201d\n\n[Amazon\u2019s HQ2 could be boon or bust for Metro and the region\u2019s transportation infrastructure]\n\nAmazon also was asking about public transit and expressed concern that Virginia, Maryland and the District had not yet agreed on dedicated funding for Metro.\n\n\u201cThank God, by the time they came back [in July], that had been done,\u201d Hoskins said.\n\nHoskins also was unhappy when he saw that Maryland was offering incentives totaling $8.5 billion, and New Jersey was offering $7 billion.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw those numbers, I shook my head and said, \u2018We can\u2019t get there from here,\u2019 \u201d Hoskins said. There was also concern that Atlanta or Chicago might win because of lower housing costs.\n\nVirginia is historically less generous than other states in offering incentives, and in the end, the state and Arlington promised $573 million for 25,000 jobs, plus investments totaling $223 million for transportation, including upgrading two Metro stations and building a pedestrian bridge connecting Crystal City to Reagan National Airport. The subsidies and transportation investments will increase if Amazon creates more than 25,000 jobs, with the official state memorandum of understanding foreseeing that the number could rise to 37,850.\n\n[Breakthrough in Virginia on Metro funding: Lawmakers approve $154 million]\n\nLooking back, it appears that Amazon decided during the spring that Northern Virginia had the tech talent and quality-of-life features it wanted, state and local officials said. From then on, the company increasingly focused on specifics about the Crystal City-Potomac Yard site, which was a joint bid by Arlington and Alexandria.\n\nIt also appeared that other cities were falling out of the race, based on declining buzz in the media and the economic development rumor mill. Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce President Jim Rooney said officials had only \u201clight contact\u201d with Amazon leaders following a site visit in early spring.\n\nIn the final weeks before Tuesday\u2019s announcement, the biggest change came in September when Amazon began talking about splitting the original investment between two cities, according to Virginia officials, whose account was confirmed by other people close to the process.\n\nThe Virginians were taken aback but remained eager to land 25,000 jobs \u2014 which would still rank as the biggest U.S. competitive economic development award ever.\n\n\u201cWe got over the [reduction] very quickly, and all in all, I think it became a better deal,\u201d Hoskins said. \u201cIt was less complicated at 25,000.\u201d\n\nThe state recalculated the incentives it was offering, cutting its direct subsidies and transportation investments by half. The state did not reduce its planned spending on the higher education technology initiative, largely because it felt the state needed to make that investment anyway.\n\nIn another adjustment, the state increased the workforce grant subsidy it was promising Amazon from $20,000 to $22,000 for each new job created. It did so, Moret said, after Amazon pledged that the average pay for employees in Arlington would be at least $150,000 a year, instead of $100,000 as in the company\u2019s original proposal.\n\nAmazon executives visited Arlington for the third and final time in September, when they met for the first time with Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol, Vice Chair Christian Dorsey and County Manager Mark Schwartz.\n\n\u201cWe were all prepared to pitch [Arlington] to them, and they ended up telling us what a great community Arlington is,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cWithout a lot of prodding from us, they said things that led us to believe they\u2019d done their homework on Arlington.\u201d\n\nSchwartz was driving in the county\u2019s Ballston neighborhood Monday afternoon when Hoskins called him and said, \u201cI have some bad news.\u201d Schwartz girded himself, but it proved needless. \u201cHe said, \u2018We won!

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA transoceanic personnel crisis that engulfed the National Security Council this week is partly rooted in a bureaucratic dispute over the seating arrangements aboard first lady Melania Trump\u2019s plane to Africa last month during her maiden solo trip abroad.\n\nAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath.\n\nPolicy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said of Ricardel in the statement.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable day of limbo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Wednesday evening that Ricardel was leaving the White House.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAn NSC spokesman declined to elaborate.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s decision to publicly advocate for the ouster of a senior member of her husband\u2019s staff shows a new willingness on her part to weigh in on White House operations and marks a change from earlier in the Trump administration, when she repeatedly played down her role as an adviser to the president.\n\nIt also comes as the president is mulling personnel changes, including possibly ousting Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and firing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nAnita McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, says Melania Trump\u2019s move was a dramatic show of power.\n\n\u201cIf anyone had questions about her willingness to exert her influence, they got their answer,\u201d she said.\n\nRicardel\u2019s dismissal also serves as a rebuke of Bolton, known for his sharp elbows and ability to navigate internal tensions, who refused for weeks to fire his handpicked deputy and worked in the past day to protect her.\n\nSoon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused.\n\nBolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\n\nThe White House was trying to find a soft landing place for Ricardel, but agencies including the Commerce Department, where she worked in the first year of the Trump administration, are hesitant to take her on because of her reputation, two senior administration officials said.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s statement came after months of tension in the White House over Ricardel\u2019s abrasive interactions with staffers in both the East Wing and the West Wing, according to several current and former staffers.\n\nMelania Trump and Ricardel have never met, according to people familiar with each of them. But the first lady viewed the conservative operative, who was among the most senior women in the West Wing, as a toxic influence in the White House, to the point that she spoke to Trump about Ricardel after the Africa trip and authorized others to spread the word that Ricardel had overstepped the mark, several people familiar with recent events said.\n\nA senior White House official said the first lady believed Ricardel was spreading false rumors about her office, including a misleading story that aides had arranged a $10,000 hotel stay in Egypt. Other White House aides said Ricardel belittled underlings, shouted at professional staff and was the most disliked aide in the West Wing.\n\nLast weekend, according to administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office again asked Bolton to oust Ricardel. Others, including Kelly, have wanted her gone for months, administration officials said, with little success in overcoming Bolton\u2019s objections.\n\nBolton declined again \u2014 and went to Asia.\n\nWhile the first lady\u2019s public statement came as a surprise to many, including in the White House, Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the Trumps\u2019, said the move isn\u2019t out of character for the first lady. \u201cOur first lady is very strong, and she has the right to choose who she\u2019s working with,\u201d he said.\n\nIn past administrations, first ladies exerted similar or greater influence, but always behind the scenes. The most famous modern example is Nancy Reagan\u2019s engineering the ouster of chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who had made the dire mistake of hanging up on her. While Nancy Reagan\u2019s fingerprints were all over the firing, there were no statements from her office to that effect.\n\n\u201cYou never hang up on the first lady. She can be your strongest ally. She can help you more than anybody realizes,\u201d said Kenneth Duberstein, who fared better as chief of staff to Reagan.\n\nMartha Washington, historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, once wrote that she felt like a \u201cstate prisoner\u201d because of protocol rules and a schedule set in part by her husband\u2019s chief adviser, Tobias Lear. And there was no love lost between Mary Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s chief counselors, John Hay and John Nicolay, who referred to her as \u201cthe hellcat\u201d behind her back.\n\nPat Nixon, Anthony says, chafed at top White House aides H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and John Erlichman for perceived offenses that included not giving her enough notice before travel and for not taking her ambitious agenda seriously, Anthony said.\n\n\u201cIt goes back so far that what we\u2019re really talking about is human nature and the problem of the boss\u2019s wife,\u201d he said.\n\nMelania Trump has taken on a more public role recently, launching her anti-bullying campaign earlier this year and traveling to Africa in October.\n\nShe has made symbolic gestures that suggest she feels free to make her views plain and to disagree with her husband.\n\nIn a rare sit-down interview with ABC News last month, the first lady was asked whether it was true that she had more control over her notoriously volatile husband than anyone else. \u201cOh, I wish,\u201d she said. \u201cI give him my honest advice and honest opinions. And then he does what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe first lady has privately complained about other current and former White House officials to her husband \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, chief among them \u2014 but has never before issued such a public statement.\n\nThe East Wing often does not clear its statements with the White House. Senior White House aides, including Kelly and Bolton, were not aware that the statement was coming before it was issued Tuesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders had not seen the final statement, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Kelly, who wanted Ricardel gone, told others he thought that the situation was handled poorly and that the White House looked bad.\n\nThe controversy has added to the turmoil surrounding the White House after last week\u2019s midterm elections, in which Republicans lost control of the House and maintained a slim Senate majority. Last week, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions before heading to Paris over the weekend for the commemoration of the end of World War I, a period during which he struck out at French President Emmanuel Macron via Twitter and Macron indirectly criticized Trump\u2019s embrace of \u201cnationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shows it\u2019s still a broken and dysfunctional White House. Maybe John Kelly has made a few trains run on time, but it\u2019s clearly still broken,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a 2017 book, \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d about White House chiefs of staff and West Wing operations.\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Whitaker's unusual path to Justice Department included owning day-care center, trailer maker and concrete supplier - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Whitaker's unusual path to Justice Department included owning day-care center, trailer maker and concrete supplier Washington Post He was a local lawyer in Iowa who rose to become one of the most important figures in the nation's capital.

(Joyce Koh /The Washington Post)\n\nHe was a local lawyer in Iowa who rose to become one of the most important figures in the nation\u2019s capital. But Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s path to the top of the Justice Department was decidedly offbeat.\n\nOver the past two decades, Whitaker \u2014 now the acting attorney general \u2014 has owned a day-care center, a concrete supply business and a trailer manufacturer, state records show. He led a taxpayer-subsidized effort to build affordable housing in Des Moines, but he walked away from the stalled project two years ago after the city threatened him with a lawsuit.\n\nIn 2004, when he started a five-year stint as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Iowa, Whitaker cited a personal-injury case and a dispute involving a dry-cleaning business as some of his most consequential legal work. When he left office, he started a modest legal practice and a short-lived lobbying and consulting firm.\n\nWhitaker, 49, stands in vivid contrast to his predecessors, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s typically boast judgeships, partnerships at prestigious firms and senior roles in the Justice Department. He is the latest in a series of un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox appointments in the Trump era.\n\nSince he was named last week as a temporary replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Whitaker\u2019s recent background has come under intense scrutiny, particularly his role on the board of an invention-promotion company that was shut down in May after federal regulators accused it of fraud. One White House official acknowledged that Whitaker, who had been Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, received little vetting.\n\nWhitaker declined a request for an interview.\n\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said he underwent \u201call the usual vetting and procedures\u201d and is qualified for the job. \u201cActing AG Whitaker has litigated both criminal and civil cases, both as a U.S. Attorney and throughout his years in private practice,\u201d she said.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker presides over federal prosecutors, the FBI, and other Justice Department operations with almost 116,000 employees. He oversees special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe into possible collusion in the 2016 presidential election, an investigation Whitaker has publicly criticized.\n\nBrian Hillebrand, an Iowa banker who became friends with Whitaker after helping to arrange financing for the trailer business, described him as \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and driven to succeed.\n\n\u201cMatt is definitely a hard worker,\u201d Hillebrand said. \u201cYou definitely want him on your team.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Whitaker was something of a local legend as a tight end on the University of Iowa football team that went to the Rose Bowl. He got an MBA and law degree from the University of Iowa, then worked for a time as general counsel for a Minnesota-based grocery store chain before moving back to Iowa in 2001 and joining a small law firm.\n\nIn 2002, he ran as the Republican candidate for state treasurer, positioning himself as a fiscal conservative. He lost by more than 10 percentage points.\n\nThat same year, while working at the law firm, he became the majority owner of a manufacturing company that built hauling equipment aimed at farmers and contractors.\n\n\u201cIf you want a tough, dependable trailer that will keep pulling long after the others have died, you need a Road Husky!\u201d the company wrote in a promotional brochure.\n\nHe sold his share of the company in 2015.\n\nHillebrand, the banker, said of the business: \u201cIt did fine. It was not a huge business.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Whitaker expanded his holdings with the purchase of the day care, Little Endeavors Child Development Center, in his hometown of Ankeny. The center had a capacity for 204 children, state records show.\n\nThat year, he and a partner also launched Buy The Yard Concrete, state records show. Whitaker\u2019s four-bedroom home in Urbandale was listed as the headquarters for the company, a two-person firm that serviced projects as far away as Las Vegas, records show.\n\nHe was plucked from relative obscurity when President George W. Bush named him to be a U.S. attorney in early 2004. Whitaker had volunteered for Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2000 at the local level.\n\nIn a disclosure submitted to the federal government for the post, Whitaker was asked to list his most consequential legal work. One case involved personal-injury litigation in which he represented a man whose leg was run over by a car. A second was a contract dispute between a dry cleaner and the grocery store where it operated. In another, he represented a marble and tile company sued by a couple over a home remodeling project.\n\nWhitaker also disclosed the businesses he owned. In handwritten notes, he said he \u201cwill terminate upon appointment.\u201d It is not clear from the form what the notation meant.\n\nKupec, the Justice spokeswoman, said Whitaker complied with ethics advice and resigned from some positions but was not required to sell the businesses.\n\nWhitaker was sworn into office in June 2004.\n\nJames Eisenstein, a professor emeritus at Pennsylvania State University who has studied the federal court system, said he knows of no U.S. attorneys with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s like Whitaker\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis was an extraordinarily weak and unusual background for a U.S. attorney,\u201d he said.\n\nOne year into his term, an equipment rental firm sued Whitaker and Buy The Yard Concrete in Nevada, alleging they owed about $12,000 for supplies and equipment rentals, court records show. The lawsuit related to a concrete project in Las Vegas.\n\nWhitaker represented himself in the case, according to court filings. He claimed the rental firm had no right to sue him because he lived in Iowa, noting in one filing that he was the U.S. attorney there.\n\nHe also said that the work on behalf of the cement firm was done by contract labor, not company employees, and that he was not involved in overseeing the project.\n\n\u201cIf Whitaker did not want to get sued in NEVADA, he should not have conducted business there,\u201d a lawyer for the equipment rental firm wrote in one legal filing. The dispute was settled privately.\n\nWhitaker served as U.S. attorney until 2009.\n\nWhen he stepped down, he issued a news release that cited several cases as significant, including a prosecution of fraud at a state workforce-training agency, a child pornography investigation that led to charges against 13 people and a crackdown on the misuse of immigrant work visas.\n\nAmong the office\u2019s biggest setbacks was the prosecution of Matt McCoy, an openly gay Democratic state senator and a rising political star on the left. A grand jury indictment accused McCoy of using his political position to extort $2,000 from a security firm in Des Moines where he was a consultant.\n\nThe investigation took many months but ended with an acquittal in less than two hours, triggering scorching criticism of Whitaker in local media, including questions about whether McCoy was targeted because he was gay and a Democrat.\n\n\u201cVoters and taxpayers deserve to know whether this was just a poorly conceived and badly bungled effort by the government \u2014 or whether something else was going on,\u201d a columnist for the Des Moines Register wrote in 2007.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said Whitaker\u2019s office pursued credible allegations.\n\nSoon after leaving his federal post, Whitaker started a new law firm with two associates in Des Moines. In 2012, he made $79,000 from legal work and had 14 clients, including the National Rifle Association, according to a Federal Election Commission disclosure he made in an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate in 2014.\n\nIn December 2012, Whitaker, a local photographer and a real estate agent teamed up to rehabilitate a run-down, 22-unit brick apartment building.\n\nThe city agreed to give the trio a $165,000 loan, using federal housing funds, in exchange for building affordable units. Once they completed the project \u2014 including installing a new roof, boiler and plumbing \u2014 they would have to repay only $25,000.\n\n\u201cLittle progress was made on the project in 2013 and 2014,\u201d the city told The Washington Post in a statement. \u201cThe city communicated with Mr. Whitaker on the urgency of this project.\u201d\n\nAfter Whitaker\u2019s partners left, he promised to use his own money to finish the project.\n\nOn April 1, 2016, the city sent Whitaker a default notice and said the city would \u201ccommence legal proceedings\u201d unless he repaid the bulk of the loan within a month, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThe frustrating part was that it appears little progress was made for a couple years under his watch,\u201d Des Moines City Manager Scott Sanders told The Post.\n\nIn a letter first obtained by the Associated Press, a city planner wrote that Whitaker\u2019s company \u201cappears to have abandoned the property.\u201d\n\nKupec, the Justice spokes\u00adwoman, said the problems with the project were due to \u201ccost overruns and a bad general contractor.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Whitaker sold his share to Jeffrey Young, a local developer who repaid the loan. Young declined to comment.\n\nBy then, Whitaker was expanding his pursuits far beyond Iowa.\n\nHe had joined the board of World Patent Marketing, the invention-promotion company in Florida. In August 2015, he sent a threatening email to a client who had complained, noting that he was a former U.S. attorney and writing that \u201cthere could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission last year accused the company of misleading customers and threatening criminal prosecution against dissatisfied clients. In May, the company agreed to pay $25 million and shut its doors as part of a settlement.\n\nStarting in 2014, Whitaker was also leader of a conservative charity, Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a lucrative endeavor that raised his profile in the nation\u2019s capital. Whitaker received a total of more than $650,000 in salary in 2015 and 2016, tax filings show.\n\nTom Hamburger and Alice Crites contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Cleve R.

(Jasic Workers Support Group via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Students and alumni of several Chinese universities are sounding the alarm over the apparent detention of more than a dozen young labor activists who have been missing since the weekend.\n\nThree recent graduates of the elite Peking University have been taken away by authorities, the Jasic Workers Support Group said in a statement late Tuesday. According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \u201ckidnapped\u201d from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \u201cdisappeared\u201d by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists are an unusual target, however, because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers\u2019 rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school\u2019s security department said the \u201csituation\u201d on Friday was that of a \u201cpolice department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\u201d\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group\u2019s website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \u201cIf you keep yelling, we\u2019ll keep hitting you!\u201d Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \u201cillegal, gang-like violence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cPeking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\u201d\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University\u2019s pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns. Several had their phones confiscated for the remainder of the summer and continued to be hounded by police back home, according to a student who took part in the action.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Eraldo Peres, File/Associated Press)\n\nHAVANA \u2014 Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.\n\nThe end of the \u201cMas Medicos,\u201d or \u201cMore Doctors,\u201d program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state\u2019s \u201cinternational missions.\u201d Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\u201cMas Medicos\u201d started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \u201cMas Medicos\u201d was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cCubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\u201d Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \u201cSuch humane acts should be respected and defended.\u201d\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island\u2019s public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba\u2019s most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is slave labor,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be an accomplice of that.\u201d\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro\u2019s conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\u201d the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can\u2019t keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

(Susan Walsh/Associated Press)\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Virginia regularly awards grants, tax breaks and other goodies to businesses that move to the state or expand their operations, sometimes even for small projects that produce just a dozen or so jobs.\n\nBut Amazon\u2019s announcement Tuesday that it plans to put at least 25,000 highly paid new workers in a new Arlington headquarters is no ordinary economic development deal. Likewise, the incentive package that comes with it is unlike any the state has ever offered.\n\nCold hard cash is a major part of the package, but state and local officials are quick to point to other incentives used to lure Amazon that have broad benefits, including massive investments in higher education and public transportation.\n\nHere\u2019s some highlights of what\u2019s in in the deal:\n\n___\n\nCASH:\n\nVirginia\u2019s contract with Amazon agrees to pay the online retailer up to $750 million if it creates 37,850 jobs by 2039. Virginia\u2019s grants are divided into two phases, with the state paying $22,000 per job for the first 25,000 jobs, for a total of $550 million in grants to the company. For any additional jobs, the company would get $15,564 per employee. Amazon won\u2019t get paid until after the jobs are created.\n\nStephen Moret, head of the state\u2019s economic development agency, said the per-job figure is not even in the top 10 of what the state has previously paid to other companies. In current dollars, Virginia has paid as much as $80,000 per job for some economic development deals, he said.\n\nVirginia\u2019s per-job incentive is effectively only about a third of what Amazon is getting from New York, where Amazon is also planning a new 25,000 employee expansion.\n\nMoret said Virginia made a \u201cconscious decision\u201d not to try to lure Amazon with over-the-top cash grants but instead focus on a more comprehensive pitch.\n\nArlington county is also promising to give Amazon a share of its hotel tax, which it said would add up to $23 million over 15 years if Amazon meets its predicted job-creation targets.\n\n___\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION:\n\nA lynchpin of Virginia\u2019s bid to Amazon is the state\u2019s promises to double the number of students who graduate each year with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science and related fields. The state plans to spend $375 million to boost the number of tech-related master\u2019s degrees at George Mason University and Virginia Tech, which is planning to open a $1 billion graduate campus near the new Amazon headquarters.\n\nState officials expect roughly half of Amazon\u2019s new jobs at the Virginia headquarters will be tech jobs.\n\nChristina Winn, director of business investment for Arlington\u2019s economic development office, said Virginia Tech\u2019s planned expansion is the key overlooked piece of the deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a catalyst for the whole region,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nTRANSPORTATION:\n\nThe state is also promising to put up to $295 million into five transportation projects. They are a connector bridge from Crystal City to Reagan National Airport, improvements to a major thoroughfare, two new Metro station entrances \u2014 including to an as-yet-to-be built station \u2014 and expansion of transit service in the area. Local governments said they\u2019ve committed to spend $570 million on a collection of projects that will directly benefit Amazon\u2019s new employees.\n\nVirginia also agreed to help Amazon build and operate a helipad at its new site at the company\u2019s expense.\n\n___\n\nHOUSING:\n\nThe Virginia Housing Development Agency plans to spend an extra $15 million a year on to promote affordable housing in areas affected by Amazon\u2019s new headquarters for the next five years, according to Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s office. The quasi-governmental agency is funded through the sale of securities and loans to private investors.\n\nArlington and the city of Alexandria plan to use new revenues from Amazon to fund at least $15 million in the next decade to create and preserve 2,000 to 2,400 units of affordable housing.\n\n___\n\nEXTRAS:\n\nVirginia\u2019s contract with Amazon contains strict language on what the state can reveal through public records requests. Moret said the intent is to protect Amazon\u2019s proprietary information, not to circumvent the state\u2019s open records laws.\n\nThe state also promises to \u201cfoster an innovative economy\u201d and help implement \u201cforward-looking regulatory frameworks\u201d that promote competition, new technologies and clean energy. Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne said that clause of the contract was meant as a signal to innovative companies in all fields that Virginia wants to work with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really saying that Virginia is moving forward,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Barakat contributed from Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

About 1,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees demonstrated Thursday at a camp in Bangladesh against plans to repatriate them to Myanmar, from where hundreds of thousands fled army-led violence last year. (Dar Yasin/Associated Press)\n\nCOX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh \u2014 The head of Bangladesh\u2019s refugee commission said plans to begin the repatriation of 700,000 Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar on Thursday were scrapped after officials were unable to find anyone who wanted to return.\n\nThe refugees \u201care not willing to go back now,\u201d Refugee Commissioner Abul Kalam told The Associated Press. He said officials \u201ccan\u2019t force them to go\u201d but will continue to try to \u201cmotivate them so it happens.\u201d\n\nSome people on the government\u2019s repatriation list disappeared into the sprawling refugee camps to avoid being sent home, while others joined a large demonstration against the plan.\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state to escape killings and destruction of their villages by the military and Buddhist vigilantes that have drawn widespread condemnation of Myanmar.\n\nThe United Nations, whose human rights officials had urged Bangladesh to halt the repatriation process even as its refugee agency workers helped to facilitate it, welcomed Thursday\u2019s development.\n\nFiras Al-Khateeb, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Cox\u2019s Bazar, said it was unclear when the process might begin again. \u201cWe want their repatriation, but it has to be voluntary, safe and smooth,\u201d he said.\n\nBangladesh officials declined to say whether another attempt at repatriation would be made Friday.\n\nBangladesh Foreign Minister A.H. Mahmood Ali told reporters in Dhaka late Thursday that \u201cthere is no question of forcible repatriation. We gave them shelter, so why should we send them back forcibly?\u201d\n\nAt the Unchiprang refugee camp, a Bangladeshi refugee official implored the Rohingya on Thursday to return to their country over a loudspeaker.\n\n\u201cWe have arranged everything for you, we have six buses here, we have trucks, we have food. We want to offer everything to you. If you agree to go, we\u2019ll take you to the border, to the transit camp,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go!\u201d hundreds of voices, including children\u2019s, chanted in reply.\n\nSome refugees on the repatriation lists \u2014 which authorities say were drawn up with assistance from the UNHCR \u2014 said they don\u2019t want to go back.\n\nAt the Jamtoli refugee camp, one of the sprawling refugee settlements near the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar, 25-year-old Setara said she and her two children, age 4 and 7, were on a repatriation list, but her parents were not. She said she had never asked to return to Myanmar, and that she had sent her children to a school run by aid workers Thursday morning as usual.\n\n\u201cThey killed my husband; now I live here with my parents,\u201d said Setara, who only gave one name. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d\n\nShe said that other refugees on the repatriation list had fled to other camps, hoping to disappear amid the crowded lanes of refugees, aid workers and Bangladeshi soldiers, which on Thursday were bustling with commerce and other activity.\n\nBangladesh had planned to send an initial group of 2,251 back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nMyanmar officials, speaking late Thursday in the captal, Naypyitaw, said they were ready to receive the refugees. Despite those assurances, human rights activists said conditions were not yet safe for the Rohingya to go back.\n\nThe huge exodus of Rohingya began in August last year after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the U.N., of ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group, viewing them as \u201cBengalis\u201d who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, as well as access to education and hospitals.\n\nThe refugees survived the ransacking of villages, rapes and killings in Myanmar, but for many, life in Bangladesh\u2019s squalid refugee camps has been bleak.\n\nThe refugees who\u2019ve arrived in the last year joined a wave of 250,000 Rohingya Muslims who escaped forced labor, religious persecution and violent attacks from Buddhist mobs in Myanmar during the early 1990s.\n\nAccess to education and employment has been far from assured.\n\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who hopes to retain power in December elections, has repeatedly complained that hosting more than a million Rohingya is taxing local resources.\n\nNegotiations for repatriation have been in the works for months, but plans last January to begin sending refugees back were called off amid concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that their return would be met with violence.\n\nForeign leaders, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, criticized Myanmar\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize-winning leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nBut on Thursday, Pence said that U.S. officials were \u201cencouraged to hear that\u201d the repatriation process would begin.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would continue working with international partners including the U.N. \u201cto ensure that the Rohingya themselves are part of any decisions on their future.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSchmall reported from New Delhi.

Attacks on government outposts and civilians by dozens of armed militias have complicated the work of Ebola response teams, who have often had to suspend crucial work tracking cases and isolating people infected with the deadly virus. Violence has escalated in recent weeks, including attacks by armed groups this weekend near the operations center in Beni, the urban epicenter in North Kivu province.\n\nNo U.S. citizens are working in the outbreak zone, but staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development are in Kinshasa, the capital, about 1,000 miles away. Additional personnel are working in neighboring countries. Whether to deploy personnel to the heart of the outbreak is a continuing debate within the administration.\n\nA fewseasoned Ebola experts from the CDC were withdrawn from Beni in late August after an attack by an armed group against a Congolese military location along a road close to where the team was traveling, according to a senior U.S. Embassy official in Congo. No U.S. government personnel or other Ebola responders were targeted or in the immediate area of that attack.\n\n\u201cSecuring the safety of our staff is our highest priority,\u201d one administration official said during a briefing for reporters Wednesday. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of rules set by the White House. Washington is continually monitoring the security situation, but right now, \u201cit\u2019s simply too dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n[CDC Director warns that Ebola outbreak may not be containable]\n\nLooming over those security concerns are the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, according to public health experts familiar with discussions over U.S. personnel deployment who spoke on condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nThe administration official declined to say whether sending CDC experts under the protection of U.S. military personnel is under consideration. \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule in or rule out anything,\u201d he said. But he noted that during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people, the U.S. military provided only logistical support.\n\nAfter CDC Director Robert Redfield raised the possibility last week that the outbreak has worsened so dramatically that it might not be brought under control, U.S. officials sought to downplay that scenario. They emphasized unequivocally that the administration\u2019s goal is to stop the outbreak.\n\n\u201cThe Ebola response is a priority of the U.S. government,\u201d Tim Ziemer, a senior official at USAID, said at another briefing, hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Ziemer had led global health security at the National Security Council but left that position abruptly in May after the global health security team he oversaw was disbanded under a reorganization by national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in controlling any outbreak, especially this one, is the inability of responders to effectively identify and trace all contacts with Ebola patients. Without that ability, the disease continues to spread. Particularly worrisome in this outbreak is that an estimated 60 to 80 percent of new confirmed cases have no known links to prior cases, making it virtually impossible for responders to track infections and stop transmission.\n\n\u201cThat shows that your systems are not working, that you\u2019re failing to get your arms around this outbreak,\u201d said J. Stephen Morrison, a CSIS senior vice president.\n\nAt the CSIS briefing, the World Heath Organization\u2019s emergency response chief, speaking from Geneva, said the outbreak is expected to last an additional six months, in a best-case scenario. Peter Salama also said informal health clinics, which are unregulated and often run by traditional healers, may have spread the virus in Beni as mothers and children sought help for cases of Ebola that had been misdiagnosed as malaria, which has similar early symptoms.\n\nRead more\n\nExperts chase the cause of paralyzing childhood disease spiking this year\n\nEbola\u2019s lessons, painfully learned, at great cost in dollars and human lives\n\nHow Ebola sped out of control"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Migrant caravan groups arrive by hundreds at US border", "description": "Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans are arriving in Tijuana by the hundreds and getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/migrant-caravan-groups-arrive-by-hundreds-at-us-border/2018/11/14/59a069de-e86d-11e8-8449-1ff263609a31_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:28:19Z", "content": "TIJUANA, Mexico Migrants in a caravan of Central Americans arrived in Tijuana by the hundreds Wednesday, getting their first glimpse of the robust U.S. military presence that awaits them after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the border. \u2026 [+6053 chars]", "fulltext": "Young Honduran migrant Daniel Gamez waits with his family in a line for a meal after arriving with the Central America migrant caravan in Tijuana, Mexico, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018. Members of a migrant caravan started to meet some local resistance as they continued to arrive by the hundreds in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, where a group of residents clashed with migrants camped out by the U.S. border fence. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 More buses of exhausted people in a caravan of Central American asylum seekers reached the U.S. border Thursday as the city of Tijuana converted a municipal gymnasium into a temporary shelter and the migrants came to grips with the reality that they will be on the Mexican side of the frontier for an extended stay.\n\nWith U.S. border inspectors at the main crossing into San Diego processing only about 100 asylum claims a day, it could take weeks if not months to process the thousands in the caravan that departed from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, more than a month ago.\n\nTijuana\u2019s robust network of shelters was already stretched to the limit, having squeezed in double their capacity or more as families slept on the floor on mats, forcing the city to open the gymnasium for up to 360 people Wednesday. A gated outdoor courtyard can accommodate hundreds more.\n\nThe city\u2019s thriving factories are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled here in the last two years, but the prospect of thousands more destitute Central Americans has posed new challenges.\n\nDelia Avila, director of Tijuana\u2019s family services department, who is helping spearhead the city\u2019s response, said migrants who can arrange legal status in Mexico are welcome to stay.\n\n\u201cTijuana is a land of migrants. Tijuana is a land that has known what it is to embrace thousands of co-nationals and also people from other countries,\u201d Avila said.\n\nMexican law enforcement was out in force in a city that is suffering an all-time-high homicide rate. A group of about 50 migrants, mostly women and children, walked through downtown streets Thursday from the city shelter to a breakfast hall under police escort.\n\nAs buses from western and central Mexico trickled in overnight and into the morning, families camped inside the bus terminal and waited for word on where they could find a safe place to sleep. One shelter designed for 45 women and children was housing 100; another designed for 100 had nearly 200.\n\nMany endured the evening chill to sleep at an oceanfront park with a view of San Diego office towers and heavily armed U.S. Border Patrol agents on the other side of a steel-bollard fence.\n\nOscar Zapata, 31, reached the Tijuana bus station at 2 a.m. from Guadalajara with his wife and their three children, ages 4, 5 and 12, and headed to the breakfast hall, where migrants were served free beef and potatoes.\n\nBack home in La Ceiba, Honduras, he was selling pirated CDs and DVDs in the street when two gangs demanded \u201cprotection\u201d money. He had already seen a colleague gunned down on a street corner because he couldn\u2019t pay. He said gangs called him and his wife on their cellphones and showed up at their house, threatening to kidnap his daughter and force her into prostitution if he didn\u2019t pay.\n\nWhen he heard about the caravan on the TV news last month, he didn\u2019t think twice.\n\n\u201cIt was the opportunity to get out,\u201d Zapata said.\n\nZapata said he hopes to join a brother in Los Angeles but has not yet decided on his next move. Like many others, he planned to wait in Tijuana for others in the caravan to arrive and gather more information before seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nByron Jose Blandino, a 27-year-old bricklayer from Nicaragua who slept in the converted gymnasium, said he wanted to request asylum but not until he could speak with someone well-versed in U.S. law and asylum procedures.\n\n\u201cThe first thing is to wait,\u201d Blandino said. \u201cI do not want to break the laws of any country. If I could enter in a peaceful manner, that would be good.\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing.\n\nOn Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the caravans.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months in Mexico at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage others in caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nRueda reported that about 1,750 migrants from the caravan had now reached Tijuana. Private shelters can house about 700, and the city-owned gym and sports complex has a capacity of 1,000 with the potential to expand to 3,000.\n\n\u201cThis is not a crisis,\u201d he told reporters, while allowing that \u201cthis is an extraordinary situation.\u201d\n\nThere are 7,000 jobs available in the state for those who can obtain legal status in Mexico, Rueda said. He touted Tijuana\u2019s integration of Haitian migrants over the last two years and the state\u2019s relatively low unemployment rate.\n\nThe migrants have met some resistance from local residents, about 100 of whom confronted a similar-size group of Central Americans who were camped out by the U.S. border fence Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome\u201d and \u201cGet out!\u201d the locals said, marching up to the group.\n\nPolice kept the two sides apart.\n\nVladimir Cruz, a migrant from El Salvador, shook his head and said: \u201cThese people are the racists, because 95 percent of people here support us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just this little group. ... They are uncomfortable because we\u2019re here,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nPlayas de Tijuana, as the area is known, is an upper-middle-class enclave, and residents appeared worried about crime and sanitation. One protester shouted, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about discrimination, it is about safety!\u201d\n\nThere are real questions about how the city of more than 1.6 million will manage to handle the migrant caravans working their way through Mexico, which may total 10,000 people in all.\n\n\u201cNo city in the world is prepared to receive this number of migrants,\u201d said Tijuana social development director Mario Osuna, adding that the city hopes Mexico\u2019s federal government \u201cwill start legalizing these people immediately\u201d so they can get jobs and earn a living.\n\nDozens of gay and transgender migrants in the caravan were already lining up Thursday to submit asylum claims, though it was unclear how soon they would be able to do so.\n\nThe caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds were stranded for most of the day at a gas station in Navojoa, some 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) from Tijuana.\n\n\u201cWe were dropped here at midnight ... in the middle of nowhere, where supposedly some buses were going to come pick us up, but nothing,\u201d Alejandra Grisel Rodriguez of Honduras told The Associated Press by phone. \u201cWe are without water, without food.\u201d\n\nAfter about 12 hours seven buses began arriving to collect the migrants, Rodriguez said, but they quickly filled up.\n\n\u201cWe would need at least 40 or 50,\u201d she said.\n\nJesus Edmundo Valdez, coordinator of firefighters and civil defense in Navojoa, said Wednesday that authorities were providing food, water and medical attention to migrants there. His phone rang unanswered Thursday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza in Culiacan, Mexico, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Cooper, had already begun surfacing.\n\nIn a September 2014 posting on the Ripoff Report, one person wrote that World Patent Marketing had offered to help market that person\u2019s idea for a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, according to an archived version of the site.\n\nAnother complaint posted in January 2015 came from a person who claimed to have worked as an employee at the company.\n\n\u201cLet me explain [to] you exactly how this scam works,\u201d the person wrote, describing in detail the tactics the company used to reel in consumers.\n\nThe person said the company would accept any invention idea, no matter how improbable, building excitement in customers by promising that their proposals were being analyzed by a review team. \u201cThe whole step by step process was simply created to get you excited about your idea,\u201d the person wrote.\n\nMagedson said he received the phone call from Whitaker around that time.\n\nMagedson said it is not uncommon for Ripoff Report to receive complaints from businesses when they are reviewed negatively on the site. Ripoff Report\u2019s business model \u2014 which encourages companies to pay for a program that can yield better reviews \u2014 has been criticized. A federal judge in Utah found in 2015 that the website encouraged negative reviews and that it accepted online postings from competitors of businesses reviewed on the site as well as from consumers. The finding came in a defamation suit in which Ripoff Report ultimately prevailed.\n\nMagedson said that Whitaker\u2019s complaints were particularly memorable.\n\n\u201cHe did not threaten me physically, but said he would shut us down and threatened to refer us to a federal agency, Homeland Security,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was yelling.\u201d\n\nAfter their conversation, Magedson posted a note on Ripoff Report noting that Whitaker, whom he described as a former U.S. attorney and GOP Senate candidate, had touted World Patent Marketing as \u201cthe top patent, idea protection and inventor services company for helping inventors and entrepreneurs succeed,\u201d according to an archived page of the website. The posting did not describe Whitaker\u2019s alleged threats.\n\nThat year, World Patent Marketing joined Ripoff Report\u2019s Corporate Advocacy program, a way for companies to improve their reputations by submitting to a review by Ripoff Report.\n\nSeparately, FTC investigators found that Whitaker received complaints about the company in his role as an advisory board member, two people familiar with the probe said.\n\nIn one incident, a customer asked Whitaker to take action because World Patent Marketing was allegedly cheating customers out of their money. Whitaker forwarded the complaint to Cooper, the chief executive, according to the people.\n\nFTC investigators did not find evidence that Whitaker sought to learn more about the allegations or expressed concerns about the accusations, the people said.\n\nFTC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe FTC considered Whitaker a material witness when the agency began probing rampant customer complaints about World Patent Marketing. Investigators were examining whether Whitaker played a role in helping the company silence critics by threatening them with legal action, according to people with knowledge of the case.\n\nBut when the FTC subpoenaed Whitaker for his records related to the company in October 2017, he failed to provide any information, telling investigators that he was busy at that time moving from Iowa to Washington for a new job, the people said.\n\nAt the time, Whitaker was preparing to assume his post as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n[Federal investigators scrutinized Whitaker\u2019s role in patent company accused of fraud, according to people with knowledge of case]\n\nThe FTC did not further pursue Whitaker\u2019s records because World Patent Marketing began negotiating a settlement with the agency, the people said.\n\nIn its investigation, the agency concluded that World Patent Marketing falsely promised clients that it would patent and market their ideas in exchange for hefty fees \u2014 and then pocketed the money, court records show.\n\n\u201cFor the last three years, Defendants have operated an invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,\u201d the FTC alleged in a recently unsealed court filing.\n\nIn 2017, people who said they were victimized were notified that the FBI had opened a criminal investigation of the company, although several of the people said they have not seen any recent interest from the bureau. The FBI has declined to comment.\n\nSince Whitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general, people who say they were victimized by World Patent Marketing have been comparing notes about their experiences, said Crystal Carlson, an inventor from Arizona who said she lost $36,000 when the company failed to market her idea for a product to prevent parents from forgetting infants in cars.\n\nCarlson, whose extensive research into the company\u2019s practices helped spur the FTC investigation, maintains a Facebook group for victims. She said some people who lost money have been incensed at Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nOthers, like her, think that Whitaker was probably fooled by Cooper about the company\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201cI think, in hindsight, he would probably kick himself in the butt just like every other victim of World Patent Marketing has,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you realize you\u2019ve been victimized in that way, you question yourself. How could you have been so stupid as to have fallen for something like this?\u201d\n\nOthers are less forgiving.\n\nNancy Torres, 60, said she lost more than $30,000 when World Patent Marketing failed to bring to market her newly designed nursing pillow. Torres said she is now deeply in debt and struggles to make home payments and provide for three grandchildren who live with her in Allentown, Pa.\n\nTorres, who generally opposes Trump, said she has been upset by Whitaker\u2019s appointment, especially the fact that the new acting attorney general never returned the money he was paid by World Patent Marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling,\u201d she said. \u201cShame on him.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.farhi", "title": "Trump lawyers, CNN square off in federal court in Jim Acosta case - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trump lawyers, CNN square off in federal court in Jim Acosta case Washington Post Lawyers for President Trump and CNN squared off in federal court Wednesday in legal arguments over whether the president has the power to revoke the White House \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trump-lawyers-cnn-square-off-in-federal-court-in-jim-acosta-case/2018/11/14/16988874-e863-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/02SYPx4pNsAHfGdrAaRSN-37-sQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/43GTOLXIKQI6RKJZSRU7CFTPTU.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:16:59Z", "content": "Lawyers for President Trump and CNN squared off in federal court Wednesday in legal arguments over whether the president has the power to revoke the White House press credential of reporter Jim Acosta.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nLawyers for President Trump and CNN squared off in federal court Wednesday in legal arguments over whether the president has the power to revoke the White House press credential of reporter Jim Acosta.\n\nThe judge overseeing a lawsuit brought by CNN said he would decide by Thursday afternoon whether to grant CNN\u2019s motion for a restraining order that would temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s access to the White House.\n\nWednesday\u2019s skirmish in U.S. District Court in Washington was the first since CNN filed its suit Tuesday. The news network did so after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders yanked the reporter\u2019s access to the White House grounds after he engaged in a contentious exchange with Trump during a news conference and briefly tangled with a press aide.\n\nPrecisely who made the decision to bar Acosta was unclear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Justice Department attorney James Burnham, representing the White House, said he didn\u2019t know who made that call when asked by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly.\n\nBurnham argued, however, that the president could exclude any reporter from the White House\u2019s grounds, just as he has the right to exclude them from interviews in the Oval Office or to ignore their questions during news conferences.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would dispute, if [Trump] wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he clearly has the authority to do that,\u201d Burnham argued at one point during the 110-minute hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right . . . for journalists to be there.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that CNN\u2019s and Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights weren\u2019t injured by the decision to exclude Acosta \u2014 as CNN contends \u2014 because the network has dozens of other journalists with White House passes who could report in his place. He also said Acosta was free to keep reporting on Trump by watching television coverage of him outside the White House gates.\n\nThat brought a sharp reply from CNN lawyer Ted Boutrous, who said the government had \u201ca warped view\u201d of journalism and due process. CNN\u2019s lawsuit contends that Trump\u2019s actions violate both the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, which ensures that government actions are guided by clear procedure, not arbitrary action.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s now taking the position that [the president] can do anything he wants,\u201d Boutrous said.\n\nThe White House took the unprecedented step of lifting Acosta\u2019s credential after Trump blasted him as \u201ca rude, terrible person\u201d when the reporter questioned him during a news conference.\n\nCNN and Acosta have gotten support from mainstream news organizations, which said Wednesday they would jointly file friend-of-the-court briefs on CNN\u2019s behalf. The organizations included The Washington Post, the New York Times, Fox News, NBC News, the Associated Press, Bloomberg and others.\n\n\u201cWhether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions,\u201d lawyers for the group said in a statement. \u201cIt is imperative that independent journalists have access to the president and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons. Our news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this president, or any president.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, Fox News President Jay Wallace said: \u201cFox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter\u2019s press credential. . . . Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don\u2019t condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "California's deadliest wildfire is also a massive air-quality problem - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post California's deadliest wildfire is also a massive air-quality problem Washington Post The Camp Fire roaring through Northern California \u2014 the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history \u2014 has left a stagnant plume of smoke \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/15/californias-deadliest-wildfire-is-also-massive-air-quality-problem/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nxCWhPlEAgtf0xmnmZ8UEtHSaY4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJLOK2XIIEI6RBCJD7ZGGYE2GE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:10:05Z", "content": "The Camp Fire roaring through Northern California the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californias history has left a stagnant plume of smoke over cities more than 100 miles away, causing stores to sell out of respirator masks and sending some of th\u2026 [+6852 chars]", "fulltext": "\n\nThe San Francisco skyline is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires behind Alcatraz Island Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nThe Camp Fire roaring through Northern California \u2014 the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history \u2014 has left a stagnant plume of smoke over cities more than 100 miles away, causing stores to sell out of respirator masks and sending some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable to the hospital.\n\nWildfire smoke, thick with soot and other particles, sent the air quality plummeting in the Bay Area to the \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d level \u2014 the second-lowest rating, just above \u201chazardous\u201d \u2014 in the week since the Camp Fire started, said Bay Area Air Quality Management District spokesman Walter Wallace. By midday Wednesday, the air-quality advisory for the Bay Region had improved slightly to the \u201cunhealthy\u201d level.\n\nStagnant weather over San Francisco has held the smoke in place. Limp winds that recently blew through the city could not clear the smoke away. Worse, an inversion layer \u2014 a sheet of warm air that traps cold air beneath it \u2014 sits like a lid above the haze.\n\nSan Francisco General Hospital has not observed any significant increase in respiratory complaints, spokesman Brent Andrew said. But Deanna Watson, 23, said she had to take her 4-year-old son to a hospital after he had trouble breathing on Monday.\n\nShe had taken Gideon out to play over the weekend when she noticed the skies become a deeper gray as the smoke began to settle around her home in Orangevale, Calif. By the afternoon, Gideon noticed the change in the gray skies, and his health.\n\nGideon had been diagnosed with Roifman syndrome, which means he has a compromised immune system and underdeveloped lungs. But this is the first time a change in air quality caused Watson to rush to him to the doctor.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at how quickly the smoke settled here,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI wish I stayed inside more, but the mornings looked clearer.\u201d\n\nGideon was discharged from a hospital in Roseville, Calif., on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cHe keeps asking me why the skies are so gray, but he really doesn\u2019t understand that the smoke caused him to feel this way,\u201d Watson said.\n\nThe Camp Fire is one of several raging throughout California. At least 48 people have died since the fire started Nov. 8, and fires elsewhere claimed at least two more lives. Nearly 100 people were listed missing Wednesday on the website of the sheriff\u2019s office in Butte County, where the fire started.\n\nBut far away from there, residents say they are feeling the effects.\n\n\u201cWith the help of wind, wildfire smoke can float hundreds of miles when there is no rain,\u201d said environmental epidemiologist Jia Coco Liu, who previously studied wildfires at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Liu lives in Palo Alto, far from the fires in Northern California, but she can smell \u201cheavy smoke.\u201d\n\nPeople older than 65 and children younger than 4 are particularly vulnerable to smoke, according to Ralph Delfino, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of California at Irvine.\n\n\u201cWhen you grow older, just like your ability to fight off infection goes down, the ability to mount an antioxidant defense decreases, too,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the past week, 58-year-old Tori Eckman has felt dreadful, she said.\n\n\u201cI have a sore throat, stinging eyes, and my asthma has flared up,\u201d she said. But her 10-year-old white Bichon, Charlie, needs to be walked, so every day she\u2019s zipped up her orange jacket with its red and white \u201cI voted\u201d sticker, and walked laps around Lower Pacific Heights, a San Francisco neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThis is my only outing for the day,\u201d she said. She\u2019s worried about how the smoke will affect Charlie but doesn\u2019t have any alternatives.\n\nDelfino and his colleagues found that, during the 2003 California wildfires, hospital admissions due to asthma increased by a third. As particulate matter in the air increased, so did the percentage of individuals who sought treatment for illnesses like bronchitis and pneumonia. Though smoke inhalation is often associated with respiratory problems, it can harm the cardiovascular system, too. Tiny particles in soot and smoke can irritate lungs and, if they are small enough, enter the bloodstream.\n\n\u201cThe primary people at risk are people who already have heart or lung disease,\u201d Delfino said.\n\nWallace urged people to avoid going outside if possible. \u201cStay indoors, limit the time outside, don\u2019t risk it,\u201d he said. \u201cHold off on that morning jog.\u201d Windows should be shut and air conditioners set on recirculate.\n\nMasks, respirators rated N95 and P100, can offer some protection, but only if they fit properly. Many people feel uncomfortable wearing these respirators because they need to sit so snugly against the face, which can be a problem for people with facial hair.\n\n\"I\u2019ve lived here for 35 years, and last week was the worst air I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Luis Cauz, 54, a delivery driver for Bi-Rite Food Service. Cauz\u2019s approach is to ignore it; he doesn\u2019t wear a mask or stay indoors, despite being asthmatic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wear one. I just feel good; I feel healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI noticed the air is improving because I\u2019m breathing better now than last week.\u201d\n\nNot everyone can afford to stay inside. Construction workers, mailmen, and utility service workers were working on Wednesday, many of them without masks.\n\nJoseph Vuong, a U.S. postal worker, made his delivery rounds in Folsom, Calif., on Wednesday afternoon. He began delivering mail at 10 a.m. but noticed a drastic change in the air quality by the early afternoon.\n\n\u201cI felt fine being outside in the morning,\u201d Vuong said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I can feel and taste the air now. It\u2019s getting worse.\u201d Vuong\u2019s employer gave him a turquoise N95 mask, but he hasn\u2019t worn it yet. It sits in his mail truck. \u201cMaybe I should start,\u201d he said.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s public health department has published a map of libraries and other public buildings with filtered air. Although the main library branch increased its hours on Friday, fewer than a dozen of the city\u2019s many homeless people stayed late, the Atlantic reported.\n\nTwo years ago, Liu and her colleagues predicted that the health impacts of wildfire smoke will increase in the coming decades because of hotter and drier summers. Their model suggested \u201csmoke waves,\u201d multiple days during which certain pollutants exceed healthy levels, would increase in intensity and frequency. In western states in the late 2040s, the number of these smoke waves will increase by half, the epidemiologists calculated.\n\nIf their predictions are correct, 82 million individuals will experience more smoke in California, Oregon and the Great Plains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to point out that this is one of the adverse health impacts of climate change. Unquestionably,\u201d Delfino said. Drought, early springs, late rains and dried-out plants result in bigger, more intense fires, he said. Delfino paused speaking to cough. Smoke had spilled into Irvine, too.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story referred to Lower Pacific Heights as a San Francisco suburb.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA transoceanic personnel crisis that engulfed the National Security Council this week is partly rooted in a bureaucratic dispute over the seating arrangements aboard first lady Melania Trump\u2019s plane to Africa last month during her maiden solo trip abroad.\n\nAs the East Wing prepared the flight manifest for the marquee trip, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel became angry that seats on the first lady\u2019s government jet were assigned to a larger-than-usual security entourage and a small press corps with none for Ricardel or another NSC staffer, according to current U.S. officials and others familiar with the trip and its aftermath.\n\nPolicy experts from the NSC and State Department were advised to fly separately and to meet the first lady\u2019s party on the ground, a practice the State Department had often used, but Ricardel objected strenuously, those people said. She threatened to revoke NSC resources associated with the trip, meaning no policy staff would advise the first lady during her visits to Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Egypt.\n\nBad blood between Ricardel and Melania Trump and her staff continued for weeks after the trip, with the first lady privately arguing that the NSC\u2019s No. 2 official was a corrosive influence in the White House and should be dismissed. But national security adviser John Bolton rebuffed the first lady and protected his deputy, prompting the first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, to issue an extraordinary statement to reporters Tuesday effectively calling for Ricardel\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said of Ricardel in the statement.\n\nAfter an uncomfortable day of limbo, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Wednesday evening that Ricardel was leaving the White House.\n\n\u201cMira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAn NSC spokesman declined to elaborate.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s decision to publicly advocate for the ouster of a senior member of her husband\u2019s staff shows a new willingness on her part to weigh in on White House operations and marks a change from earlier in the Trump administration, when she repeatedly played down her role as an adviser to the president.\n\nIt also comes as the president is mulling personnel changes, including possibly ousting Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and firing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nAnita McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, says Melania Trump\u2019s move was a dramatic show of power.\n\n\u201cIf anyone had questions about her willingness to exert her influence, they got their answer,\u201d she said.\n\nRicardel\u2019s dismissal also serves as a rebuke of Bolton, known for his sharp elbows and ability to navigate internal tensions, who refused for weeks to fire his handpicked deputy and worked in the past day to protect her.\n\nSoon after the first lady\u2019s office issued its statement Tuesday, surprised senior White House aides walked to Ricardel\u2019s office to see whether she was still there. She was, albeit confused.\n\nBolton, who was awakened in Asia in the middle of the night and told of the dust-up, was soon on the phone, telling Ricardel to remain at her post, three administration officials said.\n\nThe White House was trying to find a soft landing place for Ricardel, but agencies including the Commerce Department, where she worked in the first year of the Trump administration, are hesitant to take her on because of her reputation, two senior administration officials said.\n\nThe first lady\u2019s statement came after months of tension in the White House over Ricardel\u2019s abrasive interactions with staffers in both the East Wing and the West Wing, according to several current and former staffers.\n\nMelania Trump and Ricardel have never met, according to people familiar with each of them. But the first lady viewed the conservative operative, who was among the most senior women in the West Wing, as a toxic influence in the White House, to the point that she spoke to Trump about Ricardel after the Africa trip and authorized others to spread the word that Ricardel had overstepped the mark, several people familiar with recent events said.\n\nA senior White House official said the first lady believed Ricardel was spreading false rumors about her office, including a misleading story that aides had arranged a $10,000 hotel stay in Egypt. Other White House aides said Ricardel belittled underlings, shouted at professional staff and was the most disliked aide in the West Wing.\n\nLast weekend, according to administration officials, the first lady\u2019s office again asked Bolton to oust Ricardel. Others, including Kelly, have wanted her gone for months, administration officials said, with little success in overcoming Bolton\u2019s objections.\n\nBolton declined again \u2014 and went to Asia.\n\nWhile the first lady\u2019s public statement came as a surprise to many, including in the White House, Paolo Zampolli, a longtime friend of the Trumps\u2019, said the move isn\u2019t out of character for the first lady. \u201cOur first lady is very strong, and she has the right to choose who she\u2019s working with,\u201d he said.\n\nIn past administrations, first ladies exerted similar or greater influence, but always behind the scenes. The most famous modern example is Nancy Reagan\u2019s engineering the ouster of chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who had made the dire mistake of hanging up on her. While Nancy Reagan\u2019s fingerprints were all over the firing, there were no statements from her office to that effect.\n\n\u201cYou never hang up on the first lady. She can be your strongest ally. She can help you more than anybody realizes,\u201d said Kenneth Duberstein, who fared better as chief of staff to Reagan.\n\nMartha Washington, historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, once wrote that she felt like a \u201cstate prisoner\u201d because of protocol rules and a schedule set in part by her husband\u2019s chief adviser, Tobias Lear. And there was no love lost between Mary Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln\u2019s chief counselors, John Hay and John Nicolay, who referred to her as \u201cthe hellcat\u201d behind her back.\n\nPat Nixon, Anthony says, chafed at top White House aides H.R. \u201cBob\u201d Haldeman and John Erlichman for perceived offenses that included not giving her enough notice before travel and for not taking her ambitious agenda seriously, Anthony said.\n\n\u201cIt goes back so far that what we\u2019re really talking about is human nature and the problem of the boss\u2019s wife,\u201d he said.\n\nMelania Trump has taken on a more public role recently, launching her anti-bullying campaign earlier this year and traveling to Africa in October.\n\nShe has made symbolic gestures that suggest she feels free to make her views plain and to disagree with her husband.\n\nIn a rare sit-down interview with ABC News last month, the first lady was asked whether it was true that she had more control over her notoriously volatile husband than anyone else. \u201cOh, I wish,\u201d she said. \u201cI give him my honest advice and honest opinions. And then he does what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nThe first lady has privately complained about other current and former White House officials to her husband \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, chief among them \u2014 but has never before issued such a public statement.\n\nThe East Wing often does not clear its statements with the White House. Senior White House aides, including Kelly and Bolton, were not aware that the statement was coming before it was issued Tuesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders had not seen the final statement, a senior administration official said.\n\nEven Kelly, who wanted Ricardel gone, told others he thought that the situation was handled poorly and that the White House looked bad.\n\nThe controversy has added to the turmoil surrounding the White House after last week\u2019s midterm elections, in which Republicans lost control of the House and maintained a slim Senate majority. Last week, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions before heading to Paris over the weekend for the commemoration of the end of World War I, a period during which he struck out at French President Emmanuel Macron via Twitter and Macron indirectly criticized Trump\u2019s embrace of \u201cnationalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis shows it\u2019s still a broken and dysfunctional White House. Maybe John Kelly has made a few trains run on time, but it\u2019s clearly still broken,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a 2017 book, \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d about White House chiefs of staff and West Wing operations.\n\nPhilip Rucker contributed to this report."}]
