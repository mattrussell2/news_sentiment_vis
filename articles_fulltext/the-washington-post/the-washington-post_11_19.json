That review revealed that throughout much of 2017, she often discussed or relayed official White House business using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe discovery alarmed some advisers to President Trump, who feared that his daughter\u2019s prac\u00adtices bore similarities to the personal email use of Hillary Clinton, an issue he made a focus of his 2016 campaign. He attacked his Democratic challenger as untrustworthy and dubbed her \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d for using a personal email account as secretary of state.\n\nSome aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\n\nThe White House referred requests for comment to Ivanka Trump\u2019s attorney and ethics counsel, Abbe Lowell.\n\nIn a statement, Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Lowell, acknowledged that the president\u2019s daughter occasionally used her private email before she was briefed on the rules, but he said none of her messages contained classified information.\n\n\u201cWhile transitioning into government, after she was given an official account but until the White House provided her the same guidance they had given others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMirijanian said Ivanka Trump turned over all her government-related emails months ago so they could be stored permanently with other White House records.\n\nAnd he stressed that her email use was different from that of Clinton, who had a private email server in the basement of her Chappaqua, N.Y., home. At one point, an archive of thousands of Clinton\u2019s emails was deleted by a computer specialist amid a congressional investigation.\n\n\u201cMs. Trump did not create a private server in her house or office, no classified information was ever included, the account was never transferred at Trump Organization, and no emails were ever deleted,\u201d Mirijanian said.\n\nLike Trump, Clinton also said she was unaware of or misunderstood the rules. However, Clinton relied solely on a private email system as secretary of state, bypassing government servers entirely.\n\n\n\nIvanka Trump often discussed or relayed official White House business last year using a private email account with a domain that she shares with her husband, Jared Kushner. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nBoth Trump and Clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records.\n\nClinton originally said none of the messages she sent or received were \u201cmarked classified.\u201d The FBI later determined that 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received.\n\n[Inspector general blasts Comey and says others at FBI showed \u2018willingness to take official action\u2019 to hurt Trump]\n\nAustin Evers, executive director of the liberal watchdog group American Oversight, whose record requests sparked the White House discovery, said it strained credulity that Trump\u2019s daughter did not know that government officials should not use private emails for official business.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the obvious hypocrisy that her father ran on the misuse of personal email as a central tenet of his campaign,\u201d Evers said. \u201cThere is no reasonable suggestion that she didn\u2019t know better. Clearly everyone joining the Trump administration should have been on high alert about personal email use.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband set up personal emails with the domain \u201cijkfamily.com\u201d through a Microsoft system in December 2016, as they were preparing to move to Washington so Kushner could join the White House, according to people familiar with the arrangement.\n\nThe couple\u2019s emails are prescreened by the Trump Organization for security problems such as viruses but are stored by Microsoft, the people said.\n\nTrump used her personal account to discuss government policies and official business fewer than 100 times \u2014 often replying to other administration officials who contacted her through her private email, according to people familiar with the review.\n\nAnother category of less-substantive emails may have also violated the records law: hundreds of messages related to her official work schedule and travel details that she sent herself and personal assistants who cared for her children and house, they said.\n\nPeople close to Ivanka Trump said she never intended to use her private email to shroud her government work. After she told White House lawyers she was unaware that she was breaking any email rules, they discovered that she had not been receiving White House updates and reminders to all staffers about prohibited use of private email, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nUsing personal emails for government business could violate the Presidential Records Act, which requires that all official White House communications and records be preserved as a permanent archive of each administration. It can also increase the risk that sensitive government information could be mishandled or hacked, revealing government secrets and risking harm to diplomatic relations and secret operations.\n\nRevelations about Clinton\u2019s personal email system led to an FBI investigation of whether she had mishandled classified information. The scandal shadowed Clinton throughout the 2016 White House race, culminating in then-FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s controversial decision to hold a news conference a few months before the election to announce his conclusion that she had been reckless with government secrets but that there was not sufficient evidence she had intended to skirt the law.\n\nDuring the campaign, Donald Trump said the Democratic nominee\u2019s \u201ccorruption is on a scale we have never seen before\u201d and called her personal email use \u201cbigger than Watergate.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters still chant \u201cLock her up!\u201d at his rallies, and the president, nearly two years into his administration, continues to tweet about Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\n\u201cBig story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD,\u201d he tweeted in August, referring to a Fox News story about claims that the bureau did not scrutinize all her emails. \u201cAlso gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump first used her personal email to contact Cabinet officials in early 2017, before she joined the White House as an unpaid senior adviser, according to emails obtained by American Oversight and first reported by Newsweek.\n\n[Ivanka Trump shuts down her namesake clothing brand]\n\nIn late February 2017, she used her personal email to contact Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon and propose they meet to explore \u201copportunities to collaborate.\u201d The following month, she emailed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, suggesting that their staffers meet to discuss ways to collaborate on \u201clocational/workforce development and k-12 STEM education.\u201d\n\nWhile her messages were largely about government work, Trump was not then subject to White House records rules.\n\nWhen she joined the White House on March 30, Trump pledged to comply \u201cwith all ethics rules,\u201d responding to complaints that her voluntary role gave her all of the access and perks of the White House \u2014 but none of the legal responsibilities or constraints.\n\n\u201cThroughout this process I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role,\u201d she said in a statement at the time.\n\nBut Trump continued to occasionally use her personal email in her official capacity, according to people familiar with the review.\n\nHer husband\u2019s use of personal email for government work drew intense scrutiny when it was first reported by Politico last fall. The revelation prompted demands from congressional investigators that Kushner preserve his records, which his attorney said he had. At the time, administration officials acknowledged to news organizations, including the New York Times and Politico, that Ivanka Trump had occasionally used a private account when she joined the White House.\n\n[Kushner used private email account for some White House business]\n\nBut Trump had used her personal email for official business far more frequently than known, according to people familiar with the administration\u2019s review \u2014 a fact that remained a closely held secret inside the White House.\n\n\u201cShe was the worst offender in the White House,\u201d said a former senior U.S. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics.\n\nAfter discovering the extent of her email use in September 2017, White House lawyers relied on Lowell, Ivanka Trump\u2019s attorney, to help review her personal emails to determine which were personal and which were official business, according to the people.\n\nThe White House Counsel\u2019s Office did not have access to her personal account and could not review it without invading her privacy and possibly violating privileged communications with her attorneys, people familiar with the review said.\n\nAfter his review, Lowell forwarded emails that he had determined were related to official business to Ivanka Trump\u2019s government account, a move he viewed as rectifying any violations of the records law, they said.\n\nLowell\u2019s review found fewer than 1,000 personal emails in which Trump shared her official schedule and travel plans with herself and her personal assistants, according to two people familiar with the review.\n\nSeparately, there were fewer than 100 emails in which Trump used her personal account to discuss official business with other administration officials.\n\nThe scope of her personal email use had not emerged in response to American Oversight\u2019s records request, which sought Trump\u2019s correspondence with Cabinet agencies in early 2017. Most internal White House communications are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed \u2014 although not entirely surprised \u2014 that this administration disregarded clear laws that they more than anyone should have been aware of,\u201d Evers said.\n\nIn many cases, government officials contacted Ivanka Trump first at her personal email address. That was the case with a note she received in April 2017 from Treasury Department official Dan Kowalski, who was seeking to set up a meeting between the president and the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group of which the United States is a member.\n\n\u201cI apologize for reaching out to you on your personal email for this, but it is the only email I have for you,\u201d he wrote, according to an email obtained by American Oversight.\n\n\u201cFor future reference my WH email is [redacted],\u201d Ivanka Trump replied. \u201cThanks for reaching out and making this introduction.\u201d\n\nBut other times, Trump used her private email to initiate official business.\n\nIn April 2017, she used her personal email to write to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s chief of staff, Eli Miller, suggesting that he connect with her chief of staff, Julie Radford.

The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Many Central American migrants camped in Tijuana after crossing Mexico in a caravan said Monday that a protest over the weekend by residents demanding they leave frightened them and left them even more anxious while they try to get into the United States.\n\nThe angry protests have been fed by concerns raised by President Donald Trump\u2019s month-long warnings that criminals and gang members are in the group and even terrorists, though there is no evidence of that.\n\nAbout 500 people demonstrated in an affluent section of Tijuana on Sunday against the caravan. Dozens of protesters then marched to an outdoor sports complex near downtown where 2,500 migrants are staying, sleeping on dirt fields and under bleachers after arriving at the border city a week ago.\n\nDulce Alvarado, 28, from Lempira, Honduras, said she was stepping out of a corner grocery near the stadium carrying her 2-year-old son when she was surrounded by the demonstrators chanting \u201cGet out!\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very scared,\u201d Alvarado said.\n\nA Tijuana police officer saw them in the crowd and helped them get out and behind police tape marking off the block where the sports complex is located. The protest eventually ended peacefully.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road \u2014 and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by the migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nFor most of this city of 1.6 million, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans is not noticeable. Most migrants stay within a three-block radius of the sports complex that faces the towering metal walls topped with barbed wire at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut many residents fear with the passage of time their presence will take its toll and crime could go up. Since 2016, thousands of Haitians who also tried to get to the U.S. ended up settling here, while at the same time, Tijuana has taken in thousands of Mexicans deported from the United States.\n\nTijuana also has been struggling with drug violence and some say they do not want the caravan bringing more problems.\n\nSandra Lucia Montanez, 28, a Tijuana psychologist, said news reports last month of Central Americans storming Mexico\u2019s southern border fed the fears. But, she said, it\u2019s important that Tijuana not forget it is a city of migrants.\n\n\u201cAlmost no one here is from Tijuana,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cWe have to help the neediest ones. They come from countries with a lot of poverty. Honduras is worse off than Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe United States has dramatically increased border security in preparation for the caravan\u2019s arrival, closing lanes at ports of entry to place cement barriers topped with razor wire that can be quickly moved to block passage should there be a mass number who try to force their way into the country.\n\nBut the lane closures have also made it harder for cross-border residents to go back and forth into the U.S. to work and shop. The San Ysidro port of entry is one of the world\u2019s busiest border crossings, with more than 40,000 vehicles and 34,000 pedestrians using it daily.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. authorities closed off northbound traffic for several hours and closed a pedestrian lane at the crossing to install new security barriers, after a tip that people were gathering in Tijuana to rush the border checkpoints.\n\n\u201cWaiting until a large group of persons mass at the border to attempt an illegal crossing is too late for us,\u201d said Pete Flores, director of field operations for Customs and Border Protection in San Diego.\n\nSome of the demonstrators at Sunday\u2019s protest complained that some migrants have been aggressive, yelling insults at U.S. Border Patrol agents and climbing walls and getting into fights at Tijuana\u2019s Pacific beach.\n\nBut Tijuana police officer Victor Coronel, who has overseen security outside the sports complex where the migrants are staying, said those fears are based on the bad behavior of only a handful of migrants.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that there has been bad information circulating on social media, with videos of two or three migrants acting badly, climbing the wall or grabbing food in stores,\u201d said Coronel, adding that most are poor people simply trying to find work.\n\nCoronel said he hopes as time passes, many will opt to go home or find jobs in Mexico and integrate into society.\n\nLesbia Navarro, 36, stayed inside the stadium with her four children ages 3 to 16 as they listened to the shouts and insults from the protesters Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe only want to be here awhile, until we can get into the United States to work,\u201d said Navarro, of Choloma, Honduras. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cause anybody problems.\u201d\n\nThe Tijuana protests came amid what may be a hardening of positions in some northern Mexican states against the migrants. In Jalisco state, which the caravan passed through on its way to Tijuana, officials said they would no longer open shelters, citing problems with fights involving migrants last week.\n\nInstead, the state will provide water, some food and escorts at nine points along the main highway through the state to help ensure the migrants don\u2019t have to stop.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims.\n\nGastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx \u2014 while more migrants continue to head to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor. He wrote that like Tijuana, \u201cthe U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \u201cCatch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nStevenson contributed from Mexico City.

It reopened with 10 of the port\u2019s 26 vehicle lanes closed.\n\nThe temporary closure was one of several measures the government has taken in recent days to \u201charden\u201d U.S. border crossings as thousands of Central American migrants in caravan groups arrive in Tijuana with the goal of entering the United States.\n\nOver the weekend, work crews decked out the border fence at the southern end of San Diego\u2019s Imperial Beach with billowing, 18-foot thickets of concertina wire, a sight President Trump celebrated in a tweet saying, in part, \u201cno climbers anymore under our Administration!\u201d In recent weeks, U.S. military personnel and construction crews have installed 12.3 miles of razor wire along the Mexico border, according to one Homeland Security official.\n\nThe fortifications are needed, border officials say, to ensure that large crowds do not attempt to force their way into the country.\n\n\u201cIn the early morning hours, CBP officials received reports of groups of persons from the caravan gathering in the city of Tijuana for a possible attempt or attempts to rush illegally through the port of entry instead of presenting themselves as required to a CBP officer,\u201d the agency said Monday in a statement.\n\n\u201cCBP officials suspended operations to safely place impediments at the port of entry that would restrict access to a large group attempting to run through the border crossing. After the CBP response at San Ysidro, no activity materialized at the border crossing,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPueblo Sin Fronteras, an activist group that is helping guide the caravan, rejected claims of plans to rush the border as a \u201cdeliberate attempt to mislead the public and demonize refugees.\u201d\n\nNearly 6,000 migrants have arrived in Tijuana so far, and 1,600 are in the city of Mexicali seeking to enter the United States, according to the latest Department of Homeland Security figures. In total, between 8,500 and 10,500 are traveling with the caravan groups, DHS officials said.\n\nMany of the migrants arriving in Tijuana say they are running for their lives from gang violence and criminality in Central America, particularly Honduras, and they plan to seek asylum in the United States.\n\n[At U.S. border, migrant caravan will slow to a crawl]\n\nU.S. officials have urged them to approach the ports of entry to make their claims, and Trump has decreed new restrictions on the ability of those who enter the United States illegally to apply for asylum. CBP officials say they are processing between 60 and 100 asylum seekers per day.\n\nBut with thousands of asylum seekers in Tijuana parked on a waiting list for the chance to approach the U.S. crossing and make a claim, it may be months before migrants arriving with the caravan get a chance.\n\nThat has U.S. officials worried about more-desperate attempts to cross, especially if large groups gather along the border and the situation turns hostile.\n\nThe top U.S. border official, Kevin McAleenan, was nearly struck by a rock when he approached the fence to speak with migrants late Friday, according to San Diego Border Patrol sector chief Rodney Scott.\n\n\u201cWhile conversing through the wall with people on the south side, someone threw a large rock at the Commissioner, narrowly missing him,\u201d Scott wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nDHS officials confirmed the incident Monday but said they do not know who threw the rock, which was about the size of a golf ball. McAleenan was unharmed.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that U.S. troops would treat rock-throwing as an armed attack, but he walked back those comments the next day and said soldiers would not open fire.\n\nSarah Kinosian in Tijuana and Maria Sacchetti in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump draws criticism for faulting war hero on bin Laden", "description": "President Donald Trump has ignited a firestorm of criticism and charges that he is politicizing the military by faulting a war hero for not capturing al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden sooner", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-draws-criticism-for-faulting-war-hero-on-bin-laden/2018/11/19/e88e077a-ec4e-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:00:29Z", "content": "WASHINGTON President Donald Trump has ignited a firestorm of criticism and charges that he is politicizing the military by faulting a war hero for not capturing al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden sooner.

He called Trump\u2019s remark \u201cpatently ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of how our military and intelligence agencies operate and undermines the president\u2019s own standing as commander-in-chief,\u201d Panetta said in a statement.\n\nThe controversy follows a pattern of concerns raised by former senior military officers about Trump\u2019s grasp of the military\u2019s role, including those who assert that his decision to send thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was a political stunt.\n\nTrump also drew criticism for his decision not to visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day last week, following his trip to Europe. He said later he \u201cshould have\u201d visited the cemetery but was too busy with official business.\n\nMcRaven told CNN he is a fan both of George W.

Whether this is true, I know not, but it is essentially what some 16 House Democrats want to do with Nancy Pelosi. Here the legend ends differently: She ain\u2019t going.\n\nWhy she should be denied another term as speaker of the House is not entirely clear. One of those who wants Pelosi out is Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), who promised her constituents that she would oppose Pelosi as speaker, expounding her reasoning in a Post op-ed. It came down to this: She had promised her constituents she would do so. This is a tautology, not fresh thinking.\n\nOh, Rice had other reasons. It\u2019s time for a change, she said. She used the hopeless word \u201chope.\u201d A new generation needed to rise. Pelosi is \u201cexceptionally experienced and knowledgeable,\u201d Rice wrote, but others could do the job. I diligently read to the end of the piece. Rice named no one.\n\nThere are commanding institutional reasons why it is just plain dumb to dump Pelosi at this point. Such a move would push the House into chaos, which most Americans might think is just another word for the status quo, but it is not. Pelosi in the past has been an effective leader. The proof of that is the constant use by her opponents of the word \u201cretribution.\u201d If you strike at her and fail, you will be punished. This is how the House works when it works. This is how politics works.\n\nI have a soft spot in my heart for Pelosi for three reasons. The first is that the ongoing pillorying of her is firmly rooted in sexism. A man would never have become the GOP\u2019s perennial boogeyman (boogeyperson?). Longtime speakers become adorable icons. Tip O\u2019Neill (D-Mass.), who said Ronald Reagan \u201cknows less than any president I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d nevertheless got along famously with him, the two of them wallowing in Irish kitsch. The storied \u201cMister Sam\u201d \u2014 Sam Rayburn (D) of Texas \u2014 served three times as speaker between 1940 and 1961 and escaped vilification. Lyndon B. Johnson used to kiss his bald pate.\n\nSecond, Pelosi represents San Francisco. Like New York, it has long been caricatured as the capital of un-American ideas and lifestyles. (There is no analogous city for conservatives \u2014 Tulsa? Lubbock, Tex.?) San Francisco was first disparaged in this way by Jeane Kirkpatrick at the 1984 Republican National Convention. She used the refrain \u201cSan Francisco Democrats\u201d not merely because the party had recently held its convention there, but also because the City by the Bay had come to represent gaudy non-conformity \u2014 drug usage, free love and some pretty wonderful music. Kirkpatrick, who was Reagan\u2019s U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, could not easily be envisioned with a bong.\n\nThird, Pelosi is a pure politician. It\u2019s her life\u2019s blood \u2014 literally. Her father was the mayor of Baltimore. Her brother was the mayor of Baltimore. They were both named Thomas \u2014 Big Tommy and Little Tommy, as they were known on the street. Baltimore, where I trespassed for The Post, was partly in the South, partly in the North, totally in the Democratic Party and a feast for a political reporter. It had clubs and alliances and curious folkways, such as the distribution of \u201cwalking-around money\u201d on Election Day. Baltimore\u2019s politics were shady and colorfully corrupt, but they taught the virtues of close contact, counting votes and the unassailable importance of loyalty.\n\nThe Democratic leadership of the House is old. Pelosi is 78, her No. 2, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, is 79, and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking member, is the same age as Pelosi. The optics are poor, downright unappealing to some. This is a problem, and it is more of one because Pelosi is not only old, she is a woman. Years of incessant misogynistic attacks have fabricated Pelosi into a political version of some sort of Shakespearean crone. It\u2019s appalling that some Democrats now give it credence.\n\nThat Rice felt obliged to essentially validate Republican slander and promise her Long Island constituents that she would oppose Pelosi speaks volumes about Rice and nothing at all about Pelosi. She has been a remarkably effective fundraiser and legislator who, among other things, salvaged Barack Obama\u2019s reluctantly named Obamacare. Without her, it never would have become law.\n\nInstead of genuflecting to Pelosi\u2019s sad polls, it would have been downright bracing for Pelosi\u2019s House critics to have stood up for her. The critics, not Pelosi, deserve the political ice floe.\n\nBon voyage.\n\nRead more from Richard Cohen\u2019s archive."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Erik Wemple", "title": "White House bails on Acosta fight but lays down rules for further credential revocations", "description": "CNN secures victory with full restoration of Jim Acosta's hard pass, but there's a price to pay.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/19/white-house-bails-on-acosta-fight-but-lays-down-rules-for-further-credential-revocations/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wh82rhWHgK7g5lsNNS7h9myE098=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2JFTVEPBRY7ILNRJYU4JGNBR2A.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:46:18Z", "content": "On the surface, a new letter from the White House in laffaire Jim Acosta appears to be a belly flop.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nMedia critic\n\nOn the surface, a new letter from the White House in l\u2019affaire Jim Acosta appears to be a belly flop. After first yanking the hard pass of the CNN correspondent on Nov. 7, the White House has contested a CNN lawsuit seeking the pass\u2019s restoration. When a federal judge last Friday granted a CNN request for temporary restoration of the pass, the White House constructed a magical deliberative process, citing a \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d to revoke the credential.\n\nAnd then, on Monday, the White House gave up on the Acosta fight. \u201cWe have made a final determination in this process: your hard pass is restored,\u201d reads the letter, which notes that the final decision took into account an appeal written by CNN lawyers over the weekend. Now CNN can drop its litigation: \u201cToday the White House fully restored Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary. We look forward to continuing to cover the White House,\u201d reads a statement from the company.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that Washington will return to the status quo. As part of its letter informing Acosta that he\u2019s free to enter the White House grounds, the White House articulated a set of rules for conduct in future press conferences:\n\nPer White House letter to Acosta on Nov. 19, here are the new rules for press conferences at the White House. pic.twitter.com/a6C2pmLv2K \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) November 19, 2018\n\nIs that it? First there were the Jordan Rules; now there are the Acosta Rules. These stipulations appear reverse-engineered from the situation that took place at Trump\u2019s post-midterm news conference on Nov. 7, at which Acosta pushed the president on immigration and ill-advisedly declined to surrender the microphone when a White House intern attempted to re-possess it. The rules appear to codify to some degree the way things have always worked. In the increasingly rare and brief press appearances by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, reporters often get two questions but are sometimes limited to one. This policy sets the default to the bare minimum.\n\nSo basically - ask two questions and get banned from the White House? https://t.co/SGjien9MCP \u2014 Damon Kiesow (@dkiesow) November 19, 2018\n\nThe White House\u2019s letter to Acosta did address the difficulty of expanding beyond this sphere: \u201cA press conference is not a mechanical exercise. We are likewise mindful that a more elaborate set of rules might be devised, including, for example, specific provisions for journalist conduct in the open (non-press room) areas of the White House and for Air Force One. At this time, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places.\u201d\n\nAnother reading: We have decided not to frame additional rules because we are certain that our own boss violates them with abandon.\n\nWhatever: The result of the Acosta dispute is a new set of rules promulgated by a White House that brags about the elimination of red tape and regulations of all stripes. Apparently, new regulations are okay when the target is the media. As the CNN litigation against the White House emphasized, there were really no existing guidelines or standards for press-pass revocation at the White House, largely because White Houses generally don\u2019t do this sort of thing. That has changed.\n\nA norm has fallen, giving way to pitiful little rules. Will reporters run afoul of these new rules? Will they ask two questions when they\u2019re allotted only one? Such technicalities may be beside the point: Reporters will be thinking about those rules and the hassles that come along with violating them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Paul Waldman", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/11/19/happy-hour-roundup-1486/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IY1kaEIdSabnMvY0xqqjnbb8MLQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WCIMGYDUTI4C3KD7NGO7ZRLE5Q.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:41:17Z", "content": "* Mike DeBonis has the latest from the Democratic leadership fight : Sixteen dissident Democrats said Monday that they will vote to deny Rep.

And with Dutch soccer at club level also in strife, debate swirled as to how one of the long-time heavyweights of the world game could recover.\n\nUnder Koeman, though, the future of the Oranje looks bright. Youngsters like center midfielder Frenkie de Jong and center back Matthijs de Ligt are regarded as two of the most promising players in the world; Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum have returned to their best form over the last 18 months; and, in Van Dijk, the Netherlands has one of the best defenders around.\n\nA rock for Liverpool this season and last, Van Dijk \u2014 soccer\u2019s most expensive defender following his $99 million move from Southampton in January \u2014 sidefooted in a cross from the left to follow up an 84th-minute goal from Quincy Promes that gave the Dutch a glimmer of hope in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThe Germans had gone 2-0 up after 19 minutes thanks to Timo Werner\u2019s dipping shot from 25 meters and Leroy Sane\u2019s deflected effort from just inside the area. They couldn\u2019t hold on, though, and finished group play with no wins, just two points, and in something of a crisis.\n\nThey didn\u2019t get out of their group in Russia in a dismal defense of their World Cup title, while relegation to League B of the Nations League \u2014 featuring Europe\u2019s second-tier teams \u2014 had already been confirmed after failing to win any of their first three group games.\n\nGermany coach Joachim Loew opted to stay in the job after the World Cup, but is now under mounting pressure.\n\nThe Nations League, a new competition devised by UEFA to replace unpopular international friendlies with competitive matches between teams of a similar level, appears to have won over the skeptics, and the lineup for the Final Four is intriguing if hardly a marketer\u2019s dream.\n\nPortugal, which will be playing on home soil, has a superstar in Cristiano Ronaldo who should be back in the team after an extended absence from international soccer since the World Cup.\n\nEngland has Harry Kane, the top scorer at the World Cup, and a talented, dynamic group of young players under forward-thinking coach Gareth Southgate.\n\nSwitzerland, which hasn\u2019t reached a quarterfinal of an international tournament since 1954, will be the outsider.\n\nThe Netherlands, at No. 15, will be the lowest-ranked team in the competition but should not be discounted. This victory came three days after the team produced one of its best performances in years to beat France 2-0, while it beat Portugal 3-0 in March and Germany by the same score at home in the Nations League.\n\nThe draw for the Final Four, which comprises of two semifinals and then a third-place playoff and final, will take place in Dublin on Dec. 3.\n\nSome other loose ends were tied up in the Nations League, which offers teams a second chance to qualify for the European Championship in 2020.\n\nThe 16 group winners in Leagues A, B, C and D \u2014 or the next best-placed teams who have not already qualified via the European qualifiers starting in March \u2014 will progress to the Nations League playoffs and compete for the last four qualifying places for Euro 2020.\n\nNORWAY, MACEDONIA PROMOTED\n\nNorway was promoted to the second-tier League B after finishing top of Group C3 with a 2-0 win at Cyprus. The Norwegians started the final round of group play tied for points with Bulgaria, which could only draw at home to Slovenia 1-1.\n\nMacedonia went up to League C after beating Gibraltar 4-0 to top Group D4. Armenia, the only team that could have finished above Macedonia, ended up second after drawing at Liechtenstein 2-2.\n\nSLOVAKIA RELEGATED\n\nSlovakia was relegated to League C after losing at neighbor Czech Republic 1-0, with Patrik Schick scoring the winner in the first half with a deft lob over the goalkeeper on a counterattack.\n\nDenmark was already guaranteed promotion to the top tier and Ireland was sure of being relegated before they drew 0-0 in Aarhus.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ex-Cuyahoga County judge Lance Mason, Fraser\u2019s former husband, was taken into custody, police said.\n\nShaker Heights Police Cmdr. John Cole said Monday morning that the department is \u201canticipating charges later today\u201d against Mason, though he was unable to offer additional information. Details about Fraser\u2019s killing were also not immediately available; however, Cleveland.com reported that she was fatally stabbed.\n\n\n\nAisha Fraser (Shaker Heights Schools)\n\nIn a 911 call obtained by NBC affiliate WKYC, a woman who identifies herself as Mason\u2019s sister tells a dispatcher that Mason admitted to stabbing his ex-wife.\n\n\u201cI need the police immediately, my brother is attacking his ex-wife,\u201d the woman says, adding that the incident took place outside a home. \u201cHe stabbed her, and he says she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nWhile trying to flee the scene Saturday, Mason drove an SUV into a police cruiser, causing \u201cserious injuries\u201d to a police officer\u2019s lower legs and ribs, according to Cleveland.com. Mason then tried to escape on foot and was arrested. Police charged him with felonious assault in the collision that injured the officer.\n\nBoth Mason and the police officer were treated at a hospital.\n\nMason pleaded guilty in 2015 to attempted felonious assault and domestic violence after punching Fraser 20 times and slamming her head against the dashboard of a car five times in 2014 \u2014 an attack so violent that it required her to receive facial reconstructive surgery, WKYC reported. Mason, still a judge at the time, was removed from the bench and released from prison after serving nine months of a two-year sentence.\n\nTheir two children, then ages 4 and 6, were in the car when the assault took place, according to Cleveland.com. Fraser filed for divorce two days after the incident, though the case is pending. She also sued Mason in civil court and was awarded $150,000.\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com, Mason wrote in a letter to Fraser as part of his petition for early release that he had \u201cfailed as a husband, father, and a man.\u201d The letter also said, \u201cInstead of loving, protecting and providing for you and our daughters, I have provided a terrible example, and exposed you to rage and violence.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Saturday evening after Fraser\u2019s slaying, the city of Cleveland acknowledged that it was aware of Mason\u2019s arrest. It added that Mason, who worked for the city as a minority-business development administrator, had been terminated \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n\nMason is also a former member of the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\"I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Ms. Aisha Fraser, especially to her children,\u201d Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson said in the statement. WKYC reports that Jackson hired Mason to his role in 2017.\n\nFraser\u2019s killing has sent shock waves through the Shaker Heights community as it mourns the loss of an instructor who worked in the school system for more than 16 years. She taught at Woodbury Elementary School at the time of her death, and her two children \u2014 now 11 and 8 \u2014 were students in the school system.\n\nJohn Morris, president of the Shaker Heights Teachers' Association, said in an interview Monday that Fraser\u2019s killing has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for the city.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more difficult circumstance,\u201d he said, emphasizing the impact on the two young children she leaves behind.\n\nMorris noted that the Shaker Heights community backed Fraser as she overcame the 2014 assault and eventually helped her return to teaching.\n\n\u201cAisha grew up in Shaker, she was a \u201991 graduate, we had survived with her in 2014 and 2015 when the first incident happened,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone saw her recover and saw her thrive the last few years; to see this happen tore the hearts out of all of us.\u201d\n\nWoodbury Elementary was already closed Monday and Tuesday to hold professional learning days for teachers, said Scott Stephens, spokesman for Shaker Heights schools. Now, all district buildings will be closed on those days to offer grief counseling for staff, students and their families.\n\n\u201cIt touches so many people in so many ways, and her life was really a testament to the difference a teacher and an individual can make in the lives of others,\u201d Stephens said in an interview Monday. \u201cShe was an extraordinarily talented educator, and wonderful mother, neighbor and friend to so many.\u201d\n\n\n\nA photo of Aisha Fraser and several of her former students, posted to the Shaker Heights Teachers' Association Facebook page.\n\nMorris said Fraser worked diligently to maintain a family environment for her students, especially those with special needs. He added that her consistency and compassion made her a calming presence for everyone she knew.\n\n\u201cWhen you came into her classroom or saw her in the building, she was never the loudest teacher, but she played this consistent role in her students' lives; she became a touch point,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that she had an infectious smile and a hearty laugh that reverberated from the bottom of her soul.\n\n\u201cShe was one of those people that brings light with them,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what Monday\u2019s going to be like for her kids coming back to the classroom without her.\u201d\n\nStephens said additional counseling will be offered for Fraser\u2019s students when they return from Thanksgiving break. A substitute teacher with whom her students are familiar will take over the class, he added.

(Martin Meissner/Associated Press)\n\nGELSENKIRCHEN, Germany \u2014 A dramatic comeback sent the Netherlands to the UEFA Nations League finals after ending Germany\u2019s nightmare year with yet more disappointment in a 2-2 draw on Monday.\n\nThe comeback meant the Dutch \u2014 who missed the last European Championship and World Cup \u2014 qualified ahead of world champion France to join England, Switzerland, and Portugal in next year\u2019s inaugural Final Four.\n\nAt 2-0 down to Germany in the 85th minute, Dutch hopes of reaching the Nations League finals looked long gone.\n\nBut Quincy Promes curled a shot past Manuel Neuer, and defender Virgil van Dijk \u2014 playing as a makeshift striker \u2014 volleyed in a second for the point the Netherlands needed. For all the talk of their young players, the Netherlands\u2019 more experienced personnel made the difference.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for two consecutive major tournaments, the Netherlands was widely considered the favorite for relegation in the Nations League when drawn against Germany and France in January.\n\nWith Ronald Koeman in his first year as coach and Ajax\u2019s Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie de Jong giving the team a shot of youthful energy, the Netherlands\u2019 campaign proved it once again belonged with the continent\u2019s big names. At home, the Dutch beat Germany 3-0 and new world champion France 2-0, but struggled to maintain the same form away until the last five minutes of Monday\u2019s game.\n\nGermany had already been relegated to League B, capping a year coach Joachim Loew called \u201ca slap in the face\u201d after a group-stage exit at the World Cup. Some in the stands called for Loew to step down after 12 years in charge, though his team dominated most of the game against the Dutch before the sudden late collapse.\n\nThe Germans showed sublime skill for Timo Werner\u2019s ninth-minute opening goal, Serge Gnabry flicking the ball for the striker to head on before unleashing a powerful low shot from long range.\n\nOne of the Netherlands\u2019 much-heralded young talents, defender de Ligt, was at fault for the second goal. Faced with Leroy Sane struggling to control the ball, de Ligt mistimed his challenged entirely, leaving Sane to hit a shot which took a deflection off Kenny Tete.\n\nGermany couldn\u2019t find a third goal to finish off the Netherlands, though Gnabry went close with a header in the 40th and Werner dragged a shot wide in the 63rd.\n\nThe Dutch sprang to life in the dying minutes.\n\nIn the 85th, Germany failed to clear the ball and ignored Promes lurking on the edge of the penalty area. When the ball finally reached him, he had plenty of time to send a curling shot to the top-right corner past Neuer\u2019s outstretched arm.\n\nWith nothing to lose, defender and captain Van Dijk went up front as a makeshift forward, using his height and strength in the buildup to his dramatic leveler. Tonny Vilhena picked up the ball on the right flank and sent in a cross which glanced off a German head for Van Dijk to volley past the exasperated Neuer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In another alleged example, the court said, Charter\u2019s senior executive in charge of programming, Allan Singer, approached a group of black protesters outside Charter\u2019s offices to tell them to \u201cget off of welfare.\"\n\nCharter told the court that its decision not to carry Entertainment Studios was not related to race but rather other factors, such as that the company lacked operational resources.\n\nThe court sided with Entertainment Studios, citing arguments that Charter had negotiated or struck lucrative agreements with white-owned companies even as the black-owned company was denied the same opportunities.\n\n\u201cCorporate red tape, inconsistent decision-making among network leadership, and even boorish executives are not themselves necessarily indicative of discrimination,\u201d the court said. But Charter had not done enough to prove that racial bias played no role in its decision-making \u2014 only that it was not the most important factor, the court said. For Charter to win the motion to dismiss, the judges said, the company\u2019s explanation would have had to render Entertainment Studios\u2019 allegations implausible.\n\nWithout addressing the substance of the dueling claims, the court said, Entertainment Studios received the benefit of the doubt.\n\nCharter\u2019s next steps in the legal battle are unclear. But in a statement on the decision, the company vowed to continue fighting, calling Entertainment Studios' lawsuit \u201ca desperate tactic that this programmer has used before\u201d and promising to \u201cvigorously defend ourselves against these claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese decisions are hugely important in terms of opening the courts to African American-owned media,\u201d said Skip Miller, an attorney for Entertainment Studios.\n\nAs part of its defense, Charter had told the court that by choosing which channels to carry, the company was engaging in a form of editorial discretion protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, it said, the court would have to use a stricter standard to evaluate Entertainment Studios\u2019 claim of a legal violation \u2014 a standard that might result in the claim being rejected.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit said otherwise, saying that just because Charter engages in corporate speech when it selects which channels to carry does not \u201cautomatically\u201d require the court to use the tougher standard.\n\nConsumer groups hailed the court\u2019s move, saying it is a necessary check on industries that have cited corporate speech as a reason to eliminate regulation.\n\n\u201cIn a time when the First Amendment is often \u2018weaponized\u2019 to serve the business interests of large corporations instead of furthering free expression, this is a welcome decision,\u201d said the advocacy organization Public Knowledge, which noted that telecom and cable groups have supported a lawsuit that argued the federal government had infringed on Internet providers' free speech rights when it approved tough net neutrality rules in 2015."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump administration officials suggested sharing census responses with law enforcement, court documents show - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trump administration officials suggested sharing census responses with law enforcement, court documents show Washington Post Trump administration officials have discussed ways to circumvent the confidentiality of census responses, according to\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/trump-administration-officials-suggested-sharing-census-responses-with-law-enforcement-court-documents-show/2018/11/19/41679018-ec46-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:45:05Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Trump administration officials have privately discussed the possibility that in the future census information could be shared with law enforcement, according to documents filed in a legal challenge over plans for a new citizenship question on the 2020 survey.\n\nThe subject came up after a Democratic lawmaker asked whether responses to the survey could ever be shared with law enforcement agencies, something that has been strictly illegal according to federal law governing the census.\n\nAfter a congressional hearing in May about the citizenship question, Rep.

Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the main authors of the legislation that would overhaul U.S. sentencing laws, responded pointedly to criticism from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), the loudest opponent of the bill on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI highly respect my colleague from Arkansas but everything in his tweet and this thread is 100% Fake News,\u201d Lee tweeted Monday, referring to a thread of tweets from Cotton in which he asserted that the bill would prematurely release violent criminals from prison.\n\nCotton had protested that there had been no hearings on the legislation and speculated that the bill\u2019s proponents were afraid of letting the measure come under public scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018final\u2019 text of the FIRST STEP Act was only released yesterday, and details seem to continue to change,\u201d Cotton tweeted Saturday. \u201cIf it\u2019s finalized & ready for a vote, why offer to keep changing it?\u201d\n\nIn his rebuttal Monday, Lee noted that the final version of the criminal justice overhaul is a combination of legislation that has already passed the House and a similar bill that the Senate Judiciary Committee cleared earlier this year. He also emphasized that the legislation encourages prisoner rehabilitation and that the Bureau of Prisons ultimately has authority over who would qualify for early release.\n\n\u201cThese are not new policies,\u201d Lee tweeted. \u201cSecond, and more importantly, the First Step Act does not \u2018give early release\u2019 to anyone.

Eligible prisoners \u2014 including those who assault law enforcement officers with deadly weapons \u2014 earn new \u2018time credits\u2019 for \u2018pre-release custody or supervised release,\u2019 which is why sheriffs call this dangerous.\u201d\n\nDoug Stafford \u2014 the chief strategist for Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), another prominent GOP supporter of the bill \u2014 responded via Twitter to Lee: \u201cI don\u2019t respect people who deliberately lie about your bill.\u201d\n\nThe angry exchanges came as supporters quietly began rounding up backing for the popular measure that nonetheless faces an uncertain future in the coming weeks.\n\nThe bill, formally introduced Thursday evening, would make a number of significant changes to sentencing laws \u2014 revisions that were not included in the House bill and are significantly more controversial with Republicans.\n\nFor example, it would lower mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, including reducing the \u201cthree strikes\u201d penalty from life behind bars to 25 years. The agreement also lets judges take advantage of \u201csafety valves\u201d \u2014 which allow them to issue sentences shorter than mandatory minimums for low-level crimes \u2014 in more types of cases.\n\nThe bill\u2019s backers are now whipping support for it, hoping to show Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the legislation has more than enough votes to pass the Senate. But McConnell has been publicly and privately skeptical about the bill\u2019s prospects, telling Trump in a private White House meeting late last week that it was unlikely to pass before the end of this calendar year."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.farhi", "title": "CNN drops suit against White House after Acosta's press pass is fully restored - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post CNN drops suit against White House after Acosta's press pass is fully restored Washington Post CNN dropped its lawsuit against the White House on Monday after officials told the network that they would restore reporter Jim Acosta's press crede\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnn-drops-suit-against-white-house-after-acostas-press-pass-is-fully-restored/2018/11/19/519763fc-ec3a-11e8-8679-934a2b33be52_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4II-aNGYJU6ihRTnbsp6fJbW5nY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLPKBQXMHUI6RFWUBUR7FKVNBE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:24:12Z", "content": "CNN dropped its lawsuit against the White House on Monday after officials told the network that they would restore reporter Jim Acostas press credentials as long as he abides by a series of new rules at presidential news conferences, including asking just one\u2026 [+6492 chars]", "fulltext": "CNN dropped its lawsuit against the White House on Monday after officials told the network that they would restore reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press credentials as long as he abides by a series of new rules at presidential news conferences, including asking just one question at a time.\n\n\u201cToday the White House fully restored Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary.

White House officials had suspended Acosta\u2019s White House press pass following a contentious news conference on Nov. 7, prompting CNN to sue last week to force the administration to return it.\n\nJust three days ago, press secretary Sarah Sanders and deputy chief of staff Bill Shine told Acosta and CNN that they would suspend his press pass again once a temporary restraining order against such an action expired. The 14-day order was issued by a judge Friday and was due to expire at the end of the month.\n\nCNN went to court seeking to block that action, and on Monday the White House seemed to back down.\n\nSanders and Shine said they had made a \u201cfinal determination\u201d that Acosta\u2019s pass would be restored permanently as long as he followed new rules guiding reporters\u2019 conduct at White House news conferences.\n\n\n\nCNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta.

Acosta, however, was banned from the White House after he asked multiple questions of President Trump at the Nov. 7 news conference and briefly tangled with a White House press aide who sought to take a microphone from his hand.\n\nThe revocation precipitated a brief but colorful legal crossfire between CNN and the White House over the past 12 days.\n\nCNN first fought back against the White House\u2019s \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension of Acosta, winning a temporary restraining order (TRO) Friday that gave Acosta a reprieve for two weeks.\n\nThen it objected to the White House\u2019s fallback position \u2014 that it would take the pass away once the TRO expired. CNN\u2019s attorney, Theodore Boutrous, told the court that such an action amounted to \u201cretroactive due process.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the White House was attempting to impose \u201cvague, unarticulated standards\u201d retroactively in violation of the court\u2019s finding Friday that Acosta wasn\u2019t given due process by the White House when it revoked his pass.\n\nCNN had been seeking a preliminary injunction that would prevent the White House from suspending Acosta\u2019s pass until its lawsuit was resolved.\n\nThe tide seemed to turn in CNN\u2019s favor Friday. In a ruling seen as a victory for press freedom, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly \u2014 appointed by Trump \u2014 ordered the White House to temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s press pass while he considers the merits of the case and the possibility of a permanent order.\n\nHe said the White House has an obligation to afford due process to Acosta before it can revoke or suspend his access, and found that the White House\u2019s decision-making process in this case was \u201cso shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me . . . who made the decision.\u201d\n\nTrump said Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting,\u201d but no particular new rules had been publicly issued.

Sanders subsequently said Acosta\u2019s pass was revoked because Acosta attempted to \u201cmonopolize the floor\u201d at the news conference.\n\nIn defending the White House\u2019s decision, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was not an infringement on the First Amendment because the network had other White House reporters who are \u201cmore than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN\u2019s behalf,\u201d and Acosta could still \u201cpractice his profession and report on the White House\u201d \u2014 just not at the White House.\n\nKelly found that a reporter\u2019s \u201cFirst Amendment liberty interest in a White House press pass\u201d is protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due-process guarantees.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh, File)\n\nThe Washington Redskins have signed veteran quarterback Mark Sanchez to back up Colt McCoy, Coach Jay Gruden confirmed Monday. The team decided on Sanchez after working out several free agent passers, a day after starting quarterback Alex Smith was lost for the season to two broken bones in his lower right leg during a 23-21 loss to the Houston Texans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s won some playoff games, has got a lot of experience,\u201d Gruden said of Sanchez. \u201cI think this time of the year you need somebody who\u2019s taken some meaningful snaps with a lot of experience, and Mark\u2019s done that.\u201d\n\n[Alex Smith will miss rest of season after breaking leg in loss to Texans]\n\nMcCoy came on in relief of Smith on Sunday and nearly led a comeback victory. He had been the only quarterback on the roster other than Smith, meaning the team had to search for one in free agency to back him up. The Redskins settled on Sanchez, who has experience with several coaches on staff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to have a lot of experience with our terminology . . . but he does bring a veteran presence to the locker room and the quarterback room, which is important,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf he\u2019s thrust into action with the experience that he has, he can perform. It\u2019ll be difficult with only a couple days of walk-through, but we\u2019ll give him a package of plays that he can handle and function with, and hopefully that won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year old Sanchez last played in 2016 as a member of the Dallas Cowboys, and signed a one-year deal in 2017 with the Chicago Bears but never appeared in a game. He was a four-year starter for the Jets after being selected with the fifth overall pick in 2009.\n\nIn his first three seasons with the Jets, Sanchez had Matt Cavanaugh, now the Redskins' offensive coordinator, as his quarterbacks coach. He also played with Washington\u2019s passing game coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell, and offensive line coach and assistant head coach Bill Callahan held the same positions with the Jets from 2008 to 2011.\n\nGruden said Sunday the team preferred to sign someone who had a previous relationship with members of the coaching staff. The team also worked out EJ Manuel. T.J. Yates, Kellen Clemens and Josh Johnson.\n\n\u201cHe threw the ball good,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cMark\u2019s always been able to spin it. He was a top-10 pick in the NFL draft because he had a very nice arm, smooth release. So he\u2019s always going to throw the ball good in those settings. The other quarterbacks threw it pretty well, also, but we just chose Mark based on history and his ability to probably learn this faster.\u201d\n\n[As Colt McCoy takes over as starting QB, he tells Redskins, \u2018You\u2019re in good hands with me\u2019]\n\nSanchez\u2019s best season came in 2010 when he threw for 3,474 yards, 26 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. The Jets went to the playoffs his first two seasons, earning records of 9-7 and 11-5 record en route to back-to-back AFC championship game appearances (both losses). Interceptions were a recurring issue for Sanchez with the Jets, as he threw 69 interceptions and 68 touchdowns in four seasons.\n\nIn college, Sanchez led USC to a 12-1 record in 2008 and a Rose Bowl victory, but his most well-known NFL moment may be the infamous \u201cbutt fumble\u201d play against the New England Patriots on Thanksgiving 2012. Sanchez ran into the back of a teammate and fumbled, which the Patriots picked up and returned for a touchdown in a 49-19 loss. The play grew to symbolize the dysfunction surrounding Sanchez\u2019s tenure and the Jets organization overall.\n\nSanchez signed a one-year deal to be the third quarterback for the Bears in 2017 but was inactive for all 16 games. This April he was hit with a four-game suspension after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, but he tweeted that the test was the result of \u201cunknowing supplement contamination, not the use of performance enhancing substances.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins are attempting to hold onto first place in the NFC East despite the loss of Smith. The team jumped out to a 6-3 start behind a stout defense, a strong running game and Smith\u2019s efficient leadership of a ball-control offense. The loss to the Texans dropped the Redskins to 6-4 and set up an NFC East showdown between Washington and Dallas on Thanksgiving with first place on the line. The Cowboys, 5-5, can create a tie atop the division with a victory.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\n\u2018Say your prayers and get ready for the next play\u2019: Alex Smith injury shows game\u2019s dark side comes in a blink\n\nAlex Smith wasn\u2019t carrying the Redskins.

But, right on cue, some \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats are already warning against an overly aggressive approach to investigating the Trump administration.\n\nPolitico reports that there is a \u201ctension\u201d between \u201ccautious Democrats\u201d on one side, and \u201cthose who want to train their subpoena firepower at the White House\u201d on the other. This battle is supposedly unfolding between \u201cestablishment veterans\u201d and \u201cprogressives out for revenge\u201d against Trump:\n\nWhile much of the base wants lawmakers to take on [President] Trump . . . more moderate members fear that oversight investigations will be a distraction or cause political blowback for the party. They want to see a policy focus instead and don\u2019t want to be pulled too far to the left.\n\nIt is not clear to me how widespread this worry is. But, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume we are likely to see many more such concern-troll-like warnings.\n\nSo here is our contribution to this debate: Shut up and stop wringing your hands, \u201ccautious Democrats.\u201d This whole fear appears to be based on the notion that Democrats face some sort of zero-sum choice between investigating Trump on the one hand, and focusing investigative authority on policy and governing on the other.\n\nBut this distinction is largely an invention. It\u2019s a false choice. In multiple important ways, examining policy and governing is investigating Trump. Such oversight would be brought to bear on the administration\u2019s biggest governing fiascoes and abuses \u2014 which are themselves conspicuous outgrowths of Trump\u2019s own bad-faith rationales for his most egregious policy failures and his own abuses of power for corrupt ends. Oversight of the former is tantamount to shining a light on the latter.\n\nTake Trump\u2019s tax returns. It is true that any effort by Democrats to get them could yield fodder that damages the president politically. But such an effort would also be about determining whether there is additional self-dealing or financial conflicts of interest on Trump\u2019s part that we don\u2019t yet know about, and those things would implicate administration policy choices. Thus, shaking loose Trump\u2019s tax returns would constitute shining a light on governing abuses or potential corruption.\n\nOr take the investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have vowed to investigate topics such as Russian money laundering and the possible overlap with Trump\u2019s finances. Yes, these things could potentially harm Trump politically. But as Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), the incoming committee chairman, has noted, this would be all about determining whether Russia is in a position to \u201cinfluence U.S. policy in a way that is against our national interest.\u201d Here again, investigating Trump is investigating administration policy and what\u2019s influencing it.\n\nMore broadly, in redirecting the committee towards Trump and questions involving Russia, Democrats will be ending the Republicans\u2019 use of the committee to run a harassment campaign directed at the Mueller inquiry. This is, itself, an act of restoring a legitimate governing process to replace a thoroughly corrupt one.\n\nThen there are the ways House Democrats might pass legislation in a manner that fills the vacuum left by the GOP\u2019s abdication of its oversight role. In a memo to House Democrats, the liberal Center for American Progress recommended that they do the following in the majority:\n\nWe strongly urge Congress to pass a law requiring all candidates for federal office, beginning in 2020, to disclose their tax returns. It is similarly critical that Congress pass legislation requiring independent judicial review of any firing of a special counsel appointed by the [Justice Department], thereby preserving their independence from an elected leader seeking to improperly stifle an inquiry into their own (or their friend\u2019s or family\u2019s) affairs.\n\nThese measures would, of course, be directed at Trump. But (while they would not become law) they are also about setting forth a commitment to transparency and legitimate process when it comes to \u2014 say it with me \u2014 governing.\n\nOr take immigration. Democrats might investigate the processes behind the thinly-veiled Muslim ban, the dramatic cuts to refugee levels or the family-separations policy (particularly if Trump restarts the last in some form). In all these cases, both governing abuses and Trump\u2019s particular pathologies would be scrutinized. Examining their implementation would also shine a light on the deep saturation of bad faith at their core, which has included ignoring Homeland Security studies blowing up the travel ban\u2019s rationale, deep-sixing administration data showing refugees are a net economic positive, and shrugging at warnings that separations could traumatize children \u2014 all to carry out Trump\u2019s determination to implement a white-nationalist agenda.\n\nWill there be cases in which Democrats are at odds over what to investigate and how? Of course. There are already disagreements among Democrats on the Financial Services Committee over how vigorously to police Wall Street, and over whether to prioritize Trump\u2019s finances over passing policy. But these types of disagreements are to be expected, given how eager Democrats are to get back into the majority and flex their authority, and given the backlog created by Republican abdication. Sorting these arguments out is the stuff of governing.\n\nAre there scenarios in which Democrats might pull a Benghazi and overreach in dramatic fashion, embarrassing themselves and activating voter sympathy for Trump? Sure, but it seems unlikely. On impeachment, as Brian Beutler points out, if anything, House Democrats have erred on the side of foreclosing this option for themselves regardless of what vigorous oversight (or the Mueller investigation) ends up revealing. And Trump is not Bill Clinton. Majorities already believe the Mueller investigation is examining legitimate matters, and believe that Trump has tried to interfere with the inquiry and has lied about it. Americans just voted in Democrats to act as the very check that Trump has resisted at all costs.\n\nIf Democrats focus their oversight authority on serious abuses of power, governing fiascoes and corruption \u2014 and stick to where the facts lead \u2014 they\u2019ll be, yes, investigating Trump, while also standing for a restoration of transparency, accountability, legitimate governance and the rule of law. There\u2019s no need to allow this to get hyped into a false choice or a cause for hand-wringing, Democrats."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "A critical lawsuit over the acting attorney general", "description": "The Senate has been emasculated", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/19/another-critical-lawsuit/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kHKzKT2ZMFRUSzE8RgtxKAhQ42E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NH6DLDOJJYZTNHVMOMBEDV6R4Y.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:00:41Z", "content": "Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan legal group that has dogged President Trump on constitutional issues and violations of democratic norms for two years, filed yet another suit on Monday against the Trump administration.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nProtect Democracy, a nonpartisan legal group that has dogged President Trump on constitutional issues and violations of democratic norms for two years, filed yet another suit on Monday against the Trump administration. In conjunction with the Constitutional Accountability Center and on behalf of Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Protect Democracy is challenging the appointment of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker. In a news release the group explains:\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal government officials, including the Attorney General, before they exercise the duties of the office. The Framers included this requirement to ensure that senior administration officials receive scrutiny by the American people\u2019s representatives in Congress. The Appointments Clause is also meant to prevent the President, in the words of Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 76, from appointing officers with \u201cno other merit than that of\u2026possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.\u201d . . . President Trump\u2019s violation of the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, unilaterally preventing members of the Senate from voting on whether or not to consent to Matthew Whitaker serving as a principal Officer, leaves Senators no choice but to seek a remedy through the courts.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) issued a statement Monday: \u201cI commend Senators Blumenthal, Hirono, and Whitehouse for bringing this important lawsuit and shining a bright light on the president\u2019s unconstitutional appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting aside Mr. Whitaker\u2019s many conflicts of interest and history of hostile comments toward the special counsel\u2019s investigation, his appointment as acting AG is in direct violation of the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause and should concern every American \u2013 regardless of party affiliation \u2013 who cares about the rule of law and justice in our country.\u201d\n\nThe litigants\u2019 argument is simple and persuasive: President Trump has violated one of the core checks and balances contained in the U.S. Constitution by violating the advice and consent process in the Constitution, a key check on executive power. Especially in the case where the president has consistently attempted to micromanage the Justice Department (e.g., calling on prosecution of his opponents, pressuring the AG to un-recuse himself), it\u2019s essential for the AG to be seen as someone who is not simply a rubber stamp for his political patron. Based on the reaction from both Republicans and Democrats, Whitaker very likely would not have been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWhile it is true that Whitaker, given his public statements about the special counsel investigation and his role in advising Sam Clovis, should not be in charge of that inquiry, that strictly speaking is a recusal matter. What is at issue in the lawsuit is whether the president can appoint Whitaker without the Senate\u2019s consent. If Trump can, it\u2019s not clear why future presidents would bother with Senate confirmation for controversial appointments.\n\nThere is a legitimate issue of \u201cstanding\u201d \u2014 whether these senators are the ones to bring a lawsuit. However, in this case, they seem to have a powerful rationale why the judicial branch needs to weigh in. The complaint states that these three senators were \u201cdenied the right to vote guaranteed to them by the Appointments Clause.\u201d The plaintiffs note that Congress passed a statute prescribing the order of succession in the event of a vacancy, the DOJ succession statute. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act, they argue, that allows the president to fill an opening under some circumstances does not override the DOJ succession statute and does not allow someone such as Whitaker who has never been confirmed by the Senate to step into the role of acting attorney general.\n\nThe senators seek declaratory relief that Whitaker was appointed to perform the duties of a principal officer of the United States (reporting to the president), and therefore that he is in violation of the Appointments Clause. They ask Whitaker be enjoined from performing the duties of acting attorney general.\n\nThe question is not why these three senators acted in defense of the Senate\u2019s prerogatives but why Republicans refuse to. Under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate is no longer the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body; indeed, it doesn\u2019t deliberate at all. McConnell refuses to consider legislation to protect the special counsel and refuses to confront the president on his unconstitutional usurpation of Senate powers. It\u2019s yet another powerful example of why Republicans are not fit to hold power; if they cannot uphold their oaths and defend their explicit role under the Constitution, they have no business being there."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "New assessment: 'Little clear progress' in Afghanistan war", "description": "A new assessment of U.S.-led efforts to compel the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal in Afghanistan says there has been \"little clear progress\" in recent months", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-assessment-little-clear-progress-in-afghanistan-war/2018/11/19/08ae4004-ec3d-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:52:32Z", "content": "WASHINGTON The U.S. and Afghan governments have made little clear progress recently in compelling the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal, according to a new U.S. assessment Monday that said military and political signs point toward continued stalemate.

A new assessment of U.S.-led efforts to compel the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal in Afghanistan says there has been \u201clittle clear progress\u201d in recent months. (Rahmat Gul, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. and Afghan governments have made \u201clittle clear progress\u201d recently in compelling the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal, according to a new U.S. assessment Monday that said military and political signs point toward continued stalemate.\n\n\u201cProgress toward peace remains elusive,\u201d Glenn A. Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general, wrote in an introduction to a comprehensive review of military, political and humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan during the July-September period. These were the final three months of the 17th year of a war that began in October 2001.\n\nThe report offered little support for the Trump administration\u2019s assertions that its revised war strategy, announced in August 2017, is bringing the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgency closer to peace and reconciliation. When he visited Kabul in July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strategy \u201cis indeed working.\u201d\n\nIn the three months following Pompeo\u2019s visit, the Taliban demonstrated their resilience even as the U.S. military continued its focus on training and advising the Afghan army and police while helping develop an Afghan air force.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Saturday that efforts to draw the Taliban into peace talks are being made \u201cbelow the surface.\u201d But he indicated that progress is insufficient. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from where we could say that we\u2019re on the right path,\u201d Dunford said at the Halifax International Security Forum, referring to effectively combining military, political and social pressure on the Taliban.\n\nNoting that U.S. officials as recently as a year ago called the war a stalemate, Dunford said, \u201cit hasn\u2019t changed much\u201d since.\n\nPulling the Taliban into peace negotiations has been the central feature of the Trump administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy, with little result so far. The effort has intensified since Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul, was appointed a special U.S. envoy to Afghanistan in September. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that Khalilzad held three days of talks with the Taliban in the Gulf state of Qatar.\n\nWithout referring explicitly to the talks in Qatar, Khalilzad told a news conference Sunday in Kabul, \u201cI am talking to all interested parties, all Afghan groups... and I think there is an opportunity for reconciliation and peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Afghan government wants peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Taliban are saying they do not believe they can succeed militarily, that they would like to see the problems that remain, resolved by peaceful means, by political negotiations.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s report, which was a combined assessment by inspectors general of the Pentagon, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, said available measures of security in Afghanistan showed little change in the July-September quarter. Progress toward reconciliation with the Taliban also as scant.\n\n\u201cDespite continued efforts and activities, there was little clear progress toward reconciliation during the quarter,\u201d the report said, adding that Afghan security force casualties are rising and humanitarian needs are growing as the conflict drags on.\n\nThe U.S. military does not publicly report the number of casualties among Afghan security forces, saying it is forbidden by the Afghan government. However, just last week Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said during a visit to Washington that 28,529 Afghan forces have been killed in the past four years, compared to 58 Americans in the same period.\n\nThe U.S. has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Associated Press reported Sunday that Fried was ahead of Caldwell by 6,753 votes out of more than 8 million cast.\n\nThere was little attention on the race nationally, as the media glare focused on the more consequential Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott (R) and Sen. Bill Nelson (D), and the gubernatorial contest between former congressman Ron DeSantis (R) and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D). In both cases, the Republican claimed victory after a grueling recount that once again put the spotlight on Florida\u2019s embattled election system.\n\nBut the race between Fried and Caldwell also was the subject of the historic statewide recount. And Democrats clung to Fried\u2019s win as a sign that all is not lost for them in the nation\u2019s largest battleground state, as the country heads into campaign season for the next presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe think her win is a starting point for Democrats in Florida,\u201d said Terrie Rizzo, chairman of the Democratic Party in Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re building a strong bench in the party, and Nikki is a rising star.\u201d\n\nFried, a former public defender, was endorsed by the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence, the Sierra Club and Elizabeth Warren, the firebrand senator from Massachusetts and possible Democratic presidential contender.\n\n\n\nMatt Caldwell conceded Monday in the race for agriculture commissioner in Florida. (John Raoux/AP)\n\nMike Barnett, chairman of the Republican Party of Palm Beach County, suggested Fried\u2019s victory had more to do with her gender than the candidates\u2019 policy differences.\n\n\u201cI think it has less to do with issues, and more because people are calling this the \u2018Year of the Woman,\u2019 \u201d Barnett said.\n\nBoth Fried, 40, and Caldwell, 37 \u2014 a real estate appraiser and state representative from Lee County on the Gulf Coast \u2014 are seen as bright lights in their parties.\n\nIn an interview before his concession, Caldwell said he wasn\u2019t surprised his race was so close. Citing the state\u2019s explosive population growth, he said, \u201cthe electorate changes every week in Florida.\u201d\n\n\u201cStatewide elections in Florida are competitive. The race for Senate and governor, neither of them won by a landslide,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nFried will be stepping into a job that has been held by only 11 people since the state\u2019s founding in 1845 \u2014 all of them men, with the brief exception in 2001 of Terry Lee Rhodes, who served for four months as an interim appointee.\n\nAs a member of DeSantis\u2019s Cabinet, she\u2019ll oversee a department that traditionally has been friendly to farmers and businesses, and also to the National Rifle Association. In Florida, it\u2019s the Agriculture Commission that conducts weapons background checks and issues concealed-weapons permits.\n\nFried is a gun owner, and she has a concealed-weapons permit. Still, she has advocated for stronger gun-control measures. In October, Fried tweeted, \u201cI have a message for the @NRA: Your control over concealed weapons permits is finished. As Commissioner of Agriculture, I won\u2019t be beholden to you \u2014 but to the people of Florida.\u201d\n\nThe NRA endorsed Caldwell, and NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer called Fried an \u201canti-gun extremist who will eliminate our freedoms.\u201d\n\nFried also supports new ways of using and monitoring agricultural runoff, which is blamed for contributing to the massive red-tide and blue-green algae outbreaks that plagued the state this year.\n\nFried said she believes her platform appealed not only to Democrats but also to Republicans and the growing segment of the electorate that does not affiliate with either major party.\n\n\u201cThe issues that I have been talking about really cross party lines,\u201d Fried said. \u201cAccess to medical marijuana, water quality in our state, sensible gun regulations. These are things that are not partisan. I believe that I was able to capture a lot of independent votes, and a lot of Republican votes.\u201d\n\nFried\u2019s big issue, however, was marijuana \u2014 medical as well as recreational. Florida voters in 2016 passed an amendment allowing the use of medical marijuana. The issue was popular \u2014 it passed by 71 percent \u2014 but the state has been slow in rolling it out.\n\nFried, whose marijuana lobbying firm is called Igniting Florida, said she saw firsthand how medical marijuana helped children with seizures. She said she also saw what she considered roadblocks put up by legislators that made it difficult to get a license to provide the substance.\n\nHer outspoken support of marijuana came with a price during the election: Because Fried took donations from the medical marijuana industry, Wells Fargo and BB&T banks closed her campaign accounts briefly, citing policies against serving businesses related to marijuana, which is still prohibited under federal law.\n\nFried plans to keep pot in the forefront when she takes office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely seen as taboo. They don\u2019t even want to talk about it in Tallahassee,\u201d Fried said. \u201cI think now the conversation will start, and we\u2019ll move the issue forward.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Brady Dennis", "title": "Trump EPA official who was indicted on ethics charges has resigned", "description": "\u201cI intend to focus on my family, fight these unfounded accusations and ultimately clear my name,\" Trey Glenn wrote in a resignation letter.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/11/19/trump-epa-official-indicted-ethics-charges-has-resigned/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UHc2BbC8LkYg-YmEHWWJ1aVzGJk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2Y2I6YHTW5CDRNWYAVPZ4SXZ64.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:12:19Z", "content": "A regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, indicted in Alabama last week on violations of state ethics laws, has resigned.

(Saul Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\nThe theory behind democracy \u2014 a good theory that I embrace \u2014 is that every vote counts. Every American goes to the polling place and casts a ballot, and then we add them up to see who has been chosen to serve in office. In reality, of course, there are scads of stumbling blocks \u2014 apathy, efforts to tamp down voting, etc. \u2014 that make this ideal come up short.\n\nBut one significant way in which it comes up short is that every vote often doesn\u2019t count. When someone wins an election by a million votes, it\u2019s hard to feel as though your particular vote made much of a difference.\n\nSometimes, though, it does. Sometimes, one vote is the difference between a candidate winning and a candidate losing. It\u2019s rare, mind you, but not nonexistent.\n\nLet\u2019s come back to that. Let\u2019s first assess what the results of elections look like nationally. To do so, we used data from the Associated Press\u2019s voting results tabulations for all 50 states and the District of Columbia and determined how close the contests were on two metrics: margin of victory for the winner and the number of votes separating the first- and second-place candidates.\n\nIn total, the AP has data on 4,137 races, excluding those in which a candidate ran unopposed. (Those candidates had a remarkable track record of victory.) Here\u2019s the distribution of margins of victory.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe median margin of victory was 22.1 points, meaning that half the races were closer and half were less close. On average, candidates (and issues) won by 25.7 points. Our congratulations to state Rep. Rod Scott, a Democrat, whose 98.8 percentage-point victory in Alabama\u2019s 55th House District was the highest in the country.\n\nThe margins in terms of votes varied much more widely, given that the races ranged from statewide contests in Florida to each of New Hampshire\u2019s 42,000 individual state legislative districts. The broadest vote margin came in the former state, with voters overwhelmingly approving Amendment 12, an anti-corruption measure.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAll that\u2019s fine. But what about the closest races? There were, by our count, 133 races of the 4,137 in which the margin was under 100 votes \u2014 3.2 percent of all of the races. The AP data isn\u2019t final, so those margins (and the ones below) might change.\n\nThe 40 closest races were all within 26 votes or less. That includes the race in Kentucky\u2019s state House District 13, in which Jim Glenn (D) beat incumbent Rep. D.J. Johnson (R) by a 6,319-to-6,318 vote. That\u2019s a one-vote margin. Every vote there counted. (There were two other one-vote margins, both in New Hampshire races in which multiple candidates won in each district.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe closest race in which more than more than 50,000 votes were cast was in Illinois\u2019s 21st state Senate district. Incumbent Republican Michael Connelly (R) led by 12 votes over Laura Ellman (D). In 2012 and 2014, he ran unopposed.\n\nUpdate: That margin, though, has shifted as more votes have been counted. Ellman now leads Connelly. It\u2019s a reminder both that close races often see shifts in the days after elections -- and, as the headline states, that every vote counts.\n\nBy percentage-point margin, the closest race is still one of those New Hampshire races; the Illinois race is in the top five. About 180 races were settled by one point or less, according to the AP\u2019s data, more than 4 percent of the uncontested races.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nHere we see two other interesting additions to the top 40: Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate and agriculture commissioner races. These were two of the closest races in the country, and while the margins were 10,033 and 6,753 votes, respectively, they were certainly races in which small shifts in the vote made a big difference.

This isn\u2019t really a problem; while such experience can be valuable in confronting some of the challenges a president faces, we\u2019ve had both great and terrible presidents who wore the uniform.\n\nBut we\u2019ve certainly never had a president who displayed Donald Trump\u2019s combination of boastful claims about how devoted he is to the military and regular displays of contempt for those who have served or are still serving.\n\nPart of it comes from Trump\u2019s refusal to concern himself with the habits and norms that govern politics, which doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be unhealthy. But it also comes from the fact that Trump has no evident principles that he holds dearer than servicing the demands of his own ego.\n\nIn the latest controversy, Trump appeared on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d during which host Chris Wallace tried to ask him about criticism he received from retired Adm. William H. McRaven over the president\u2019s attacks on the media.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nWallace: Bill McRaven, Retired Admiral, Navy Seal, 37 years, former head of U.S. Special Operations \u2014 Trump: Hillary Clinton fan. Wallace: Special Operation \u2014 Trump: Excuse me, Hillary Clinton fan. Wallace: Who led the operations, commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden, says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his life. Trump: Okay, he\u2019s a Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer and frankly \u2014 Wallace: He\u2019s a Navy SEAL \u2014 Trump: Would it have been nicer if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it been nice? Living \u2014 think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan and what I guess in what they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer. But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there. And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion and year and they don\u2019t tell him, they don\u2019t tell him \u2014 Wallace: You\u2019re not even going to give them credit for taking down Bin Laden?\n\nMcRaven released a statement noting that in fact he did not support Hillary Clinton in 2016, and expressing his admiration for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, both of whom he served under. But in Trump\u2019s eyes, the fact that McRaven has criticized him means the admiral is an enemy, and must be attacked on every front. It\u2019s not within the president\u2019s DNA to say \u201cI respect his service, but he\u2019s wrong about this.\u201d If you criticize Trump, you can never have done anything right.\n\nIt\u2019s for this reason that Trump said about Sen. John McCain, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d A normal person can acknowledge McCain\u2019s heroic suffering as a prisoner of war in Vietnam while still disagreeing with him about most things \u2014 or even criticizing him vigorously (I certainly did). But not Trump. He has to go after the thing that earned his critic respect in the first place.\n\nThis is only the latest of many instances Trump has attacked war heroes, veterans, Gold Star families or others associated with the military in unusually personal terms, a direct violation of the bipartisan norm that demands respect for people in uniform.\n\nTo be clear, you can argue that the boundaries of that norm are sometimes drawn too broadly, as a way of exempting veterans in political life from criticism. For instance, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders once responded to a question concerning false claims that Chief of Staff John F. Kelly had made by saying, \u201cI think that if you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that that\u2019s something highly inappropriate,\u201d which is, of course, ludicrous.\n\nBut there is a simple rule anyone can follow: While it is perfectly fine to disagree with anyone, denigrating a veteran\u2019s military service itself is probably out of bounds.\n\nIt is possible that Trump chafes at the idea that retired admirals or generals are accorded a special status when criticizing him, receiving attention for their opinions that others might not enjoy. You might even be able to contend that McRaven\u2019s views about press freedom are no more inherently valuable than anyone else\u2019s. But Trump can\u2019t seem to stop himself from taking it that one step further, not just to say \u201che\u2019s wrong,\u201d but to attack the thing McRaven is best known for in his military career. (As has been pointed out, the special forces that McRaven commanded weren\u2019t charged with finding Bin Laden; that was an intelligence matter. The special forces went in and got bin Laden once he was located.)\n\nThis helps explain why Trump\u2019s other actions toward the military have shown none of the special concern he claims to have, and which all presidents have shown. Ahead of the midterm elections, he deployed thousands of troops to the southern border to heighten tension over the phantom threat of a caravan of migrants; those troops are still there, cooling their heels and missing Thanksgiving with their families. He orders an idiotic military parade (which was thankfully canceled), wasting their time and money, for no purpose other than his own aggrandizement. He hasn\u2019t visited any of the deployed troops in war zones anywhere in the world, and when asked why not, he answers that he opposed the war in Iraq.\n\nThe proper response to that excuse is of course, \u201cWho the hell cares?\u201d It\u2019s not as though the men and women who are there had any say in the matter, and visiting them is a way of demonstrating that you honor their service. Barack Obama opposed the war but, as president, he made multiple visits to the troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan, as well.\n\nBut for Trump, it\u2019s all personal. He regularly refers to \u201cmy military\u201d and \u201cmy generals\u201d as though they belong not to the country but to him personally. And if they displease him? Then they\u2019re dead to him, and they go right in with all his other enemies as targets for personal destruction."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "US cuts in Palestinian refugee aid mitigated by new pledges", "description": "The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says it has nearly closed its funding gap by securing new donor pledges to make up for US aid cuts", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/us-cuts-in-palestinian-refugee-aid-mitigated-by-new-pledges/2018/11/19/a93ee43a-ec31-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:31:08Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "DEAD SEA, Jordan \u2014 The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says it has nearly closed its funding gap after securing new donor pledges to make up for U.S. aid cuts.\n\nPierre Kraehenbuehl, the head of the U.N.

Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. So I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\n\nCNN conservative commentator Amanda Carpenter responded to the first comment this way: \u201cThere\u2019s no explanation for it. It\u2019s a racist thing to say. I\u2019m not from the South, but I\u2019m pretty sure joking around about going to a public lynching is not something people say.\u201d She continued, \u201cWhat she needs to do is tour the new lynching museum that\u2019s down South where they show the horrific things that people went through in her backyard.\u201d\n\nWhen a former Trump campaign adviser tried defending Hyde-Smith by claiming this was all part of \u201cthe outrage culture,\u201d Carpenter countered, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when someone says something so provocative that you blame the people who are offended.\u201d She bluntly declared, \u201cIf Republicans want to quit being accused of being racist, they have to stop saying racist things.\u201d\n\nThat kind of straight talk and zero tolerance for racism is exceedingly rare among GOP elected officials, candidates and their helpmates in the right-wing media. The usual response is that he or she didn\u2019t mean it, or \u201cWhat about \u2026 ?\u201d\n\nThe explanation for why Republicans talk this way and other Republicans don\u2019t object should be obvious: In the Trump era, where white grievance is the prime motivator for turning out the base and resentment of \u201celites\u201d is what binds voters to President Trump, GOP politicians are loath to repudiate racist rhetoric. Instead they try to harness not only the winks, nods and overt statements of solidarity with the alt-right (including fondness for Confederate statues and emblems) but also the reaction this generates from those whom their base scorns \u2014 the media, urban elites and civil rights groups.\n\nTrump spent the last weeks of the campaign hysterically warning about a non-emergency, the progress of a caravan of refugees a thousand miles from our border. Once the election was over, the matter was dropped. Well, to crib from Carpenter, if Republicans want to quit being accused of being \u201canti-immigrant,\u201d they have to stop saying anti-immigrant things (e.g. calling them \u201canimals,\u201d talking about an infestation, making up a crime wave purportedly caused by immigrants).\n\nIndeed, this formulation should serve as a guidepost for Republicans:\n\nIf Republicans want to quit being accused of science denial, they have to stop denying science. If Republicans want to quit being accused of being protectionist know-nothings, they have to stop saying that trade wars are easy to win, tariffs are good, consumers don\u2019t suffer from tariffs, and the trade deficit means we owe other countries something. If Republicans want to quit being accused of hypocrisy, they have to stop being hypocrites about the debt (bad only for Democrats), executive power (bad only for Democrats) and corporate cronyism (bad only for Democrats). If Republicans want to quit being accused of misogyny, they have to stop suggesting that women invent allegations of sexual assault, don\u2019t want to work hard enough to be on the Judiciary Committee and aren\u2019t intelligent. If Republicans want to quit being accused of being the party of the rich, they have to stop giving big tax cuts to the rich, attacking Medicaid, rubber-stamping a Cabinet of billionaires and tolerating their abuse of travel privileges. If Republicans want to quit being accused of being doormats for dictators, they have to stop defending Trump when he refuses to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, to name just a few. If Republicans want to quit being accused of kowtowing to the National Rifle Association, they have to stop blocking every measure the NRA opposes. If Republicans want to quit being accused of contempt for the free press, they have to stop cheering when Trump calls the media the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d takes away a reporter\u2019s credentials for failing to be deferential enough and uses the instruments of power to threaten media critics.\n\nIn short, Republicans bring criticism on themselves when they talk and act in ways that are factually wrong and morally indefensible. It\u2019s a big reason that voters who care about facts and public morality won\u2019t vote for them.\n\nRead more:\n\nStacey Abrams has it right about election rhetoric\n\nRepublicans used to vilify presidents who disrespected the military\n\nDenial is not a foreign policy\n\nThe GOP has just two problems: Trump and Trumpism"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Judge to decide on espionage trial for Panama ex-leader", "description": "Former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli has made a noisy court appearance ahead of a ruling on whether he should stand trial for alleged political espionage", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/judge-to-decide-on-espionage-trial-for-panama-ex-leader/2018/11/19/49447036-ec31-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:28:27Z", "content": "PANAMA CITY Former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli has made a noisy court appearance ahead of a ruling on whether he should stand trial for alleged political espionage.

This isn\u2019t a fluke or a one-time finding. It tends to be systematic.\u201d\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from about 42,800 people surveyed in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe NYU study authors relied on data from the 2015 survey, the first year in which respondents were asked questions about sexual identity and attraction. Those who took the survey were first asked whether they considered themselves to be heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual. Second, respondents were asked whether they were attracted to the opposite sex or to the same sex, and to what extent.\n\nThe survey also queried the misuse of prescription opioids, defined as using prescription pain-reliever drugs in ways that were not directed by a doctor, in both the past month and the past year.\n\nAfter controlling for factors such as demographics and other drug use, the NYU team of researchers found that women who identified as bisexual were twice as likely to misuse opioids when compared with heterosexual people.\n\nOne of the study\u2019s authors, Joseph Palamar, said he found these results particularly interesting, in part because the opioid epidemic is so often associated with men.\n\n\u201cTypically women are more protected against drug use,\u201d said Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the men we worry about.\u201d\n\n[Inside the fallout of America\u2019s crackdown on opioids]\n\nThe reasons behind these disparities are unclear and require further study, the researchers said. But Duncan, the study\u2019s lead author, said the findings square with other research indicating that bisexual women in particular are more likely to report poor health outcomes, including, for example, problems sleeping.\n\nDuncan attributes this trend to the \u201cminority stress model,\u201d the theory that members of minority groups tend to experience greater degrees of stress due to stigma and discrimination.\n\nIn this case, Duncan argued, bisexual women are a minority within a minority. They might face the stigma and discrimination associated with being a woman and a member of the LGBT community, while not belonging fully to lesbian or gay circles. These additional stressors could predispose them to increased rates of substance abuse, the authors said.\n\n\u201cThese things together create further stress, less ability to cope and give rise to poor health,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nPalamar wondered whether bisexual individuals might also be more exploratory in nature, both in regard to their sexuality and their openness to trying drugs. But Duncan pushed back against that theory, arguing that the differences probably have more to do with the stress associated with their distinct life experiences.\n\nThe study notably did not take into account the experiences of the transgender and non-binary communities, as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has not yet included a question about gender identity. The survey also did not allow for participants to respond with more fluid sexual identities, including pansexuality.\n\nThe researchers also decided not to include heroin use with the prescription drug variable, \u201cin order to keep the results more straightforward,\u201d according to the study.\n\nThe authors adjusted for geographic differences, such as whether a person lived in an urban versus a rural area. But it would be worth accounting for geographic disparities in future research, Duncan said.\n\n\u201cIn counties or places that are less accepting of LGBT identities . . . I would imagine there would be a higher risk of opioid use,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nPalamar warned against using the findings to further stigmatize the lesbian, gay and bisexual population but said the research emphasizes the need to focus prevention efforts within these communities. The authors urged doctors, parents and educators to consider sexual orientation when screening for opioid misuse and focus on stress management within lesbian, gay and bisexual communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue documenting who is at risk,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThis study is really the first step.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Airbnb removes listings in Israeli settlements", "description": "Vacation rental company Airbnb says it is removing its listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/airbnb-removes-listings-in-israeli-settlements/2018/11/19/04434a5e-ec2f-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:12:12Z", "content": "JERUSALEM Vacation rental company Airbnb says it is removing its listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

A neighbor down the street recalled how Christopher Watts used to play with the girls in a wagon, and his social media feeds were full of love odes to his family and the \u201clittle peanut\u201d growing in Shanann\u2019s womb, to be named Nico.\n\nBut investigators were immediately suspicious after finding Shanann\u2019s wallet and keys still in the house.\n\nA day after the disappearance, a woman named Nichol Kessinger contacted the sheriff\u2019s office after seeing Watts on the news, the Denver Post reported. She told investigators that she had been dating him for several weeks, under the impression that he was in the process of finalizing a divorce and moving out with his daughters.\n\n\u201cHe lied about everything,\u201d Kessinger later told the Denver Post.\n\n[He said he killed his wife after she strangled their daughters. Prosecutors say he killed them all.]\n\nAt Monday\u2019s hearing, the district attorney alleged that Shanann had been trying to save the marriage for weeks \u2014 texting her husband and buying self-help books as he shopped for jewelry and vacation spots to take his \u201cnew love.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis motive was simple, your honor,\u201d Rourke said. \u201cHe had a desire for a fresh start.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested Watts after interviewing Kessinger and soon announced that he had confessed to killing Shanann in \u201ca rage\u201d \u2014 claiming he had walked in on his wife as she was strangling their two girls, too late to save them.\n\nAn investigation proved that was a lie, too, Rourke said. \u201cThe man seated to my right smothered his daughters,\u201d he said as Watts looked down at his handcuffs, one leg occasionally shaking beneath the table. An autopsy found a cut in Bella\u2019s mouth, he said, suggesting that \u201cshe fought back for her life\u201d and bit her tongue before she died.\n\nWatts had been home with the girls while Shanann was out of town that weekend. He killed his wife shortly after she returned from the airport early on a Monday morning.\n\nA bruise in the shape of a finger mark on her neck told investigators that Watts had strangled her slowly and without resistance, Rourke told the court. \u201cThe horror she felt as the man she loved wrapped his hands around her throat and choked the life out of her must have been unimaginable,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides pleading guilty this month to all three murders and unlawful termination of a pregnancy, Watts admitted to tampering with their bodies.\n\nOn Monday, Rourke described how surveillance cameras showed Watts going back and forth between the house and his pickup in the darkness that morning \u2014 loading up the corpses before he drove to a company oil field \u201cto secrete away his family in a place he hoped they\u2019d never be found.\"\n\nHe dug a hole for Shanann and stuffed each of his daughters into a separate tank full of crude oil. Bella had to be shoved through the eight-inch hatch, Rourke said, leaving a tuft of blond hair on the side that investigators in hazmat suits would later discover.\n\nAnd when he had done all that, Rourke said, Watts contacted a real estate agent to put the house on the market.\n\nCynthia and Ronnie Watts openly doubted that their son had really done all these things \u2014 even after he pleaded guilty to it all Nov. 6 in a deal that spared him the death penalty.\n\nBut on Monday, as the couple addressed the court and their son, they asked only that Watts one day explain himself.\n\n\u201cWe love you, and we forgive you, son,\u201d Cynthia Watts said, turning from the podium to look at him, though he still didn\u2019t raise his eyes. \u201cWe are forced to question everything.

Children under age 2 made up the largest share of the ER visits.\n\nAbout 74 million antibiotic prescriptions are doled out to kids each year, the study notes, and past research has indicated that at least one-third of these pediatric antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary.\n\nOverprescribing these drugs can contribute to antibiotic resistance, as weaker bacteria are routinely killed off and \u201csuperbugs\u201d that cannot be treated by antibiotics proliferate.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, these are lifesaving drugs with benefits that far outweigh the risks,\u201d says pediatrician Katherine Fleming-Dutra, co-author of the study and deputy director of the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to recognize those risks, both in terms of long-term antibiotic resistance and short-term, acute events.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has estimated that up to 10 percent of all childhood antibiotic prescriptions cause an allergic reaction. Here are what parents need to know about the new study and what to discuss with your pediatrician.\n\nWhat the study found\n\nUsing national data on ER visits between 2011 and 2015, CDC researchers estimated that 69,464 annual visits were made by children younger than 19 who were experiencing antibiotic-related \u201cadverse events.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of these events \u2014 86.1 percent \u2014 involved some kind of allergic reaction. Fleming-Dutra notes that there was a broad spectrum of what could constitute an allergic reaction, from anaphylaxis to mild rashes and gastrointestinal issues. Seventy-seven percent of all the problems counted in the study were considered \u201cmild allergic events.\u201d\n\nThe antibiotic side effects that were not allergic reactions were most commonly issues such as diarrhea and diaper rash in younger children and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, in older children. Headaches and yeast infections were less common reactions, and certain antibiotics produced rare side effects such as light sensitivity.\n\nThe researchers observed the most adverse events among children younger than 2. One in 400 children 2 or younger visits the ER each year with a reaction to antibiotics. The older the child, the less likely they were to have a negative reaction to antibiotics.\n\nPediatrician Mark Sawyer, a member of the American Association of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Infectious Diseases, who was not involved in the study, says it\u2019s not surprising there were more adverse events for younger children.\n\nYounger children, Sawyer says, are more prone to infections and thus more likely to be prescribed antibiotics. They are also more likely to experience allergic reactions. And newer parents can tend to be anxious, bringing younger children to the ER for more minor symptoms, Sawyer adds.\n\nFleming-Dutra says that, ultimately, decisions about which drug your child is prescribed \u2014 or whether they are prescribed medication at all \u2014 should be made by your pediatrician. But this study can be a good \u201cconversation starter between parents and doctors,\u201d she says, prompting \u201ca more informed discussion about the potential risks and rewards of antibiotics.\u201d\n\nWhat parents should know\n\nSawyer says discussion of the pros and cons of antibiotics has increased in recent years, and that fewer physicians are prescribing them needlessly for, say, viral infections.\n\nAnd the growing body of research on the risk of antibiotic side effects and the harms of overuse \u2014 the CDC published a similar study on adverse reactions in 2016 \u2014 can help shift the conversation between parents and doctors.\n\n\u201cI think nervous parents can sometimes push and push pediatricians for antibiotics, because they\u2019re seen as a quick-fix for all kinds of sickness,\u201d he says. \u201cStudies like this can help people understand they aren\u2019t always the answer.\u201d\n\nHere are some things you should know the next time you bring your child to the pediatrician \u2014 either with an ailment that may require antibiotics or with symptoms of an adverse reaction to the drugs.\n\n\u2022 Coughs and runny noses typically do not require antibiotics. These drugs can\u2019t do anything to fight colds and other viruses. If your child\u2019s symptoms are severe, you can certainly bring them to the doctor \u2014 just know that antibiotics probably won\u2019t be the answer.\n\n\u2022 Sore throats are not treatable with antibiotics, unless your child has strep. Parents sometimes assume a child\u2019s sore throat is caused by the bacteria streptococcus (strep), and is therefore treatable with antibiotics. In about 80 percent of cases, however, sore throats are viral in origin. Your pediatrician should test for strep before prescribing antibiotics.\n\n\u2022 Antibiotics are not effective for most ear infections. Sawyer says research has shown antibiotics don\u2019t make sense for most ear infections, especially in older children. For treating ear infection pain, it\u2019s more effective to give your child pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil or generic) or acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic).\n\n\u2022 Mild adverse reactions to antibiotics are common. It\u2019s not unusual for children to have mild rashes, nausea, diarrhea and even vomiting in reaction to antibiotics. Sawyer says these symptoms don\u2019t necessarily connote an allergy; often pediatricians will recommend your child finishes antibiotic treatment even if they have these reactions.

Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speaker, an act of defiance that puts the dissidents on the cusp of forcing a seismic leadership shake-up as the party prepares to take the majority.\n\nTheir pledge to oppose Pelosi, delivered in a letter to Democratic colleagues, comes as the California congresswoman has marshaled a legion of supporters to make her case. She is courting members in one-on-one conversations while securing the backing of allies on and off Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Monday, the International Association of Fire Fighters; UnidosUS, a leading Latino civil rights organization; and nine military veterans serving in the House endorsed her return as speaker. Meanwhile, at a town hall meeting in Massachusetts, a leader of her opposition in the House was confronted by dozens of pro-Pelosi protesters.\n\nThe insurrection against Pelosi stands as the only official obstacle to unity in the top leadership ranks, after Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) on Monday withdrew her challenge for the No. 3 job held by Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), and Pelosi endorsed her leadership team. But the renegades\u2019 threat is considerable.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus,\u201d her opponents wrote. \u201cHowever, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran on and won on a message of change.\u201d\n\nPelosi, 78, has expressed complete confidence that she will retake the speaker\u2019s gavel in January \u2014 eight years after she lost it following massive Republican gains in the 2010 midterms and 16 years after she was first elevated to the top Democratic leadership post in the House.\n\nPelosi is the only speaker candidate who has declared ahead of a party nominating vote on Nov. 28, with a vote of the full House on Jan. 3. But her opponents believe that an alternative will emerge if it becomes clear Pelosi does not have the 218 votes needed to win in January.\n\nDrew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, said Monday that she \u201cremains confident in her support among members and members-elect\u201d and noted that more than 90 percent of the incoming Democratic caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nTwo Democratic aides said Pelosi inquired with at least one incoming member about whether they would be willing to vote present \u2014 a move that would lower the threshold for becoming speaker while also allowing Pelosi\u2019s critics to keep their word in opposing her. Hammill declined to comment on whether Pelosi is exploring that possibility.\n\nThe signers of the letter might not be able to force Pelosi out themselves, but there is at least a handful of Democrats who plan to oppose her but did not sign the letter.\n\nThe size of the Democratic majority remains in flux, but Democrats have won 232 seats, according to the Associated Press, with four races still undecided. If the current leads hold in those uncalled races, Democrats will have won 234 seats \u2014 a 17-seat majority.\n\n[Does Pelosi have the votes to become speaker?]\n\nThat means Pelosi could lose as many as 16 Democratic votes when she stands for election as speaker Jan. 3. Two of the 16 signers, Anthony Brindisi (New York) and Ben McAdams (Utah), have yet to be declared winners.\n\nAlso signing the letter were Reps. Jim Cooper (Tenn.), Bill Foster (Ill.), Seth Moulton (Mass.), Brian Higgins (N.Y.), Stephen F. Lynch (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Kathleen Rice (N.Y.), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (Calif.), Kurt Schrader (Ore.), Filemon Vela (Tex.), and newly elected members Joe Cunningham (S.C.), Max Rose (N.Y.) and Jeff Van Drew (N.J.).\n\nNot signing the letter was Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who has publicly opposed Pelosi and is mulling a run against her.\n\nA spokesman for Fudge said Monday that she was unavailable for an interview and spending time in her congressional district in the Cleveland area, adding that her final decision on the speaker race is not expected until after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nA Fudge associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said it was unclear why Fudge did not sign the letter but that the lawmaker was deliberately keeping a low profile this week as she continues to think through her possible candidacy, with the travel and fundraising of the job weighing on her and potentially pushing her away from running.\n\nMoulton, one of the leaders of the insurrection, stayed in close touch with fellow Pelosi critics on Monday, including a call with Fudge, who has been his mentor in the House, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Moulton continues to encourage her to run, the person said.\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Amesbury, Mass., Monday night, Moulton heard an earful from Pelosi supporters \u2014 including about 20 organized protesters who held signs reading \u201cI Stand With Nancy.\u201d Many of them saw sexism and ageism in the push to oust Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m targeted \u2014 I\u2019m old and I\u2019m a woman,\u201d said Lynda Christian, 80, of nearby Burlington, Mass. \u201cNancy Pelosi, I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s done a fantastic job. Who fires somebody who does something well?\u201d\n\nAddressing the sometimes testy crowd, Moulton said it would be \u201cfailing the American people\u201d to keep Pelosi in place after 16 years in charge.\n\n\u201cThe American people cried out for change in this election,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington isn\u2019t working, and we need a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nFive other Democrats \u2014 Rep. Conor Lamb (Pa.) and Reps.-elect Jason Crow (Colo.), Jared Golden (Maine), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.) \u2014 have made firm statements saying they would not vote for Pelosi but did not sign the letter.\n\nRepresentatives for Crow, Lamb and Spanberger each said Monday that their positions on Pelosi had not changed and that they intend to vote against her in the January floor vote.\n\nGolden said the same in an interview, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s your vote, not signing a piece of paper, that counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to pass the torch to new leaders in the Democatic Party, and I stand by that, and I\u2019m going to vote that way in caucus and on the House floor,\u201d he said.\n\n[Trump again offers GOP votes to make Pelosi speaker. This time it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s joking.]\n\nIn her conversations with individual members, Pelosi has started inquiring about their policy priorities and committee assignment preferences. The Democratic Caucus gives its top leader wide leeway to make those decisions, crucial to a lawmaker\u2019s legislative career.\n\nShe has also met with key subgroups within the caucus, including hearing out the left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus and the more centrist New Democrat Coalition. Both groups expect to have scores of Democrats in their ranks next year.\n\nThe Progressive Caucus issued a statement last week supportive of Pelosi, citing her pledge to help appoint caucus members to coveted committees such as Appropriations, Financial Services, and Ways and Means.\n\nThe New Democrats are pressing Pelosi for rules changes to ensure lawmakers have time to read bills and that operations in the House are more transparent, and Pelosi attended a meeting of the group Friday during which she was pressed on the need to shield centrist members from politically perilous votes.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the chairman of the coalition, cited the cap-and-trade climate bill that House Democrats passed in 2009, only to see it languish in the Senate. Many Republican challengers used the bill in their campaign to oust Democratic incumbents the next year.\n\n\u201cThe culture of our caucus is very progressive, as it should be. But we need to make sure that we don\u2019t do things which damage the electoral prospects of the people who gave us the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she heard us loud and clear.\u201d\n\nDeGette had challenged Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in House leadership, for the majority whip post. But facing a backlash from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, DeGette dropped her bid \u2014 ensuring, for now, that Clyburn will remain in the top ranks.\n\nAny major shake-up in the Democratic leadership now depends on whether the dissidents can muster the votes to keep Pelosi from seizing the House speaker\u2019s gavel in January. If that bid is successful, it could kick off a wholesale scramble that could also threaten Clyburn, the current assistant Democratic leader, and Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who is seeking to move from whip to majority leader.\n\nDeGette, who has long served as chief deputy whip, launched her campaign after the Nov. 6 election by touting her experience in rounding up support for difficult pieces of legislation \u2014 implicitly making the case that Clyburn, 78, was not up to or interested in the task.\n\nBut the challenge upset backers of Clyburn, a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman and a revered figure among the caucus\u2019s roughly 50 African Americans \u2014 who bristled at the notion that the caucus\u2019s top tier could be all white.\n\n\u201cOut of the three of the leadership positions, he is the only one with announced opposition,\u201d Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the current Congressional Black Caucus chair, said last week. \u201cI just think it is offensive and insulting.\u201d\n\nDevi Lockwood in Amesbury, Mass., contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Angela Fritz", "title": "Thanksgiving weather forecast is record cold in Northeast, snowy for travel in West", "description": "Although the forecast looks favorable for most of the Lower 48 this year, a few regions will face wintry weather and record-low temperatures.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/11/19/thanksgiving-weather-forecast-is-record-cold-northeast-snowy-travel-west/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8KjPYhsEhrAlY2PYsUHcU1JSRJI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZS74S7G45YI6PISBBBEDCVSC2A.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:48:30Z", "content": "Millions of people are about to travel for Thanksgiving, and many could face weather delays.

(Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post)\n\nMillions of people are about to travel for Thanksgiving, and many could face weather delays. Although the forecast looks favorable for most of the Lower 48, a few regions will face wintry weather and record-low temperatures.\n\nNortheast\n\nTuesday is the busiest travel day for Thanksgiving in the Northeast, according to AAA, which says about 48.5 million people will drive this year. About 4.3 million travelers will get to their holiday destinations by plane, the agency notes. In the Northeast, snow could lengthen the time that travelers spend on the road and at the airports. The National Weather Service in Boston writes:\n\nA weak wave of low pressure will bring light snow to the region [Monday] morning changing to rain except freezing rain in the Worcester Hills and east slopes of the Berkshires. A stronger wave of low pressure will likely impact the area later tonight into Tuesday with accumulating snow across northern Massachusetts. Rain may change to snow before ending Tuesday afternoon across [Connecticut, Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts].\n\n\n\nWind-chill forecast for Thursday afternoon.\n\nBehind the snow, an Arctic blast sweeps into the Northeast late Wednesday, bringing record-cold wind chills in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nFrom Maine to Pennsylvania, temperatures could be lower than they\u2019ve ever been on Thanksgiving, even in the years the holiday fell very late in the month. Early-morning lows drop to about 20 degrees from Philadelphia to New York City. In Upstate New York, temperatures at sunrise will be in the single digits. Boston\u2019s Thursday-morning low temperature will be about 15 degrees.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, only three Thanksgivings have had high temperatures below 30 degrees. The coldest Turkey Day on record in New York City was Nov. 28, 1901, when the high temperature was 26 degrees \u2014 which is also the forecast for Thursday.\n\nAt the very least, it looks as though it will be the coldest Thanksgiving in more than 20 years.\n\nForecast Record cold daytime temperature Record date Boston 22 degrees 24 degrees Nov. 28, 1901 Providence 23 degrees 30 degrees Nov. 28, 1996 New York City 26 degrees 26 degrees Nov. 28, 1901 Philadelphia 29 degrees 30 degrees Nov. 28, 1996 Washington 34 degrees 30 degrees Nov. 27, 1930\n\nMidwest\n\nA chance of light snow during the day and night on Monday shouldn\u2019t be a travel concern in the Midwest. But wintry-cold temperatures are flowing across the Great Lakes, which will generate snow for some of the areas off Lake Michigan, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario through Wednesday. Lake-effect snow is in the forecast for Northeast Ohio; Erie, Pa.; and western Upstate New York into late Wednesday afternoon and evening.\n\nThanksgiving should be dry for much, if not all, of the Midwest. High temperatures Thursday are in the 20s and 30s.\n\nThanksgiving high temperature Minneapolis 37 degrees Chicago 35 degrees Detroit 30 degrees Indianapolis 36 degrees Cleveland 27 degrees\n\nSouth\n\nRain is possible in parts of Texas on Monday, the region\u2019s busiest Thanksgiving travel day, according to AAA. Houston\u2019s travelers tend to hit the road on Monday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and in Dallas, most air travel is scheduled Monday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nIn Southeast Texas, rain on Monday could cause delays on the roads before it\u2019s pushed out of the region by a cold front. That same front extends across the Southeast, where showers are possible into early afternoon Tuesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, the forecast is quiet across much of the South. There\u2019s a chance of showers Wednesday evening and night in the Houston area, but they should clear out by Thursday morning for a partly sunny Thanksgiving.\n\nWest\n\nA storm brewing off the West Coast will delay travel starting Wednesday, and the National Weather Service is advising drivers to plan extra time into their trips.\n\n\u201cAfter weeks of dry conditions under strong high pressure, a significant pattern shift will occur by Wednesday as weak to moderately strong weather system moves into the region,\u201d the National Weather Service in Reno, Nev., wrote on Monday. \u201cThis means that [Monday] and Tuesday will be the best days for those with travel plans this week.\u201d\n\nSnowy and windy conditions are likely over the Sierra passes above 7,500 feet starting Wednesday morning. The combination of snow and wind could reduce visibility significantly at high elevations. At lower elevations, roads will be wet \u201cand will be initially slick as road residue, like oil, begins to wash off paved surfaces,\u201d the Weather Service noted. Closures are likely at the Ebbetts, Sonora and Tioga passes in the Sierra Mountains this week.\n\nUp to a foot of snow could fall on the high elevations in the Central Sierra this week.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay area, rain begins Tuesday night and lasts through Thanksgiving Day. In Southern California, showers are possible starting Wednesday afternoon, and rain is likely Wednesday night. Most of the precipitation should clear out by Thursday in Los Angeles, but there\u2019s a chance of lingering showers through Thanksgiving night."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Macedonia formally demands return of fugitive ex-premier", "description": "Macedonia's Foreign Ministry has summoned Hungary's ambassador to formally demand that the government in Budapest rejects an asylum application by fugitive former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-formally-demands-return-of-fugitive-ex-premier/2018/11/19/3ea556dc-ec2b-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:45:12Z", "content": "SKOPJE, Macedonia Macedonias Foreign Ministry has summoned Hungarys ambassador to formally demand that the government in Budapest reject an asylum application by fugitive former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.

The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia and targeted vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nThe draft resolution condemns the targeting of civilians and civilian buildings, \u201cthe unlawful military use of civilian infrastructure\u201d and drone and missile attacks by the Houthis against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also expresses concern at reports of civilians being used as human shields.\n\nIt welcomes the coalition\u2019s recent de-escalation in Hodeida and calls on the Houthis \u201cto respond in kind in order to allow urgent deliveries of assistance and flows of lifesaving commercial imports.\u201d It also welcomes \u201cthe renewed commitment from the Yemeni parties to work on a political solution\u201d under Griffiths\u2019 leadership.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned the council on Oct. 23 that Yemen\u2019s economic crisis and escalating conflict had pushed the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation closer to famine than ever before, and on Friday he again urged its members to take action now.\n\nLowcock said the Security Council should urge the parties to negotiate an end to the conflict and the international community to boost aid. He also called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nThe draft resolution calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Hodeida governorate and to missile and drone attacks and for all bureaucratic roadblocks to the delivery of humanitarian aid to be removed within two weeks.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the U.N.

(Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 A federal judge grilled the Justice Department on Monday over President Trump\u2019s new asylum ban but did not immediately rule on an urgent request from advocacy groups to halt it.\n\nThe lawsuit targets Trump\u2019s declaration this month that only people who cross at legal checkpoints on the southern border may request asylum. Those who cross elsewhere, the government said, can seek a temporary form of protection that is much harder to qualify for and does not lead to U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe Trump administration issued the new rule as a large caravan of Central American migrants was headed to the border and the president continued to fume about the thousands of families crossing into the United States each month.\n\nThe migrants say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home. But Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart told U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar there is a \u201ccrushing strain\u201d of migrants attempting to cross the border illegally and asking for asylum as a way to stay indefinitely. He said most asylum claims are \u201cultimately meritless.\u201d\n\nTigar questioned the administration\u2019s account, noting that border apprehensions are near historic lows and that federal law says anyone on U.S. soil can apply for asylum \u2014 regardless of how they got there.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left of that expression of congressional intent?\u201d the judge asked.\n\n\n\nU.S. authorities fill the Tijuana River with sand mounds and concertina wire at the border line between Mexico and the United States. (Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n[Central American caravan: Here\u2019s what you need to know]\n\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the administration is overstepping its authority. He called the dispute \u201ca classic separation-of-powers case.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day we are learning about individuals who are in serious danger, individuals who have very strong asylum claims who are not being allowed to apply for asylum,\u201d said Gelernt, one of the attorneys representing advocacy groups in the lawsuit.\n\nFederal officials have said the president has broad powers to protect the borders and national security. When he announced the asylum rules this month, Trump invoked the same authority that ultimately allowed him to impose a travel ban on migrants from mostly Muslim-majority nations. After earlier versions were blocked in court, the Supreme Court upheld a modified version of the ban by a 5-to-4 vote in June.\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs said the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 1.25 million fewer people at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal 2018 than it did in fiscal 2000. But the ACLU acknowledged in court that a fairly small fraction of the thousands of asylum claims filed in recent years have actually been granted.\n\nTo Stewart, these numbers illustrate that large number of immigrants are abusing the asylum system and that the new rule is needed to discourage people from crossing unlawfully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that the rule will discourage people from entering the country to make asylum claims,\u201d Tigar said to Stewart. \u201cBut how does that make it more likely that the claims that are presented will be meritorious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rule encourages people with strong claims to follow the process,\u201d Stewart said.\n\n[The caravan is like a small town. But it\u2019s a town under pressure.]\n\nTigar also asked whether legal ports of entry had adequate staffing. \u201cAre ports of entry capable of processing additional asylum seekers, or are they backed up?\u201d\n\nStewart answered that resources could be shifted, \u201cand presumably the process could be faster.\u201d\n\nHe sought to reassure the judge that those who cross the border illegally could still seek protection, just not the permanent refuge and U.S. citizenship that asylum provides.\n\n\u201cA theme in the ACLU\u2019s briefing is that this returns people to persecutors and torturers,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt does no such thing.\u201d\n\nTigar asked whether the effect of the new rule \u201cmight be some persons who are subject to torture . . . won\u2019t get relief?\u201d\n\nThe ACLU and others say in the lawsuit that the administration violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by swiftly pushing through the new rules.\n\n\u201cIf this rule stays in effect, people are going to die,\u201d Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said after the hearing. \u201cThere are going to be people who fall through the cracks in our system.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, advocates say migrants \u201ccannot reasonably\u201d go to a legal checkpoint because many do not know they even exist or how to find them along the 2,000-mile border.\n\n[With a broken immigration system, here\u2019s one way into America]\n\nEven at legal checkpoints, advocates allege, border officials are increasingly turning migrants away or forcing them to wait in long lines. The nation\u2019s biggest border crossing \u2014 in California at San Ysidro, across from Tijuana \u2014 was closed Monday for several hours.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials said 6,000 people in Tijuana are waiting to enter the United States, with another 1,600 more than 100 miles east in the border city of Mexicali. In all, 8,500 to 10,500 people are at the border or en route.\n\nIn a separate legal action Monday, ACLU lawyers asked a federal judge in Washington to block the government from enforcing a June opinion by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that said foreigners generally will not be eligible for asylum based on domestic abuse or gang violence.\n\nThe lawsuit also asks the judge to allow migrants to return to the United States if they were deported because of the new rules.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan did not say how or when he would rule, taking the issue under advisement. Sullivan in August temporarily blocked the deportation of 12 immigrants represented by the ACLU in the case. On Monday, he signaled that he was open to a wider, more permanent ban.\n\nAt a hearing this summer, Sullivan ordered the U.S. government to \u201cturn that plane around\u201d when he learned that it was deporting a mother and her daughter even as her lawyers were arguing in court in her behalf.\n\nTrump administration officials say the rising number of families crossing the border is a smuggling tactic that migrants use to gain entry into the United States because of legal limits on how long the federal government can detain children.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s pledge to halt illegal immigration, his administration has been forced to release thousands of families to await deportation hearings, which can take months or years in the backlogged immigration courts.\n\nAckerman is a freelance reporter based in Oakland, Calif.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nMid-November brought an early round of snow to Washington. Might early December produce another?\n\nYou may have seen rumors on social media about a cold, stormy pattern developing toward the end of this month. There\u2019s a kernel of truth to them.\n\nYes, the pattern to end November and December is one to pay attention to. But while snow lovers can have fun fantasizing about what it might deliver, it\u2019s important to understand model projections 10 days or more into the future are often quite wrong.\n\nAs we discussed in our winter outlook, the developing El Ni\u00f1o tilts the odds slightly toward above-average snow in our region. But by themselves, El Ni\u00f1os are poor predictors of how much snow we\u2019ll get. While six of our 10 snowiest winters have occurred during El Ni\u00f1os, so have our two least-snowy winters.\n\nFor a snowy winter or a snowy stretch of time, we really need to see a very specific weather pattern develop at high altitudes (which can happen with or without El Ni\u00f1o) and, also, luck. Some models are hinting that such a pattern could take shape by the end of the month.\n\nHere is what this pattern looks like, composited from the 10 snowiest winters in Washington since 1950:\n\n\n\nHigh-altitude weather pattern for 10 snowiest winters in Washington since 1950. (NOAA)\n\nNote the warm colors (yellows and reds), indicating abnormally high pressure, from Iceland westward across southern Greenland to the Hudson Bay, and the cold shades (blue and purple), indicating lower-than-normal pressure, across the South and just off the East Coast. This configuration of high- and low-pressure zones is indicative of the negative phase of the North Atlantic oscillation \u2014 which is frequently associated with cold, stormy weather in our region.\n\nThe high pressure over Greenland acts as a block and helps force the jet stream south of its normal location, and that tends to produce storm tracks across the Southern states. Such a southerly storm track also helps park high pressure to our north that can lock in cold air, giving us a better chance of getting snow instead of rain.\n\nThe European modeling system of the high-altitude pattern for the week of Nov. 25 to Dec. 2 has a pattern not too dissimilar to the pattern from our top 10 snowiest winters.\n\n\n\nHigh-altitude weather pattern over North America from Nov. 25 to Dec. 2 predicted by European modeling system. (WeatherBell.com)\n\nNote all the orange shades indicating above-normal pressures across Canada extending across Greenland. The negative phase of the North Atlantic oscillation and Greenland block are present. The match between the predicted upcoming pattern and our past snowy winters is not perfect but close enough to start paying attention.\n\nWhile the map above shows the pattern in place during the 10 snowiest winters, let\u2019s also look at the pattern a day before 10 big individual snowstorms (eight inches or more) since 1950, which gives a clearer signal of some of the specific features required:\n\n\n\nHigh-altitude weather pattern associated with 10 snowiest winters in Washington. (NOAA)\n\nNote when you look at the pattern favorable for snow at close range, certain aspects of the pattern stand out more strongly. There are two zones of abnormally low pressure: one south of Nova Scotia (near 50 degrees longitude and 50 degrees latitude, sometimes called the 50-50 low); and another centered near the lower Mississippi Valley.\n\nThe northern of these two low-pressure zones helps lock in high pressure over New England, which funnels cold air into our region. Meanwhile, the low-pressure zone over the lower Mississippi Valley provides the energy for the storm that turns into a snowmaker. If forecasters see this pattern in computer simulations within a few days of a predicted winter storm, the excitement factor ramps up exponentially.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re seeing a possible signal for such a pattern 324 hours into the future (around Dec. 1 or 2) in the European modeling system:\n\n\n\nHigh-altitude weather pattern predicted by European modeling system for Dec. 1 at 7 p.m. Eastern. (WeatherBell.com)\n\nBut at such long lead time, the key features are not as pronounced as in the day-before maps from actual events shown above. However, you still see the low-pressure zones south and east of the Canadian Maritimes and another area of blue over the lower Mississippi Valley.\n\nIf this forecast was an 84-hour projection instead of one way out in la-la land, I\u2019d be starting to sound the alarm bells for snow. But no way, this far out.\n\nYes, the model forecasts toward the first week of December are interesting and fun to fantasize about, if you like snow, but probably still don\u2019t have the details right. But don\u2019t take the forecasts very seriously.

Her Conservatives don\u2019t have a parliamentary majority, and whether she can persuade enough lawmakers to back the agreement is uncertain.\n\nIt is also unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal when it is put to a vote, likely next month.\n\nMay\u2019s government relies for survival on the votes of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which struck a deal last year to back the Conservatives on major legislation, including finance bills. But the DUP opposes the Brexit deal\u2019s plans for keeping the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland open after Britain leaves the bloc.\n\nIn a warning to May, DUP lawmakers abstained Monday during several votes on the government\u2019s finance bill.\n\nMay argues that abandoning the plan, with Britain\u2019s March 29 departure date just over four months away, could lead to Brexit being delayed or abandoned, or to a disorderly and economically damaging \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit.\n\nBut opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said his lawmakers would vote against May\u2019s agreement and also try to block a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit.\n\nThe agreement also must be approved by the European Parliament. Manfred Weber, who leads the EU legislature\u2019s largest group, said the initial assessment of the center-right European People\u2019s Party was \u201cvery encouraging, very positive.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cit must be clear to our British partners that there will be no renegotiation of this text that is now on the table.\u201d\n\nLuxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the deal \u201cis the best one possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no better one for this crazy Brexit,\u201d Asselborn said as EU foreign ministers met in Brussels before the Sunday summit of member country leaders at which the bloc intends to sign off on the deal.\n\nMost contentious negotiating issues have been resolved, but Spain insisted at the Brussels meeting that it needed more clarity on how Gibraltar, the British territory at the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, would be dealt with.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU foreign ministers \u201chave agreed to the principle\u201d of a one-off extension of the post-Brexit transition period if the two sides need more time to finalize a trade deal.\n\nUnder the divorce agreement, Britain would be bound by EU rules during the transition. It is due to end in December 2020 but can be extended by mutual agreement if more time is needed.\n\nBarnier wouldn\u2019t give a specific end-date for the extension. It\u2019s a delicate issue for May, because some in her party worry the extension could be used to trap Britain in the EU\u2019s rules indefinitely.\n\nMay says any extension must be finished before the next U.K. election, scheduled for the first half of 2022.\n\nMay tried to build public and business support for the deal on Monday, telling business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry that it \u201cfulfills the wishes of the British people\u201d to leave the EU, by taking back control of the U.K.\u2019s laws, money and borders.\n\nMay confirmed the government\u2019s plan to end the automatic right of EU citizens to live and work in the U.K., saying Britain\u2019s future immigration policy will be based on skills, rather than nationality.\n\nShe said EU nationals would no longer be able to \u201cjump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi\u201d \u2014 a phrase that risked further upsetting EU citizens in Britain, who have faced more than two years of uncertainty about their future status.\n\nBritish businesses, longing for an end to uncertainty about what rules they will face after Brexit, have broadly welcomed the agreement. But some are unhappy with the immigration plans, which have yet to be revealed in detail.\n\nCarolyn Fairbairn of the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to make \u201ca false choice between high- and low-skilled workers\u201d that would leave many sectors short-staffed.\n\nMay said she was confident the deal \u201cwill work for the U.K.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let no one be in any doubt - I am determined to deliver it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Brussels, Austria\u2019s minister for Europe, Gernot Bluemel, struck a more melancholy tone.\n\n\u201cA painful week in European politics is starting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the divorce papers on the table; 45 years of difficult marriage are coming to an end.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRaf Casert reported from Brussels.\n\n___\n\nSee the AP\u2019s Brexit coverage at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

DeGette (D-Colo.) had challenged Rep. James E. Clyburn (\u2026 [+2743 chars]", "fulltext": "Sixteen Democrats said Monday that they will oppose Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speaker, an act of defiance that puts the dissidents on the cusp of forcing a seismic leadership shake-up as the party prepares to take the majority.\n\nTheir pledge to oppose Pelosi, delivered in a letter to Democratic colleagues, comes as the California congresswoman has marshaled a legion of supporters to make her case. She is courting members in one-on-one conversations while securing the backing of allies on and off Capitol Hill.\n\nOn Monday, the International Association of Fire Fighters; UnidosUS, a leading Latino civil rights organization; and nine military veterans serving in the House endorsed her return as speaker. Meanwhile, at a town hall meeting in Massachusetts, a leader of her opposition in the House was confronted by dozens of pro-Pelosi protesters.\n\nThe insurrection against Pelosi stands as the only official obstacle to unity in the top leadership ranks, after Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) on Monday withdrew her challenge for the No. 3 job held by Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), and Pelosi endorsed her leadership team. But the renegades\u2019 threat is considerable.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Leader Pelosi for her years of service to our Country and to our Caucus,\u201d her opponents wrote. \u201cHowever, we also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran on and won on a message of change.\u201d\n\nPelosi, 78, has expressed complete confidence that she will retake the speaker\u2019s gavel in January \u2014 eight years after she lost it following massive Republican gains in the 2010 midterms and 16 years after she was first elevated to the top Democratic leadership post in the House.\n\nPelosi is the only speaker candidate who has declared ahead of a party nominating vote on Nov. 28, with a vote of the full House on Jan. 3. But her opponents believe that an alternative will emerge if it becomes clear Pelosi does not have the 218 votes needed to win in January.\n\nDrew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, said Monday that she \u201cremains confident in her support among members and members-elect\u201d and noted that more than 90 percent of the incoming Democratic caucus declined to sign the letter.\n\nTwo Democratic aides said Pelosi inquired with at least one incoming member about whether they would be willing to vote present \u2014 a move that would lower the threshold for becoming speaker while also allowing Pelosi\u2019s critics to keep their word in opposing her. Hammill declined to comment on whether Pelosi is exploring that possibility.\n\nThe signers of the letter might not be able to force Pelosi out themselves, but there is at least a handful of Democrats who plan to oppose her but did not sign the letter.\n\nThe size of the Democratic majority remains in flux, but Democrats have won 232 seats, according to the Associated Press, with four races still undecided. If the current leads hold in those uncalled races, Democrats will have won 234 seats \u2014 a 17-seat majority.\n\n[Does Pelosi have the votes to become speaker?]\n\nThat means Pelosi could lose as many as 16 Democratic votes when she stands for election as speaker Jan. 3. Two of the 16 signers, Anthony Brindisi (New York) and Ben McAdams (Utah), have yet to be declared winners.\n\nAlso signing the letter were Reps. Jim Cooper (Tenn.), Bill Foster (Ill.), Seth Moulton (Mass.), Brian Higgins (N.Y.), Stephen F. Lynch (Mass.), Ed Perlmutter (Colo.), Kathleen Rice (N.Y.), Tim Ryan (Ohio), Linda T. S\u00e1nchez (Calif.), Kurt Schrader (Ore.), Filemon Vela (Tex.), and newly elected members Joe Cunningham (S.C.), Max Rose (N.Y.) and Jeff Van Drew (N.J.).\n\nNot signing the letter was Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), who has publicly opposed Pelosi and is mulling a run against her.\n\nA spokesman for Fudge said Monday that she was unavailable for an interview and spending time in her congressional district in the Cleveland area, adding that her final decision on the speaker race is not expected until after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nA Fudge associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said it was unclear why Fudge did not sign the letter but that the lawmaker was deliberately keeping a low profile this week as she continues to think through her possible candidacy, with the travel and fundraising of the job weighing on her and potentially pushing her away from running.\n\nMoulton, one of the leaders of the insurrection, stayed in close touch with fellow Pelosi critics on Monday, including a call with Fudge, who has been his mentor in the House, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Moulton continues to encourage her to run, the person said.\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Amesbury, Mass., Monday night, Moulton heard an earful from Pelosi supporters \u2014 including about 20 organized protesters who held signs reading \u201cI Stand With Nancy.\u201d Many of them saw sexism and ageism in the push to oust Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI almost feel like I\u2019m targeted \u2014 I\u2019m old and I\u2019m a woman,\u201d said Lynda Christian, 80, of nearby Burlington, Mass. \u201cNancy Pelosi, I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s done a fantastic job. Who fires somebody who does something well?\u201d\n\nAddressing the sometimes testy crowd, Moulton said it would be \u201cfailing the American people\u201d to keep Pelosi in place after 16 years in charge.\n\n\u201cThe American people cried out for change in this election,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington isn\u2019t working, and we need a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nFive other Democrats \u2014 Rep. Conor Lamb (Pa.) and Reps.-elect Jason Crow (Colo.), Jared Golden (Maine), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Abigail Spanberger (Va.) \u2014 have made firm statements saying they would not vote for Pelosi but did not sign the letter.\n\nRepresentatives for Crow, Lamb and Spanberger each said Monday that their positions on Pelosi had not changed and that they intend to vote against her in the January floor vote.\n\nGolden said the same in an interview, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s your vote, not signing a piece of paper, that counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to pass the torch to new leaders in the Democatic Party, and I stand by that, and I\u2019m going to vote that way in caucus and on the House floor,\u201d he said.\n\n[Trump again offers GOP votes to make Pelosi speaker. This time it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s joking.]\n\nIn her conversations with individual members, Pelosi has started inquiring about their policy priorities and committee assignment preferences. The Democratic Caucus gives its top leader wide leeway to make those decisions, crucial to a lawmaker\u2019s legislative career.\n\nShe has also met with key subgroups within the caucus, including hearing out the left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus and the more centrist New Democrat Coalition. Both groups expect to have scores of Democrats in their ranks next year.\n\nThe Progressive Caucus issued a statement last week supportive of Pelosi, citing her pledge to help appoint caucus members to coveted committees such as Appropriations, Financial Services, and Ways and Means.\n\nThe New Democrats are pressing Pelosi for rules changes to ensure lawmakers have time to read bills and that operations in the House are more transparent, and Pelosi attended a meeting of the group Friday during which she was pressed on the need to shield centrist members from politically perilous votes.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the chairman of the coalition, cited the cap-and-trade climate bill that House Democrats passed in 2009, only to see it languish in the Senate. Many Republican challengers used the bill in their campaign to oust Democratic incumbents the next year.\n\n\u201cThe culture of our caucus is very progressive, as it should be. But we need to make sure that we don\u2019t do things which damage the electoral prospects of the people who gave us the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she heard us loud and clear.\u201d\n\nDeGette had challenged Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in House leadership, for the majority whip post. But facing a backlash from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, DeGette dropped her bid \u2014 ensuring, for now, that Clyburn will remain in the top ranks.\n\nAny major shake-up in the Democratic leadership now depends on whether the dissidents can muster the votes to keep Pelosi from seizing the House speaker\u2019s gavel in January. If that bid is successful, it could kick off a wholesale scramble that could also threaten Clyburn, the current assistant Democratic leader, and Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who is seeking to move from whip to majority leader.\n\nDeGette, who has long served as chief deputy whip, launched her campaign after the Nov. 6 election by touting her experience in rounding up support for difficult pieces of legislation \u2014 implicitly making the case that Clyburn, 78, was not up to or interested in the task.\n\nBut the challenge upset backers of Clyburn, a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman and a revered figure among the caucus\u2019s roughly 50 African Americans \u2014 who bristled at the notion that the caucus\u2019s top tier could be all white.\n\n\u201cOut of the three of the leadership positions, he is the only one with announced opposition,\u201d Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the current Congressional Black Caucus chair, said last week. \u201cI just think it is offensive and insulting.\u201d\n\nDevi Lockwood in Amesbury, Mass., contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Philip Bump", "title": "Cable news networks spend far more time talking about hurricanes than wildfires", "description": "It's not all about East Coast bias.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cable-news-networks-spend-far-more-time-talking-about-hurricanes-than-wildfires/2018/11/19/f9577a7b-f47d-4b63-8ed4-fa43f64487ba_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:56:52Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\n\nFirefighters battle the Camp Fire in Northern California. (U.S. Forest Service/National Wildfire Coordinating Group/EPA-EFE/REX) (Usfs/Nwcg Handout/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nOne of the imbalances that exists in any news coverage is that an anticipated event can spawn a massive amount of speculation while coverage of the event itself is more constrained. Consider the 2018 midterm elections: Newspapers, websites and cable news networks spent months assessing what was likely to happen, who would control which chambers, how President Trump would respond \u2014 and then the events happened and coverage moved to a single track, looking at what happened.\n\nThat alone can help explain some of the unevenness in how natural disasters are covered.\n\nIn the wake of the Camp Fire in Northern California, which has killed at least 76 people, with hundreds missing, there has been a common criticism on social media that the wildfire \u2014 and wildfires in general \u2014 receive much less coverage than hurricanes on cable news. Analysis of closed-captioning data collected by the Internet Archive makes clear that this perception is accurate.\n\nLooking at four hurricanes \u2014 Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017 and Michael this year \u2014 we pulled data on the density of hurricane coverage on every day following the formation of the storms. Of the four, Maria got the least coverage in the days after formation, with Irma receiving the highest density of coverage on cable news networks.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWe can compare that with coverage of three major wildfire events in the past year: the Camp Fire, fires in Southern California last winter and the Mendocino Complex Fire from this summer, the largest on record in the state.\n\nThe scale on the vertical axis of all of the graphs in this article is the same.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWe used \u201cwildfire\u201d instead of \u201cfire\u201d in these searches, because the latter term is more common for non-wildfire-related uses. Using \u201cfire\u201d increases the responses, but they are still dwarfed by responses for \u201churricane.\"\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Camp Fire is the deadliest fire in the history of California. On Fox News and MSNBC, the peak density of coverage through Sunday has never matched the lowest density of coverage on those networks in the first two weeks after the formation of Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nWhy that imbalance? A few likely reasons.\n\nForecasting. Notice that the peaks in hurricane coverage happened in concert with or before the storms making landfall in the United States. As with the election, cable networks could spend days before the landfall anticipating where the storm would go and what its effects could be. Regardless of whether the storms caused massive damage, there was plenty of time to speculate that they might. Lots of visuals of hurricanes spinning toward land, past damage and so on.\n\nThe Camp Fire \u2014 unfortunately for its victims \u2014 offered no such period of forewarning. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s horrifying description of the fire\u2019s emergence makes clear that the period between the fire\u2019s ignition and its overwhelming the town of Paradise was a matter of hours. There was no warning even in the areas affected by the fire on the same day, much less for days in advance.\n\nScale. The Mendocino Complex Fire was the largest on record in California, burning more than 717 square miles. The hardest-hit areas of Hurricane Harvey, by contrast, spanned 23,000 square miles. What\u2019s more, the days leading up to Harvey\u2019s landfall (or any hurricane\u2019s landfall) meant a much larger range of possibly affected areas. Irma\u2019s landfall was projected at one point to make landfall near Tampa, a major metropolitan area.\n\nBy other metrics, hurricanes are much more dangerous, as well. Irma was responsible for more than 90 deaths in the United States. The Mendocino Complex Fire resulted in one. More than 12,000 buildings have been destroyed by the Camp Fire to date; Harvey caused an estimated $125 billion in damage.\n\nBias. Which isn\u2019t to say that the coverage reflects what it should. Part of the reason Irma received as much coverage as it did was that it closely followed Hurricane Harvey, and the possibility that two sections of the continental United States might see massive damage from hurricanes. That hype cycle bolstered hurricane coverage in the run-up to Irma. But when Maria emerged shortly after, far from the mainland, coverage sagged.\n\nMaria, of course, was far deadlier than either Harvey or Irma.\n\nEven within California, some evidence of imbalanced coverage exists. Here are mentions by network of Paradise, the small city in Northern California that was gutted by the Camp Fire, vs. coverage of Malibu, a more-populated and better-known area currently threatened by the Woolsey Fire.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nParadise received more coverage, but Malibu\u2019s coverage was disproportionate to the scale of damage. That many celebrities live in Malibu probably played a role in that divergence.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing in this admittedly grim analysis is another important factor: the effects of the fire in Northern California on cities there. San Francisco and San Jose \u2014 the 10th-largest city in the country \u2014 have seen more than a week of dangerously unhealthy air quality, thanks to smoke from the Camp Fire.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area has had 10 continuous days of dangerously unhealthy air quality from the devastating November wildfires.

We have to have action married to that faith.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t believe that you are trying to cast aspersions or cause me to say anything, but what I am being clear about is that I\u2019m choosing my words very carefully because words have meaning. . . .\n\nTAPPER: I want to just give you an opportunity to answer this, because this is going to be the big question coming out of this interview.\n\nPresident Trump, based on no evidence, cast all sorts of aspersions on the election in Florida, and what was going on with the recounts and what was going on with the counts. He alleged fraud. He alleged theft. And he was criticized widely by Democrats and Republicans for doing so.\n\nHow is what you\u2019re doing any different from what he did?\n\nABRAMS: My accusations are based entirely on evidence.\n\nWe had four different federal judges in the course of a week say that what we witnessed was wrong and forced better behavior.\n\nAnd what I\u2019m simply asking for is another court to force even stronger behaviors, legal reforms that will guarantee that no one has to question the legitimacy of our election.\n\nDan Gasaway is a Republican who lost a Republican primary because they failed to adequately provide ballots that were accurate. That was under Brian Kemp\u2019s watch.\n\nAnd so this is not something that simply affected Democrats. This is not partisan. The head of the tea party in Georgia, Debbie Dooley, pointed out the gross mismanagement of how we administer absentee ballots."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Felicia Sonmez", "title": "Senate Democrats sue to block Trump\u2019s acting attorney general Matt Whitaker", "description": "\u201cInstalling Matthew Whitaker so flagrantly defies constitutional law that any viewer of School House Rock would recognize it,\u201d Sen.

Others, including the trio of senators who filed Monday\u2019s lawsuit, have argued that Whitaker\u2019s appointment violates the Constitution because Whitaker, who worked as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, is not a Senate-confirmed official.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment also faces a lawsuit filed by Maryland Attorney General Brian E.

(Zakeria Hashimi/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt was 3 a.m. when the loudspeaker at the village mosque crackled to life. An elder was calling everyone to come quickly. Taliban forces had just attacked a neighboring village, he said, and there was no time to lose.\n\nMurtaza Nasiri, 23, recalled later that he was among those who immediately volunteered to help defend their village, Haider, located in the long-peaceful ethnic \u00adShiite Hazara heartland of Ghazni province. Nasiri had grown up there, and he was studying to be an economist.\n\nHe had never held a gun in his life. But suddenly he found himself being handed a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and following a group of men up the forested hills, where they began firing toward the insurgents. He had no idea how to handle the weapon, so someone else grabbed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI had never experienced anything like this before,\u201d Nasiri said, bursting into tears as he recounted the harrowing Nov. 6 attack.\n\nNasiri\u2019s family and at least 1,000 others have fled to Bamian, a city 200 miles to the north, from a ferocious assault on their villages across Jaghori and Malistan \u2014 two Hazara-dominated districts in Ghazni \u2014 as well as a third in next-door Uruzgan province. The violence, which continued for two weeks and left more than 100 dead, took residents and police by surprise. Afghan forces ultimately quelled the assault and pushed the Taliban out of the villages, but sporadic fighting continues.\n\nUntil now, Shiite Hazara communities in Ghazni had remained untouched. But as the Taliban, a mainly Pashtun and Sunni militant group, has expanded its territory across the country \u2014 leaving just 55 percent of Afghan districts under government control or influence \u2014 it has launched daring attacks to seize control of Hazara and Shiite strongholds in central Afghanistan.\n\nThe Hazara, the third-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, suffered persecution by successive Pashtun-led regimes, including the Taliban, which executed them en masse. With the fall of the Taliban came opportunities for education and jobs for the minority group.\n\nBefore the recent attacks, the Taliban had steered clear of Hazara villages, in part because the militant group has little local support in those areas and would not be able to maintain control without it. But now that the Taliban controls large parts of the country, its attacks have become more daring.\n\nIn its most significant attack on a major city in three years, the Taliban besieged the provincial capital, Ghazni city, in August. According to local leaders, insurgents had met with Jaghori elders in recent months, asking them to accept Taliban rule, but had been strongly rejected.\n\n\n\nVehicles travel on the highway between Ghazni and Kabul in October. (Zakeria Hashimi/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe unexpected attacks came as Taliban leaders expressed interest in reconciliation and attended peace discussions in Moscow and Qatar. Analysts said they expect the insurgents to keep up an aggressive battlefield campaign to drive a harder bargain.\n\nIn Nasiri\u2019s village and several others, local armed men held off the Taliban fighters for several days while the government sent in hundreds of army troops, including special operations forces, to counter the wave of attacks.\n\nBut on Nov. 11, local witnesses and officials said, a single Taliban raid on Hotqol village left 23 Afghan special forces members dead, along with dozens of local fighters. Villagers interviewed in Bamian described seeing bodies piled onto a truck. Many said they decided to flee soon after.\n\nOne of those who made the hazardous drive north, over rugged roads and mountain passes in freezing cold and rain, was Shafiqa Rezai, 29. A midwife in Angori village, she was on night duty Nov. 6 when the gunfire began. By early morning, she said, three corpses and 18 wounded people had arrived.\n\nAfter hiding at home for a week while the fighting came closer, Rezai said, she and her family decided to escape. They drove for three days and nights in a convoy of six cars before reaching Bamian, a Hazara stronghold.\n\n\u201cI cried all the way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe left everything behind.\u201d\n\n\n\nEthnic Hazara from Afghanistan\u2019s Malistan and Jaghori districts take shelter at a mosque after fleeing their homes and arriving in Ghazni city Nov. 12.

Local agencies also offered medical checkups and blankets.\n\nIn interviews here last week, displaced people from Jaghori and Malistan described their home districts as havens of calm and development for the Hazara during the past 17 years, with almost no interference from insurgents. They said there was little crime and schools for both boys and girls.\n\nThat tranquil atmosphere was abruptly shattered with the recent attacks. Schools and markets closed, cellphone towers were destroyed, and some village militia fighters are still missing.\n\nOne militiaman who fled to Bamian, Habibullah Ahmadi, 48, said he had lost faith that the government would protect them. Several others said that Taliban representatives had told villagers they wouldn\u2019t be harmed if they stayed indoors but that nobody trusted them.\n\nSome of the displaced said they were thinking of resettling in Bamian, where they have been welcomed in homes and mosques. After the Taliban captured Hotqol, the managers of an orphanage in the nearby Jaghori district center managed to transport all 120 children to a branch of the same organization in Bamian, where they may remain.\n\n\u201cWe were really worried the insurgents might harm or even take the children\u201d if the district fell, said Ghulam Hussain Matin, director of the Shuhada nonprofit, which runs both orphanages, as a group of children played volleyball in the yard outside. \u201cThe sounds of explosions and bullets can also do them psychological harm.\u201d\n\n\n\nDisplaced Afghans rest after fleeing from Jaghori district to escape ongoing battles between Taliban and Afghan security forces in Ghazni on Nov. 15.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) with President Trump. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nOpinion writer\n\nOne of the most revealing sidelights to the recent Florida recounts was to see Sen. Marco Rubio tossing off conspiracy-mongering tweets about missing ballots and stolen votes, a positively Trumpian display that more than a few people who once admired Rubio found disheartening. Sean Sullivan reports:\n\nJust four years ago, Marco Rubio was gearing up to run for president with an inclusive and sunny message designed to capture the imagination of a modernizing Republican Party \u2014 and maybe even the country. Those days, and that candidate, are long gone. Like many Republicans, the second-term Florida senator has sounded more and more like President Trump since the 2016 election \u2014 striking a notably darker and foreboding tone while adopting some of Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn political tactics and controversial positions.\n\nThis could be an object lesson in the moral perils of political survival, a story about how easy it is for a politician to lose his soul if he cares too much about one day reaching the brass ring of the presidency. But Marco Rubio\u2019s story is also a microcosm of everything that has happened to the Republican Party over the past decade \u2014 its promise and its shameful descent.\n\nIn fact, you can get an almost-complete understanding of that history just by marking Rubio\u2019s highs and lows, his setbacks and ill-fated reinventions.\n\nRubio won election to the Senate in 2010 as part of the tea party wave and was immediately hailed as a future star. He was intensely conservative but lacked the off-putting hard edge of so many of his ideological compatriots. Many believed he was the person who could sell Reagan-style conservatism to a changing America. Eloquent and charismatic, Rubio was young (only 39 at the time), bilingual and more tuned in to pop culture than your average senator. He liked to quote hip-hop lyrics on the Senate floor.\n\nNot long after the presidential election of 2012, which many Republicans felt Mitt Romney lost in no small part because of his harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric, Rubio appeared on the cover of Time magazine under the headline, \u201cThe Republican Savior.\u201d The accompanying article said, \u201cGOP leaders know they have a demographic problem. They hope Rubio can help provide the solution, which is why they\u2019ve chosen him to deliver the response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Feb. 12\u2014in English and Spanish.\u201d\n\nRubio worked hard with the bipartisan Gang of 8 to produce an immigration bill everyone could live with, one that included both increased border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThen came the backlash. The immigration bill passed the Senate in June 2013 but died in the House, and Rubio found himself the target of withering contempt from many of the same right-wing media figures who had celebrated him so recently but now portrayed him as an advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. So when he decided to run for president in 2015, he thought he could repudiate the bill he helped write, advocate a tougher stance on immigration and use his firm conservatism on every other issue to convince the GOP base that he could still be their champion.\n\nBut he still misunderstood where the party was. \u201cThe time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century,\u201d he said in the speech announcing his candidacy. \u201cYesterday is over, and we are never going back.\u201d\n\nThen Donald Trump happened, and the problem for Rubio wasn\u2019t just Trump himself but what he revealed about the Republican electorate. It turned out they weren\u2019t looking for someone who could sell conservatism to a changing America. Instead, \u201cgoing back\u201d was precisely what they wanted. Only one candidate told them he could make America everything it was when they were young, especially that he could get rid of all the immigrants they so despised.\n\nThe most emblematic moment of Rubio\u2019s fall may have come in an ad, little noticed at the time, that he ran as his fortunes were declining during the primaries. In the ad, Rubio says, \u201cThis election is about the essence of America, about all of us who feel out of place in our own country.\u201d\n\nThis was stunning, because the whole point of Rubio\u2019s entire political career had been that he doesn\u2019t feel out of place in modern America. But even he resorted to channeling the anxieties and resentments of old, white people when it became clear where the nomination battle was being fought.\n\nAnd, of course, he lost. He was supposed to be the Republican version of Barack Obama, but it turned out that wasn\u2019t what Republicans wanted at all. And now, his antennae still tuned to the party\u2019s base, he tries to be just Trumpian enough to maintain their affection in preparation for his inevitable 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut what will Rubio find when he mounts that campaign? Will the party decide its members really do need to find a way to appeal to nonwhite voters \u2014 for real this time? Or will Trump\u2019s white nationalism have become so inextricably woven into what it means to be a Republican that Rubio will find himself in the same position with primary voters that he was in 2016, unable to break through the voters\u2019 attraction toward the candidate offering the most direct appeal to their fears and hatreds?\n\nA great deal depends on whether Trump wins reelection in 2020. If he loses, Republican voters may be more open to Rubio\u2019s appeal, the loss of power convincing them that the party has to change if it\u2019s to survive. In the meantime, Rubio will keep trying, however insincerely, to give the GOP base what he thinks it wants. But he can\u2019t change who he is. Rubio was supposed to be the Republican who could sell a changing America on Reagan-style conservatism. But as long as Trump-style conservatism is what the GOP wants to sell, Rubio probably won\u2019t get the chance.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Republicans sound like they haven\u2019t learned a thing\n\nJennifer Rubin: Two GOP senators: Flake defends democracy, Rubio undermines it\n\nJennifer Rubin: Republicans used to vilify presidents who disrespected the military"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Kristine Phillips", "title": "Trump says he knows why Republicans lost: \u2018I wasn\u2019t on the ballot\u2019", "description": "\u201cI am on the ticket,\u201d President Trump told a crowd in Southaven, Miss., in October.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-fix/trump-says-he-knows-why-republicans-lost-i-wasnt-on-the-ballot/2018/11/19/98f2c1c6-f794-4845-87e1-3e73b1df1d10_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:22:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "\u201cI am on the ticket,\u201d President Trump told a crowd in Southaven, Miss., in October, as he traveled from state to state to drive home a message: He may not be on the ballot, but voters should pretend that he is.\n\n\u201cA vote for Morrisey is a vote for me,\u201d Trump said in West Virginia of state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who was defeated by incumbent Sen.

In the same interview Sunday with the Fox News anchor, Trump said Republicans lost because he was not the candidate.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t on the ballot,\u201d he said to Wallace. Never mind that the president spent weeks telling voters that the midterm elections were about him.\n\n[\u2018I am on the ticket\u2019: Trump seeks to make the election about him, even if some don\u2019t want it to be]\n\nWhen confronted with the post-midterm reality, the president seems to want to have it both ways. He basks in victories \u2014 his victories. But he glosses over the losses, which were not his losses because, as he said, he was not on the ballot. (Reminder: \u201cPretend I\u2019m on the ballot,\u201d Trump said a month ago.)\n\nThe midterm election was a referendum on Trump \u2014 but only where he won.\n\nIn a testy exchange with Wallace, Trump took credit for victories in Florida: \u201cLook at Florida. I went down to Florida. Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot,\u201d he said of the Florida governor who narrowly ousted Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson after several tumultuous days of recounts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn Georgia: \u201cI was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won,\u201d he said, referring to Brian Kemp, who defeated Democrat Stacy Abrams in a hard-fought and contentious gubernatorial race.\n\nAnd in Ohio: \u201cA wonderful man named DeWine is your governor of the great state of Ohio. Remember what they used to say before my election? You cannot win unless you win Ohio. I won Ohio,\u201d he said of Mike DeWine, who defeated Democrat Richard Cordray in the gubernatorial race.\n\n[House candidates campaign on their agendas, but voters vote on Trump]\n\nBut when confronted with questions about the losses \u2014 and there were many \u2014 in traditionally Republican suburbs, in red-state cities such as Houston and Oklahoma City, in three swing states, and losses among suburban women and independents, Trump refused to take the blame.\n\nPoll after poll showed that Trump was among the top factors people thought about as they voted on Nov. 6.\n\nThe Washington Post and Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University polled voters in 69 battleground congressional districts to see what they thought, how they felt and how they voted on \u2014 and before \u2015 Election Day. Forty-two percent of those polled said Trump is either the most important or the second most important issue on the vote, along with health care.\n\nA Fox News exit poll found that 63 percent of more than 116,000 voters said Trump was a factor in their vote. A CNN exit poll of more than 18,000 voters found that 95 percent of Republicans said their vote for the U.S. House was to support Trump, while 94 percent of Democrats said their vote was to oppose him.\n\nIn many of the battleground congressional districts, including in areas that Trump narrowly won in 2016, candidates tried to campaign on their agenda, but the president\u2019s shadow loomed so large that it obscured everything else. For some Republican candidates, winning meant being as Trumpian as they could possibly be and gambling on the Trump vote in a year when that vote, however enthusiastic, generated an equally enthusiastic opposition.\n\nFor some, like newly elected Florida Gov.

Joe Manchin III.\n\nNow, the results of the midterm election are clear: Voters in rural areas and deep-red states elected Trump-endorsed Senate candidates in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Texas and Tennessee \u2014 an affirmation of the president\u2019s ability to rally his base. \u201cI won the Senate,\u201d he told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nBut voters in urban and suburban areas, including in several swing states that voted for Trump in 2016, recoiled from him by rejecting Republicans in the House. In the same interview Sunday with the Fox News anchor, Trump said Republicans lost because he was not the candidate.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t on the ballot,\u201d he said to Wallace. Never mind that the president spent weeks telling voters that the midterm elections were about him.\n\n[\u2018I am on the ticket\u2019: Trump seeks to make the election about him, even if some don\u2019t want it to be]\n\nWhen confronted with the post-midterm reality, the president seems to want to have it both ways. He basks in victories \u2014 his victories. But he glosses over the losses, which were not his losses because, as he said, he was not on the ballot. (Reminder: \u201cPretend I\u2019m on the ballot,\u201d Trump said a month ago.)\n\nThe midterm election was a referendum on Trump \u2014 but only where he won.\n\nIn a testy exchange with Wallace, Trump took credit for victories in Florida: \u201cLook at Florida. I went down to Florida. Rick Scott won, and he won by a lot,\u201d he said of the Florida governor who narrowly ousted Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson after several tumultuous days of recounts and evidence-free claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn Georgia: \u201cI was the one that went for Brian, and Brian won,\u201d he said, referring to Brian Kemp, who defeated Democrat Stacy Abrams in a hard-fought and contentious gubernatorial race.\n\nAnd in Ohio: \u201cA wonderful man named DeWine is your governor of the great state of Ohio. Remember what they used to say before my election? You cannot win unless you win Ohio. I won Ohio,\u201d he said of Mike DeWine, who defeated Democrat Richard Cordray in the gubernatorial race.\n\n[House candidates campaign on their agendas, but voters vote on Trump]\n\nBut when confronted with questions about the losses \u2014 and there were many \u2014 in traditionally Republican suburbs, in red-state cities such as Houston and Oklahoma City, in three swing states, and losses among suburban women and independents, Trump refused to take the blame.\n\nPoll after poll showed that Trump was among the top factors people thought about as they voted on Nov. 6.\n\nThe Washington Post and Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University polled voters in 69 battleground congressional districts to see what they thought, how they felt and how they voted on \u2014 and before \u2015 Election Day. Forty-two percent of those polled said Trump is either the most important or the second most important issue on the vote, along with health care.\n\nA Fox News exit poll found that 63 percent of more than 116,000 voters said Trump was a factor in their vote. A CNN exit poll of more than 18,000 voters found that 95 percent of Republicans said their vote for the U.S. House was to support Trump, while 94 percent of Democrats said their vote was to oppose him.\n\nIn many of the battleground congressional districts, including in areas that Trump narrowly won in 2016, candidates tried to campaign on their agenda, but the president\u2019s shadow loomed so large that it obscured everything else. For some Republican candidates, winning meant being as Trumpian as they could possibly be and gambling on the Trump vote in a year when that vote, however enthusiastic, generated an equally enthusiastic opposition.\n\nFor some, like newly elected Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who appeared in an ad helping his daughter \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d it paid off.\n\nFor others, like the Republicans in Orange County, it didn\u2019t.\n\nRead more:\n\n3 takeaways from Trump\u2019s testy Fox News interview\n\nTrump\u2019s attack on retired admiral who led bin Laden raid escalates a war of words\n\n\u2018Takes all of the oxygen out\u2019: Trump further divides political map for 2020"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Alex Smith's injury is especially painful for those who know him best - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Alex Smith's injury is especially painful for those who know him best Washington Post As hard as any of us in journalism may try to be as objective and fair as possible, some moments make it impossible.

He was one of five quarterbacks who were the focal points of my recent book that attempts to explain what it is like to play the most scrutinized \u2014 and fragile \u2014 position in professional sports.\n\nLast season, I talked to Smith after wins and after losses, including Kansas City\u2019s heartbreaking 22-21 playoff loss to Tennessee in what turned out to be his last game with the Chiefs.\n\nNever once did he ask to postpone a meeting or a phone conversation. Never once did he bristle at a question. Chiefs Coach Andy Reid perhaps summed up Smith best after Kansas City traded him to Washington to clear a path for Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s done for Patrick can\u2019t be paid back in money,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAlex knew we drafted him to eventually replace him. But he was his mentor and his friend from the first day he got here. Then again, I wouldn\u2019t have expected anything different from him. I\u2019ve never coached a better person than Alex.\u201d\n\n[Jerry Brewer: Alex Smith wasn\u2019t carrying the Redskins. Colt McCoy doesn\u2019t have to either.]\n\nAnyone watching Smith\u2019s injury Sunday afternoon had to feel sickened by it. Those of us old enough to remember Joe Theismann\u2019s injury 33 years ago to the day will never forget the sight of Lawrence Taylor frantically signaling for help .\n\nI felt all of that and more when Smith went down Sunday. It was apparent right away that this was a life-changing, Theismann-like injury.\n\nTheismann, who was 36 when he was injured, never played again. Years ago he told me he had never looked at the play. \u201cToo painful,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even like to think about it.\u201d\n\nTheismann had no choice Sunday. He was in the stadium, and when he talked to reporters, he was clearly shaken. It was almost as if he finally saw the replay he never wanted to see.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one. Everyone on the field was clearly upset too. Medical techniques have advanced since Theismann\u2019s injury, so there\u2019s hope Smith, 34, will play again. Like Theismann, he\u2019s a mobile quarterback whose ability to make plays with his legs is one of his strengths.\n\nLast year, playing the Jets in the Meadowlands, Smith scrambled right when he couldn\u2019t find anyone open on a second-quarter play. He dodged a couple of tacklers, broke a tackle, cut away from the sideline and wasn\u2019t tackled until he\u2019d carried the ball 70 yards.\n\nHow often do you see a quarterback run for 70 yards, especially a 33-year-old quarterback?\n\n\u201cLot of joking in the quarterback room the next day about how fast I was for a white guy,\u201d he told me later.\n\nWhen I asked Reid about the play, he started laughing.\n\n\u201cFirst year he was here [2013], he took off on a run in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned to [then-quarterbacks coach] Matt [Nagy] to tell him I wanted to go two-minute on the next couple plays. He said, \u2018You might want to wait until he\u2019s finished.\u2019 I turned around and he was still running.\u201d\n\nA lot of fans and media here in Washington have not understood how important Smith was in Washington\u2019s 6-3 start. His numbers haven\u2019t been overwhelming, but before Sunday, he had avoided turnovers, a problem for Washington when Kirk Cousins was the quarterback, and in two of Washington\u2019s three defeats (New Orleans and Atlanta), the defense was hopeless.\n\nNick Foles proved last year that a competent backup can step in for a starter and win key games. Colt McCoy is certainly a competent backup. He\u2019s good enough that if Washington hadn\u2019t been able to trade for Smith during the offseason, he would have been the starter this season because the team was not going to trade up for one of the touted quarterbacks in this year\u2019s draft after what happened with Robert Griffin III.\n\nHonestly, though, I don\u2019t care one way or the other about how McCoy plays. My concern is for Smith. Yes, it\u2019s personal. He\u2019s been through enough ups and downs in his career that I know he\u2019ll deal with this one, too.\n\nIn 2012, the 49ers, who had just missed the Super Bowl a year earlier, were 6-2 when Smith suffered a concussion. Colin Kaepernick came in to replace him and played so well that Coach Jim Harbaugh couldn\u2019t take him out of the lineup. As a result, Smith watched from the sideline as the 49ers came up seven yards short of winning the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to take the team to the Super Bowl. But I understood why Jim did what he did. Kaep played great.\u201d\n\nSmith has never been a complainer and won\u2019t be now. But it is impossible not to feel \u201cgutted,\u201d as the Texans\u2019 J.J. Watt said.\n\n[Thomas Boswell: Alex Smith injury shows game\u2019s dark side comes in a blink]\n\nThe play on which Smith was injured was in no way a dirty play. It was, as Ray Lewis used to say to his teammates before games, \u201cjust football.\u201d\n\nEveryone, including Smith, understands that. It doesn\u2019t make it any easier to watch or to think about.\n\nMcCoy may be able to replace Smith when it comes to running plays on the field. But he won\u2019t be able to replace him in the locker room. A couple of weeks after Smith began organized team activities with his new team this past spring, I asked team executive Doug Williams (another quarterback featured in my book) how he was fitting in.\n\n\u201cFitting in?\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s already the leader in the locker room. Everyone is already looking up to him in there.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons trading for Smith was a good idea is because he is a \u201cyoung\u201d 34: agile and mobile in the pocket and in the kind of physical shape where there was no reason to believe he couldn\u2019t play well until he\u2019s 40.\n\nHe had his best season a year ago. Because the Chiefs had the kind of offensive weapons Washington doesn\u2019t, he did have all-pro numbers, throwing for more than 4,000 yards.\n\nThat, however, isn\u2019t the reason I want to see him make a full recovery. You might be able to argue about how good a quarterback he is. There\u2019s no arguing about how good a person he is. They don\u2019t get better than Alex Smith."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Timothy Bella, The Washington Post", "title": "NCAA relents: Lesbian college athlete disowned by parents can get outside help - Albany Times Union", "description": "Shortly after moving back onto campus in August, Emily Scheck saw that she had several text messages from her mom.

(Instagram)\n\nShortly after moving back onto campus in August, Emily Scheck saw that she had several text messages from her mom. A 19-year-old cross-country runner for Canisius College in Buffalo, the sophomore looked down in horror. She was getting disavowed by her mother for being a lesbian.\n\nHer mother had found photos on social media of Scheck with the woman she is dating and was apoplectic. Scheck had not come out to her parents, as she feared they wouldn\u2019t accept her sexual orientation, according to the Griffin, the Canisius student newspaper. As first reported by the LGBT sports website Outsports, Scheck was allegedly faced with an ultimatum from her family: Leave school, give up her partial scholarship and return home to Webster, N.Y., to go through therapy for her sexual orientation, or she would be cut out from their lives for good.\n\nWhen she indicated to her parents that she was staying at Canisius and had no interest in therapy, her father drove 85 miles to drop off her belongings: clothing, stuffed animals, trophies and even her birth certificate. He reportedly dumped her things in her car and proceeded to remove the license plates from her vehicle. The family had already removed her from their car insurance plan, according to Outsports.\n\n\u201cWell, I am done with you,\u201d Scheck\u2019s mom texted her daughter, the Buffalo News reported. \u201cAs of right now, declare yourself independent. You are on your own. Please don\u2019t contact us or your siblings.\u201d\n\nScheck needed to know: Why was this happening to her?\n\n\u201cBecause you disgust me,\u201d her mother allegedly replied.\n\nWith only $20 to her name, Scheck was desperate, working two part-time jobs while going to class and cross-country practice every day.\n\n\u201cI never would have guessed in a million years that this was something that was going to happen to me,\u201d she told the News. \u201cMy roommates, they started crying. Me too.\u201d\n\nWhen a roommate launched a GoFundMe campaign this month to raise money for Scheck to eat, live and buy books for the semester, the fundraiser generated tens of thousands of dollars in days. As of early Monday, the campaign, which had an original goal of $5,000, had raised more than $58,000 since Nov. 7.\n\nBut the 19-year-old was faced with another ultimatum last week. This time, it was from the NCAA: Give back the online donations or keep the money and lose her eligibility for college athletics. She felt she had no choice but to give up her eligibility.\n\nOn Friday, the NCAA, which has long fought against active student-athletes receiving any outside financial contributions, relented, with a rare reversal in its position: Not only could Scheck keep the donations, but she could also maintain her eligibility.\n\nEmily Scheck can retain her eligibility and continue to receive GoFundMe donations that assist her with living and educational expenses. pic.twitter.com/jut5EjPLnU \u2014 Inside the NCAA (@InsidetheNCAA) November 16, 2018\n\nThe weeks that followed her family\u2019s actions were rough. Unable to buy books, she had to borrow them from friends to study. Without license plates, her friends had to figure out where she could park without getting towed. And figuring out how she\u2019d eat was a daily struggle.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even get groceries, initially,\u201d she told the News. \u201cI was just really relying on my roommates and my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nShe told her coaches of the situation, Outsports reported, but months went by without a firm plan for how Scheck was going to find housing and money for food to survive. That\u2019s when Grace Hausladen, one of her roommates and teammates, launched a GoFundMe campaign in hopes of getting financial support for her friend. Hausladen knew there was some recent precedent for successful campaigns based on college athletes in difficult life situations. She pointed to the head injury suffered by Tennessee State football player Christion Abercrombie in September, and the NCAA later approving one of the GoFundMe accounts set up for his medical fees, the Griffin reported.\n\n\u201cShe was kicked out of her home for being herself,\u201d Hausladen wrote. \u201cNo one deserves to have their home and siblings taken away from them for being their true selves. Though she has made a new home in Buffalo through her teammates and her girlfriend, Justyna, we can no longer stand by and do nothing.\u201d She added: \u201cThis should not be happening in today\u2019s society. Help her feel accepted. Help her feel like herself.\u201d\n\nAlmost instantly, the campaign was a viral hit and initially totaled $25,000, more than enough to get her through the fall semester.\n\n\n\nEmily Scheck. (Facebook)\n\nThe success of the campaign got the attention of the NCAA and Canisius, which led to the choice of either giving back the money or losing her eligibility. It was a choice also given to Hausladen, the creator of the GoFundMe. By last week, Scheck\u2019s story had been shared across social media, with people both encouraging her to remain positive and pressuring the NCAA and school to rule in her favor. The public support apparently paid off.\n\n\u201cCanisius and the NCAA will continue to work together in support of Emily,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cShe is a member of the Canisius family and we will to do whatever we can to assist her.\u201d\n\nEven with the ruling that Scheck is allowed to keep the funding, the runner\u2019s relationship with her family remains strained.\n\n\u201cAs long as I stay in Buffalo and I don\u2019t come home, they\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m still on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nHer father, Timothy, told the News that there is more to the story than his daughter is publicly sharing, and that the family accepts her coming out. He added that the comments of disavowing her were meant to pressure her to come home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a private family matter,\u201d he said to the newspaper. \u201cWe love our daughter. We accept Emily.\u201d\n\nScheck said that the lines of communication are now open with her parents, who, she told the student newspaper, are seeing a counselor specializing in the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to give them something if they\u2019re going to therapy and working on themselves,\u201d she told the Griffin. \u201cI hope to someday have a relationship again, whatever that means.\"\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nWhite House tells Acosta his press pass will be suspended again when order expires, CNN says\n\nA look at Trump\u2019s \u2018A-plus\u2019 weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure\u2019 Calif., and Adam \u2018Schitt\u2019\n\nAnti-vaccination stronghold in N.C. hit with state\u2019s worst chickenpox outbreak in 2 decades"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "6 arrested on sex charges at Toronto all-boys school", "description": "Police have arrested six students from a prestigious private all-boys Catholic school in Toronto and charged them with sexual assault related to a video that was posted on the internet", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/6-arrested-on-sex-charges-at-toronto-all-boys-school/2018/11/19/5cc233ee-ec1f-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:20:08Z", "content": "TORONTO Police have arrested six students from a prestigious private all-boys Catholic school in Toronto and charged them with sexual assault related to a video that was posted on the internet.

After CNN filed its suit seeking restoration of Acosta\u2019s pass, Sanders said, in part: \u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor.\u201d\n\nThat argument doesn\u2019t age well. Sure, Acosta badgers the president; he grandstands; he insists on airing his followup questions; he develops quick and close relationships with microphones. But if the White House really applied this standard equally, it would be sending \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d packets to any number of mouthy correspondents. Furthermore, the White House letter to Acosta acknowledged that prior to this incident, it had no standards of conduct at press events, primarily because it didn\u2019t believe such a document was \u201cnecessary.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Acosta struck back in a Nov. 18 letter, stating that the retroactive \u201capplication of vague, unarticulated standards to a journalist\u2019s access to the White House is not only different from your original explanations, but it is the same sort of due process violation that led the district court to issue a temporary restraining order against you on Friday.\u201d The standards of behavior aren\u2019t clearly laid out, argue Acosta\u2019s counsel, and what\u2019s more: They are \u201cimpermissible in the First Amendment context because they provide no protection against content- and viewpoint-discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe weekend missive-fest demonstrates that the White House dysfunction factory won\u2019t be slowing down in anticipation of the Thanksgiving holiday. Think about this: It was about 10:30 a.m. on Friday when Kelly issued his ruling that the White House had robbed Acosta of due process in revoking his hard pass. Before Friday even came to a close, the White House somehow managed to come up with a \u201cdue process\u201d on the press-pass front. Red tape has never materialized so quickly.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know: This \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d to revoke Acosta\u2019s credentials on Nov. 16 matches the decision to revoke Acosta\u2019s credentials on Nov. 7. The brand-new process, too, requires the hard-pass deprivee to muster his appeal to the \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d over the course of a weekend, perhaps a first in the history of public-sector \u201cdue process.\u201d\n\nWhere does this go from here? Toward further farce. In their letter to Acosta, Shine and Sanders not only required a response by Sunday afternoon, but they also promised a final decision by Monday at 3:00 p.m. How a sturdy and just process could take place that quickly is a matter that the government may have to explain in court sometime soon.\n\nIn its suit against top White House officials, CNN argues that the revocation violates precedent in Sherrill v. Knight, a 1977 case finding that the \u201cFifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause protects a reporter\u2019s First Amendment liberty interest in a White House press pass,\u201d according to a summation provided by Kelly himself. When he granted CNN\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, the judge scorned the nonexistent procedures that the White House followed in banning Acosta. It\u2019s hard to see how he would validate the process, such as it is, that the White House has jury-rigged over the past few days.\n\nMaybe the White House was heartened by what was missing from Kelly\u2019s Friday ruling. At the end of his explanation, Kelly was careful to note that he wasn\u2019t ruling on First Amendment issues.\n\n\u201cEven in this circumstance, I don\u2019t take lightly the executive branch\u2019s weighty, general interest in control of its White House press [inaudible],\u201d said Kelly, who went on to stress the \u201cvery limited nature\u201d of the ruling. \u201cIn resolving this TRO, because I found it must be granted as to the due process claim, I haven\u2019t had to reach the plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment claim at all. \u2026 So I want to make very clear: I have not determined that the First Amendment has been violated here,\u201d said the judge.\n\nMaybe that was all the encouragement the White House needed to continue pressing its authoritarian campaign against one of many irksome White House beat reporters. In any case, Trump on Friday faced a clear fork in the road: He could quietly slink away from this controversy with a settlement that would likely be overshadowed by other news. Or he could loudly continue pressing a dubious and embarrassing cause that would enhance his standing as a media adversary. That he appears to have chosen the latter demonstrates that he needs Acosta like he needs Diet Cokes and retweets."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "US closes busiest Mexico border crossing for several hours", "description": "The United States has closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested the presence of thousands of Central American migrants", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-closes-busiest-mexico-border-crossing-for-several-hours/2018/11/19/7a8d842a-ec1d-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:06:39Z", "content": "TIJUANA, Mexico The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of C\u2026 [+5654 chars]", "fulltext": "An anti-migrant demonstrator is surrounded by the press as she argues with a woman during a protest against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, Sunday, Nov. 18, 2018.

(Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants.\n\nThe U.S. also closed one of two pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro crossing in a move apparently aimed at preventing any mass rush of migrants across the border.\n\nThe installation of movable, wire-topped barriers threatens to complicate life for Mexicans using San Ysidro, where about 110,000 people enter the U.S. every day in 40,000 vehicles.\n\nLong lines backed up in Tijuana, where many people have to cross the border to work on the U.S. side.\n\nSuch inconveniences prompted by the arrival of the migrant caravan may have played a role in Sunday\u2019s protests, when about 400 Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \u201cOut! Out!\u201d referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road \u2014 and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nSome Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused them of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to the city. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \u201cinvasion.\u201d And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in Tijuana,\u201d protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don\u2019t have criminal records.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don\u2019t represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: \u201cChildhood has no borders.\u201d\n\nThe protests came amid what may be a hardening of positions in some northern Mexican states against the migrants. The civil defense department of Jalisco state, where migrants pass on their way to Tijuana, said it would no longer provide shelters for migrants, citing problems with fights among migrants at a shelter last week.\n\nInstead, the state will provide water, some food and escorts at nine points along the main highway leading through the state to help ensure the migrants don\u2019t have to stop.\n\nAnd in Mexico City, authorities closed a shelter at a sports complex that had once housed thousands of migrants. The remaining 650 migrants from the third, mainly Salvadoran, caravan were taken to a Roman Catholic pilgrimage hostel at the Basilica of Guadalupe. The city said the hostel would be warmer.\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \u201cWe want them to return to Honduras,\u201d said Rivera.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city\u2019s privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \u201cWe are fleeing violence,\u201d said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \u201cHow can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S.\n\nEdwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \u201cthe U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \u201cCatch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Julie Watson contributed to this story from Tijuana and Marcos Aleman contributed from San Salvador.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nIn a search for ancient life on Mars, NASA will send its next rover to explore Jezero Crater \u2014 the site of a former delta and lake.\n\nThe rover, which is scheduled to launch in 2020, is equipped with a drilling system that can collect and store rock samples that contain clues to Mars\u2019s ancient past. Once the samples are cached, NASA hopes to send follow-up missions to retrieve the samples and return them to Earth.\n\n\u201cGetting samples from this lake-delta system will revolutionize how we think about Mars and its ability to harbor life,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for science.\n\nThe landing site selection came after years of research and days of fierce debate over the best spot to look for evidence of ancient life on an alien world. Among the alternatives being considered were Columbia Hills, an ancient hot spring that was explored by the now-defunct rover Spirit, and Northeast Syrtis, a network of ancient mesas that may have harbored underground water.\n\nUltimately, Zurbuchen said, Jezero was selected for the diversity of its terrain. Each type of rock at the site \u2014 from clays that could preserve signs of ancient organisms to volcanic rocks that hint at Mars\u2019s planetary evolution \u2014 should help the rover achieve its two main science goals. First, to determine what the Red Planet\u2019s environment was like deep in the past. And second, to figure out whether life ever got going there.\n\nIn a conference announcing the decision Monday, Mars 2020 project scientist Ken Farley described delta systems as \u201cextremely good at preserving biosignatures.\u201d On Earth, not only are these ecosystems rich in life but also headwater organisms swept downriver can be trapped in delta sediment.\n\n\u201cWe want to seek evidence of possible ancient life on Mars,\u201d Farley said. They do not expect to find anything alive. \u201cCurrently the surface of Mars is too dry, too cold and has too much radiation for life as we know it to survive.\"\n\nResults from past missions have revealed that Mars was not always the desolate desert world we see today. Dormant volcanoes suggest it once boasted intense volcanic activity. And landforms like the dried-up delta at Jezero Crater demonstrate that liquid water existed on the surface \u2014 which means Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere to keep the water from boiling away.\n\nThis new view of Mars resembles what is known about early Earth. And scientists know microbial life began here as early as 4 billion years ago.\n\nIf it happened here, why not there?\n\nJezero Crater is the site of an ancient delta that fed into a cratert lake.

But windswept sand formations known as \"ripples\" pose a hazard to the rover here and at other sites. The Washington Post Source: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona\n\nJezero Crater is the best place on Mars to probe that question, said Tim Goudge, a geologist at the University of Texas at Austin who is one of the leading advocates for the site. Deltas are beloved by scientists because of the way they gather sediments from across a watershed and deposit them in layers, which eventually harden into rock. Many of the most ancient fossils found on Earth come from this kind of environment.\n\nIf a microbe ever swam in Mars\u2019s waterways, its organic remains may still be buried in the mudstones along the rim of Jezero Crater.\n\n\u201cSedimentary rocks tell us the history of what\u2019s been happening at a site,\u201d Goudge said. \u201cIt\u2019s recorded in the layers, and you can read them like a book.\u201d\n\nIn a memo announcing his selection, Zurbuchen noted that Jezero offered opportunities for exploration after its initial mission, which will last 1.5 Martian years (or about 2.8 Earth years). The crater is not far from an area known as Midway, which shares many characteristics with Northeast Syrtis. At a recent workshop to assess the potential landing sites, members of the project science team for Mars 2020 said that an extended mission connecting Jezero to Midway might allow scientists to explore the best of both sites.\n\nJezero Crater is a more treacherous environment than the kinds NASA usually lands in. Often, landers have to arrive at what scientists jokingly refer to as a \u201cparking lot\u201d \u2014 a flat, featureless region \u2014 and then drive long distances to reach rocks of actual interest. But an innovative new technology called terrain relative navigation (TRN), which allows the spacecraft to compare images of the landscape beneath it to a map of known hazards, should make it possible for the rover to land safely.\n\nOnly about 40 percent of Mars missions have been successful. And Mars 2020 is not a low-risk endeavor. \u2033There is no backup plan,\u201d Zurbuchen said Monday.\n\nSince TRN has never been deployed before, Zurbuchen asked engineers for an additional analysis of the technology. Without assurance that the technology will work as designed, the complex environment at Jezero might pose too high a risk for landing. But Zurbuchen said he was happy with the progress on TRN so far.\n\n\n\nOn ancient Mars, water carved channels and transported sediments to form fans and deltas within lake basins, as seen in this image of Jezero Crater. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/JHU-APL)\n\nLori Glaze, acting director of NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division, told reporters that this mission will define the next decade of Martian exploration. \u201cThe more we understand about the Mars environment, the better equipped we\u2019re gonna be to send humans,\u201d she said.\n\nThe launch window for Mars 2020 opens July 17, 2020, with an expected landing in February 2021. NASA plans to launch a mission in the late 2020s to collect the cached Jezero Crater samples, according to Zurbuchen. If the rendezvous on Mars succeeds, a returning spacecraft will make a delivery to Earth in the early 2030s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go to any other place any time soon,\u201d Zurbuchen said. \u201cMars is the obvious place, after the moon, to extend our presence deeper and deeper into space.\u201d\n\nThis report has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nNext stop, Mars: Inside the fierce debate over the fate of NASA\u2019s new rover \u2014 and a chance to make history\n\nCassini was the mission of a lifetime for this NASA scientist.

They love what you\u2019ve done to the economy. They love the fact that you have basically put ISIS out of business. The one thing they say is, why do you have to be so divisive? Why don\u2019t you do more to bring the country together?\u201d\n\nTrump replied, \u201cI think that if I was very different, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten what we had to get. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, we got [oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] approved, we have \u2014 we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular thing you can imagine, health care \u2014 I got rid of it. \u2026 I think if I was a, you know, more modified, more moderate in that sense, I don\u2019t think I would have done half of the things that I was able to get completed.\u201d\n\nLast week, The Post reported that recent election results set off \u201cfive days of fury\u201d from Trump. The quote above suggests that even after brooding over the midterm shellacking, Trump won\u2019t learn from it and change his rhetoric. There may be some gestures at moderation \u2014 as when last week he offered to help Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) secure votes to be speaker of the House. But Democrats can rest easy knowing that in 2020 Trump will still be repeating the mistakes that helped them in 2018.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a surprise, some readers may say, because Trump doesn\u2019t change. Yet there is actually plenty of precedent for major course corrections from Trump. The man who once built his own buildings with largely domestic investors now makes most of his money by leasing his name to other people\u2019s properties and/or using overseas investment. The real estate businessman moved to headlining a television franchise, which switched from real contestants to celebrities halfway through its run. He\u2019s tried selling wine, steak, deodorant and a dozen other products. He has ventured into casinos, airlines and even a football team, with the only commonality being that they all failed. Even in politics, Trump for years flirted with third-party runs on the Reform Party ticket long before coming home to the GOP.\n\nSure, many of these changes resulted from external pressure \u2014 lack of investors, for example. But there\u2019s little distance between banks not buying what you\u2019re selling and voters not backing what you\u2019re pushing. And as much as Trump likes to pretend he\u2019s immovable, he has made deals with reality before. But this time, he has opted to reject reality instead.

McRaven, a retired Navy SEAL and Special Operations commander who oversaw the 2011 killing of bin Laden.\n\nMcRaven had criticized Trump for describing the news media as the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nIn response, Trump dismissed McRaven during the Fox News interview as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer\u201d before suggesting that the four-star admiral, who recently left his post as chancellor of the University of Texas amid a battle with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, should have caught bin Laden more quickly.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d Trump said. He added that bin Laden had been \u201cliving in Pakistan right next to the military academy; everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nTrump suspended security aid to Pakistan earlier this year and accused the country\u2019s leaders of \u201clies and deceit.\u201d The president\u2019s latest criticism of the longtime U.S. military ally drew a rebuke from Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who said on Twitter on Monday morning that the United States was seeking to make Pakistan \u201ca scapegoat for their failures.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of McRaven also triggered outrage among some current and former military and intelligence officials. On Sunday night, former CIA deputy director Michael Morell pointed out that it was the CIA rather than McRaven\u2019s forces that was responsible for \u201cfinding\u201d bin Laden.\n\nRetired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal defended McRaven in a CNN interview Monday in which he said that Trump was \u201csimply wrong\u201d and that personal attacks on anyone are not warranted.\n\n\u201cI know Bill McRaven and was honored to serve alongside him,\u201d McChrystal said, calling Trump\u2019s comments \u201csymptomatic\u201d of the country\u2019s crisis in leadership.\n\nThe Republican National Committee rallied in Trump\u2019s defense Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWorth noting after recent comments: Retired Adm. William McRaven was reportedly on Hillary Clinton\u2019s short list for Vice President in 2016,\u201d the RNC said in a tweet. \u201cHe\u2019s been critical of President @realDonaldTrump\u2014 even dating back to the 2016 campaign. He\u2019s hardly a non-political figure.\u201d\n\nMcRaven reportedly also was on Trump\u2019s short\u00adlist for national security adviser during the presidential transition in 2017.\n\nPaul Sonne and Philip Rucker contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ChelseaJanesWP/", "title": "Nationals reunite with veteran catcher Kurt Suzuki, agreeing to two-year deal - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Nationals reunite with veteran catcher Kurt Suzuki, agreeing to two-year deal Washington Post The Washington Nationals continued their aggressive start to the offseason Monday, addressing their glaring need for a proven catcher by agreeing to \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/11/19/nationals-reunite-with-veteran-catcher-kurt-suzuki-agreeing-two-year-deal/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M4DA_BMwnOFa29XYtHxppsnByuc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VGXPHXR5ZMI6RFK3PUXBTN4ZMY.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:51:56Z", "content": "The Washington Nationals continued their aggressive start to the offseason Monday, addressing their glaring need for a proven catcher by agreeing to a two-year deal with 35-year-old Kurt Suzuki, according to a person familiar with the situation.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Nationals continued their aggressive start to the offseason Monday, addressing their glaring need for a proven catcher by agreeing to a two-year deal with 35-year-old Kurt Suzuki, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal, pending a physical, is worth $10 million and will pay Suzuki $4 million in 2019 and $6 million in 2020, and it would bring Suzuki back to the team for which he played in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSuzuki is a beloved clubhouse presence, well respected for his ability to frame pitches and handle a pitching staff \u2014 and recently respected in Washington for the tremendous damage he inflicted on the Nationals as a member of the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe veteran hit .271 with 12 homers in 105 games with Atlanta in 2018, but at his age, he likely cannot be relied upon as a full-time starter. Still, he is a proven option who gives the Nationals depth and reduces their desperation as they seek to add a \u201cfront-line\u201d type. If they want to find a platoon player to complement Suzuki, they can now find that player and all but assure themselves of increased offensive production after a year of minimal catching contributions. If they still seek an all-star starter, particularly on the trade market, they will no longer be doing so from a position of weakness \u2014 which can only help their cause.\n\nThe move is the latest in a series of quick hits orchestrated by General Manager Mike Rizzo, who is undaunted by the pending status of Bryce Harper \u2014 and unwilling to submit to what might once again be a slow-moving offseason. He traded for reliever Kyle Barraclough within days of the end of the regular season. He jumped on reliever Trevor Rosenthal within days of free agency\u2019s beginning. Now he is striking first on the catchers market, a market the Nationals likely will continue to monitor moving forward.\n\nWashington still has several needs to address. The team needs starting pitching. It needs a left-handed first baseman to spell Ryan Zimmerman. The Nationals could use a proven utility man, a Marwin Gonzalez type. They can never have enough bullpen help, something Rizzo has said many times.\n\nBut more than any team in the majors, the Nationals are on the move, addressing their needs regardless of the machinations of a sluggish early market. And by acquiring Suzuki, they are addressing a need while adding a stabilizing influence to their clubhouse and a recently potent offensive player. Suzuki compiled an .825 OPS with the Braves over the past two years \u2014 against the same divisional competition he will face with the Nationals over the next two.\n\nRead more:\n\nWith Rule 5 deadline looming, which prospects will Nationals protect?\n\nThe Nationals need starting pitching.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nNASA is considering selling seats on the spacecraft that will ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, offering rides to the public while opening another line of revenue as the agency attempts to broaden its appeal.\n\nOn several occasions, Russia has flown wealthy people who paid millions of dollars for the ride to space. And a trio of private companies backed by billionaires is also looking to fly tourists out of the atmosphere. But except for a couple of rare exceptions, such as Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who was killed when the space Shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, NASA has not allowed private citizens on its rockets.\n\n\u201cJust like in the early days of aviation with barnstorming, these initial activities will help build the infrastructure and the foundation that can lead to future innovations that, frankly, we cannot imagine right now,\u201d said Michael Gold, the vice president of regulatory and policy at Maxar Technologies, who is leading the advisory council\u2019s policy reform effort.\n\nThe proposal, backed Friday by a NASA advisory subcommittee, is in the nascent stage and is part of moves by the agency to better insert itself into the public consciousness by working with the private sector.\n\nThe proposals would have to be approved by the entire advisory council and then forwarded to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting comes two months after Bridenstine announced he was forming the committee and tasking it to look at how the agency could better partner with industry. He said that he wants NASA and its astronauts \u201cembedded into the American culture.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, he reiterated the point, saying: \u201cThe reality is, we\u2019re in a new era now.\u201d\n\n[Companies in the cosmos: Explore the new space race]\n\nIn addition to selling seats, the space agency is exploring the prospect of allowing its logo to be used for commercial purposes and allowing its astronauts to appear in commercials that would boost the agency\u2019s brand.\n\nThe move comes as the White House is seeking to end direct funding of the International Space Station by 2025 and turn over the orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity. That plan has been met with fierce congressional resistance and questions about how it would be achieved and funded.\n\nBut selling seats could be a small step toward achieving that goal. NASA could charge millions of dollars for the rides on the spacecraft developed by Boeing and SpaceX to fly crews to the space station. The revenue generated by those sales would be used to help the agency \u201cfacilitate commercialization of space platforms in and beyond\u201d low Earth orbit, according to language adopted by the advisory group.\n\nThe group is also exploring how the agency could loosen some of the rules that prohibit NASA from endorsing particular products or services. It had talked about the possibility of selling naming rights for its rockets. While Bridenstine said it would be \u201ca heavy lift,\u201d on Friday the committee approved language recommending \u201cspace-based promotional activities\u201d that \u201ccould enhance NASA\u2019s public profile and encourage youth to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\u201d\n\nIt also took a step toward getting its logo used more often. Today, NASA generally doesn\u2019t put its logo on the rockets that fly cargo to the space station or its science experiments to space for fear that it would be seen as an endorsement of the rocket company.\n\n\u201cThere has been a presumption of no,\u201d Gold said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Republicans sound like they haven\u2019t learned a thing", "description": "Trump apologists should look at the midterms", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/19/republicans-sound-like-they-havent-learned-a-thing/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RJBDixJTKAgdsaaAUVjb7TY_ZnM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HS7M7BMITM3CVLF26OARSC2GBI.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:45:10Z", "content": "The continued, abject weakness of the Republican Party in the face of President Trumps rhetorical outrages and policy blunders will be the downfall of Republicans on the ballot in 2020, just as it was for so many Republicans outside deep red states in 2018.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post misspelled the name of Sen. Joni Ernst. This version has been corrected. 1:40 p.m.\n\nThe continued, abject weakness of the Republican Party in the face of President Trump\u2019s rhetorical outrages and policy blunders will be the downfall of Republicans on the ballot in 2020, just as it was for so many Republicans outside deep red states in 2018.\n\nTake Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a bright and well-liked freshman, who will be up for reelection in two years. Despite her authoritative voice as a veteran, she cannot bring herself to criticize Trump for his blatant misuse of the military. Her \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview was painful to watch as she tried to avoid getting crosswise with the president:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You\u2019re a vet. Is deploying 6,000 troops to the border a good use of resources? SEN. ERNST: Well I- again, up to the president and of course those governors that are involved if they\u2019re National Guard soldiers. BRENNAN: You\u2019re on Armed Services, you have a voice. ERNST: If they are active duty soldiers it does actually provide them an opportunity for real life training in their roles. Many of them, if they serve in logistics type positions they will actually be doing those missions on the border. So it is a very good skill. As someone who has commanded troops both in peacetime and in wartime to make sure that they keep their skills sharp. And so when they do deploy, they are in harm\u2019s way overseas. They know exactly how to support the- the men and women on the frontlines. BRENNAN: That\u2019s how you see- I know General Mattis said- Secretary Mattis has said they won\u2019t even have any contact with people coming across. ERNST: Exactly, but they will be utilized in the roles. Like I said many of them may be logistics professionals serving in our armed services. And then it gives them greater opportunity to respond quickly in those types of situations, whether they are supporting with food or body armor, whatever it might be for Border Patrol agents. It allows those Border Patrol agents to actually focus on the law enforcement duties.\n\nSo what training are they actually getting, and is this more valuable than their actual, official training. You cannot help but think how justifiably outraged the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) would be about a president using troops as props. But Ernst is no maverick.\n\nShe was no more courageous on the GOP\u2019s problem with women:\n\nBRENNAN: You don\u2019t think the president\u2019s rhetoric or what happened during the 2016 election is turning away women from the party overall\u2013 ERNST: I\u2013 BRENNAN: \u2013voters or candidates? ERNST: I think that we could do a better job of communicating clearly that we support women and that\u2019s something that I try and do. I try and set a very strong example for women that want to run for office, women that wish to serve in the military. Whatever it might be, we need to set a good example. Women primarily, men secondarily, we need to step up and make sure that we are supporting the needs of our constituents.\n\nJust weak. Pathetically weak.\n\nShe isn\u2019t even able to defend her state\u2019s economic interests:\n\nBRENNAN: I want to ask you about something that really impacts your home state. The vice president said today- and he\u2019s in Asia, that the U.S. is not in a rush to end this trade dispute with China, suggesting that things might not get resolved when President Xi and Trump sit down in just a few weeks. There was a $12 billion bailout for farmers, to help alleviate some of this pain. Will you need another one? ERNST: I am hopeful that we will not need another subsidy program for our farmers. Our farmers would much rather grow their goods and make sure that they are getting out to the rest of the world. Absolutely. But I\u2019ve done a number of farmer roundtables all across the state of Iowa and at the last one I held, the very last speaker, a- a middle aged farmer, he-he stood up and said I understand why President Trump is doing this; however, what I don\u2019t understand is why someone didn\u2019t do it sooner. So they understand\u2013 BRENNAN: The pain is tolerable for now? ERNST: The pain is tolerable for now. I want to see these trade deals done. I\u2019d rather see them done sooner, rather than later, but we have to get a good deal with China or it\u2019s all for naught.\n\nWhy should her state endure any pain as a result of Trump\u2019s misguided policies?\n\nErnst may have missed the lesson of the 2018 midterms. Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg points out that the danger to Republicans is greater than simply loss of college-educated women in the suburbs of big cities. He explains:\n\nDemocrats did not win simply because white women with college degrees rebelled against Mr. Trump\u2019s misogyny, sexism and disrespect for women. Nearly every category of women rebelled . . . Democrats got their wave in part because a significant portion of male and female white working class voters abandoned Mr. Trump and his Republican allies . . . Working people are not fools, and Mr. Trump promised them a Republican president who would never cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid; who would repeal Obamacare but provide \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d; who would get rid of bad trade deals and \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d as he never tired of saying. Instead, had Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to replace Obamacare passed, it would have imposed vast cuts in retirement programs and driven up health insurance costs. His tax reforms were heavily weighted to large corporations and the top 1 percent. So it is no surprise that more than half of white working class men now believe that Mr. Trump is \u201cself-dealing\u201d and corrupt.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to listen to a Democratic pollster, maybe she should pay attention to Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who saw a Democrat win the race to fill his seat. \u201cWe\u2019re losing the suburb,\u201d he warned. \u201cIf we had a mass movement from the suburbs for people to move back to rural areas, then perhaps our Republican Party would have more of a future, but not the way that we\u2019re going now.\u201d\n\nUnless Ernst can figure this out and start putting distance between herself and the toxic president, she\u2019ll be a sitting duck in 2020. The junior senator from Iowa who once made a splash with her castrating pigs ad vowing to fight corruption once in office never called for a full investigation of conflicts of interest, foreign emoluments or any issue touching on corruption now endemic in the administration. She appears to be just another Trump enabler.\n\nSome savvy Republican(s) might mount a primary challenge, offering himself or herself as an independent conservative who\u2019ll put fighting corruption and the interests of Iowa first \u2014 and stop dancing around hard issues because truth-telling might upset Trump. If Republicans don\u2019t come up with an independent-minded candidate willing to stand up to Trump when needed, Democrats should put Iowa high on the list of winnable Senate seats for 2020.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nDenial is not a foreign policy\n\nRepublicans used to vilify presidents who disrespected the military\n\nThe GOP has just two problems: Trump and Trumpism"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Aritz Parra | AP", "title": "Spain wants 2030 World Cup bid with Morocco and Portugal", "description": "Spain wants Morocco to join a three-country bid with Portugal to host the 2030 World Cup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/spain-wants-2030-world-cup-bid-with-morocco-and-portugal/2018/11/19/d15755ba-ec18-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:33:18Z", "content": "MADRID Spain wants Morocco to join a three-country bid with Portugal to host the 2030 World Cup.

While debating the issue in Australia\u2019s House of Representatives, one lawmaker, Liberal Party member Tim Wilson, paused for a moment and proposed to his longtime partner, saying the same-sex marriage debate had been \u201cthe soundtrack\u201d to their relationship.\n\nThe founders of White magazine, who are Christian, said they created the publication more than a decade ago to celebrate relationships. During the same-sex marriage debate, the couple said, people began asking why the magazine did not feature same-sex couples in its pages.\n\n\u201cWe started getting messages then: \u2018You\u2019re the only magazine in Australia that\u2019s not showing your support. Come on, guys, jump on board. Move forward with 2018.\u2019 But then there was always something that just stopped us because we just didn\u2019t want to enter into that conversation \u2014 that wasn\u2019t a loving conversation \u2014 and add heat to a hot conversation,\u201d Carla Burrell said in a video statement on the magazine\u2019s website.\n\nBut her husband, Luke, said that the couple understood why their decision was contentious.\n\n\u201cThe accusations that it\u2019s unfair that at this time we\u2019re not featuring same-sex marriage, I get that that can be hurtful.

Why can\u2019t we have diversity in our thoughts and feelings? I think without those things, we\u2019re not progressing.\u201d\n\nThe announcement drew a wide range of responses on social media \u2014 some from people saying they are \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the magazine\u2019s closure and others telling the founders, \u201cYou reap what you sow.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove is love.

The mounds are found in dense, low and dry forest caatinga vegetation and can be seen when the land is cleared for pasture. (Roy Funch)\n\nIn northeastern Brazil, in a forest so dry that the trees blanch bone-white, termites have been busy at work for millennia. The only external signs of their labor are dirt mounds, garbage dumps from their underground excavations. Dirt and garbage normally inspire as much awe as toenail clippings \u2014 but these are truly marvelous slag piles.\n\nThe conical mounds, each about 8 feet tall and 30 feet wide, erupt from the ground at regular intervals, spaced about 60 feet from each of six neighbors. From the air, the pattern evokes a checkerboard or the hexagonal combs in a beehive. A satellite map, via Google Earth, indicates the mounds cover more than 88,000 square miles, an area larger than Minnesota.\n\n\u201cImagine it being a city,\u201d said Stephen J. Martin, an entomologist and expert in social insects at Britain\u2019s University of Salford. \u201cWe\u2019ve never built a city that big.\u201d And the centimeter-long termites, Syntermes dirus, did it grain by grain.\n\nIn total, the earth excavated by termites equals the volume of 4,000 Pyramids of Giza, as Martin and his co-authors report in a study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. They collected samples from the centers of 11 mounds, and by measuring radiation in the mineral grains, determined the oldest mound tested is about 3,800 years old. Perhaps others are older. Based on satellite images and spot-checks across thousands of kilometers, the scientists estimate that 200 million mounds dot the landscape.\n\nIf the forest cover vanished, exposing the mounds in all their splendor, this place would be celebrated as a natural \u201cwonder of the Earth,\u201d Martin said.\n\nYet tucked under trees and thorny brush, the mounds can be hard to spot. Martin failed to notice them at first. He\u2019d traveled to the Brazilian dry forest, called the caatinga, in pursuit of honeybees. Only after miles of driving, where the road sliced through the trees to reveal the mounds' gumdrop shape, did he see them. These were termite mounds, the local residents told Martin.\n\n\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be right \u2014 there\u2019s too many of them,\u201d he recalled thinking. Back in Britain, colleagues told him the mounds must be lake sediment or another geological feature.\n\nThe locals, of course, were correct, as Martin found out when he returned. Miles from any major city, while walking near a swimming hole, the entomologist bumped into another biologist, named Roy Funch.\n\n\u201cHe was walking up the river with a friend, and I was walking up the river to go swimming,\u201d said Funch, a co-author on the new paper. Martin \u201clooked like, obviously, an outsider,\u201d so Funch, who also works as a tour guide, moseyed up, said hello and asked what brought Martin to Brazil. The termite mounds, Martin said, lamenting that nothing about them turned up in Google Scholar.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, you just met the only guy in Brazil who\u2019s working on these mounds,\u2019 \" Funch recalled. \u201cSo, you know, \u2018serendipitous\u2019 is putting it lightly.\u201d\n\nFunch had traveled to Brazil in the 1970s with the Peace Corps. The beautiful mountains and hiking trails persuaded him to settle in the country\u2019s northeast, he said. He fell under the mounds' spell, too. The tallest, which Funch calls \u201cgrandmother mounds,\u201d reach 15 feet into the air. (Not all of them are still active.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has ever seen such a modification of the landscape at such a huge scale by such tiny little creatures,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the 1980s, Funch, who describes himself as a \u201cbackwoods scientist\u201d but has a PhD in botany, wrote about the termite mounds for a popular science magazine. He hoped to catch other researchers' attention. Nobody bit. Thirty years passed, and he decided to study them himself, until he teamed up with Martin.\n\nThese mounds, unlike the hives other termites build, are not nests or ventilation shafts. \u201cWe thought that the nests would be in the middle of the mounds,\u201d Funch said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t. They weren\u2019t even under the mounds.\u201d A single large tunnel, about 10 centimeters (about four inches) in diameter, rises through the center of the mound. The termites deliver their waste and plug the tunnel at the top.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever found the queens' nests. We really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening below the ground. Absolutely nothing,\u201d Funch said.\n\nThe mounds make uncooperative subjects. Soldier termites emerge when researchers disturb the dirt. The local name for the soldiers translates to \u201cclick-click\u201d because their mandibles are so loud. They\u2019ll draw blood, Martin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got razor-sharp mandibles. They\u2019ll slice straight through the skin,\u201d he said. The nutrient-poor soil is a nightmare to dig up, baked hard as concrete in the heat.\n\nRemoteness and poor soil are the very qualities that enable the termite mounds to endure. The area has long droughts, said University at Buffalo geographer Eun-Hye Yoo, an author of the study. (Yoo also met Funch in a Brazilian tourist town. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to meet people,\u201d he said.) The climate, though not friendly to human agriculture, is stable. In this harsh environment, the termite kingdom flourishes.\n\n\u201cThese termites have exploited this area and done very well for themselves,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThe wet season lasts for about a month. The caatinga leaps from brown to green and back again. The trees bloom, and just as quickly they shed their leaves. Within weeks, the forest floor is stripped bare of leaf litter. The termites take everything to eat. Martin suspects the litter sustains them for the rest of the year. Termites elsewhere farm fungus on leaf detritus, but there are no known fungus-growing termite species in South America.\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of the termite mounds. (Stephen J. Martin) (Guarino, Ben)\n\nThe scientists do not have a definitive explanation for the mounds' unusual hexagonal spacing. The pattern is \u201cabsolutely striking and quite unusual in its scale. It\u2019s a beautiful example of large-scale self-organization,\u201d said Corina Tarnita, a mathematical biologist at Princeton University who was not involved with the new work. The only comparable pattern in nature so widely distributed, she said, are African fairy circles, rings in the brush that appear from Angola to South Africa.\n\nBut Martin proposed that, because these social insects \u201care very, very good at optimization,\u201d the six-pointed system may be the most efficient. Beneath the dirt, as seen by fiber-optic cable, is a large and interconnected tunnel system. The termites guide themselves by pheromones, the insect equivalent of a subway conductor.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got enough connections, it\u2019s very easy to find the nearest mound,\u201d Martin said. Only if a mound does not exist at the edge of the megacity will they begin to build a new one.\n\nTarnita cautioned that the mounds tested in this study were done so haphazardly. \u201cIt would be really important to have a systematic assessment of age that gives some sense of the relationship between a mound\u2019s age and that of its neighbors, or its neighbors' neighbors,\u201d she said.\n\nMartin agrees there\u2019s plenty of work to do. No one knows how closely related the animals are at the far fringes of the empire. Their genetics are untested. And the colonies' rulers remain a mystery. \u201cWe\u2019d love to get to the royal chamber,\u201d he said. He\u2019d sacrifice a marvelous mound or two to a backhoe, for science.\n\nRead more:\n\nTermites figured out farming 25 million years before people did\n\nThese strange, subterranean cities are eerily like our own.

Some, for example, suggested that George Soros, the liberal philanthropist, was bankrolling anti-Facebook protesters. To put it more bluntly, Facebook enabled a smear campaign against its critics.\n\nAs Max Read pithily observed in New York magazine: \u201cFake news isn\u2019t just a problem for Facebook. It\u2019s also a solution!\u201d\n\nThe second, by the great feature writer Eli Saslow in The Washington Post, focused on a particular blogger who makes a living inventing viral lies that spread \u2014 and are believed \u2014 on a Facebook page called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense.\n\nTogether, these stories tell us once again what we already knew: That Facebook is a rudderless ship sailing toward the apocalypse \u2014 and we\u2019re all along for the ride.\n\nBad and telling as they are, the latest developments are only more of the same.\n\nThis is the same company \u2014 with the same leadership \u2014 that denied the now-established truth that misinformation deeply infected the 2016 presidential campaign. (\u201cA pretty crazy idea,\u201d was Zuckerberg\u2019s feint at the time.)\n\n\u201cThe same people are leading that company that have always led that company,\u201d observed Sheera Frenkel, one of the Times reporters, in an interview with Kara Swisher on MSNBC Sunday night.\n\nIf the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, the latest insane revelations were completely predictable.\n\nSome Facebook investors are calling \u2014 again, and more vehemently \u2014 for a change at the top. If Zuckerberg is to stay at the helm, they at least want him to give up his dual role as CEO and chairman. Step down as chairman and appoint an independent director to oversee the board.\n\n\u201cA company with Facebook\u2019s massive reach and influence requires robust oversight and that can only be achieved through an independent chair who is empowered to provide critical checks on company leadership,\u201d said one of these investors, Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller, according to Business Insider.\n\nZuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company and can do pretty much whatever he wants. And he doesn\u2019t like that idea.\n\nBut it\u2019s the right one. At the very least, it\u2019s a move in a sensible direction. If there was ever a company that needed vigorous checks and balances, it\u2019s this one.\n\nFacebook is a $40 billion global giant with almost unimaginable power. It now has 2 billion users worldwide.\n\nAnd its leadership \u2014 perhaps understandably \u2014 has shown itself simply not up to the task of dealing with the explosion of growth since its founding in 2004 in Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard dorm room.\n\nOver the past few days Zuckerberg seems to be reaching new lows, threatening to fire employees who speak to the news media. Considering the smarmy lip service that Facebook pays to \u201ctransparency,\u201d that\u2019s especially appalling.\n\nHe also, according to Wall Street Journal reporting, blamed his second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last spring. (The British research firm gained access to the sensitive data of millions of Facebook users.)\n\nAlthough Zuckerberg often says the right words (\u201cI started this place, I run it. I\u2019m responsible for what happened here\u201d), his behind-the-scenes behavior tells another story: The buck never seems to stop with Zuckerberg, despite his immense and closely held power.\n\nThere is no good solution here. Government regulation of social-media platforms has dire implications for free speech. And the notion that Facebook is going to somehow fix itself has been proved wrong time and time again.\n\nBut the status quo is unacceptable \u2014 and dangerous.\n\nIf Zuckerberg really wants to be \u201cresponsible for what happened here,\u201d he\u2019ll step aside as chairman and encourage some stringent internal oversight. And, as part of that, true transparency to the public and the press.\n\nFacebook, whether it wants to admit it or not, is in serious crisis.\n\nAnd its power is such that the crisis extends to everyone it touches \u2014 and beyond.\n\n(Correction: In an earlier version of this column, Sheera Frenkel\u2019s name was misspelled Sheera Frankel.)\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Football Top 20: After WCAC championship miracle, Gonzaga goes to No. 1 - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Football Top 20: After WCAC championship miracle, Gonzaga goes to No. 1 Washington Post What a weekend of high school football.

When Obama\u2019s timetable for winding down forces in Afghanistan seemed to coincide with the election calendar, conservatives (me included) criticized mixing political and military decision-making.\n\nIt remains a wonder then that so many Republicans give President Trump a pass on far more serious snubs and for his blatant politicization of the military. (It\u2019s one of many reasons that has prompted conservative foreign policy gurus such as my colleague Max Boot and Eliot Cohen to repudiate the party of Trump enablers.) The New York Times recounted: Trump \u201ccanceled a trip to a cemetery in France where American soldiers from World War I are buried. He did not go to the observance at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. He has not visited American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.\u201d In addition, he \u201chas also alarmed Defense Department officials with seemingly off-the-cuff remarks about military matters.\u201d Flippant remarks about dismissing transgender members of the military, ending our presence in Syria, canceling joint exercises with South Korea and pondering a military option in Venezuela have alarmed military commanders, who have now learned to largely ignore his tweets and verbal outbursts.\n\nHad Obama behaved in such ways, surely rock-solid hawks such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) would have gone crazy. But Cotton and other Republicans are now first and foremost apologists for Trump. If he does it, it\u2019s fine \u2014 or not worthy of remark. If Obama did it, he didn\u2019t love America, in their book.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s impossible to ignore or overlook Trump\u2019s useless deployment of thousands of troops at the border for the sake of ginning up his xenophobic base in time for the midterms. Gordon Adams, Lawrence B. Wilkerson and Isaiah Wilson III (a professor emeritus and two retired colonels) write:\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement and the deployment that followed (of roughly 5,900) were probably perfectly legal. But we are a bipartisan threesome with decades of experience in and with the Pentagon, and to us, this act creates a dangerous precedent. We fear this was lost in the public hand-wringing over the decision, so let us be clear: The president used America\u2019s military forces not against any real threat but as toy soldiers, with the intent of manipulating a domestic midterm election outcome, an unprecedented use of the military by a sitting president. \u2026 As many senior military retirees have argued, the forces are not and should not be a political instrument. They are not toy soldiers to be moved around by political leaders but a neutral institution, politically speaking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth debating whether Defense Secretary Jim Mattis should have quit over the issue, but that\u2019s an issue of the proper response to an outrageous abuse of the military; it\u2019s a given that Trump abused our armed forces (who will sit by the border, far from the caravan, while their families celebrate Thanksgiving without them).\n\nTrump also yanked the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan and threatened to do the same to ex-military and ex-intelligence officials who criticized his administration. The notion that the clearances are given to assist current military and intelligence officials in the performance of their duties did not seem to register with Trump.\n\nThen to make Trump\u2019s contempt for the military all the more stark, he now decides to attack the commander of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. No, really. He did that. The Post reports:\n\nPresident Trump derided retired Adm. William H. McRaven as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer\u201d and suggested that the venerated former head of U.S. Special Operations Command should have apprehended Osama bin Laden faster. The comments, which the president made in an interview with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d represent the latest point of tension between Trump and a group of retired general officers who have criticized the commander in chief publicly for his handling of national security and military matters. McRaven, a retired Navy SEAL, oversaw the 2011 operation that killed bin Laden at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After Trump revoked former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance in the summer, McRaven wrote an article in The Washington Post defending Brennan as a man of unparalleled integrity and asked the president to revoke his clearance, as well, in solidarity. McRaven also criticized Trump more broadly.\n\nSome oversight hearings on the politicization of the troops or even a simple House resolution deploring Trump\u2019s remarks would be in order.\n\nMore important, it\u2019s time for Democrats to rise to the occasion, put the Tom Cottons and others on the spot and object to these outrageous episodes. In 2020, Democrats, a GOP primary challenger and/or an independent conservative should take on the president\u2019s disrespectful conduct and challenge his politicization of the military. The same should go for those challenging Republican incumbent lawmakers who sit idly by as Trump engages in conduct they would have deemed impeachable in the case of Obama.\n\nRead more:\n\nDenial is not a foreign policy\n\nThe GOP has just two problems: Trump and Trumpism\n\nFive takeaways from Friday\u2019s CNN-White House ruling"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "UK taxi rapist must remain in prison, parole board 0073ays", "description": "UK Parole Board panel has ordered that a serial rapist believed to have attacked more than 100 women must stay in prison", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-taxi-rapist-must-remain-in-prison-parole-board-0073ays/2018/11/19/ca95b992-ec13-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:57:19Z", "content": "LONDON A U.K. Parole Board panel has ordered that a serial rapist believed to have attacked more than 100 women must stay in prison.

(Michael Rubenstein for The Washington Post)\n\nSay goodbye to the jokes that have flowed from the dais of the White House correspondents' dinner for decades: The White House Correspondents' Association announced Monday that biographer Ron Chernow will be the featured speaker at the annual black-tie event in the spring.\n\nHaving a serious speaker \u2014 Chernow is an esteemed historian who has chronicled the lives of George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Ulysses S. Grant, among others \u2014 is a big break from the tradition of having a stand-up comedian entertain the ballroom of journalists, members of Congress and administration types.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that Ron will share his lively, deeply researched perspectives on American politics and history at the 2019 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner,\u201d WHCA President Olivier Knox, who is the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, said in a news release. \u201cAs we celebrate the importance of a free and independent news media to the health of the republic, I look forward to hearing Ron place this unusual moment in the context of American history.\u201d\n\nKnox declined to comment for the record, but the hiring of Chernow is likely to tamp down the sort of controversy that followed comedian Michelle Wolf\u2019s stand-up routine at April\u2019s dinner\n\nWolf landed polarizing punchlines about White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who attended the dinner and sat at the head table in the stead of her boss. \u201cShe burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye,\u201d Wolf said of President Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, whom she also likened to an \u201cUncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women.\u201d\n\n[The harshest jokes from Michelle Wolf\u2019s correspondents\u2019 dinner speech]\n\n\"The so-called comedian really \u2018bombed,\u2019 \u201d tweeted Trump, who had skipped the dinner for the second time in his presidency.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy generated by those comments, the heads of several major news organizations, including Politico and The Washington Post, told WHCA board members that they preferred to do away with a comedian as the evening\u2019s entertainer.\n\nThe news organizations have considerable financial leverage; they buy the tables at the event each year.\n\nPolitico publisher Robert Allbritton \u201cexpressed his concern about [Wolf\u2019s] routine and how that reflected on the journalists and the other people sitting in that room,\u201d said a person close to Allbritton. \u201cHe had a strong belief that a change was appropriate\u201d in the evening\u2019s entertainment.\n\nWashington Post publisher Fred Ryan had a similar comment Monday: \u201cThe event should be about the journalists,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be about cutting humor but about journalism.\u201d\n\nFollowing the news of the programming change Monday, Wolf tweeted that the correspondents' association \u201care cowards. The media is complicit. And I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\u201d\n\nThe association\u2019s news release included comment from Chernow, who said that this is the \u201cperfect moment to go back to basics. \u201cThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association has asked me to make the case for the First Amendment and I am happy to oblige,\u201d Chernow said.\n\nBut he promised to make his performance at the event, which will take place April 27, at least a little entertaining. \u201cWhile I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the dinner has featured a stand-up act by a celebrity comic who makes jokes targeting both the president and the news media, and the president gets his turn at the mic to deliver a jokey stand-up act. (The two exceptions were in 1999 and 2003 when Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles performed, respectively.) But that setup has become fraught in recent years by Trump\u2019s boycott, which leaves half the jokes landing on a target who isn\u2019t there to give as good as he gets. The dinner itself, too, has come under scrutiny for its transformation into a celebrity-laden spectacle in which sources and the journalists who cover them appear to cozy up for a formal-dress schmooze. And in the Trump years, it has lost some of its luster, because the president and Hollywood types have stayed away.\n\nBut will a WHCD with fewer laughs \u2014 and a bigger focus on the First Amendment and the association\u2019s scholarships that the dinner funds \u2014 be any fun? We asked Frank Sesno, a former CNN correspondent who now heads George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public affairs, that exact question before the first dinner under the Trump administration in 2017. \u201cFrankly, people don\u2019t want to put on a tux and come out on a Saturday night to get lectured to,\u201d\n\nclarification: An earlier version of a headline on this post said that Ron Chernow's hosting gig was the first time a comedian had not performed at the White House correspondents' dinner in decades. In actuality, it is a decades-long tradition with two exceptions: Aretha Franklin in 1999 and Ray Charles in 2003. The article has been updated.\n\nWatch more:"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "AP PHOTOS: Migrants at Balkan border face new obstacle: cold", "description": "AP PHOTOS: Near the border of Bosnia and Croatia, nothing really keeps migrants camping there stay warm", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ap-photos-migrants-at-balkan-border-face-new-obstacle-cold/2018/11/19/201c4ba4-ec11-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:38:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "In this Sunday, Nov. 18, 2019 photo a migrant wrapped in a blanket waits for food distribution at a camp in Velika Kladusa, Bosnia, close to the border to Croatia.

The approach of another winter announced tougher times for migrants stuck in the region while trying to reach western Europe.\n\nHundreds of migrants are staying in make-shift camps with no heating or facilities. Some are fleeing wars in their home countries in the Middle East Africa or Asia. Others have been driven away by poverty, lack of freedom or hope for the future.\n\nOne such camp is in the town of Velika Kladusa, in northwestern Bosnia, only about a kilometer (mile) from the heavily guarded border. Dozens of migrants spend days and nights here trying to cross into Croatia, a European Union member nation a short distance away that holds the promise of easier travels.\n\nMigrants turn to Bosnia to avoid more heavily guarded routes elsewhere in the Balkans. As a European Union member, Croatia is easier to pass through toward wealthy EU countries where they hope to find work and start new lives. Many spend months, or sometimes even years, on the road.\n\nAfter their long journeys, many migrants don\u2019t have winter shoes, warm socks, caps or gloves. They wrap themselves tightly in blankets, leaving their faces barely visible. At lunch time, they line up for warm meals provided by aid groups. They eat among garbage-strewn, grim-looking tents made of nylon, ropes and cardboard.\n\nAt night, the travelers gather around camp fires warm up or cook. Some say their hands have turned blue from cold and they don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nBosnian authorities have been struggling to accommodate migrants who arrive in a country still recovering from a brutal 1992-95 ethnic war.

They said Ethiopian Jews are starving, ostracized and deprived of basic needs in Africa while the government in Israel is \u201cdragging its feet to come to our rescue.\u201d\n\nEyayu Abuhay, a community organizer, said 50 Ethiopian Jews have died since 2015 while waiting to join their family members in Israel. \u201cWe want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to our rescue before we all die here,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February, Ethiopian Jews held a similar protest in Addis Ababa and warned they will stage a mass hunger strike if Israel eliminates funding to help them join their families in Israel. Since then, Israeli officials have visited Ethiopia, but organizers said nothing has changed since then.\n\nMost of the more than 8,000 Ethiopian Jews in the East African nation are practicing Jews and believed to have family members that already reside in Israel. Some told AP they have been separated for more than a decade.\n\nBut Israel doesn\u2019t consider them Jewish under strict religious law, meaning their immigration requires special approval. They are descendants of Ethiopian Jews who were forcibly converted to Christianity around a century ago, and the Israeli government views bringing them to Israel as family reunification rather than \u201caliya,\u201d or Jewish immigration. The families allege discrimination.\n\nIn 1991, with Ethiopia in civil war, Israel carried out the dramatic Operation Solomon which airlifted some 14,500 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in less than two days. Now about 145,000 Ethiopian Jews are estimated to be living in Israel.\n\n\u201cWhy are we not allowed to immigrate to Israel? Is it because we are black or uneducated?\u201d asked Melese Sidisto, a coordinator for Ethiopian Jews in Addis Ababa, who then burst into tears. \u201cWe are being cheated like a child. This is not right.\u201d\n\nIn a letter addressed to Netanyahu, the Ethiopian Jews in Addis Ababa said they want to go to Israel immediately and without any preconditions to join their family members.\n\n\u201cOur family members are dying here while we are awaiting your promise to be implemented,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cNot implementing the promise amounts of playing with Israeli citizens lives.

His fellow North Koreans fired at him, hitting him at least five times and leaving him fighting for his life. When doctors in the South treated the 25-year-old, they found more problems, including an infection of parasitic worms.\n\nDespite all this, Oh survived. And this week, roughly a year after he escaped from the North, he gave his first interview to a foreign media publication. In it, the defector offered a grim picture of life inside North Korea and the factors that motivated him to escape.\n\n\u201cI really felt that we would have a war with the United States,\u201d Oh told the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, referring to the increase in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang during the year he escaped.\n\nThe Sankei Shimbun published a video of its interview with Oh, which did not show his face but featured a man talking with a slight North Korean accent. The newspaper said Japanese security services confirmed Oh\u2019s identity.\n\nIn his interview, Oh revealed that his father was a major general and suggested that he had enjoyed a relatively comfortable lifestyle growing up in North Korea. However, he said he was indifferent to the rule of Kim Jong Un and had no loyalty to the North Korean regime. Oh estimated that roughly 80 percent of his generation felt the same way.\n\n\u201cIt is natural to have no interest nor loyalty since the hereditary system is taken as a given, regardless of its inability to feed people,\u201d he added, according to a translation by Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe soldier\u2019s dramatic escape from North Korea captivated many people around the world. While defectors from the country are far from uncommon, few take the dangerous path through the demilitarized zone through the peace village of Panmunjom in the Joint Security Area \u2014 the only place where North Korean soldiers face off against their South Korean and U.S. counterparts \u2014 as Oh did.\n\nDespite the heavy military presence, Panmunjom is best known as a tourist area now. The last time a shooting took place in the Joint Security Area was 1984, when a Soviet citizen tried to sprint to the southern side of the border. A North Korean soldier last defected in 2007, but no gunfire was exchanged at the site at that time.\n\nOh\u2019s defection was captured on closed-circuit television footage later released by the U.S. military. It showed the young soldier driving a jeep-like vehicle before it got stuck in a ditch. He then jumped out of the vehicle and began running, while other North Korean soldiers shot at him.\n\nIn his interview with the Sankei Shimbun, Oh denied reports in the South Korean press that he was wanted for murder in North Korea. Instead, he said, he had been drinking after getting into trouble with his friends. After breaking through a checkpoint, he had become fearful of being executed, so he had just kept going in a bid to escape.\n\nHe also said that he understood why his fellow soldiers had to fire at him, almost killing him. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t shoot, they would face heavy punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have done the same.\u201d\n\nOh\u2019s injuries were so severe that a U.S. rescue crew that loaded him onto a Black Hawk helicopter initially thought he might not survive. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a miracle,\u201d Sgt. 1st Class Gopal Singh told The Washington Post last December.\n\nSouth Koreans were so gripped by Oh\u2019s case that the trauma surgeon who treated him, Lee Cook-jong, became a celebrity in the country.

The Guardian called it \u201cone of the most spectacular art heists of modern times.\u201d\n\nLast weekend, a Dutch novelist thought that she\u2019d stumbled upon one of the works \u2014 Picasso\u2019s \u201cT\u00eate d\u2019Arlequin\u201d \u2014 buried under a tree in the Romanian countryside.\n\nMira Feticu, who wrote a book about the heist, said she\u2019d received an anonymous letter about 10 days ago with instructions for tracking the painting.\n\nFeticu\u2019s discovery sent tremors of excitement through the art world. Though four Romanians were arrested in connection with the crime in 2014, the paintings were never found. Investigators said they believed the works had been destroyed after the thieves failed to find a buyer. Olga Dogaru, one of the perpetrators, even confessed to burning the works in her stove to protect her son.\n\nShe later retracted that statement. But specialists from Romania\u2019s natural history museum said ashes from Dogaru\u2019s stove contained traces of at least three of the oil paintings.\n\nFeticu\u2019s discovery cast doubt on those findings. She delivered the artwork to the Dutch Embassy, where investigators spent the weekend feverishly working to determine whether the work was real.\n\nThen Sunday night, Feticu appeared on the Dutch public broadcaster NOS to say she\u2019d been had. She alleged that the painting \u2014 and the letter she received \u2014 was part of a publicity stunt to promote a new work by Dutch artists Bart Baele and Yves Degryse.\n\nThe pair had created the fake Picasso as part of their new project \u201cTrue Copy,\u201d a meditation on the work of notorious Dutch forger Geert Jan Jansen, who made millions selling fake paintings.

Substitute julienned bok choy for Aunt Irma\u2019s green bean casserole! And as for the turkey \u2013 if you must have such a hackneyed entree, then at least spatchcock it, glaze the result with a sriracha-molasses reduction and festoon it with candied kumquats for some eye-catching color.\n\nThese sorts of helpful suggestions belong to a perennial food-writing genre we might call \u201cMake Thanksgiving Great Again.\u201d I have an alternative suggestion: Because Thanksgiving is already pretty great, why not keep it just as it is?\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m all in favor of culinary exploration, but Thanksgiving is simply the worst possible time to try something new.\n\nThere you are with 12 hungry relations in your living room, looking wistfully toward the kitchen as they scour the shrimp platter for stray scraps of lettuce. You, meanwhile, are trying seven new recipes, all of them with lightly fictionalized cooking times. Dinner will, we fancy, be on the table just in time to ring in the new year.\n\nIf, that is, your newest experiments ever qualify for the table. Every few years, my mother suggests I try some new turkey-cooking method she just read about, since it obviously represents the most up-to-date culinary science. And hence, every few years, another turkey disaster \u2026 including the year my bird turned out to be, underneath its gorgeously browned skin, absolutely raw.\n\nAfter that particular catastrophe, I put my foot down: From now on, my turkeys will be cooked in the most boring possible manner, and using no methods younger than I am. Experimental chemists probably wouldn\u2019t test some new formula in the middle of a Category 5 hurricane; nor should you try to expand your repertoire during the most lavish and complicated meal you\u2019ll ever prepare.\n\nMore to the point, why should we innovate? Thanksgiving is already America\u2019s favorite holiday. Unlike many other holidays, it has no purpose but the food, its religious significance having faded to insignificance by the beginning of the 20th century. All we do on Thanksgiving is eat \u2014 the same old things, year after year.\n\nAnd though you wouldn\u2019t know it to read many food sections, we love those things. Thanksgiving\u2019s nostalgic pull is anchored to the very dishes that food writers keep trying to wean us off of: trite turkey, corny casseroles, stereotypical stuffing, platitudinous pumpkin pies.\n\nWe don\u2019t repeat this menu because we\u2019re under some mass delusion. We eat these dishes because they\u2019re wonderful, the distilled essence of fall on a single plate. They\u2019re so wonderful, in fact, that a Frenchman who was at my family\u2019s table last year recently asked if he might fly over again for an encore. Which he will get, nearly exactly, down to the glasses, the silverware and, of course, the indigestion.\n\nWhen you have a national holiday so appealing that it\u2019s developing an export market, why fiddle with it?\n\nWell, because Thanksgiving was invented for a different time, when cooking was an unavoidable, 30-hours-a-week chore for the feminine half of the country. When you have to put three meals on the table every single day, you prize a certain predictability in your menus, which saves time and ensures that the result will be edible. But thanks to modern food preservation and ubiquitous cheap restaurants, cooking from scratch is now an optional activity. Like most hobbies, we tend to look to it for novelty, a chance to show off. The same, again, feels less than impressive.\n\nBut Thanksgiving\u2019s excess is impressive enough; novelty is gilding the lily. And saying that we can\u2019t bear to eat the same meal once a year suggests a palate so jaded as to be positively debauched.\n\nThanksgiving\u2019s lack of originality is, in fact, what\u2019s so special about it. Emulating our ancestral menus connects us to those past generations who developed them. In following their lead, we also unite with our 325 million fellow Americans, almost all of whom are eating essentially the same meal at roughly the same time. We may vehemently disagree on politics or religion, but we can still all come together over mashed potatoes and green beans.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, please join me in ignoring all the \u201cnew traditions\u201d being pushed. Instead, let\u2019s collectively embrace a fine old one, known as \u201cleaving well enough alone.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Jennifer Rubin", "title": "Denial is not a foreign policy", "description": "We're tired of losing to two-bit autocrats.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/11/19/denial-is-not-a-foreign-policy/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mPyIkQv2JC0ZUp72F0SbcUtbs2s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IAYE5ZEUNM6YTC6T7GF4HCSYI4.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:00:22Z", "content": "President Trump didnt want to acknowledge that Russia intervened in our election.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPresident Trump didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that Russia intervened in our election. The American people have yet to get a satisfactory explanation for his subservience to an international foe. Perhaps the Russians have incriminating information on him, or perhaps he\u2019s financially indebted to Russians. He might simply be afraid to admit he didn\u2019t win on his own. In any event, Trump has spent a couple of years denying incontrovertible evidence of Russian wrongdoing, going so far as to take Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s side publicly over the unanimous views of our intelligence community. Denial leads to irrational rhetoric, concern about his loyalties and embarrassment for our country.\n\nThings seem no better when it comes to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman:\n\nThe Washington Post first reported Friday that the CIA had assessed with high confidence the Saudi leader\u2019s role [in the killing of Post Global Opinions columnist Jamal Khashoggi], based on multiple sources of intelligence. But the president had already been shown evidence of the prince\u2019s alleged involvement in the killing, and privately he remains skeptical, Trump aides said. He has also looked for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed, the aides said. \u2026 \u201cThis is a situation where everyone basically knows what happened,\u201d said one adviser who talks to Trump often. This person said Trump has repeatedly criticized how Mohammed has handled the situation and has said it is clear they are hiding facts.\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel and national security adviser John Bolton briefed Trump, even \u201coffering pieces of evidence that show lieutenants of Mohammed were directly involved in the killing, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\nTrump, like a child putting his fingers in his ears and babbling to avoid disagreeable reality, refuses to listen to the audiotape, what he calls \u201ca suffering tape.\u201d Perhaps it makes the lie that Mohammed was not involved harder to sustain, or perhaps it\u2019s evidence of Trump\u2019s personal cowardice and squeamishness. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s further proof that no matter what evidence is available, Trump will insist on creating doubt about Mohammed\u2019s culpability (quibbling about whether there is evidence of an \u201corder\u201d).\n\nIf the \u201c400-pound guy\u201d \u2014 a figment of Trump\u2019s imagination \u2014 could be invoked to create doubts about Russian interference in our elections, don\u2019t expect a mere audio recording to end debate about the alleged grisly murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi. The White House would do well to listen to Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who on CNN on Sunday admonished the administration not \u201cto just deflect and say it\u2019s a spectacular ally, when, in fact, some of the bloom has been coming off that rose for a while.\u201d He offered the novel idea that our policy should be \u201cbased on the truth, not in something that we simply want to see because we have a lot invested in the relationship with the crown prince now.\u201d\n\nDespite the CIA\u2019s \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Mohammed was behind the plot (and common sense, which would tell us that a despotic leader aware of much less significant actions would necessarily be aware of something of this magnitude), Trump would rather elevate the importance of and protect a murderous regime, create more concern about his loyalties (Does he have a financial stake at risk? Is he simply an easy mark for flattery?) and increase embarrassment for the United States. In this case, Trump gives the green light to every strongman around the globe who would imprison, harass or murder journalists.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis have already undermined their position in the world, undermined their standing. And the administration makes sure \u2014 needs to make sure it doesn\u2019t undermine its own standing,\u201d warned Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday.\n\nTrump and a good many conservative foreign policy advisers and outside experts were frankly snookered by the Saudis, who fed their hunger for an anti-Iran ally that spared us the trouble of deeper engagement in the region. Now they are straining to avoid the collapse of an ill-conceived strategy. Veteran diplomat Aaron David Miller tweeted:\n\nTrump is looking for a way out of the Khashoggi crisis that doubles down on his investment in MBS. Tuesday\u2019s report may make that clear. But nothing will fix the problem of the pariah prince or the fact that he\u2019s getting bamboozled by Saudis and everyone knows it. \u2014 Aaron David Miller (@aarondmiller2) November 18, 2018\n\nWhen it comes to Russia and Saudi Arabia, Congress must play the role of foreign policy grown-up and keep American foreign policy grounded in reality. With near-unanimous votes in Congress, Trump was obliged to sign on to additional sanctions against Russia in 2017. Likewise, Congress has it within its power to cut off arms sales and to enact sanctions that include Mohammed. It can also end support for the Yemen War and the Saudis\u2019 killing and starvation of thousands of innocents. As Schiff advised, \u201cfirst and foremost, we need to bring an end to the conflict in Yemen, but also we need to stop placing so much reliance on Saudi Arabia and in particular on the person of the crown prince.\u201d\n\nWith a Democratic-majority House, Congress also will have the power and the will to explore Trump and Jared Kushner\u2019s financial ties to foreign powers, which could be at the root of Trump\u2019s insistence of sheltering autocrats from responsibility for their unacceptable actions. The House can subpoena Trump\u2019s tax and business records, put Trump employees under oath, obtain outside bank records and call other witnesses who might have knowledge of foreign business connections.\n\nTrump very likely is in violation of the emoluments clause (by virtue of the Saudis\u2019 lavish spending at his properties). In plain language, Congress must determine whether foreign corruption, if not outright bribery, is affecting our foreign policy decision-making and hence our national security, or whether our excessively deferential policy toward the Saudis stems from Trump\u2019s refusal to reshape a flawed foreign policy.\n\nIronically, the result of Trump\u2019s indulgence of belligerent governments (including North Korea, with whom Trump wants another photo-op summit) is to embolden foes and to make us look as though we\u2019re dependent on lesser powers (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Egypt). If only Trump actually had a foreign policy that put American interests \u2014 and values \u2014 first, we might reclaim the respect of allies and foes alike. Sadly, we likely will need a new president before we start winning again.\n\nRead more:\n\nFred Hiatt: Why bring a bonesaw to a kidnapping, Your Highness?\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump is defending Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s lies.

Should he lose the race, the fault would lie not with him but with irregularities like illegally cast votes. In Pennsylvania in August 2016, down by 9 points in polls, he insisted that the only way he would lose was \u201cif in certain sections of the state they cheat.\u201d The \u201ccertain sections\u201d were interpreted to mean heavily black areas where people such as Sean Hannity had made baseless assertions of the existence of fraud in the past.\n\nTrump ended up winning Pennsylvania, thanks to a race that narrowed at the end and a late surge for his candidacy. It was critical to Trump\u2019s election, one of three states in which a 78,000-vote combined victory powered his electoral college win.\n\nAfter he won, though, his tone about the election didn\u2019t change. He\u2019d won, barely \u2014 but kept raising questions about the legitimacy of the vote in places he wasn\u2019t victorious, like New Hampshire or California, the state that alone handed him his popular-vote loss and where, he claims, immigrants in the country illegally helped power that defeat. (Trump reiterated his claim about New Hampshire in an interview with the Daily Caller last week; it remains untrue.)\n\nSerious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016\n\nThe bifurcation of his concerns was so sharp that year that in Michigan, another of those narrow-margin states that propelled him to the White House, his legal team fought back against a recount by asserting that \u201c[a]ll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d This is true, but it\u2019s not what the client of those attorneys was arguing.\n\nThis weekend saw the resolution of other closely contested races between Democrats and Republicans. Gov. Rick Scott (R) of Florida was declared the winner of that state\u2019s U.S. Senate contest over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D). The race for Scott\u2019s seat was won by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), whom defeated Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) of Tallahassee. The narrow margins in the races had pushed each into a recount, with the Republicans maintaining large-enough leads that carried over from election night.\n\nBefore the vote counting was over, though, Scott and Trump had raised allegations of fraud in heavily Democratic parts of the state, focusing in particular on the spotty record of Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes to suggest that illegal ballots were being added to the total to boost Nelson\u2019s total. (Snipes announced her resignation on Sunday.)\n\nThere was no evidence that any illegal ballots had been cast. The state\u2019s law enforcement agency announced that it had found no evidence of illegal activity, as did the office of the secretary of state (which works for Scott). Scott\u2019s worry appears to have been that the totals of provisional and absentee ballots from Broward \u2014 added to the total votes cast in the county only after Election Day \u2014 were reducing his lead, given how well Nelson did in the county. Scott and his allies claimed those votes had materialized out of nowhere, aiming to raise questions about the count in Broward and, therefore, to stop the bleeding. As it turned out, his lead was large enough to withstand the totals from votes that were still coming in and then large enough to withstand the recount.\n\nTrump has repeatedly used the Republican gains in the Senate as an argument for how well his party did in the midterms (despite lots of evidence to the contrary). He joined Scott\u2019s assertions about fraud, seemingly also to help protect Scott\u2019s lead.\n\nBut then, in an interview with Fox News after Scott was declared the winner, Trump still claimed that the race had been affected by fraudulent votes.\n\n\"Rick Scott won and he won by a lot,\" Trump told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace. \"I don\u2019t know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end. And if I didn\u2019t put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes he would of lost that election, okay? In my opinion he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him. Rick Scott won Florida.\"\n\nThe \u201cvotes that disappeared at the very end\u201d appears to be a reference to several counties failing to recount all of the ballots because of various mistakes or technical problems. In several cases \u2014 including in Palm Beach County, which Scott had highlighted as problematic \u2014 those votes weren\u2019t counted by the recount deadline and so weren\u2019t included.\n\nAgain, though, it\u2019s important to note that Trump\u2019s claim about how his spotlight of truth curtailed cheating lacks any evidence. His first tweet about the vote counting in Florida came after Broward County had announced its total number of cast ballots, meaning that there were no more votes that would be added to the county\u2019s total. The count itself revealed a preference for Nelson, but turnout in Broward was down from 2016 (unlike a lot of counties) and the shift in support of the Democratic candidate was lower than the average across Florida counties.\n\nIn that interview with the Daily Caller, Trump made broader \u2014 and more bafflingly untrue \u2014 claims about voter fraud, including that voters would vote twice by changing their shirts and that voter ID laws were less onerous than buying cereal, for which ID is required. (It is not.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump who continued to press unfounded allegations of impropriety in Florida after the results were finalized. On Jeanine Pirro\u2019s Fox News show on Saturday, Gov.-elect DeSantis also raised questions about voting in the state he will soon lead.\n\n\u201c[Y]ou had two counties \u2014 Broward and Palm Beach County \u2014 these ballots started appearing that were not initially logged. Because you know we track every vote, Judge. I mean, that\u2019s just how we do these elections now, so it started that they were all real big Democrat margins,\u201d he said. He later added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that there was a flagrant violation of the law. I mean, some of these votes that were counted late, a day or two after the election were supposedly cast during early voting, and they were just never reported as having been cast, and we have a lot of transparency and legal requirements precisely because that\u2019s what confers legitimacy to these results.\u201d\n\nWhy would DeSantis and Trump keep insisting on illegal procedures or illegal ballots in elections they just won? Quite possibly because they're looking forward two years to the next important election in the state.\n\nLast week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of Trump\u2019s most fervent and frequent defenders in the House, spoke with Breitbart News about the Florida voting. Gaetz made much more sweeping assertions about what had happened in the state (also either misleading, exaggerated or false) \u2014 but posited a rationale for why Democrats might be committing fraud ... but not enough fraud to win the elections.\n\n\u201cI think this is about really stress-testing the integrity of our election system,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think that Democrats are saying, okay, well if we\u2019re down 5,000 votes, these are the tools we can use. If we\u2019re down 15,000, these are the tools we can use. If we\u2019re down 30,000, then we need truckloads of new ballots to show up, right? I think that is really the exercise we\u2019re going through\u201d for the inevitably close race in Florida in 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Gaetz believes this is really what\u2019s happening any more than it\u2019s clear whether Trump thinks the vote in New Hampshire was fraudulent. But Gaetz, it seems, revealed the rationale behind the argument: hardening the state prior to 2020. Scott\u2019s efforts to restrict voting among former felons may have helped contribute to his Senate victory. DeSantis seems poised to push further on addressing how elections are run, changes that in other states in the past have often disenfranchised voters who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nNew laws in Florida and other states making it more difficult to vote would likely be helpful to Trump. Alleging fraud in Florida also positions the state to be in 2020 what Philadelphia voters were for Trump in 2016 \u2014 an escape hatch. In his interview with Fox News\u2019s Wallace, Trump made clear how much higher the stakes will be for him in two years' time.\n\nWhy\u2019d his party lose the House?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t on the ballot,\u201d Trump said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Greg Sargent", "title": "Why did Trump\u2019s lies fail so badly?

The result:\n\nThe analysis shows that the approximately three-dozen House districts Democrats flipped have substantially higher average gross-domestic-product-output per worker than the average across the totality of the districts now held by Republicans nationwide. The same goes for household income; percentage with a bachelor\u2019s degree; and job share in professional and digital services. Meanwhile, the flipped districts have a significantly lower percentage of manufacturing job share than the GOP ones overall.\n\nBy all these metrics, the flipped districts much more closely resemble the totality of Democratic districts across the country. Mark Muro, the Brookings senior fellow who conducted this analysis, draws broad conclusions about the areas of the country in which Democrats seized House districts.\n\n\u201cThe ones that flipped are relatively high-productivity, high-income and well-educated places with a higher proportion of their employment in information-oriented professional and digital services,\u201d Muro told me. \u201cThey are far better educated and more tied to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Muro added, the GOP districts \u201chave much less professional or digital employment, and are less educated and more oriented towards traditional pursuits like manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThe deepening economic divergence\n\nThe big story here is that this election once again highlighted the deepening economic divergence between Democratic and Republican areas, a divergence that is driven by what Brookings calls \u201cterritorial inequality.\u201d\n\nIn its new report out today, Brookings looks at this problem in depth. In short, the biggest metropolitan areas and their immediately surrounding suburbs are pulling away from more rural, small town, and small metro areas in productivity and share of the nation\u2019s job growth, due to digitalization, globalization, corporate concentration, and other factors.\n\n\u201cBig, techy metros like San Francisco, Boston, and New York with populations over 1 million have flourished, accounting for 72 percent of the nation\u2019s employment growth since the financial crisis,\u201d the report says. \u201cBy contrast, many of the nation\u2019s smaller cities, small towns, and rural areas have languished.\u201d This has created a \u201cgeography of discontent\u201d that has spawned \u201centrenched poverty\u201d in the \u201cleft-behind\u201d areas, producing \u201cdeepening small-town resentment of coastal cosmopolitan elites.\u201d\n\nAs my chart above details, the post-election map of the House shows that, overall, districts now held by Democrats have significantly higher output per worker, median household income, percentages with college degrees, and jobs in professional and digital services than GOP districts do.\n\nCNBC\u2019s John Harwood crunched this and other data supplied by Brookings and summarized it this way: All of the districts across the country that will now be controlled by Democrats \u201caccount for 61 percent of America\u2019s gross domestic product,\u201d while all the districts that will now be controlled by Republicans account for 38 percent.\n\nMy chart demonstrates that Democrats won with inroads into areas that follow that pattern. Harwood looked at more data and added:\n\nBlue districts have attracted the expanding segments of the U.S. population and workforce; half their residents are non-white. Red districts are 27 percent non-white.\n\nAll this hints at one reason Trump\u2019s closing narrative may have failed. Echoed by many Republican candidates, Trump closed with theatrical trade belligerence and a relentless campaign fueled by lies demonizing migrants as a destructive force. He tried to claim the Trump/GOP agenda \u2014 crackdowns on immigrants; trade wars; a deeply regressive economic agenda wrapped in false promises of a huge middle-class tax cut and health-care protections \u2014 has fueled a miraculous Trump Economy that is breaking decisively with the hellscape of the Obama years.\n\nBut if the areas where Democrats won the House are more prosperous and more connected to the global and digitalizing economy \u2014 and to some degree more diverse \u2014 then this may help explain why that narrative didn\u2019t resonate in those places. The economy was already doing well in many such areas when Trump took office, and globalization and immigration \u2014 in short, the changing makeup of the economy and the country \u2014 are perhaps not experienced as economic threats.\n\nIndeed, a new poll from Democracy Corps underscores this on immigration. It found that on Election Day, 54 percent of those who voted believe immigrants \u201cstrengthen our country,\u201d 20 points higher than those who see them as a burden. This included a large majority of independents. As pollster Stan Greenberg concluded, Trump\u2019s \u201copen borders\u201d attacks \u201cbackfired,\u201d allowing Democrats to make \u201cbig gains\u201d by embracing \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cimmigrants\u201d and \u201cmulticultural America.\u201d\n\nThose big gains were, of course, in the very areas discussed above.\n\nA lingering challenge for Democrats and progressives\n\nStill, all of this also points to the need for Democrats and progressives to do a better job speaking to those \u201cleft behind\u201d parts of the country, by focusing on the problem of territorial inequality.\n\nThe Brookings report lays out multiple ideas for mitigating this, from investments in helping workers transition to tech and digital occupations, to finding alternative sources of capital to bolster businesses in these lagging areas. It also points to the decline in antitrust enforcement leading to more power to depress wages by local employers in them. Brookings proposes geographically targeted wage subsidies and tax credits to incentivize hiring, among many other things.\n\nThe broader point here is that big Democratic gains in areas dominated by the new economy also showcase the need to address the problems in areas outside of them.\n\n\u201cThe economic dislocation outside growing metropolitan areas creates legitimate economic grievance,\u201d Marshall Steinbaum of the Roosevelt Institute, which has studied the impact of economic concentration on these left-behind areas, tells me. \u201cRising regional inequality bespeaks the need for a broader policy agenda,\u201d one that will \u201censure broadly shared prosperity.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, of course, lost ground in the Senate. Steinbaum points out that the geography of the upper chamber, in which rural areas are overrepresented, itself suggests the utility of a \u201ccompelling message\u201d on regional inequality directed at those areas.\n\nIt might also be good politics against Trump in 2020, as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s hate and lies are failing.

Attacking Bill McRaven\n\nWALLACE: Bill McRaven, retired admiral, Navy SEAL, 37 years, former head of U.S. Special Operations \u2014 TRUMP: Hillary Clinton fan. WALLACE: Special Operations \u2014 TRUMP: Excuse me, Hillary Clinton fan. WALLACE: Who led the operations, commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime. TRUMP: Okay, he\u2019s a Hilary Clinton, uh, backer and an Obama-backer and frankly \u2014 WALLACE: He was a Navy SEAL 37 years \u2014 TRUMP: Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that? Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice? You know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer. But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there. And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year and they don\u2019t tell him, they don\u2019t tell him \u2014 WALLACE: You\u2019re not even going to give them credit \u2014 TRUMP: For years -- WALLACE: \u2014 for taking down bin Laden? TRUMP: They took him down but \u2014 look, look, there\u2019s news right there, he lived in Pakistan, we\u2019re supporting Pakistan, we\u2019re giving them $1.3 billion a year, which we don\u2019t give them anymore, by the way, I ended it because they don\u2019t do anything for us, they don\u2019t do a damn thing for us.\n\nFor a candidate and president who has tried to make support for the U.S. military his calling card, Trump has shown remarkably little compunction about attacking decorated veterans and their families. The most famous example is Sen. John McCain, of course, whose war hero status Trump repeatedly questioned and whom Trump attacked even as McCain was dying of brain cancer over the last year. But Trump has also tangled with Khizr Khan, a Gold Star father who spoke against Trump at the Democratic National Convention, and, at one point, Trump suggested a Gold Star widow who spoke out against him was lying.\n\nAdd retired Adm. William H. McRaven to the list. When asked about criticisms from McRaven, who oversaw the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, Trump immediately dismissed him as a \u201cHillary backer\u201d \u2014 repeatedly.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nAdmiral McRaven tells me: \u201cI did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else. I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all Presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office...\u201d 1/ https://t.co/gMjkkpLaJF \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 18, 2018\n\nBut it\u2019s just noteworthy how quickly Trump goes into attack mode. As with McCain and Khan, Trump is serving notice that nobody is immune from his wrath. If you criticize him, you will be attacked in very political terms and even have your most significant achievements diminished. Trump has huge sway over his base, and he\u2019s basically saying: You can criticize me, but I will not let it pass, and I will not abide by the usual rules. I will attack your legacy, and I will take 40 percent of the country with me.\n\nIt may make sense as a political strategy. Usually such attacks would be punished politically, but Trump has so lowered the bar for the political rules of engagement that such criticisms are normal. It\u2019s why Republicans are so reluctant to condemn Trump.\n\nBut the McRaven example shows how ugly it can get. Here is another bona fide American hero being reduced to a partisan operative by the president of the United States.\n\n2. Questioning the intel on Jamal Khashoggi\n\nWALLACE: A month ago you said you had spoken with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and that he had told you directly that he had no knowledge of this. TRUMP: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right and still says that. WALLACE: But we now know that some of the people closest to him, some of his closest advisers were part of this. Question: Did MBS lie to your sir? TRUMP: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you know who could really know but I can say this he\u2019s got many people now that say he had no knowledge. WALLACE: What if the crown prince speaking to you, the president of the United States, directly lied to you about \u2014 TRUMP: Well, he told me that he had nothing to do with it. He told me that I would say maybe five times at different points. WALLACE: But what if he\u2019s lying? TRUMP: As recently as a few days ago. WALLACE: Do you just live with it because you need him? TRUMP: Well, will anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know? But he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved. You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\n\nWe know that the CIA has concluded, with high confidence, that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist. And Trump has made little secret that this is not his preferred conclusion.\n\nBut this answer, even more than his wishy-washy comments over the weekend, epitomizes how he\u2019s going to play it. Even as the CIA has told him Mohammed was almost definitely behind it, Trump suggests this is actually unknowable. \u201cWill anybody really know?\u201d he said. \u201cAll right, will anybody really know?\u201d\n\nIntelligence is an imprecise business, yes, but applying this standard means the United States basically won\u2019t hold anybody accountable, barring a conviction in criminal court. It\u2019s an impossible standard, but it\u2019s one Trump has employed before: with the Russia probe.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency has often meant calling into question the very existence of objective facts. But here\u2019s the point: He only does this when it\u2019s something he wants to doubt. It\u2019s a stark contrast to how Trump treats facts \u2014 many of them false \u2014 that he wants to accept.\n\nWhat\u2019s also telling here is that Trump will allow for the idea that his intelligence community is wrong, but he won\u2019t really allow for the idea that Mohammed has lied to him. It\u2019s a remarkable double standard, but a convenient one for Trump. And that\u2019s what really matters to him.\n\n3. \u2018I won the Senate\u2019\n\nWALLACE: When Democrats flipped the House back in 2006 and picked up 30 seats, President Bush 43 had a news conference the next day and said, \u201cWe had a thumping.\u201d Last week, in this election, the House picked up, so far it\u2019s 36 seats, it may be on the way to 40 seats and your reaction was that it was almost a complete victory. TRUMP: I won the Senate, you don\u2019t mention that. WALLACE: But, well \u2014 I \u2014 TRUMP: Excuse me, I won the Senate. WALLACE: I understand that but \u2014 TRUMP: I think they said 88 years. WALLACE: But this was a \u2014 this was a historically big defeat in the House. You lost 36, maybe 40 seats. Some would argue that it was a thumping. And I want to talk about some of the ways in which you lost. You lost in traditionally Republican suburbs, not only around liberal cities like Philadelphia and D.C. but also red-state big cities like Houston and Oklahoma City. You lost among suburban women. You lost among independents and, in three key states that I think you remember pretty well \u2014 Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan \u2014 you lost both the governor seats and the Senate seats. TRUMP: Are you ready? I won the Senate, and that\u2019s historic too, because if you look at presidents in the White House it\u2019s almost never happened where you won a seat. We won \u2014 we now have 53 as opposed to 51 and we have 53 great senators in the U.S. Senate. We won. That\u2019s a tremendous victory. Nobody talks about that. That\u2019s a far greater victory than it is for the other side. Number two, I wasn\u2019t on the ballot. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 ... WALLACE: But if you can\u2019t carry \u2014 and you certainly didn\u2019t carry it two weeks ago \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, you\u2019re not going to get reelected. TRUMP: I didn\u2019t run. I wasn\u2019t running. My name wasn\u2019t on the ballot. There are many people that think, \u201cI don\u2019t like Congress,\u201d that like me a lot. I get it all the time; \u201cSir, we\u2019ll never vote unless you\u2019re on the ballot.\u201d I get it all the time. People are saying, \u201cSir, I will never vote unless you\u2019re on the ballot. I say, \u201cNo, no, go and vote.\u201d \u201cWell, what do you mean?\u201d As much as I try and convince people to go vote, I\u2019m not on the ballot.\n\nWithin a span of two minutes, Trump both takes credit for \u201cwinning the Senate,\u201d but also suggests historic losses in the House were not his fault. And it\u2019s not even him saying Republicans won the Senate; it\u2019s \u201cI won the Senate.\u201d\n\nTrump will argue this is because he campaigned for Senate candidates and not really for House candidates. Okay. But he\u2019s picking and choosing what\u2019s a reflection of him and what is not. It also raises this question: If Trump was such a boon to the GOP in the Senate, why didn\u2019t he try to replicate that in the House, which after all was the more endangered chamber?\n\nThe answer: The White House knew he wasn\u2019t helping them hold the House, but he could turn out the GOP base in key Senate races. And when it comes to Trump\u2019s overall impact, he can\u2019t have it both ways."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Britain's top diplomat in Iran as US oil sanctions back on - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Britain's top diplomat in Iran as US oil sanctions back on Washington Post TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 Iranian state media say the country's foreign minister discussed ways of easing international financial transactions during a meeting with British Foreig\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/britains-top-diplomat-in-iran-as-us-oil-sanctions-back-on/2018/11/19/3914adc4-ec05-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:15:59Z", "content": "TEHRAN, Iran Iranian state media say the countrys foreign minister discussed ways of easing international financial transactions during a meeting with British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt in Tehran.

He planned and directed the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. President Trump attacked him in an interview that aired Sunday. (University of Texas at Austin/AP)\n\nWith Joanie Greve\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump\u2019s insults of war heroes and military families who criticize him are a feature, not a bug, of his presidency.\n\nBill McRaven, a retired Navy SEAL and Special Operations commander who oversaw the killing of Osama bin Laden and the capture of Saddam Hussein, is just the latest veteran to face Trump\u2019s ire. \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace asked the president about McRaven\u2019s comment that Trump referring to the free press as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d is the greatest threat to democracy. Rather than respond to the substance of this critique, Trump dismissed McRaven as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer.\u201d Then he said the four-star admiral should have caught bin Laden earlier.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?\u201d the president said. \u201cEverybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s counterpunching betrayed a lack of basic knowledge about how these kinds of operations work. A former deputy CIA director, Michael Morell, noted that it was never McRaven\u2019s job to find bin Laden:\n\nCorrection needed to POTUS\u2019s comment today that McRaven should have found bin Laden sooner. CIA did the \u201cfinding.\u201d McRaven\u2019s special operators did the \u201cgetting.\u201d They moved within days of President Obama giving the order. https://t.co/7e79sDpENH \u2014 Michael Morell (@MichaelJMorell) November 18, 2018\n\nA former director of the CIA and NSA, retired four-star Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, also wondered why Trump hasn\u2019t taken out other terrorist leaders in hiding:\n\nHow you doing on Zawahiri, Mr President? Abu Bakr al Baghdadi? BillMcRaven is a naval officer and an American hero. Like the ones that gave all at Belleau Woods. You remember them, right? https://t.co/FrE7wjPEg3 \u2014 Gen Michael Hayden (@GenMhayden) November 18, 2018\n\nMcRaven recently stepped down as chancellor of the University of Texas system to battle leukemia.\n\n\u201cI did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else,\u201d he said in a statement to CNN. \u201cI am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for. I admire all presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the nation together in challenging times. I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime. When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression, then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands.\u201d\n\n(McRaven also criticized Trump this summer for revoking former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance in an op-ed for The Washington Post.)\n\n-- Trump, who gave himself an \u201cA \u201d for his overall performance as president in the Fox interview, routinely claims that he\u2019s a champion for those who have served in uniform. \u201cNobody has been better at the military,\u201d Trump said last month. \u201cI have done more for the military than any president in many, many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the vets, maybe more than anybody else, appreciate what we are doing for them,\u201d he added during an event at the White House last week.\n\n-- But Trump often hasn\u2019t lived up to his rhetoric. Among other things, he never apologized to John McCain before he died. The president said the late Arizona senator was not a war hero because he got captured. When retired Marine Corps Gen. John Allen endorsed Clinton in 2016, Trump blasted the former commander of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan as \u201ca failed general.\u201d\n\n-- Thanks to Trump, more than 5,000 American G.I.s who would have spent Thanksgiving with their families will instead be separated from them \u2014 deployed at the southern border, waiting around for the arrival of a caravan of migrant families from Central America.\n\n\u201cHe likes to pound his chest and talk tough, but he has not served our nation in uniform,\u201d said Rep.-elect Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be spending yet another holiday away from their families in tents without running water.\u201d\n\nCrow is one of at least nine Democrats who won House seats this month who served in the armed forces, intelligence services or in national security roles at State or DOD. When they get seated in January, they plan to launch an investigation into whether Trump\u2019s politically motivated deployment wasted taxpayer resources, according to Karoun Demirjian and Dave Weigel.\n\n-- Last Monday, on Veterans Day, Trump suggested that ballots cast by active duty members of the military who are deployed overseas should not be counted in Florida. He said that the state \u201cmust go with election night\u201d numbers and not count new ballots that arrived afterward. He said this four days before the deadline, under Florida law, for military ballots to arrive that had been postmarked by Nov. 6.\n\n-- The same day, he broke with tradition and \u2014 for the second year in a row \u2014 did not visit Arlington National Cemetery on the holiday. That was even after he took heavy criticism for skipping a Saturday ceremony in France to honor the end of World War I. The White House blamed rain, but the leaders of France, Germany and Canada still showed up.\n\n-- Two years into the job, Trump still has not visited U.S. troops in a combat zone \u2014 and he canceled a planned trip last week to see some of the troops he deployed to the border. In the Fox interview, Trump made a rare acknowledgment that he erred by blowing off Arlington on Veterans Day. \u201cI should have done that,\u201d he said. \u201cI was extremely busy on calls for the country, we did a lot of calling as you know.\u201d He also hinted that a plan to visit a war zone is in the works and said he hasn\u2019t been able to go so far because he\u2019s been so busy.\n\nTrump, who avoided serving in Vietnam by claiming he had bone spurs in his feet, has gone golfing on more than 100 days of his presidency. He said in 1997 that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases while promiscuously gallivanting around New York City in the 1970s was \u201cmy personal Vietnam.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cTrump recently has signaled discontent with the top retired generals serving in his administration, raising questions about whether he is souring on the military brass in his orbit,\u201d Paul Sonne and Phil Rucker report. \u201cEarlier this year, he derided Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as \u2018sort of a Democrat.\u2019 In Sunday\u2019s interview, he said that there are things [John] Kelly does that he doesn\u2019t like and that at some point he will move on from the chief of staff position.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cRhetorically, Mr. Trump has embraced the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as \u2018my military\u2019 and \u2018my generals\u2019 \u2026 But top Defense Department officials say that Mr. Trump has not fully grasped the role of the troops he commands, nor the responsibility that he has to lead them and protect them from politics,\u201d the New York Times reported Saturday.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t believe in the mission: \u201cOne reason he has not visited troops in war zones, according to his aides, is that he does not really want American troops there in the first place. To visit, they said, would validate missions he does not truly believe in.\u201d\n\nAnother telling detail that shows how disinterested he is in details: \u201cShortly after becoming commander in chief, President Trump asked so few questions in a briefing at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., that top military commanders cut the number of prepared PowerPoint slides to three \u2014 they had initially planned 18 \u2026 The commanders had slotted two hours for the meeting, but it lasted less than one,\u201d per Helene Cooper, Peter Baker, Eric Schmitt and Mitchell Ferman.\n\n\u201cThere was the belief that over time, he would better understand, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Col. David Lapan, a retired Marine who served in the Trump administration in 2017 as a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, in an interview with the Times. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he understands the proper use and role of the military and what we can, and can\u2019t, do.\u201d\n\nFormer high school track coach Evie Cluke talks about her interactions with Ian David Long after he shot and killed 12 people at a Southern California bar. Cluke said Long was volatile and sadistic and once told her he wanted to join the military so he could kill people for his country. Cluke coached Long at Newbury Park High School in 2008 and 2009. (Amanda Lee Myers/AP)\n\n-- Many veterans and mental-health advocates also bristled two weeks ago when Trump appeared to blame the massacre at a Thousand Oaks, Calif., nightclub on the post-traumatic stress disorder of a Marine veteran who had served in Afghanistan. Trump began speculating about PTSD when asked about 28-year-old Marine veteran Ian David Long, who killed 12 people at the country-music bar in California before killing himself. \u201cHe was a Marine. He was in the war. He served time. He saw some pretty bad things, and a lot of people say he had PTSD, and that\u2019s a tough deal,\u201d Trump said after describing the shooter as a \u201cvery sick puppy.\u201d \u201cPeople come back \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s a horrible thing \u2014 they come back, they\u2019re never the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s broad-brush remarks outside the White House on Friday prompted concern that the president was amplifying stereotypes suggesting PTSD turns veterans into violent killers and that all service members come home somehow damaged from combat,\u201d Sonne reported. \u201cIt is not clear whether Long had been formally diagnosed with PTSD before his death.\u201d\n\nSubsequent reporting has revealed that Long had a pattern of being violent and unable to control his temper for years before he joined the military.\n\nWilliam Owens holds a photo of his youngest son, Ryan Owens, at his home in Lauderdale by the Sea, Fla. (Emily Michot/Miami Herald/AP)\n\n-- Moreover, Trump has had several awkward and testy interactions with Gold Star families.\n\nWeeks into his presidency, Trump traveled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet the family of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who had died during a mission in Yemen. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u201cFear,\u201d the experience was so uncomfortable for the president that \u201che let it be known the would make no more trips to Dover.\u201d \u201cNo one said anything harsh, but there was a definite coldness that the president remembered,\u201d Woodward reported.\n\nTrump had personally authorized the operation in which Owens died, but the president blamed the generals for the outcome. He said on Fox News at the time that the commanders \u201ccame to see me and they explained what they wanted to do \u2026 And they lost Ryan.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Trump called the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson after he was killed in action in Niger. She said he stumbled recalling her husband\u2019s name and told her that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery upset and hurt; it made me cry even worse,\u201d Myeshia Johnson said of her conversation with the president, saying Trump\u2019s tone made her angry. \u201cIf my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risked his life for our country, why can\u2019t you remember his name?\u201d\n\nTrump disputed Johnson\u2019s account and said he was \u201cvery respectful\u201d in tweets about the incident. A congresswoman who was in the room when it happened validated the widow\u2019s account.\n\nIn a phone call to another grieving Gold Star father, Chris Baldridge, after his son was killed in Afghanistan in June 2017, Trump said he\u2019d send a personal check for $25,000 and would direct his staff to establish an online fundraiser for the family, but neither happened \u2014 until after The Post pressed the White House on the issue four months later.\n\nKhizr Khan, left, talks to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) during the confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions in January 2017. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\n-- The most famous clash with a Gold Star family came before Trump took office. In July 2016, Trump criticized the parents of the late Capt. Humayun Khan after they spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Khizr Khan, a Pakistani-born Muslim, said his son wouldn\u2019t have been able to be in the United States, let alone serve in the armed forces, if Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban was in effect. Directing his remarks at Trump and waving a pocket Constitution, Khan said: \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing, and no one.\u201d\n\nTrump responded by saying, \u201cI think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard.\u201d He then said Hillary Clinton\u2019s writers gave him the speech to deliver, which Khan denied, and suggested that Ghazala Khan, Capt. Khan\u2019s mother, did not speak at the DNC because the Islamic religion does not allow her to speak in public.\n\n\u201cI was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention,\u201d Trump tweeted later. \u201cAm I not allowed to respond?\u201d\n\n-- Today is the sixth anniversary of this Trump tweet:\n\nIt makes me feel so good to hit \"sleazebags\" back -- much better than seeing a psychiatrist (which I never have!) \u2014 Donald J.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\n-- The White House informed CNN reporter Jim Acosta it would again revoke his press pass once a judge\u2019s temporary order expires. Meagan Flynn reports: \u201cThe 14-day order was issued Friday and unless the judge extends it, it would expire at the end of the month. In a ruling seen as a victory for press freedom, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly, appointed by [Trump], ordered the White House to temporarily restore Acosta\u2019s press pass on Friday while he considers the merits of the case and the possibility of a permanent order. \u2026 But on Sunday night, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter of \u2018Reliable Sources\u2019 said in his newsletter that \u2018White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.\u2019\u201d\n\nMichael Bloomberg speaks during a panel discussion in Washington.

Tim Craig, Annie Gowen and Frances Stead Sellers report: \u201cAs firefighters battle to contain the deadly Camp Fire, authorities intensified efforts to identify the lost and the dead. Teams of volunteers in white protective gear searched blackened ground and family members came to makeshift DNA centers where their mouths were swabbed to help identify victim remains. On Saturday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said that the list of people unaccounted for was up to 1,276 and that 63 victims have been tentatively identified. On Friday authorities released more than 600 names in an effort to identify those who had been found by friends and relatives. The astonishing tally raised fears that the death toll would rise exponentially.\u201d\n\n-- The garage of one family who fled the fire became a safe haven for an ambulance crew and their patients. Allison Klein reports: \u201cA few hours [after leaving their home], [Desiree] Borden got a Facebook message from someone she didn\u2019t know: \u2018I know this is random,\u2019 it read. \u2018Is your house at ...

Trump went on to explain that the president of Finland, whom he met on an overseas trip a week earlier, told him about raking the forest floors. \u2018He called it a forest nation,\u2019 Trump said, \u2018and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem.\u2019 Finnish President Sauli Niinisto later disputed this. He told a local newspaper that he had briefed Trump on Finland\u2019s efforts to surveil and care for its forests ... but said he can\u2019t recall anything being mentioned on raking.\u201d\n\n-- Finland instead focuses on removing dead trees from forest floors and providing early warning of fires. The New York Times\u2019s Patrick Kingsley explains: \u201cThe secret to the Finns\u2019 forest management system lies instead in its early warning system, aerial surveillance system and network of forest roads, said Professor Henrik Lindberg, a forest fires researcher at the H\u00e4me University of Applied Sciences, a college in southern Finland. At times of high incendiary risk, the Finnish authorities are highly effective at delivering warnings across most forms of media.\u201d\n\nA man holds a poster showing images of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, describing the prince as \u201cassassin\u201d and Khashoggi as \u201cmartyr.\u201d (Emrah Gurel/AP)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump said he will not listen to the \u201csuffering tape\u201d of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Felicia Sonmez and Karen DeYoung report: \u201cBased in part on the tape and other intercepted communications, the CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered last month\u2019s killing of Khashoggi \u2026 But Trump maintained in an interview on \u2018Fox News Sunday\u2019 that the crown prince had told him \u2018maybe five different times\u2019 and \u2018as recently as a few days ago\u2019 that he had nothing to do with the killing. Aides have said Trump has been looking for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed, a close ally who plays a central role in Trump\u2019s Middle East policy.\n\n\u201c\u2018We have the tape. I don\u2019t want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape,\u2019 Trump said in the Fox interview ... He described it as \u2018a suffering tape\u2019 and told Fox host Chris Wallace, \u2018I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it . . . . It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.\u2019 Still, Trump demurred when Wallace asked about Mohammed\u2019s role in the killing and whether the crown prince may have been lying to Trump about his lack of involvement. \u2018Well, will anybody really know?\u2019 Trump said. \u2018You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But, at the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s comments underscored how hesitant he is to break with MBS after building his Middle East strategy around the crown prince. From the New York Times\u2019s Mark Landler: \u201c[The 33-year-old heir] has become the fulcrum of the administration\u2019s strategy in the Middle East \u2014 from Iran to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process \u2014 as well as a prolific shopper for American military weapons, even if most of those contracts have not paid off yet. [The president\u2019s comments] also showed how stubbornly Mr. Trump has decided to stick with his ally. He does not even want to listen to evidence that could shake his confidence, even if it creates rifts with intelligence officials.\u201d\n\n-- Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping escalated their trade attacks during this weekend\u2019s Pacific Rim trade summit. The New York Times\u2019s Damien Cave reports: \u201c[Xi and Pence] both made their cases to the global leaders assembled in Papua New Guinea \u2014 then they dug in and refused to compromise. That left the group of 21 nations in disarray, unable to agree on even a routine joint statement like those that had closed every other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit since 1989. Countries caught in the trade-war crossfire between China and the United States are becoming increasingly exasperated. \u2026 Experts said the stalemate at [APEC] would set up a high-stakes showdown at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina this month, which Mr. Xi and [Trump] are expected to attend.\u201d\n\n-- China\u2019s continued success has defied U.S. predictions that its economic model would not last. The New York Times\u2019s Philip P. Pan reports: \u201cThe pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations. During this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot. But neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again.\u201d\n\n-- John Bolton has centralized national security decision-making in Trump\u2019s administration, a move that has been criticized by some of his colleagues. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dion Nissenbaum reports: \u201cMr. Bolton, who turns 70 years old Tuesday, has pared back the number of people accustomed to playing a bigger role in important national security debates and has convened fewer meetings than his predecessor of the White House \u2018Principals Committee\u2019 \u2026 Although Mr. Bolton has scored key policy victories during his short White House tenure, his consolidation of authority has irked other administration officials, who say he and his National Security Council aren\u2019t serving as honest brokers in coordinating the administration\u2019s national security policies.\u201d\n\n-- New U.S. sanctions on Iran are having a severe impact on medical imports. Erin Cunningham reports: \u201cThe trade of humanitarian goods is allowed under U.S. sanctions, according to Treasury Department guidelines, permitting Iran to import food, medicine and medical devices without punishment. But the far-reaching sanctions on Iranian financial firms reimposed two weeks ago could endanger the flow of humanitarian goods as foreign banks and outside suppliers abandon business ties with their partners in Iran, analysts and experts warn. In recent months, some European banks have refused to process payments even from Iranian firms that are exempt from sanctions out of fear of U.S. penalties, according to people familiar with the transactions. \u2026 Some say they fear transactions with outside banks could cease altogether, prompting shortages of vital goods, including medicine.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration\u2019s opposition to U.N. aid for Palestinian refugees has sparked a debate over who gets to define refugees. Loveday Morris and Suzan Haidamous report: \u201cDespite the fact that many were born and raised in Lebanon, Palestinian residents remain reliant on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), an entity that provides aid to millions of Palestinians around the region, particularly for basic services like health care and education. Now, however, the Trump administration is trying to dismantle that lifeline, leaving many Palestinians fearing for their futures. \u2026 These efforts have sparked debate over what it means to be a Palestinian refugee and highlighted questions on resettlement, and whether residency or citizenship in another country would diminish their claim to a future Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Trump said he would not intervene if acting attorney general Matt Whitaker moved to curtail special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201c\u2018Look, it\u2019s going to be up to him. . . . I would not get involved,\u2019 Trump said in an interview on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019 The president also publicly mocked a House Democrat who criticized Whitaker, deriding Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) as \u2018little Adam Schitt\u2019 in a tweet. \u2026 Trump said in Sunday\u2019s interview that he \u2018did not know [Whitaker] took views on the Mueller investigation as such\u2019 before he appointed him. Trump essentially shut the door to sitting down with Mueller, telling host Chris Wallace that his written answers mean \u2018probably this is the end\u2019 of his involvement in the inquiry. \u2018I think we\u2019ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably: We\u2019re finished,\u2019 Trump said. He said that he had given \u2018very complete answers to a lot of questions\u2019 and that \u2018that should solve the problem.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Ben Terris profiles Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat who is in line to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee: \u201cWith a healthy heart, and in control, Cummings has limitless possible targets: hush money paid to a porn star on Trump\u2019s behalf, citizenship questions on the census, security clearances revoked from the president\u2019s critics, and dozens of other oh-yeah-remember-thats that slipped out of the churning news cycle unanswered. The difficulty won\u2019t be finding things to look into. It will be figuring out what\u2019s worth looking into. Cummings knows by now the risks that come with opening wounds voluntarily. After he recovered from heart surgery, he checked back into the hospital for another procedure \u2014 this time on his knee. But something went wrong. The knee got infected, and Cummings spent another three months at Hopkins. He emerged more aware than ever that there\u2019s only a finite amount of time in this world.\u201d\n\n-- Criticism of how Facebook has reacted to manipulation of its platform during the 2016 election has caused tension between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Deepa Seetharaman reports: \u201cThe 34-year-old CEO believes Facebook didn\u2019t move quickly enough at key moments this year and increasingly is pressing senior executives to \u2018make progress faster\u2019 on resolving problems such as slowing user growth and securing the platform ... It also has led to confrontations with some of his top reports, including Ms. Sandberg, who has long had considerable autonomy over the Facebook teams that control communications and policy. This spring, Mr. Zuckerberg told Ms. Sandberg, 49, that he blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica, the research firm that inappropriately accessed private data on Facebook users and used it for political research, according to people familiar with the exchange.\u201d\n\n-- Eli Saslow traces the roots of a satirical website started by liberal bloggers that has become popular among Trump supporters: \u201cIn the last two years on his page, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, [Christopher] Blair had made up stories about California instituting sharia, former president Bill Clinton becoming a serial killer, undocumented immigrants defacing Mount Rushmore, and former president Barack Obama dodging the Vietnam draft when he was 9. \u2018Share if you\u2019re outraged!\u2019 his posts often read, and thousands of people on Facebook had clicked \u2018like\u2019 and then \u2018share,\u2019 most of whom did not recognize his posts as satire. Instead, Blair\u2019s page had become one of the most popular on Facebook among Trump-supporting conservatives over 55.\u201d\n\nMIDTERMS FALLOUT:\n\n-- Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson conceded to Republican Gov. Rick Scott in Florida\u2019s fraught Senate race. Amy B Wang, Felicia Sonmez and Paul Sonne report: \u201cAlthough results of the race are not due to be certified until Tuesday, Nelson said in remarks posted on Twitter that things had worked out \u2018a little differently\u2019 from the way he and his wife had hoped. He went on to issue a call for bipartisanship in an era of brutally divisive politics. \u2026 Scott\u2019s victory boosts the Republican Senate majority to 52, with a final seat in Mississippi due to be decided in a Nov. 27 runoff. In a statement, Scott thanked Nelson for his service. \u2026 Going into the recount, Nelson trailed Scott by more than 12,000 votes, and his campaign had hoped a reexamination of ballots \u2014 particularly in heavily Democratic Broward County \u2014 would help him close the gap. But when the recount ended at midday Sunday, Scott still led Nelson by 10,033 votes out of more than 8 million cast, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Scott\u2019s razor-thin victory leaves Florida, the nation\u2019s third-most-populous state, with two Republican senators for the first time since the Reconstruction era immediately after the Civil War.\u201d\n\n-- Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes submitted her resignation. The South Florida Sun Sentinel\u2019s Anthony Man reports: \u201cBroward\u2019s vote counting was an outlier among the state\u2019s 67 counties, taking a long time to complete. For days, Snipes wouldn\u2019t say how many ballots were outstanding and uncounted and her office wasn\u2019t reporting updated results as frequently as the law required. And there were repeated hiccups during the recount period, including Snipes\u2019 acknowledgment on Saturday that her office couldn\u2019t find 2,040 ballots that had been included in the first vote count but not in the machine recount of state elections. \u2026 She\u2019s been subject to waves of criticism for long lines and slow vote counts in multiple elections.\u201d\n\n-- The Florida recount fight is a dress rehearsal for 2020. Beth Reinhard and Amy Gardner report: \u201cAmid the raucous street protests and updates from sleep-deprived election workers, influential figures in both parties \u00adinserted themselves into the drama \u2014 testing legal strategies to influence the makeup of the electorate and political arguments to win public opinion. \u2026 For Democrats, who typically perform better in high-turnout elections, that meant pushing to count as many votes as possible and accusing Republicans of trying to suppress the vote. For Republicans, the goal was to limit the number of eligible votes and claim Democrats were trying to steal the election.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s aggressive response to the recount demonstrates how the Florida Republican has belatedly come to embrace Trumpism. Sean Sullivan reports: \u201cSince the Nov. 6 midterm elections, Rubio has stood on the front lines of the partisan war here in Florida over his state\u2019s recount, storming social media with criticism of Democrats and seizing on incomplete information to raise doubts about the intentions of elections officials. He also penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed declaring that \u2018Trump Is Right About Nationalism,\u2019 embracing a term fraught with racial and historical baggage, though he argued it is not about ethnicity. \u2026 His latest transformation has revived criticism among some Republicans that Rubio is a politician without a core \u2014 a shape-shifter who has bounced from tea party insurgent to sunny moderate to Trump acolyte with little compunction.\u201d\n\n-- Democrat Stacey Abrams, who conceded in Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race to Republican Brian Kemp, refused to call Kemp the \u201cthe legitimate governor-elect.\u201d Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \u201cCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper was asking [Abrams] whether she felt the victor was \u2018the legitimate governor-elect.\u2019 Abrams, who had hoped to force a runoff with Kemp but conceded the race on Friday, pivoted to her concerns about irregularities, voter suppression and a last-minute investigation during her campaign for her state\u2019s highest office. \u2026 \u2018The law as it stands says that he received an adequate number of votes to become the governor of Georgia,\u2019 Abrams said. \u2018But we know sometimes the law does not do what it should, and something being legal does not make it right.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump announced he would hold rallies in Mississippi next week as the state\u2019s Nov. 27 runoff Senate race has become unexpectedly competitive. Matt Viser reports: \u201cRepublican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith stumbled recently when, in praise of a supporter, she spoke of her willingness to sit in the front row of a public hanging if he invited her \u2014 words that, in the South, evoked images of lynchings. She has struggled to grapple with the fallout, baffling members of her party and causing even faithful Republicans to consider voting for her opponent, former congressman Mike Espy. That Espy is attempting to become the state\u2019s first black senator since shortly after the Civil War made her remarks all the more glaring. It has positioned him to take advantage not only of a substantial black turnout but of a potential swell of crossover support from those put off by Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign. Espy remains the underdog in the conservative state, but Republicans with access to private polling say Hyde-Smith\u2019s lead has narrowed significantly in recent days.\u201d\n\n-- Despite immense polarization, hundreds of thousands of voters still split their ballots this year between Republican and Democratic candidates. Jenna Johnson found some of them: \u201cOf the more than 2.3 million Arizonans who voted in the midterm election, roughly 188,000 appear to have voted for [Democratic Senate candidate Kyrsten] Sinema and Republican [Gov. Doug] Ducey. Maricopa County, Arizona\u2019s most populous county and home to Phoenix and its suburbs, also split its votes overall. Although Ducey was easily reelected, Sinema won by just under 54,000 votes out of more than 2.3 million cast, so those split-ticket voters played a major role in the outcome. Democratic and Republican strategists say that although they started in different camps, Sinema and Ducey both found victory by being aggressively moderate and presenting themselves as problem solvers, not partisans.\u201d\n\n-- But Trump\u2019s consistent presence on the campaign trail appears to have deepened partisan divides during the midterms. Michael Scherer and Robert Costa report: \u201cThe Trump effect now sets the stage for an intensely tribal 2020 showdown over his reelection, with a smaller and heavily rural Republican Party facing off against a growing Democratic coalition of suburban and urban residents in higher-income states. \u2026 Strategists from both parties say the president, in effect, erected a wall that broke the blue wave, allowing Republicans to hold onto key House seats and defeat Democratic Senate incumbents in conservative Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. The same strategy, however, empowered Democrats to win decisive victories in formerly Republican suburbs in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, California and the otherwise reliably red state of Texas.\u201d\n\n-- Trump has abandoned the dire warnings he espoused in the immediate run-up to Election Day in an apparent effort to stave off Republican losses. From Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey: \u201cGone from the president\u2019s talking points are dire threats about the caravan of Central American migrants that he had described as imminent and life-threatening, or the executive order he promised to sign ending the constitutional right to citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants, or the phantom 10 percent middle-class tax cut that he said would pass so easily. Now that Democrats have seized the House majority, the president has added to his repertoire happy talk about cutting deals with Pelosi \u2026 Trump\u2019s shift in rhetoric and policy priorities is striking enough that this period of his presidency could be divided in two parts: Before and after Nov. 6.\u201d\n\n-- Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s solid performance in the Texas Senate race has scrambled Democrats\u2019 2020 calculus. Politico\u2019s David Siders reports: \u201cEven prior to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s meteoric rise, many Democratic fundraisers had approached the large number of 2020 contenders with apprehension, fearful of committing early to one candidate. But the prospect of a presidential bid by O\u2019Rourke, whose charismatic Senate candidacy captured the party\u2019s imagination, has suddenly rewired the race. \u2026 O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appeal rests on his perceived ability to bridge a gulf within the party \u2014 between Democratic contenders who are older but come with pre-existing donor networks, and Democrats who are younger but have not yet developed a substantial fundraising base.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi speaks during a weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n-- On the Sunday shows, incoming Democratic House members expressed differing opinions on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership bid. Tory Newmyer reports: \u201c\u2018I would look at what the job is, and it\u2019s a little bit of herding cats, and it\u2019s a little bit about keeping a Democratic Party that\u2019s full of lots of different points of view. And I think that Nancy has demonstrated that time and time again,\u2019 [Rep.-elect Donna Shalala (D-Fla.)] said in an interview alongside four other newly elected female House Democrats on ABC News\u2019s \u2018This Week.\u2019 \u2018She has a backbone. She\u2019ll stand up to a president.\u2019 \u2026 [But Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger (Va.)] said she will honor the commitment [she made during her campaign]. \u2018If we are going to turn a page and bring civility back to the political discussions, we need to change the people who are directing that conversation,\u2019 Spanberger said ...on ABC.\u201d\n\n-- But the lack of a declared challenger to Pelosi is impeding efforts to deny her the gavel. The New York Times\u2019s Julie Hirschfeld Davis reports: \u201cAs much as some House Democrats, including several among the wave of newcomers elected this month, say they want to shake up a calcified party leadership, would-be challengers are keenly aware of the immense power Ms. Pelosi wields, and fearful of institutional retribution and reputational damage if they step forward to test the status quo.\u201d\n\n-- Democrats completed a sweep of congressional races in Orange County, previously a GOP stronghold. The LA Times\u2019s Mark Z. Barabak, Joe Mozingo and Michael Finnegan report: \u201cGil Cisneros defeated Republican Young Kim on Saturday in the last of Orange County\u2019s undecided House races \u2026 With Cisneros\u2019 victory, Democrats will constitute the entirety of Orange County\u2019s seven-member congressional delegation, the first time since the 1930s that the birthplace of Richard Nixon, home of John Wayne and spiritual center of the Republican Party will have no GOP representative in the House. \u2026 Cisneros\u2019 victory, after more than a week of counting mail-in and other outstanding ballots, will give Democrats 45 of the state\u2019s 53 House seats and mark a new low for the flailing Republican Party.\u201d\n\n-- Even with former Senate majority leader Harry Reid in retirement, the Democratic machine he created helped lead to a wipeout of Republicans in Nevada. The AP\u2019s Michelle L. Price and Nicholas Riccardi report: \u201cDemocrats romped up and down the state in the Nov. 6 midterm elections, ousting Republican Sen. Dean Heller, winning races for governor and lieutenant governor, and expanding their state legislative majorities. The shellacking was 15 years in the making, the culmination of a long-term plan to shift a battleground into the Democratic column. \u2026 Despite being treated for pancreatic cancer, Reid has remained active in Nevada politics.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee responded to Trump's insult (the president appeared to intentionally misspell his name):\n\nWow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one.\n\n\n\nWas that like your answers to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, or did you write this one yourself? https://t.co/Yd27sayt7C \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) November 18, 2018\n\nRick Scott celebrated his victory:\n\nThe president congratulated Scott:\n\nFrom day one Rick Scott never wavered.

The fresco depicts a story and art subject of Greek mythology, with Queen of Sparta Leda being impregnated by Zeus - Jupiter in Roman mythology - in the form of a swan. (Cesare Abbate/ANSA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nROME \u2014 Archaeologists have found a fresco in an ancient Pompeii bedroom that depicts a sensual scene of the Roman god Jupiter, disguised as a swan, and a legendary queen of Sparta from Greek mythology.\n\nThe figure of Leda being impregnated by the god in swan form was a fairly common home decoration theme in Pompeii and Herculaneum, another town destroyed in A.D. 79 by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius near present-day Naples.\n\nBut Pompeii archaeological park director Massimo Osanna praised this fresco as exceptional since it was painted to make it appear Leda was looking at whoever saw the fresco upon entering the bedroom.\n\n\u201cLeda watches the spectator with a sensuality that\u2019s absolutely pronounced,\u201d Osanna told Italian news agency ANSA.\n\nThe fresco\u2019s details include a depiction of Leda protecting the swan with her cloak as the bird sits on her lap.\n\nOsanna noted the fresco\u2019s context of the Greek \u201cmyth of love, with an explicit sensuality in a bedroom where, obviously beside sleep, there could be other activities.\u201d\n\nThe fresco, with its colors still remarkably vivid, was discovered Friday during ongoing work to consolidate the ancient city\u2019s structures after rains and wear-and-tear in past years caused some ruins to collapse, the tourist site\u2019s officials said.\n\nThe bedroom is located near a corridor by the entranceway of an upscale domus, or home, where another splendid fresco was discovered earlier this year, said the archaeological park, which is part of the Italian Culture Ministry.\n\nLeda is an important figure in Greek mythology. She was said to have borne children fathered by the god Zeus, the Greek version of Jupiter, and by a mortal king of Sparta. According to myth, her children included the beautiful Helen of Troy and the twins Castor and Pollux.\n\nOsanna said one hypothesis is that the home\u2019s owner was a rich merchant who wanted to give the impression he was culturally advanced by incorporating myth-inspired frescoes. It appeared the artist was inspired by a 4th century B.C. sculpture by Timotheos, he said.\n\nBecause of safety concerns, unexcavated parts of the domus will probably remain that way, ANSA said. Archaeologists are considering removing both frescos found in the home to a place where \u201cthey can be protected and shown to the public,\u201d Osanna was quoted as saying.\n\nPompeii\u2019s sprawling, partially excavated grounds are one of Italy\u2019s top tourist attractions.\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects Leda\u2019s identity in mythology as a queen of Sparta.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bernhardt, who worked as a lobbyist for a decade before rejoining the department, is prohibited from participating in matters that specifically affect 22 of his former clients until Aug. 3, 2019. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nEver since the resignation in July of Scott Pruitt from the Environmental Protection Agency, environmentalists angry at the Trump administration's pro-fossil-fuel push have aimed their ire at Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\nBut behind the scene at Interior, which manages one-fifth of the America's landmass, Zinke's No. 2 is quietly making his mark. On Monday, my colleague Juliet Eilperin published an in-depth profile of the deputy secretary at the department, David Bernhardt.\n\nBernhardt dives into the policy weeds at Interior in ways Zinke does not. He has done so ever since serving at Interior during the George W. Bush administration:\n\nWhen Bernhardt got ready to move over to Interior\u2019s solicitor\u2019s office in 2005, he knew he was going to spend much of his time dealing with the Endangered Species Act. As he recounted in a speech at the Heritage Foundation this fall, 'I was a little nervous.' So he asked his aides for the entire legislative history of the act, just before leaving for a vacation at Dewey Beach, Del. with his wife and two young kids. They brought him 10 volumes bound in deep red covers over faded pages. They filled up nearly his entire trunk. When he arrived at Dewey, Bernhardt told his wife, 'I\u2019m not going to leave the house the entire time. I\u2019m going to study the entire legislative history of the Endangered Species Act.' ... As one of the main architects of Trump\u2019s energy and public lands agenda, he knows how to check the boxes and follow the rules. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to the Endangered Species Act, which he mastered during that long-ago beach vacation. Last year, Bernhardt brought together top career officials at the Fish and Wildlife Service with political appointees to discuss how to retool Endangered Species Act regulations and gave them a 30-day deadline to produce a draft. The proposed rule, if enacted, could mark the biggest change to federal endangered species policy in decades, making it easier for development to take place in imperiled species\u2019 habitats.\n\nBetween his stints in the Bush and Trump administrations, however, Bernhardt worked for so many clients as a lobbyist that he now carries around a small card listing all his potential conflicts of interests:\n\nAs a partner at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Bernhardt represented clients such as the Westlands Water District, which provides water to California farmers. Water is Westlands\u2019 lifeblood, but it has to compete with state and federal officials\u2019 push to supply it to municipalities and imperiled species as well. Bernhardt represented Westlands when it unsuccessfully sued Interior over the Endangered Species Act, and sat on the board of a conservative group connected to the water district, CESAR, that has challenged federal scientific findings on endangered species such as California\u2019s delta smelt. On Aug. 17, two weeks after Bernhardt\u2019s recusal over Westlands Water District expired, Zinke tasked him with drafting a new plan for managing federal and state water supplies there. Interior and California officials have been tight-lipped about ongoing negotiations, but Bernhardt and his colleagues have made clear they hope to overhaul existing agreements to provide more water to agricultural interests. ... \u201cBernhardt is a walking conflict of interest,\u201d said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a critic of DOI\u2019s approach to California water issues. \u201cThe recusal was a sham, and the fact that they created this plan to spring into action on behalf of all their special interests after his one-year recusal expired doesn\u2019t surprise anyone.\u201d Westlands, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment, is one of four organizations from which Bernhardt is no longer recused. These include North Dakota\u2019s Garrison Diversion Conservancy District and Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District. And as Bernhardt explained, just because he represented a specific company doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t make policy decisions affecting its industry. \u201cSo, truthfully, you can fully meet your ethical requirements appropriately and still serve the department,\u201d Bernhardt said.\n\nRead Eilperin's entire piece here:\n\nHealth & Science \u2018The man behind the curtain\u2019: Interior\u2019s No. 2 helps drive Trump\u2019s agenda Both critics and backers see David Bernhardt as key to shifting Interior to the right Juliet Eilperin\n\nTHERMOMETER\n\n\u2014 California is burning: Early on the morning of Nov. 8, minutes before a fire was first reported, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. high-voltage power line malfunctioned, wrote the Los Angeles Times in this devastating and deeply reported piece on how the deadly Camp Fire progressed in the region. \u201cBy sunset, the fire had swept 19 miles over an entire mountain, surprising, trapping, terrifying and killing \u2014 the most destructive and deadliest in California history... The fire moved so fast \u2014 faster than emergency officials grasped, faster than evacuation orders could be acted on \u2014 consuming entire neighborhoods before people could flee.\u201d\n\nDeath toll: It has risen to 76 and the list of people unaccounted for is now at 1,276, The Post\u2019s Tim Craig, Annie Gowen and Francis Stead Sellers report. \u201cThe astonishing tally raised fears that the death toll would rise exponentially,\u201d they write. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea is urging \"people to look at the list and contact the sheriff\u2019s office if they see their name on the list.\"\n\nTrump tours the state: The president surveyed the devastation over the weekend and pledged the federal government would help Californians rebuild. Even still, he criticized the state, blaming the deadly blazes on poor forest management.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s one-day visit to the state thrust him into a role of uniter and consoler that he has never occupied comfortably,\u201d The Post\u2019s Jenna Portnoy and Anne Gearan report. \u201cThe president seemed moved by the scale of the loss around him and was solicitous of Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom (D). But he said more about the firefighters and other rescuers deployed to the fire than about the victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want great climate\u201d: The president also said the fires did not change his views on climate change. \u201cI want great climate,\" he said. \"We\u2019re going to have that. And we\u2019re going to have forests that are very safe. Because we can\u2019t go through this ever year.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump says Californians should rake forests: Criticizing California\u2019s forest management, Trump suggested that the state should be following Finland's forest management example. \u201cYou look at other countries where they do it differently and it\u2019s a whole different story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was with the president of Finland and he said: \u2018We have a much different \u2014 we\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 He called it a forest nation, and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d\n\nWhat is Trump saying!? \u201cHis general sentiment is correct \u2014 that we need to manage fuels,\u201d Yana Valachovic a forest adviser with the University of California\u2019s Cooperative Extension program told The Post\u2019s Avi Selk. \u201cAnd yeah, managing that pine litter adjacent to our homes and buildings is super important. \u2026 But the reality is, to manage every little bit of fuel with a rake is not practical.\u201d\n\nFinland responds: Finnish President Sauli Niinisto disputed Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cNiinisto said their conversation focused on the California wildfires and the surveillance system Finland uses to monitor forests for fires,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201cHe remembered telling Trump \u2018We take care of our forests,\u2019 but couldn\u2019t recall raking coming up.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times adds \u201cthat burned Paradise and parts of Southern California are significantly different from the forest fires that hit Finland last year.\u201d\n\nPOWER PLAYS\n\nEPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, smiles as he is recognized by President Donald Trump during a Medal of Freedom ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\n\u2014 Andrew Wheeler gets a promotion: Trump announced he plans to nominate Wheeler, who has served as the EPA\u2019s acting administrator since July, as Pruitt's official replacement.\n\nWhat the announcement means: It\u2019s a \u201cmove that would ensure a continued deregulatory push at the agency,\u201d The Post\u2019s Brady Dennis and Eilperin report. \u201cDuring his brief tenure as the EPA\u2019s acting chief, Wheeler has proved far different from the man he replaced. Where Pruitt was a politician who appeared to enjoy the limelight and trappings of Cabinet life, Wheeler has long worked behind the scenes on energy and environmental policy and generally avoids public attention.\u201d But what Wheeler and Pruitt have in common is a \"zeal to deregulate.\"\n\nWhat the Senate is saying:\n\nThomas R. Carper (D-Del.), ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, was among the several Senate Democrats to question Wheeler's nomination. \u201cI have a friend who, when asked how he\u2019s doing, always says, \u2018Compared to what?\u2019 Compared to Administrator Pruitt, Mr. Wheeler is better. Compared to Administrators Ruckelshaus or Whitman, he\u2019s not doing nearly as well,\" Carper said in a statement.\n\n(D-Del.), ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, was among the several Senate Democrats to question Wheeler's nomination. \u201cI have a friend who, when asked how he\u2019s doing, always says, \u2018Compared to what?\u2019 Compared to Administrator Pruitt, Mr. Wheeler is better.

Pallone, poised to head the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has said he agrees with the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d proposed by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). \u201cBut he stopped short of committing to the activists' demand that he swear off campaign contributions from oil, gas and coal companies, and he disputed how they categorized some of the contributions he has received from fossil fuel interests,\u201d per the report.\n\nA gray wolf is seen at the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minn., in 2004.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), say the wolves have recovered enough to be delisted, according to the Spokesman-Review, though several environmental disagree with that notion. \u201cBy delisting the gray wolf, we can allow people in our state and community to use science-based management practices that will benefit both our endangered and native animals while protecting farmers and ranchers,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said in a statement. The bill now heads to the Senate.\n\nOIL CHECK\n\n\u2014 Crab fishers sue oil companies: A commercial fishing group on the West Coast has filed a climate lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against 30 fossil fuel companies over losses resulting from the changing climate.

It is still unclear whether the government will survive even the next few days, let alone finish its term a year from now.\n\nAlthough Bennett retracted his demand to become defense minister, opposition parties still planned to file a motion of no confidence in the government on Wednesday. It was anyone\u2019s guess whether those once loyal to Netanyahu\u2019s now-shrinking coalition would be able or even willing to fend off the move, which could lead to an early national election.\n\nIf he does make it through the next few weeks or even months, Netanyahu faces a serious challenge given his coalition\u2019s razor-thin majority in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset: 61 seats out of 120. His government will have a tough time passing controversial legislation and could face political blackmail over more hard-line issues.\n\nIt was the surprise resignation last week of Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman that precipitated the biggest coalition crisis Netanyahu has faced to date.\n\nThe hawkish Liberman cited disagreements with the prime minister over how best to tackle the never-ending cycle of violence with Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza. He said he had pushed for wider military action to stem rocket fire, violent protests, and the incendiary kites and balloons floated from Gaza that have caused havoc and destruction in southern Israeli communities for most of the past year.\n\n[Early elections look likely in Israel with Netanyahu\u2019s coalition on verge of collapse ]\n\nBut Netanyahu, as he indicated last week, opted for what he portrayed as a more balanced approach: focusing on the security situation while simultaneously seeking to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe for the 2 million residents of Gaza \u201cheld hostage\u201d by Hamas.\n\nThe flare-up of violence last week was prompted by a botched Israeli operation into Gaza. In response, militants fired more than 460 rockets and mortar shells into Israel. Israeli jets struck about 160 targets in the Palestinian enclave. Less than 48 hours after the fighting began, Netanyahu accepted a cease-fire, prompting accusations that he had capitulated to Hamas.\n\nResidents of southern Israel, a large portion of whom form Netanyahu\u2019s base, have held daily protests over the government\u2019s failure to find a viable military or diplomatic solution to the tensions with Gaza.\n\nIn his much-anticipated news conference Monday, Bennett focused on security. There had been speculation that Bennett, an ultranationalist and head of the Jewish Home party, and his deputy, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, would follow Liberman\u2019s lead and resign from the government.\n\nFor days, Bennett asked to be given the defense portfolio, insisting that he had the answers to Israel\u2019s Gaza conundrum. If not appointed defense minister, he declared, his eight-member Knesset faction would quit the government, causing it to collapse.\n\nBut by Monday, he had dropped his demand, saying he would stay on as education minister to help in the \u201cgreat mission of making Israel win again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I may pay a political price. It is not the end of the world. You win some, you lose some,\u201d he said. Explaining his backtracking, Bennett referred to calls among his supporters not to bring down the government, considered the most right-wing in Israel\u2019s history.\n\n[Israel\u2019s hawkish defense minister resigns from the government over Hamas truce ]\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s adroit orchestration of the political turmoil to his own benefit, however, also may have played a role in Bennett\u2019s reversal.\n\nOn Sunday night, after a weekend of speculation that an election was on the way, Netanyahu called an impromptu news conference. The Israeli leader not only invoked his past and present sacrifices for the country \u2014 a move that drew comparisons to Netanyahu\u2019s own hero, former British prime minister Winston Churchill \u2014 but also alluded to the security threats Israel faces.\n\nAnnouncing that he would keep the defense portfolio for himself, Netanyahu dared Bennett and other coalition partners to bring down his government in the face of the ongoing security concerns and noted that previous right-wing Israeli governments were often succeeded by more left-leaning ones.\n\nOn Monday morning, a statement from his office said Netanyahu had taken over the Defense Ministry, meeting with the army\u2019s current chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot, and the incoming head, Aviv Kochavi.\n\n\u201cAs I said last night, we are in a battle that has not yet ended. In such a sensitive period of security, it is irresponsible to topple the government,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nYehuda Ben Meir, a senior associate at the Institute for National Security Studies, said it was \u201cclear Netanyahu wants to push off elections as much as he can.\u201d\n\nWith important dates coming up, such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March, Israel\u2019s national days in early May and even the forthcoming Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, there will be many opportunities for Netanyahu to regain some of his lost support.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu took a huge risk and a hit to his popularity agreeing to the cease-fire,\u201d said Emmanuel Navon, senior fellow at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum and a member of the Likud Central Committee.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu has always presented himself as Mr. Security. It would be suicidal to go to the polls now after an extremely unpopular decision and a humiliating cease-fire with Hamas,\u201d Navon said. \u201cHe just wants to push off elections as much as he can.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPalestinians say Gaza cease-fire concluded after worst fighting since 2014\n\nTensions escalate as Israeli jets pound targets in Gaza in response to rocket fire\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Tory Newmyer", "title": "The Finance 202: U.S.-China trade conflict is worsening", "description": "For now.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2018/11/19/the-finance-202-u-s-china-trade-conflict-is-worsening/5bf2226f1b326b39290548d3/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/84f45e9ab3da794c0bc2f3a3fd465e5e-3500-2403-70-8-20181117T110833Z_804019948_RC1FD270D140_RTRMADP_3_APECSUMMIT5583.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T13:24:20Z", "content": "THE TICKER U.S. Vice President Mike Pence looks at Chinese President Xi Jinping as they prepare for a family photo with APEC leaders at at a gala dinner during the APEC Summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.

China\u2019s former chief trade negotiator issued a rare public criticism of his own government\u2019s tactics, calling the regime\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on U.S. soybeans badly conceived. \"If we have people who always talk about politics engaging in [trade] negotiations, we will never have a deal,\u201d Long Yongtu said, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. \u201cWe don\u2019t think deeply enough.\u201d\n\nThat rebuke speaks to deep reservations rumbling behind the scenes in Beijing about Xi\u2019s management of the conflict. \u201cThe Chinese still don\u2019t know how to handle Trump, and they don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Trey McArver, founding partner of Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any new ideas. I think they\u2019re just spinning their wheels.\u201d\n\nIMF managing director Christine Lagarde, left, and Xi arrive for an International Monetary Fund informal dialogue session at the APEC summit. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nPence, in his swing through Asia last week, kept up his recent tough talk on China. He warned in a Thursday speech in Singapore that \u201cempire and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d In Papua New Guinea, he invoked China\u2019s \"Belt and Road Initiative\" to offer the country\u2019s neighbors a \u201ca better option.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt. We don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road.\u201d\n\nXi, in his speech at the summit, tried to position China as a defender of the international order, warning that \u201cconfrontation, whether in the form of a hot war, cold war or trade war, will produce no winners.\u201d But a senior Trump official cited by the Wall Street Journal blamed a Chinese objection for sinking a communique the other 20 nations endorsed. The official said the Chinese opposed the inclusion of a sentence \u2014 \u201cWe agreed to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices\u201d \u2014 they believed singled them out.\n\n\u201cCould anything be more emblematic of a deteriorating world order?\" McArver says. \u201cFor 29 years we\u2019ve been able to agree on something. This is the first year they haven\u2019t. If 30 years from now, we look back at a mega-trend of deglobalization, this summit may be one of the important events along the way.\u201d\n\nProgramming note: We\u2019re publishing an abbreviated version of the newsletter through Wednesday this week and then will be dark on Thursday and Friday in observance of Thanksgiving.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\n\u2014 May scrambles to save Brexit deal. FT's Jim Pickard and Sarah Gordon: \"Prime Minister Theresa May insisted on Monday her Brexit deal would give Britain \u201ccontrol over our borders\u201d by bringing an end to free movement once and for all. After Brexit the UK would be \u201cfully in control\u201d of who comes in, with EU nationals no longer able to \u201cjump the queue\u201d ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi, she told the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s annual conference in east London\u2026 The British prime minister is struggling to win support from her own MPs for her withdrawal agreement with Brussels, with critics insisting they almost have enough signatures for a vote of no confidence in her leadership.\u201d\n\nGlobal markets are mostly quiet. WSJ's Riva Gold: \"Stocks in Europe and Asia were mostly higher Monday in a week expected to be dominated by Brexit developments and fresh readings on the U.S. and European economies. The Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.3% in morning from its lowest close this month, while futures pointed to a flat opening on Wall Street. Asian markets mostly rallied despite lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and China at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\"\n\n\u2014 Gloomy investors shrug off strong earnings. WSJ's Akane Otani: \"Many on Wall Street are weathering the autumn technology rout by buying the shares of firms with slower, steadier earnings growth, the latest sign that investors largely remain sanguine about U.S. stocks despite recent reversals. Trading has turned rocky since the S&P 500 finished the third quarter with its biggest gain since 2013. The broad index is down 6.1% since the end of September...\n\n\"Nine years into the U.S. stock rally, investors are grappling with two forces. Many feel the best days of this economic cycle are past, especially with windfalls from 2017\u2019s tax overhaul set to fade. Though few economists foresee a recession soon, analysts and portfolio managers say the fall pullback offers a reminder of the ever-present risk that markets will fall sharply as rising interest rates and slowing growth hit corporate profits. But a hefty contingent contends there are still significant gains to be had, thanks to the robustness of companies\u2019 bottom lines.\"\n\n\u2014 Slowing global growth could compel Fed to pause. NYT's Peter Eavis: \"One of the biggest threats to stock prices is suddenly looking less scary. Investors\u2019 concerns about rising interest rates have helped fuel the recent selling that has left the S&P 500 stock index nearly 6.6 percent off its high. But there have been signs in recent days that interest rates may not rise as quickly as investors previously expected. Officials at the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, made remarks last week that suggested they were becoming more mindful of a slowing global economy. While that may mean stock investors will soon be able to worry less about rising rates, the slowdown in growth could still weigh on stock prices.\"\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\n\u2014 Tracking China's unlikely rise as a global economic superpower. The New York Times's Philip P. Pan goes deep to explain the origins of the Chinese juggernaut: \"The Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation. China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAn epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.\"\n\nMELTDOWN WATCH:\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nNissan Motor Co.'s chairman Carlos Ghosn. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)\n\n\u2014 Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn arrested. WSJ's Sean McLain: \"Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested Monday in Tokyo, Japanese media reported, and Nissan said it intended to oust Mr. Ghosn from his post after uncovering \u201csignificant acts\u201d of financial misconduct. Japanese prosecutors couldn\u2019t immediately be reached to confirm the arrest, which was reported by public broadcaster NHK and other media.\n\n\"The sudden allegations are a blow to the legacy of Mr. Ghosn, 64 years old, who was credited for rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy starting in 1999. They also call into question the future of the alliance between Nissan and partners Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Mr. Ghosn is also chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi.Nissan said Mr. Ghosn worked with another executive at Nissan to underreport his compensation in securities filings\u2014the same allegation that Tokyo prosecutors cited in arresting Mr. Ghosn, according to Japanese media.\"\n\n\u2014 Facebook at war. WSJ's Deepa Seetharaman: \"Mark Zuckerberg gathered about 50 of his top lieutenants earlier this year and told them that Facebook Inc. was at war and he planned to lead the company accordingly. During times of peace, executives can move more slowly and ensure that everybody is on board with key decisions, he said during the June meeting, according to people familiar with the remarks. But with Facebook under siege from lawmakers, investors and angry users, he needed to act more decisively, the people said.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s new approach is causing unprecedented turmoil atop Facebook, driving several key executives from the company, according to people familiar with the matter. At times, it has created tensions with his longtime chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg\u2026 The 34-year-old CEO believes Facebook didn\u2019t move quickly enough at key moments this year and increasingly is pressing senior executives to \u201cmake progress faster\u201d on resolving problems such as slowing user growth and securing the platform, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nFacebook's former chief security officer Alex Stamos, writing in The Post: \"No one at the company ever told me not to examine Russian activity, nor did anyone attempt to lie about our findings, but Facebook should have responded to these threats much earlier and handled disclosure in a more transparent manner.\"\n\n\u2014 What's next for HQ2 losers? NYT's Neil Irwin: \"Some promising answers are bubbling up, although there may not be a single plan that all the people who study these issues can agree upon. A new paper by Clara Hendrickson, Mark Muro and Bill Galston at the Brookings Institution aims to summarize the facts about these regional divides, as well as how policy contributes to them and how it could help reduce them. They argue for heavy investment in digital skills, even in areas without a large existing high-tech sector. They seek new channels to ensure that businesses in struggling areas have access to capital, including small-business lending from banks and venture capital for start-ups.\"\n\nRelated: Trump country is falling further behind. Anthony W. Orlando, writing for The Post: \"How have Trump voters fared economically, compared with Hillary Clinton voters? Not noticeably better, according to the data. By most measures, my latest research shows, Trump counties \u2014 and especially counties with higher proportions of Trump voters \u2014 continue to fall farther behind the rest of the country economically. The story of our economy, like the story of our politics, continues to be a story of division and divergence.\"\n\n\u2014 Deutsche Bank no longer indispensable. Bloomberg's Steven Arons and Chris Reiter: \"As Deutsche Bank AG approaches its 150th anniversary, Germany\u2019s biggest lender is facing an inconvenient truth: it is no longer irreplaceable for the country\u2019s economic elite. From corporate giants to specialist engineering firms, Germany Inc.\u2019s once-solid allegiance to Deutsche Bank is waning after years of crises stemming from efforts to emulate Wall Street investment banks, according to discussions with numerous executives.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nAs public anger increases over skyrocketing prescription drug prices, one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) announced a plan it says will help lower patients' out-of-pocket costs. It also aims to move away from the practice of rebates criticized for helping to push up the price of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized the practice of rebates -- reimbursements paid by drugmakers to PBMs and insurers -- with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar suggesting ending the rebate system entirely.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has said the \u201csystem of rebates between payers and manufacturers\u201d drives up drug costs. And when he announced his drug pricing blueprint in May, President Trump decried the \u201cdishonest double-dealing that allows the middleman to pocket rebates and discounts that should be passed on to consumers and patients.\"\n\nExpress Scripts announced last week a new \"formulary,\" or list of covered drugs, that will favor lower-cost generic versions of the drugs rather than expensive, branded versions. Now its clients, including both health insurers and employer plans, can choose between lists that include drugs with a high list price -- and high rebate to PBMs like Express Scripts -- or the new list with lower-price drugs but with little or no rebate. Experts say the plan sheds some light on a complicated system of negotiations and has the potential to benefit some patients, though it\u2019s less clear how wide the impact will be and whether it will be successful.\n\nUnder the current model, drug manufacturers set a list price for their medications and negotiate a rebate off that price with PBMs in exchange for having their medicines placed on a list of covered and preferred medicines. Experts say it\u2019s not always clear who gets the rebate, but part of it goes to employers or insurance companies while PBMs also keep a percentage. This model leads to higher costs for patients as drugmakers increase list prices to offset the cost of rebates.\n\nSteve Miller, the Express Scripts chief medical officer, said the system \u201cused to work very well.\u201d But as prices got higher, it became \u201cone of the hottest controversies in pharmacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to imagine a world where what if we got rid of those exaggerated prices, and just got the drug companies to come out with a low price?\u201d he told me in an interview. \u201cIf a pharmaceutical company will come out with sometimes the exact same drug but at a low price, we\u2019ll advantage them on this new formulary. So especially for those with high-deductible health plans, those who are uninsured, those who have coinsurance, they will have a great option in the marketplace that really lowers their out-of-pocket.\u201d\n\nExperts say the plan could benefit patients who currently pay coinsurance based on a percentage of a drug's list price. If the covered drugs have lower list prices to begin with, that could mean lower costs at the pharmacy counter for patients.\n\nRichard G. Frank, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School, said the move is significant because it develops an alternative to the rebate system. Express Scripts says it will still allow for rebates through other lists for payers that prefer the current system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been locked in this debate where every party points to the other party as the reason behind drug prices being high for consumers,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAnd certainly one of the issues that\u2019s come up is the difference between list prices and transaction prices... And then you\u2019ve got as a result of that people proposing to end the rebate system or change the rebate system.\u201d\n\nLindsay Bealor Greenleaf, director at health-care consulting firm ADVI, said it\u2019s clear Express Scripts is responding to pressure from policymakers.\n\n\u201cThis announcement aligns with the direction things are headed in Washington -- of policymakers rethinking the role played by rebates,\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cThis is a proactive step to get prepared for a new environment that will change up their business.\u201d\n\nMiller acknowledged the company\u2019s plan is an answer to the Trump administration\u2019s calls for a change.\n\n\u201cWhen [Trump] did his Rose Garden address in the spring, the problems that have been created by high rebates were identified by the president,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis was an idea we responded with.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a silver bullet, it\u2019s not going to fix high drug prices in the United States, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\" he added.\n\nGreenleaf said other PBMs could follow suit. \u201cAnytime Express Scripts or Optum or CVS change the way they do business, the rest of the industry certainly takes note,\u201d she said.\n\nJC Scott, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the lobbying group for PBMs, commended the move. \u201cThis innovative formulary design again demonstrates how PBMs respond to client needs in the marketplace and deliver quality and affordable benefits,\u201d Scott said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Holly Campbell, a spokeswoman for PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry's biggest lobbying group, said the announcement is \"important,\" but she still pointed fingers at other middlemen in the drug-pricing process.\n\n\u201cExpress Script\u2019s announcement is an important step toward addressing market distortions that result from middlemen profiting from the billions in rebates, fees and other discounts that they negotiate with biopharmaceutical companies, rather than sharing those savings directly with patients,\u201d she said.\n\nGreenleaf said it remains to be seen whether health-plan sponsors take advantage of the new lists.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of payers that enjoy receiving the rebates, and payers will often tell you they are using these rebates to keep their premiums low for enrollees. The truth is no one ever really knows the full extent of what the rebates are being used for because there\u2019s a black box,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to the extent that some payers do enjoy rebates to keep for themselves or to keep premiums down, those types of payers might decide this isn\u2019t something they want to take part in right now.\u201d\n\nAnd Kay Morgan, vice president of drug information at information analytics firm Elsevier, said Express Scripts is inserting some transparency into the drug-pricing process by explicitly saying it will favor lower-cost generics. She also said it appears to be a response to calls, including from the administration, to move toward generics and biosimilars as one way to tackle rising costs.\n\n\"It will remain to be seen if this would actually cause a pharmaceutical company to lower their prices,\" Morgan said.\n\nHarvard professor Frank said it\u2019s a \"worthwhile step\" from a top PBM while tensions are running high on drug prices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my optimistic hat on for a second and say hopefully it can be both; it can take the heat off of them because they\u2019re giving consumers a better deal,\" he said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get deep enough into it so we\u2019ll know whether in fact it\u2019s socially beneficial in addition to being privately beneficial.\u201d\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nIn this Nov. 23, 2015, file photo, the Pfizer logo is displayed at world headquarters in New York.

As of Sunday, Branswell reports there are 366 confirmed and probable cases of Ebola infections in the outbreak, and 214 deaths.\n\n\u201cAfter Friday night\u2019s violence subsided, several members of the Ebola response team \u2018were exhibiting some distress,\u2019 [WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom] said, and a decision was made to pull them back to Goma, a city south of Beni, so that they could get a few days of rest and counseling,\u201d Branswell writes. \u201cOthers insisted on staying in Beni, he said, calling them \u2018very courageous people.\u2019 \"\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s violence was the latest in a string of attacks in the region,\u201d she adds.

(AP Photo/Julie Carr Smyth)\n\n\u2014 The Ohio House of Representatives passed a bill that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, or at about six weeks. It's one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country.\n\n\"A fetal heartbeat can be detected by an ultrasound as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, a time during which most women are unaware they are pregnant,\" the New York Times's Christina Caron writes. Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed a similar bill in 2016.\n\n\u201cUnder the bill, approved Thursday by a vote of 60 to 35, performing an abortion on a fetus with a heartbeat would result in a fifth-degree felony, which is punishable in Ohio by up to one year in prison and a $2,500 fine,\u201d Caron writes. \u201c The bill now heads to the Ohio Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measure includes no exceptions for rape or incest. Doctors may, however, make an exception during a medical emergency or if an abortion would save a woman\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor told the Times this piece of legislation is specifically meant to challenge Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cWe believe Ohio is best positioned to send this through the Circuit Courts and to the federal Supreme Court,\u201d state Rep.

Expansion legislation will now need only a simple majority to pass because Kelly would almost certainly sign the bill into law,\u201d Shorman reports. \u201cPreviously, lawmakers would have needed a supermajority in both the House and Senate because they would need to override the governor\u2019s veto.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\nEarly Lead \u2018Big Game\u2019 between Cal and Stanford postponed due to poor air quality The 121st meeting of the two teams now will take place Dec. 1 in Berkeley, Calif.

At a heated session of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u2019 annual conference, on Monday Nov. 19, 2018, western powers clashed with Russia over a decision to set up a new investigative team which could name the perpetrators of chemical attacks. (Peter Dejong, FILE/Associated Press)\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 The U.S. and Western powers on Monday clashed with Russia and others over whether the global chemical weapons watchdog could start apportioning blame for poison gas and nerve agent attacks.\n\nAt a heated session of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u2019 annual conference, both sides bitterly fought over a June decision for the group to set up a new investigative team which could name the perpetrators of chemical attacks \u2014 a major change in the group\u2019s rules.\n\nRussia and China said the widely-backed June decision to allow the organization to identify those responsible should be reviewed to ensure it didn\u2019t go beyond the OPCW mandate.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the watchdog, Kenneth Ward, complained that \u201ca tsunami of chemical weapons\u201d had been used this year, especially in Syria, an ally of Russia, and called Moscow\u2019s attempts to undo the decision \u201cpungent hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nBritain and its allies also have accused Moscow of using a Soviet-era nerve agent in an attempted assassination of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury earlier this year. Russia denies the allegation.\n\nBritain\u2019s ambassador, Peter Wilson, said a Russia-Chinese proposal to review the decision \u201cis clearly designed to obstruct and delay implementation\u201d of the decision.\n\nRussian envoy Alexander Shulgin said the new team would wield unlawful powers within the OPCW and on Monday called for an expert group to assess the viability of the decision, something the U.S. insisted would hamstring the development of the team. Wilson said that the Russian move would \u201cundermine\u201d plans to set up the team.\n\nLast June, an 82-24 vote among OPCW members provided more than the necessary two-thirds majority to give the group the mandate to name the parties it found responsible for chemical attacks.\n\nWith Russia\u2019s opposition on Monday, Ward said that Russia and China made \u201can attempt to re-litigate what happened in June.\u201d He said that both nations \u201care trying to turn back the clock of history.\u201d\n\nOne allegation still being investigated by weapons inspectors is the suspected chemical attack in April in the Syrian town of Douma. An interim report said that weapons inspectors found \u201cvarious chlorinated organic chemicals\u201d at the site of the alleged Douma attack.\n\nThe OPCW made headlines last month when Dutch authorities revealed that they had foiled an alleged plot by Russian spies to hack into the organization\u2019s Wi-Fi network using equipment stashed in the trunk of a rental car parked at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.

(Saudi Press Agency/Associated Press)\n\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman on Monday gave his first major speech since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, expressing support for his son, the crown prince, and making no mention of allegations that the young royal ordered the killing.\n\nThe annual policy speech by the king instead highlighted Saudi Arabia\u2019s priorities for the coming year, focusing on issues such as the war in Yemen, security for Palestinians, stability in the oil market, countering rival Iran and job creation for Saudis.\n\nThe king voiced support for his favored son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that the 32-year-old heir to the throne is focused on developing the capabilities of Saudi youth. The prince oversees all major levers of power in the kingdom, ranging from security to the economy.\n\n\u201cThe country is working tirelessly to create more jobs and training for Saudi youth,\u201d Salman said. \u201cThe crown prince, chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs and Development, has focused on developing human capabilities and preparing the new generation for future jobs.\u201d\n\nSaudi media reported Monday that the crown prince will attend the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month. It would be the first trip abroad for the crown prince after the Oct. 2 slaying of Khashoggi, and would bring him face to face with world leaders from the U.S., Turkey, Canada and European countries that have strongly criticized the kingdom for the brutal killing.\n\nKing Salman delivered his remarks in the ornate hall of the consultative Shura Council before the country\u2019s ministers, senior officials, military officers and clerics. Prince Mohammed was in attendance and seated next to the country\u2019s top cleric.\n\nIn the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the 82-year-old monarch put Prince Mohammed in charge of overseeing the reorganization of intelligence services. The king\u2019s speech made no reference to that, but he did commend Saudi Arabia\u2019s judiciary and public prosecution for their work in seeking justice in accordance with Islamic law.\n\nHe said the kingdom \u201ctakes pride in the blessed efforts\u201d of the judiciary and public prosecution, adding that Saudi Arabia affirms its commitment to the application of Islamic law.\n\nOn Thursday, Saudi prosecutors said they are seeking the death penalty against five men suspected of killing Khashoggi, who had written critically of the crown prince in columns for The Washington Post. The prosecutor\u2019s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s death and distance the killers and their operation from the crown prince.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials, however, have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. Others familiar with the case caution that while it\u2019s likely that the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played.\n\nSaudi investigators say a high-ranking adviser to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani, and a senior intelligence official, Ahmed al-Assiri, concocted a plan to force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia, deeming his presence abroad as a threat to national security.\n\nSaudi prosecutors say the 15-man team sent to Istanbul exceeded their authority when the lead negotiator in the team decided to kill Khashoggi for refusing orders to return. The Saudis say the agents killed Khashoggi with tranquilizers and then dismembered his body, which has not been found.\n\nThose findings came after Saudi authorities spent weeks denying Khashoggi had been killed in the embassy.\n\nThis past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on their conclusions, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those sanctioned was al-Qahtani, who was fired from his post as the crown prince\u2019s adviser after details of the killing emerged.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said his administration will get \u201ca very full report,\u201d including who was responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, on Monday or Tuesday. Trump has criticized the Saudi response to the killing, but has been reluctant to say definitively if he thinks the crown prince ordered it.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, fine. National security adviser John Bolton, not concerned.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, are you fine with that? Speaker Paul D. Ryan? Will Congress go along with this coverup?\n\nBecause that also will be a choice. Congress does have alternatives.\n\nFor starters, it could summon CIA Director Gina Haspel, who listened to the tape of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, who knows the truth, who almost certainly knows who ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, and ask her: Why bring a bonesaw to a kidnapping?\n\nRecall the sequence of lies that the Saudi regime has presented about this case:\n\nKhashoggi, a Post contributing columnist who would have turned 60 on Oct. 13, entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, at his government\u2019s invitation, shortly after noon on Oct. 2 to take care of some minor paperwork. He told his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, that he would be out shortly, and asked her to wait. She waited \u2014 until after midnight. She never saw him again.\n\nThe regime of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told The Post, told Congress, told the world: Khashoggi left the consulate not long after he entered.\n\nWe, too, are concerned.\n\nKhashoggi was our friend.\n\nWhy would we harm him?\n\nThis was the story told by the crown prince and the crown prince\u2019s younger brother, who happened to be the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Khalid bin Salman.\n\nWhere is the videotape of him leaving, they were asked. Our cameras were broken, they said. Where is the paperwork he came to fill out? They did not bother to reply.\n\nNo doubt they would have stuck by that story, malfunctioning cameras and all, but evidence got in the way. The Turkish government had photographs of a 15-man hit squad arriving from Saudi Arabia and entering the consulate shortly before Khashoggi. The Turks had audiotape of Khashoggi\u2019s brutal killing, almost as soon as he entered the consulate. They knew that the hit squad included a forensic specialist who arrived with his bonesaw, who put on earphones and listened to music as he dismembered the body.\n\nThe Saudis retreated to a new story: No, our friend Jamal had not walked out of the consulate. Yes, they admitted, he had died inside. But he had perished in a brawl, when he tried to grapple with the security team (not a hit squad!) that had been sent to meet him.\n\nThat story, too, was too preposterous to sustain \u2014 or so we thought \u2014 and the Saudi prosecutor abandoned it, coincidentally just as Turkey was playing the audiotape for Haspel. Never mind, they said, there was no brawl; Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated murder, after all.\n\nWho had premeditated it? They would find out and tell the world, the crown prince himself assured Pompeo, and Pompeo assured us.\n\nBut on Thursday, the brawl myth was back. The Saudis announced that Khashoggi\u2019s death was unintentional, that a friendly invitation to return to Saudi Arabia had gone awry.\n\nWhy would you need a 15-man team to tender such an invitation?\n\nAnd even if what you had in mind was \u201conly\u201d a forcible rendition \u2014 what you or I would call a kidnapping \u2014 why would you need a bonesaw?\n\nOh, and where is Khashoggi\u2019s body? Turned over to a mysterious \u201cTurkish collaborator,\u201d whom the Saudis are unable or unwilling to identify, even to Turkish police.\n\nProbably no one in the United States government harbors the slightest doubt that the architect of this crime was the crown prince, as the CIA has concluded. His closest henchmen orchestrated the deed, and they would not dare act without his knowledge.\n\nHe bets that it won\u2019t matter. He bets that he can feed an already discredited fairy tale to Trump and Pompeo and Bolton, and they will obediently swallow it. So far his bet seems safe.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us have to go along.\n\nWhy bring a bonesaw to a kidnapping, Your Highness?\n\nRead more from Fred Hiatt\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/RickNoackTWP/", "title": "Why Finland is so good at handling forest fires.

Sweden is one of the continent\u2019s greenest countries, and officials there eventually got so desperate that they ordered an air force jet to drop a bomb in the middle of the wildfire\u2019s center to deprive the blaze of oxygen.\n\nThe strategy failed, and Sweden\u2019s fires continued to rage for weeks. But just a few hundred miles away, in neighboring Finland, officials worried about a far different problem: not enough wildfires. \u201cFrom nature\u2019s point of view, the diversity of species and habitats suffers from too few fires,\u201d the Finnish Forest Association recently concluded in a report.\n\nIn Sweden, officials were stymied by their neighbor\u2019s luck: Weather maps showed that both countries were adversely affected by the same rare, extreme heat this summer.\n\n\n\nLand surface temperature anomaly in early July 2018, compared to 2000-2015 mean. (NASA)\n\nViewed from space, the differences appeared especially striking. As all of Finland\u2019s neighboring countries, including Russia, battled massive blazes, the skies over Finland were smoke-free.\n\n\n\nRussian forest fires are seen from a satellite on July 20. (NASA)\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t really luck, Finnish researchers soon let everyone know. Instead, Finland has one of the world\u2019s most successful strategies to counter wildfires, and it is now being more closely examined in other nations recently struck by large-scale fires.\n\nOver the weekend, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto was forced to clarify that this strategy does not consist of raking, however. He was contradicting his U.S. counterpart, President Trump, who said Saturday as he was touring California\u2019s wildfire areas that Finnish authorities \u201cspent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forests, it\u2019s very important,\u201d Trump said.\n\n[A look at Trump\u2019s \u2018A-plus\u2019 weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure,\u2019 Calif., and Adam \u2018Schitt\u2019]\n\nThe Finnish president confirmed that he discussed wildfire prevention with Trump, but rejected the suggestion that raking ever came up. The forest service in Finland does carry out controlled burns of the forest floor mostly to clear away underbrush and also promote new saplings.\n\nResearchers aren\u2019t sure whether the country\u2019s approach can really hold any lessons for California, however, given that parts of Finland are located close to the Arctic Circle and have prolonged periods of rain and snow. Whereas below-average precipitation is still the exception in Finland, it has become the new normal in California.\n\nAllowing some burns and clearing away undergrowth are also part of federal forest policy in California. In fact, some of the areas hit in the California fires burned 10 years earlier, so there hadn\u2019t been a major build up of undergrowth.\n\nNo, the key factor in California\u2019s vulnerability to fires (and Finland\u2019s resistance) appears to have to do with weather. The two countries are on very different trajectories, as Finnish scientists predict the annual number of days with a wildfire risk to increase by perhaps as little as 10 percent by 2100. According to some estimates, wildfires may burn almost 80 percent more area in California by 2050 than at the moment.\n\nFinland does, however, offer an instructive example to its Nordic neighbors. It has managed to bring down the area annually destroyed by wildfires from sometimes more than 100,000 hectares a century ago to now less than 1 percent of that. That compares to 25,000 hectares lost in Sweden this summer.\n\n\u201cThe difference between the two Nordic countries is not explained by vegetation or climate,\u201d Finland\u2019s Forest Association said, \u201cbut is believed to be based on differences in infrastructure and forest management.\u201d\n\nResearchers say that Finland has a far denser road network than other nations in the region, which creates barriers to the expansion of the blazes. Lakes and rivers are abundant, too. With many of the California fires happening near population centers now, a lack of roads is probably not the issue.\n\nPerhaps the most striking difference with California is of a historical nature: Northern Europe is greener today than it was 100 years ago, whereas California has lost about half of its big trees. Europe\u2019s medieval and industrial revolution-era need for wood turned former forest areas into grasslands, especially in southern Finland.\n\nWhen reforestation became a more serious concern, Finland split up future forests into small compartments. One side effect of this was fewer wildfires, as blazes usually don\u2019t spread beyond a single compartment, with borders that are usually marked by wide paths or by trees with different heights.\n\nAlthough that approach may work in other European countries with similar histories, California is facing a climate-change challenge that it can\u2019t confront itself.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nTrump just can\u2019t quit MBS\n\nTrump suggests Californians can rake their forests to prevent wildfires.

(Adnan Abidi/Reuters)\n\nToday we celebrate World Toilet Day to promote awareness about the global sanitation crisis. Toilets have been around for more than 5,000 years, but many people around the world still do not have one.\n\nNo. 6 on the list of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is to achieve universal access to adequate sanitation and end the practice of open defecation by 2030, recognizing the dangers of waterborne disease. But 61 percent of the global population still lacked safely managed sanitation services in 2015. Why has progress toward this goal been so hard to achieve?\n\nRural Africa and South Asia are where the sanitation problems are concentrated \u2014 and India has one of the worst sanitation records. More than half of the rural population still practices open defecation. Here are three things my research on India\u2019s sanitation progress suggests:\n\n1. The answer is not just constructing more toilets.\n\nIn 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began the Clean India Mission (Swachh Bharat Mission) to install 111 million household toilets by the end of 2019 at an estimated cost of about $20 billion.\n\n[Aug. 15 was India\u2019s 70th birthday. How it answers these 3 questions will define its future \u2014 and the world\u2019s.]\n\nAlthough this mission includes communicating hygiene awareness, the focus has overwhelmingly been on installing toilets \u2014 and families can get subsidies to install private toilets. Although microfinancing helps, my study shows that information is a greater motivator in encouraging households to install latrines in rural areas.\n\nUsing the India Human Development Survey, a nationally representative panel survey conducted in 2004 and 2011, I find that households with women who regularly consume mass media through newspapers, radio or television are more likely to install a private toilet in their home. Several types of publicly reported information, such as government-sponsored public health campaigns, reports on the health risks of open defecation, or learning about sanitation facilities, may help explain this finding. Therefore, beyond the infrastructure drive to supply toilets, promoting toilet access and use through mass media is an effective strategy \u2014 particularly for women in hard-to-reach rural areas.\n\n2. Having more women in leadership roles helps improve sanitation.\n\nSDG 6 also specifically targets women and girls. Women are more heavily affected by the negative consequences of poor sanitation because they are at higher risk of violence and stress when practicing open defecation after sunset. They are also usually the primary caregivers to children, who are most susceptible to sanitation-related diseases. In a recent article in Comparative Politics, I explore the possibility that having more women in leadership roles helps address the burdens of poor sanitation that disproportionately affect women.\n\n[Why is India \u2018missing\u2019 63 million women \u2014 even though development is roaring?]\n\nUsing Indian census data about the availability and types of latrine facilities, I find that areas represented by female politicians are more likely to have \u201csafely managed toilets,\u201d which remove waste in a sanitary manner by avoiding human contact. These latrines also provide other benefits, such as greater privacy and reduced exposure to physical and sexual violence. This research is a reminder that not all latrines are equal \u2014 maximizing the intended health benefits of latrines means considering safe disposal methods of waste.\n\n3. Promoting latrine use is key.\n\nAlthough increasing the number of toilets and improving their quality is important, the larger challenge is how to ensure that they actually will be used. Surprisingly, many people with access to latrines do not use them. In our survey of 810 households in Delhi\u2019s slums, where private toilet ownership is rare, we found that many people do not regularly use nearby public toilets, known as community toilet complexes, built specifically for slum dwellers. Although almost all of our survey respondents acknowledged that open defecation presents health risks and is embarrassing, people find places to defecate in public or wait until they go to work to use a toilet instead.\n\n[Delhi is blanketed with toxic smog. This is why.]\n\nOur survey reveals that interactions among community members may be an important motivator to get people to use public toilets because these networks help spread norms that discourage the practice of open defecation. In particular, we find that frequent interactions with community leaders can help promote daily use of public latrines. A possible explanation is that local community leaders, who often help solve everyday problems, motivate collective behaviors of public latrine use by communicating their work on fixing sanitation problems, perhaps to claim credit for their work. Our survey results suggest that using these channels to promote latrine use may be key.\n\nPoor sanitation causes waterborne diseases, such as diarrhea, which is one of the leading causes of child mortality worldwide. If the goal is to improve global public health through sanitation, these research findings suggest looking not just at achieving universal toilet access but also paying more attention and resources to efforts to encourage their use.\n\nYuJung Julia Lee is an assistant professor at the Department of Political Science at Colorado State University.

Watt combined to sack Alex Smith. Players in the vicinity immediately motioned for trainers to attend to the Redskins quarterback, who remained on the ground in obvious pain. Smith broke his right tibia and fibula and will miss the rest of the season. The gruesome injury happened 33 years to the day since Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann broke his right leg on a hit by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Theismann, who was at FedEx Field for Redskins alumni homecoming weekend, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cNovember 18th is such a horrible day for Redskins quarterbacks.\u201d\n\n\n\nWashington Post\n\nHail: Colt McCoy\n\nMcCoy knows Coach Jay Gruden\u2019s offense about as well as anyone, so it was no surprise to see the Redskins\u2019 longtime backup quarterback look comfortable in relief of Smith. He capped his first drive with a touchdown pass to Jordan Reed and led another touchdown drive in the fourth quarter that gave Washington a brief lead. McCoy\u2019s final numbers (6 for 12 for 54 yards) weren\u2019t impressive, but he nearly put the Redskins in position for a game-winning field goal in the final seconds.\n\nThanksgiving at Dallas will mark McCoy\u2019s first start since Week 15 of the 2014 season. AT&T Stadium is the site of one of the greatest moments of the former University of Texas star\u2019s career, a 20-17 overtime triumph against Dallas when the Redskins were 9.5-point underdogs in 2014. The Cowboys, who are coming off a 22-19 win over Atlanta, opened as eight-point favorites on Sunday.\n\nFail: Jay Gruden\u2019s Clock Management\n\nGruden has never been mistaken for a genius when it comes to using his timeouts. On Sunday, his clock mismanagement may have cost the Redskins the game. With 2:22 remaining and the Texans leading 23-21, Lamar Miller ran for four yards on second and nine from the Washington 41-yard line. Rather than using his second timeout, Gruden allowed the clock to run down to the two-minute warning.\n\nOut of the break, Houston was gifted a first down on a questionable defensive holding penalty on Norman. The Redskins used their final two timeouts after the Texans\u2019 next two plays, and Houston allowed the clock to run down to 56 seconds before Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn missed a long field goal. Had Gruden used his timeouts before the two-minute warning, the Redskins would\u2019ve had roughly 20 more seconds to work with on their final drive. That might\u2019ve been enough time to pick up an additional few yards for Dustin Hopkins, whose 63-yard field goal attempt bounced in the end zone on Washington\u2019s final play of the game.\n\nfor those struggling w/this inc Gruden, a 2nd TO w/2:16 left before 3rd & 5 would've resulted in 3 snaps before 2:00 warning. The 3rd & 5 def hold, 1st/10 no gain, 2nd/10 3 yd gain.

The former SMU standout made his presence felt early on. After the first catch of his career, a sliding grab over the middle in the first quarter, Quinn popped up and gave an emphatic first-down signal. Quinn moved the chains again later in the half with a catch on an underneath crossing route. In a game that featured several drops by Redskins receivers, including a potential touchdown by Vernon Davis, Mr. Irrelevant was Mr. Reliable. Quinn finished with four catches on four targets for 49 yards.\n\nNice ball over the middle by Alex Smith as Trey Quinn makes his first catch #Redskins pic.twitter.com/Gqdn6dq2Mw \u2014 Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) November 18, 2018\n\nFail: That Penalty on Josh Norman\n\nNorman was visibly upset with the defensive holding penalty that negated Washington\u2019s third-down stop out of the two-minute warning, and for good reason. Jonathan Allen and Matt Ioannidis combined to bring down Watson short of the sticks on the play, but the official closest to Norman decided that he grabbed DeAndre Hopkins while Watson was still behind the line of scrimmage.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Norman said. \u201cYou play defense and those plays, gosh, man, you just have to shake your head. A guy like that, you try and shut them out in the second half. . . . One-on-one with a phenomenal athlete like he is, all-pro, me an all-pro, and we were going after each other.

The EU nations and Britain are still negotiating the outline text of a draft Brexit deal, setting out their future relationship which will have to be ratified by both the British and the European Parliaments. (Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 The U.K. and the European Union plowed ahead Monday with plans to have their divorce deal signed, sealed and delivered within days as British Prime Minister Theresa May waited to see whether rebel lawmakers opposed to the agreement had the numbers to challenge her leadership.\n\nThe draft agreement reached last week triggered an avalanche of criticism in Britain and left May fighting to keep her job even as British and EU negotiators raced to firm up a final deal before a weekend summit where EU leaders hope to rubber stamp it.\n\nThe 585-page, legally binding withdrawal agreement is as good as complete, but Britain and the EU still need to flesh out a far less detailed seven-page declaration on their future relations.\n\nMay said \u201can intense week of negotiations\u201d lay ahead to finalize the framework.\n\nThe deal has infuriated pro-Brexit lawmakers in May\u2019s Conservative Party. The Brexiteers want a clean break with the bloc and argue that the close trade ties called for in the agreement May\u2019s government agreed would leave Britain a vassal state, bound to EU rules it has no say in making.\n\nTwo Cabinet ministers, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, resigned in protest, and rebels are trying to gather the signatures of 48 lawmakers needed to trigger a no-confidence vote.\n\nOne rebel lawmaker, Simon Clarke, on Monday urged wavering colleagues to help trigger a leadership challenge to May.\n\n\u201cIt is quite clear to me that the captain is driving the ship at the rocks,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nEven if May sees off such a challenge, she still has to get the deal approved by Parliament. Her Conservatives don\u2019t have a parliamentary majority, and it\u2019s not clear whether she can persuade enough lawmakers to back the agreement.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers, including Raab, say the prime minister should stay in her post but try to renegotiate the Brexit deal \u2014 something May and other EU leaders insist is impossible.\n\nMay argues that abandoning the plan, with Britain\u2019s withdrawal just over four months away on March 29, could lead to a disorderly and economically damaging \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit \u2014 or to a situation in which Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is postponed indefinitely.\n\nThe agreement also must be approved by the European Parliament. Manfred Weber, who leads the EU legislature\u2019s largest group, the center-right European People\u2019s Party, said its initial assessment of the deal is \u201cvery encouraging, very positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be clear to our British partners that there will be no renegotiation of this text that is now on the table,\u201d Weber said in Berlin.\n\nLuxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the deal \u201cis the best one possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no better one for this crazy Brexit,\u201d Asselborn said as EU foreign ministers met in Brussels before a leaders\u2019 summit on Sunday at which the bloc intends to sign off on the deal.\n\nSpain insisted it needed more clarity on how the U.K. territory of Gibraltar at the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula would be dealt with.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU ministers \u201chave agreed to the principle\u201d of a one-off extension of the post-Brexit transition period if the two sides need more time to finalize a trade deal. Under the divorce agreement, Britain agrees to be bound by EU rules during the transition. It is due to end in December 2020 but can be extended by mutual agreement if the two sides need more time.\n\nBarnier wouldn\u2019t give a specific end-date for the extension. It\u2019s a delicate issue for May, because some in her party worry the extension could be used to trap Britain in the EU\u2019s rules indefinitely.\n\nMay says any extension must be finished before the next U.K. election, scheduled for the first half of 2022.\n\nMay tried to build public and business support for the deal on Monday, telling business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry that it \u201cfulfils the wishes of the British people\u201d to leave the EU, by taking back control of the U.K.\u2019s laws, money and borders.\n\nMay confirmed the government\u2019s plan to end the automatic right of EU citizens to live and work in the U.K., saying Britain\u2019s future immigration policy will be based on skills, rather than nationality.\n\n\u201cIt will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi,\u201d May said.\n\nBritish businesses, longing for an end to uncertainty about what rules they will face after Brexit, have broadly welcomed the agreement. But some are unhappy with the immigration plans, which have yet to be revealed in detail.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry\u2019s Carolyn Fairbairn said \u201ca new immigration system represents a seismic shift,\u201d and urged the government not to make \u201ca false choice between high- and low-skilled workers\u201d that would leave many sectors short-staffed.\n\nMay said she was confident the deal \u201cwill work for the U.K.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let no one be in any doubt - I am determined to deliver it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Brussels, Austria\u2019s minister for Europe, Gernot Bluemel, struck a more melancholy tone.\n\n\u201cA painful week in European politics is starting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the divorce papers on the table; 45 years of difficult marriage are coming to an end.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n\n___\n\nSee the AP\u2019s Brexit coverage at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

You won\u2019t want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.\n\nA note to readers this Thanksgiving week: Our indefatigable researcher, Bastien Inzaurralde, is on vacation. So we'll be bringing you an abbreviated newsletter this week and be fully back up to speed following the holidays.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nAs the Department of Homeland Security gains new authority over cybersecurity and continues its review of election security during the 2018 midterms, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\u2019s future at the agency remains uncertain.\n\nDuring a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, President Trump would not commit to Nielsen continuing as DHS secretary following a Washington Post report that he is planning to remove her from the post. Just two days earlier, Nielsen stood by his side as he signed a bill into law that creates a new cyber-focused agency within DHS.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance, there\u2019s a chance everybody, I mean that\u2019s what happens in government, you leave, you make a name, you go,\u201d Trump told Fox News's Chris Wallace yesterday when asked whether Nielsen would continue at DHS. \u201cI like her very much, I respect her very much, I\u2019d like her to get much tougher on the border \u2014 much tougher, period.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration with Nielsen\u2019s performance on immigration may be her undoing. But Nielsen\u2019s potential ouster comes at a time when the department is engaged in critical cybersecurity work and could actually disrupt efforts to take stock of how well states and localities secured their elections in the 2018 midterms as the country heads into 2020, the first presidential election year since Russia is known to have interfered with the electoral process.\n\nDHS officials have long worried that turnover there made it difficult for the department to stay on top of evolving cyber threats. Nielsen has been at DHS for less than a year, and a new secretary would be the fourth in two years. If Nielsen leaves sometime in the near future, it would create a void at the top of a department just as it is finally taking the reins as the government's top cyber cop \u2014 a role lawmakers have been reluctant to bestow on DHS since such proposals were introduced during the Obama administration.\n\nLawmakers worried the relatively young, sprawling department agency wasn't well-equipped to handle cybersecurity threats, but legislation signed by President Trump Friday created a DHS agency that would do just that.\n\nDavid Becker, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said Nielsen's leadership was essential to efforts to secure the 2018 midterm elections because she enabled state and federal officials to effectively collaborate after a rocky post-2016 start. The department is currently reviewing how successful it was in securing voting infrastructure and systems in 2018, although there is no current evidence of tampering with election infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHer leadership was focused on exactly the right tone with state and local election officials,\u201d Becker said, adding that if Nielsen exits, \u201cIt could mean a real loss of cybersecurity leadership and focus.\u201d\n\nNielsen did face scrutiny earlier in her tenure for appearing to call into question the intelligence community\u2019s finding that Russia influenced the 2016 election in favor of Trump. As The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake wrote at the time, her comments raised questions about whether the administration was taking seriously threats of election interference.\n\nChris Krebs, the newly elevated Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director, wouldn\u2019t comment about the possibility of Nielsen's departure in an interview with me last week. However, Krebs did praise the secretary's commitment to cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cThe secretary has been an incredible champion for DHS cybersecurity and cybersecurity across the country,\u201d Krebs said.\n\nBefore serving as DHS secretary, Nielsen was a cybersecurity expert in the private sector. She also served as a special adviser for emergency preparedness and disaster response during the George W. Bush administration and worked at the Transportation and Security Administration.\n\n\u201cTo have someone who just intrinsically understands issues related to cybersecurity is a huge asset in a fight to prevent future foreign interference in our elections,\u201d Becker said.\n\nMy colleagues Nick Miroff, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker broke the news of Trump\u2019s plans to oust Nielsen last week. They reported that people who previously worked with Nielsen were astonished when she was selected for the role because she had no experience leading a large organization, but had served in the chief of staff role when John Kelly, the former DHS head who is now the White House chief of staff, was there.\n\nNielsen\u2019s removal may have been delayed because there is not a clear successor to replace her (though Trump has changed his mind on personnel decisions before), the Associated Press reported on Thursday. Potential candidates include U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, and two military officers \u2014 TSA head David Pekoske, formerly of the Coast Guard, and Maj. Gen. Vincent Coglianese, who runs the Marine Corps Installations Command, the AP reported.\n\nNielsen\u2019s work enforcing Trump\u2019s immigration policies has largely overshadowed her cybersecurity efforts. She became the public face of the administration\u2019s much-maligned policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border when she gave a news conference defending the controversial practice at the height of the controversy.\n\nIf Nielsen is pushed out of the administration, it could be an early indicator that well-qualified people may not want to work in the Trump administration, Aaron wrote.\n\n\u201cBut she seems to be a victim of irrational expectations more than anything,\u201d Blake wrote. \u201cAnd she has spent much of her tenure tolerating Trump\u2019s whims and even putting her reputation on the line in the name to keeping her job. No amount of public fealty, it seems, has been enough.\u201d\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\nAmerica\u2019s Election Grid Remains a Patchwork of Vulnerabilities The midterms showed that there aren\u2019t enough qualified poll workers and that accusations of political manipulation persist.

Some 2.5 billion among them do not have adequate toilets, according to U.N. figures. The lack of toilets forces many to defecate in the open \u2014 in the streets, in the bushes and by rivers and other water sources.\n\nAmong the development goals set by the U.N. in 2015 is a target to ensure everyone has access to a safe toilet by 2030. But campaigners warn this goal will be hard to meet if governments and businesses do not put more money into the sanitation economy.\n\nSanitation is \u201cthe business of the decade,\u201d said Cheryl Hicks, chief executive of the Geneva-based business group Toilet Board Coalition. She told The Associated Press that the group is urging commercial investment to help reduce toilet shortages in countries where governments cannot afford such infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHalf the world needs toilets. They don\u2019t have them because the infrastructure is too expensive for governments,\u201d she said.\n\nAfrican countries are among the neediest.\n\nThe new report by WaterAid cites an estimated 344 million children in sub-Saharan Africa who lack a toilet at home, leaving them vulnerable to diarrhea and other water-borne infections.\n\nIn the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, one of 101 countries surveyed by WaterAid, eight in 10 schools there lack adequate toilet facilities. The same study reported that 93 percent of households in the East African nation of Ethiopia lack a decent toilet.\n\nJoel Ssimbwa, an entrepreneur who has put up two low-cost facilities in impoverished parts of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, said he launched his business in 2016 after several times he needed to ease himself but had \u201cnowhere to go.\u201d\n\nIn September 2007 a Ugandan lawmaker told reporters he was \u201cbadly off\u201d and helpless after being photographed urinating against a wall outside the Ministry of Finance in Kampala. He was later charged and fined, despite protesting the lack of sanitation facilities nearby.\n\nThere are fewer than 20 free public toilets in Kampala, a city of over 3 million people. Toilets in buildings across the city are often kept under lock and key, apparently to ward off unwelcome users.\n\nSsimbwa acknowledged that the Shs300 (8 cents) he charges may still be unaffordable to many, the reason he is working on a business model that would allow his clients to pay a uniform monthly fee instead of having to pay each time they check in.\n\n\u201cIt is a drop in the ocean, but it creates awareness\u201d of what the government and others must do, he said, talking about his services.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nAs U.S. citizens cast their ballots in this month\u2019s midterm election, Facebook announced its suspicions that the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) was attempting to interfere . But what, exactly, was the online strategy of this \u201ctroll farm\u201d that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had already indicted in connection with meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign?\n\nTo understand the IRA\u2019s approach, we looked at what it had done before the 2016 election. We analyzed all known IRA-operated Twitter accounts to see what kind of material the trolls shared. We found that they shared less junk news than one might have expected, relying instead on local news sources.\n\nHow we did our research\n\nOur study drew on a data set shared online by Twitter\u2019s elections integrity initiative of more than 9 million tweets sent by about 3,600 IRA-linked accounts in 2016. Because we were primarily interested in tweets with links that had been shared in the United States, we discarded tweets without links and accounts that posted in Russian. That left us with 556 accounts that tweeted about 209,000 links between January and November.\n\nTo compare the trolls\u2019 tweeting to \u201cnormal\u201d Twitter behavior, we also collected tweets during the same period from two comparison groups: politically engaged users and a random sample of U.S. users. These tweets were collected by New York University\u2019s Social Media and Political Participation ( SMaPP ) lab. The sample of random Twitter users contains 1,344 accounts that tweeted about 106,000 links; the sample of politically engaged users encompasses 1,952 accounts that shared about 437,000 URLs. Find our full analysis and additional methodological details in a newly released SMaPP Data Report .\n\n[This explains how social media can both weaken \u2014 and strengthen \u2014 democracy]\n\nJunk news? Not so much.\n\nOnly about 6 percent of all links the trolls shared on Twitter led to what Merrimack College researchers classified as known junk news sites ; these sites contained, for example, extreme bias, conspiracy theories, rumors or junk science. Still, trolls linked to such sites more often than the average politically interested user linked to such sites (4 percent of all links) and much more than an average Twitter user (0.4 percent of links).\n\nBut the number of links to junk news sites spiked sharply in the weeks immediately leading up to the election, suggesting that the trolls put extra effort into spreading falsehoods just before Election Day. At its peak, the IRA tweeted more than 2,000 links to junk news sites in a single week in September 2016, which was five to 10 times more than in typical previous weeks.\n\nHow the IRA went local\n\nOur most surprising finding is that the IRA heavily used local media: 30 percent of all its links led to local or regional news websites. That means the trolls shared five times as much local news content as junk news content. By comparison, our politically interested users pointed 1.9 percent of their links to local news sources and our average users only 0.3 percent.\n\nSome IRA accounts even pretended to be local news outlets themselves. They used Twitter handles such as \u201cAtlanta_Online\u201d or \u201cKansasDailyNews\u201d and tweeted heavily about the region they pretended to be located in, sharing articles from real local news outlets. Many of their tweets talked about \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cClinton\u201d or \u201c#politics,\u201d meaning that these local news sources were at least in part used to spread news about the presidential race.\n\nAnother set of IRA accounts masqueraded as partisans on the left or the right. Drawing on classifications from Patrick L. Warren and Darren L. Linvill of Clemson University, we also examined 14 IRA accounts that pretended to be white conservative Americans \u2014 using Twitter handles such as \u201cUSA_Gunslinger\u201d or \u201cSouthLoneStar\u201d \u2014 and eight posing as left-leaning, usually black, partisans, with screen names such as \u201cBlackToLive\u201d or \u201cTrayneshaCole.\u201d\n\nThese partisan accounts also shared local news, framed in polarizing ways. Although both sides often tweeted about the police, crime and minorities, the right-leaning accounts tended to focus on crimes committed by minorities and to support law enforcement, while the left-leaning accounts emphasized crimes against minorities and police brutality.\n\nProportion of each news category shared by the IRA over time\n\n\n\nCaption: Figure displays the proportion of links to local, national and junk (as classified by opensources.co) news sites over time shared by IRA troll accounts.\n\nData: Twitter; Figure: Leon Yin, NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP lab.)\n\nBut why?\n\nWe suspect that the IRA relied so heavily on local news sources because they believed Americans trust their local media outlets more than other sources, as a 2017 Pew Research Center report found.\n\nThe local-tweeting trolls also could have been \u201csleeper accounts.\u201d By posing as legitimate news sources and sharing reliable information for months or years, they might have been trying to build a reputation and online following for more effectiveness in future influence campaigns.\n\nAnother possibility is that the IRA simply wanted to exacerbate polarization. Amplifying reliable local news content in ways that confirm partisan prejudices could also heighten polarization. Some of the fake partisan accounts amassed hundreds of likes and retweets on every link they shared, many more than the average IRA accounts.\n\n[A plague of Twitter bots is roiling the Middle East]\n\nDoes the IRA know its geography?\n\nIRA accounts\u2019 geographical targeting was less sophisticated, at least for the 2016 presidential race. The troll farm tweeted most local news content from outlets based in California, Kansas and Missouri, none of which were considered swing states in 2016.\n\nMap of local news shared by IRA accounts\n\n\n\nData: Twitter and the NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab; Figure Leon Yin, NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP lab.)\n\nLessons for the future\n\nOur findings regarding junk news and local news shared by IRA trolls reveal that simply fighting fake news will not be enough to stop attempts at electoral manipulation on social media. That being said, links to news were not the only content shared by IRA trolls on Twitter, so there is more to be done to understand these accounts\u2019 strategies.\n\nFranziska Roscher is a PhD candidate in politics at New York University and a graduate research associate in the Social Media and Political Participation lab at New York University.\n\nLeon Yin is a research scientist in the Social Media and Political Participation lab.\n\nRichard Bonneau is professor of biology and computer science at NYU and a co-director of the Social Media and Political Participation lab."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Joe Davidson", "title": "Connolly plans defense of federal employees as incoming subcommittee chair", "description": "The Virginia Democrat promised \"a very different approach\" than that of Republicans: \"Federal employees need to be respected and their rights in the workplace upheld and strengthened.\"", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/19/connolly-plans-defense-federal-employees-incoming-subcommittee-chair/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:00:18Z", "content": "Rep.

Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) is poised to become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, which has broad jurisdiction, including over the federal workplace. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nColumnist\n\nRep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) is clear on what a Democratic majority in the House next year will mean for the federal workforce:\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I think the hostility to federal employees and their \u2026 unions will end.\u201d\n\nConnolly is in position to do something about that. He\u2019s prepped to be chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, after serving as its ranking Democrat.\n\nIn addition to the workforce, the subcommittee\u2019s jurisdiction includes federal contractors, the U.S. Postal Service, federal IT management, Metro and more \u2014 issues of prime importance to the DMV. While that could change, Connolly will continue to have a strong hand in issues affecting federal employees. His Northern Virginia district has many, and lots of contractors, too.\n\nWe spoke with Connolly about the House Democratic takeover in the 116th Congress and his priorities as the subcommittee-chairman-in-waiting. His comment about hostility toward federal workers and their unions was right on time.\n\nThree federal unions sued the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) last week over its \u201cNotice of Repudiation.\u201d The day after Election Day, VA unilaterally repudiated parts of collective bargaining agreements that allowed medical professionals to use \u201cofficial time,\u201d claiming it \u201cnegatively impacts direct patient care.\u201d\n\nFederal law allows individuals to participate in defined workplace activities in their capacity as union leaders while being paid by the government. They are prohibited from internal union business while on official time and must represent the entire bargaining unit, not just union members. Republicans have long sought to cut official time, which is a target of President Trump\u2019s aggression toward federal labor organizations.\n\nBut Connolly has reminded him that \u201cthis administration cannot eviscerate United States law by fiat.\u201d\n\nAs chairman of the subcommittee, he would have more authority to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cWe believe strongly that federal employees need to be respected and their rights in the workplace upheld and strengthened,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll take a very different approach than that which has characterized the Republican leadership \u2026 I think you\u2019ll see a reversal on a lot of fronts,\u201d including GOP hits on federal workplace rights and compensation. \u201cI think that will have practical consequences that are good for federal employees. I think that\u2019s a big change.\u201d\n\nVA\u2019s action attempts to skirt Trump\u2019s May 25 executive orders seeking to eviscerate union influence. The directives have largely been blocked by a federal court order, which the administration is appealing.\n\n\u201cLegislation to overturn President Trump\u2019s three executive orders aimed at making it impossible for federal unions to represent their members, and essentially rendering the federal government an at-will employer\u201d is at the top of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers federal workforce agenda.\n\nWhen the orders were issued, the administration said they made it \u201ceasier for agencies to remove poor-performing employees and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used.\"\n\nConnolly is wary of the administration\u2019s goal and doubtful about its method.\n\n\u201cI think the Congress can certainly assert itself\u201d and oppose Trump\u2019s workforce actions, Connolly said. \u201cWe\u2019re not at all convinced that all of this can be done by executive order. And I think we\u2019re prepared to challenge that, including in court if we have to.\u201d\n\nHe also challenges the administration\u2019s right to reorganize federal agencies, including the suggested privatization of the Postal Service, without congressional approval.\n\n\u201cIf you want to reorganize the federal government. You come to Congress with a proposal for its consideration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the regular order of things.\u201d\n\nHis focus on civil service protections, compensation and labor organizations is supported by union leaders.\n\n\u201cWe expect the House to demonstrate its respect for the apolitical civil service and the union rights of federal employees,\u201d said American Federation of Government Employees President J. David Cox Sr. \u201cWe are also counting on the House and the Senate to resist the administration\u2019s efforts to undermine federal pay, retirement, and health insurance benefits.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues, Connolly expects the committee to probe the administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question on the next census. \u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d there will be hearings on that, he said with emphasis. \u201cAnd I would expect subpoenas to flow\u201d to determine how that decision was made, he added.\n\nOn the civil service reform front, Teresa W. Gerton, president and chief executive of the National Academy of Public Administration, wants Congress to fund training and encourage agencies to be more flexible in the use of personnel management tools \u201cso that they can manage their workforce in a way that supports their mission while still upholding merit principles.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, Connolly said, are \u201ccertainly willing to consider meaningful reforms that make government more efficient and make it take the hiring process a little easier.\u201d\n\nBut they won\u2019t support efforts that are \u201csimply designed to shrink the federal workforce and further constrain the rights of federal employees in the workplace. If that\u2019s the agenda under the guise of reform, we\u2019re not going to cooperate, we\u2019re going to resist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing but attempts to rein in the rights of the workers \u2026\u201d he added, \u201cand that makes us obviously quite suspicious as to motives.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPersonnel chief wants a yes with unions, but Trump administration actions say no\n\nTrump\u2019s orders show unwavering attack on federal unions, employees\n\nVA, skirting court order, kills \u2018official time\u2019 for medical professionals\n\nPostal unions making big ad buy to stop postal privatization before Trump releases plan"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "South African minister notes worry about graft prosecutions", "description": "Cabinet minister in South Africa cites concerns that efforts to prosecute people allegedly involved in corruption under former president Zuma are falling short", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-african-minister-notes-worry-about-graft-prosecutions/2018/11/19/b281be90-ebf1-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:53:15Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 A Cabinet minister in South Africa on Monday citing concerns that efforts to prosecute people allegedly involved in corruption under former president Jacob Zuma are falling short.\n\nPravin Gordhan, the public enterprises minister, told a commission investigating corruption allegations that he has often heard South Africans ask why no \u201cbig figure\u201d has ended up in a prison uniform.\n\nGordhan questioned \u201chow many files are waiting on the desk of the National Prosecuting Authority?\u201d with investigations and charges prepared but prosecutions yet to proceed.\n\nAs finance minister under Zuma, Gordhan was widely seen as a strong opponent of efforts to loot state coffers.

He has been arrested on suspicion of financial misconduct. (Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNissan said Monday that chairman Carlos Ghosn has been arrested and will be dismissed after the Japanese automaker uncovered \u201csignificant acts of misconduct,\u201d including underreporting his own salary and using company assets for his personal benefit.\n\nGhosn is considered one of the car industry\u2019s top executives and is one of the highest-paid corporate bosses in Japan. He is widely credited with having saved Nissan Motor Co. from near-bankruptcy. He also serves as chairman and chief executive of France\u2019s Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.\n\nBrazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, he is one of the few foreigners in such a senior position in Japan.\n\nNissan said it conducted an internal investigation that lasted several months based on a report from a whistleblower regarding misconduct by Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly. It shared its findings with public prosecutors for their own investigation.\n\n\u201cI am not in a position to talk about the progress of the investigation itself, but as a result of the investigation, we heard that the arrests have been made of the two gentlemen,\u201d CEO Hiroto Saikawa said during a news conference at the company headquarters in Yokohama.\n\nSaikawa said he would convene a meeting of the board on Thursday to remove Ghosn and Kelly.\n\nNissan said its investigation showed numerous \u201csignificant acts of misconduct,\u201d including underreporting Ghosn\u2019s compensation to the Tokyo Stock Exchange to the tune of more than $40 million over five years. It also said he used investment funds for personal gain and misused company expenses.\n\nNissan said Kelly was also deeply involved in the wrongdoing.\n\nRenault shares tumbled nearly 10 percent in Paris, while Nissan\u2019s German-listed securities fell by a similar amount.\n\nGhosn, 64, began his career at tiremaker Michelin in France in the late 1970s before moving on to Renault in 1996. There he helped engineer a turnaround in the carmaker\u2019s fortunes that earned him the admiration of the business world \u2014 but not of labor unions or leftist politicians, who resented his high salary while he presided over massive job losses in the wake of the global financial crisis.\n\nHe joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO from 2001 until 2017, engineering a similar turnaround there and earning the nickname \u201cLe Cost Killer.\u201d\n\nGhosn stepped down as Nissan CEO last year but remained chairman of the company.\n\nHe became a star in the business world in Japan, appearing on magazine covers dressed in a kimono and even spawning a manga comic book on his life, although he also attracted more criticism for his high salary.\n\nGhosn was one of the first executives to champion electric cars, and he developed a range of low-cost cars for emerging markets.\n\nIn June, Renault shareholders approved Ghosn\u2019s $8.5 million compensation for 2017. He also received the equivalent of more than $10 million in his final year as Nissan CEO.\n\nThe scandal also raised eyebrows in France, where the French government is a major shareholder in Renault. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Monday that the government would not comment on the judicial investigation in Japan but had already made inquiries with Renault about the company\u2019s management structure.\n\nIn a late-night news conference, Saikawa, the Nissan CEO, did little to hide his anger at Ghosn for letting the company down.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concentration of power in one individual,\u201d as well as Ghosn\u2019s \u201clong reign\u201d at the automaking conglomerate, affected operations and could have been factors in allowing the misconduct to take place, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople who reported to Mr. Ghosn became limited in number,\u201d Saikawa said. As a result, instead of making decisions based on a range of information and opinions, Ghosn \u201cmade decisions based on limited input in some cases.\u201d\n\nSaikawa also spent considerable time expressing his deep regret over the \u201cbewilderment and anxiety\u201d that the news has caused employees and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cBeyond being sorry, I feel big disappointment and frustration and despair and indignation and resentment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe news is the latest scandal to sully Nissan\u2019s brand. In July, it acknowledged it had uncovered falsified emissions data from most of its factories in Japan, while in 2017 it admitted it had allowed unqualified personnel to carry out postproduction tests at some of its plants, forcing it to recall more than a million vehicles for reinspection.\n\nAlthough the company denied a direct link between the failure to carry out proper testing and its ongoing efforts to cut costs, Chief Competitive Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi said at the time that he \u201cneeded to reflect on whether there was an environment at Nissan in which anything could be tolerated if it led to cost-cutting.\u201d\n\nTim Hubbard, assistant professor of management in the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said Ghosn\u2019s arrest complicates an interconnected set of relationships among Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi.\n\n\u201cThis has widespread implications for a large portion of the auto industry, as these alliances have become more critical in the increasingly interconnected design, manufacturing and support of auto customers worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cGhosn\u2019s arrest is another unfortunate example of the perils of having too much power concentrated in one individual within \u2014 and across \u2014 corporations.\u201d\n\nOne of the puzzles was why Ghosn, with all his wealth, might have wanted to defraud his own company, if the accusations are true.\n\n\u201cIt seems very shortsighted to me, when you have that much money, why you would want to nickel-and-dime the company and shareholders,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond\u2019s law school.\n\nTobias said that if the alleged transgressions had occurred in the United States, someone like Ghosn, who could afford the best legal counsel available, might have been able to strike a deal with prosecutors to avoid jail time by paying a large fine.

A Russian presidential commission concluded that he had been beaten and denied medical care. Two prison doctors were charged with negligence leading to his death, but one was acquitted by a court in 2013 and another didn\u2019t face justice because of a statute of limitations.\n\nU.S.-born Browder, who owned a major investment fund in Russia, then mounted a campaign to bring Magnitsky\u2019s killers to justice. He pushed through legislation, named after Magnitsky, in the United States imposing travel and financial sanctions on top Russian officials including prosecutors. Several other countries have since adopted the Magnitsky Act.\n\nRussian prosecutors on Monday announced new charges against Browder, accusing him of forming a criminal group to embezzle funds in Russia. They also said they suspect Magnitsky\u2019s death in prison was a poisoning and said they have a \u201ctheory\u201d Browder was behind it.\n\nMikhail Alexandrov of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office told reporters that they opened a criminal case into a poisoning with a military-grade substance of the three people they called Browder\u2019s associates and said that it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that Magnitsky, who they said displayed similar symptoms, was poisoned as well.\n\nThe new charges against Browder follow his 2013 conviction in absentia by a Moscow court on tax evasion charges that he dismissed as a sham.\n\nThe announcement comes as the Netherlands is preparing to host diplomats from all EU member states to discuss a pan-EU Magnitsky Act.\n\nBrowder told The Associated Press on Monday that he has no relation to the three men named by the prosecutors and described the accusations of the poisoning as an attempt to discredit his campaign for justice for Magnitsky:\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201creaction is so absurd that it only helps our campaign and our cause,\u201d he said.\n\nBrowder compared the new theory about Magnitsky\u2019s death to the Russian denials of its role in the 2014 downing of Malaysian flight MH17: \u201cIt looks like MH17 where the Russians are blaming the Ukrainians for the plane that they shot down.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Monday that they will now be placing Browder on a wanted list and expect Interpol\u2019s cooperation.\n\nRussia has previously tried to get Browder placed on Interpol\u2019s wanted list, but the organization has repelled the efforts, viewing his prosecution as politically motivated.\n\nBrowder was briefly detained in Spain in May and released after police found that the arrest warrant for him was no longer valid.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement comes two days before Interpol is expected to elect its new chief, and a former Russian police official is a front-runner.\n\nBrowder said the possible appointment of a former Russian police official \u201cputs the organization in a grave danger of being fully discredited.\u201d\n\nOther Kremlin critics have been vocal about the upcoming Interpol election.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny who has faced a flurry of detentions and criminal charges tweeted Monday that his associates \u201chave suffered abuse\u201d from Interpol officials who were complying with Russian warrants to persecute Kremlin opponents and warned that the candidate from Russia would only make things worse: \u201cI don\u2019t think that a president from Russia will help to reduce such violations.\u201d\n\nAsked about the upcoming vote at Interpol in connection with the Browder case, Prosecutor General\u2019s Office spokesman Alexander Kurennoy told reporters that Moscow views the organization as \u201ctrusted partners\u201d and expressed hope that \u201cthe procedures will be followed in a regular manner\u201d when it submits an arrest warrant for Browder.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Petros Karadjias/Associated Press)\n\nLEFKARA, Cyprus \u2014 Legend has it that the intricate needlework used in embroidery known as \u2018Lefkaritiko lace\u2019 was of such high quality that Leonardo Da Vinci himself bought a tablecloth when he visited this mountainous village in the late 15th century and gifted it to Milan\u2019s cathedral.\n\nLocal merchant Demosthenes Rouvis contends that the zig-zag pattern adorning the tablecloth on which Jesus Christ and his disciples dine in Da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d closely resembles those found on \u201cLefkaritiko\u201d embroidery.\n\nBut this centuries-old tradition is under threat now, falling prey to more modern trends \u2014 tourists with an eye for a bargain souvenir and local workers looking for ways to make a better living.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the village\u2019s heyday in the late 19th and early 20th century, when merchants fanned out around the world to sell the costly cloth.\n\nThe skills involved in hand-stitching the embroidery that uses Irish linen and French thread have been passed down from generation to generation for some 600 years. The art was taught to Lefkara women by Cyprus\u2019 former Venetian rulers when they vacationed in the village, said veteran embroider Evdokia Stavri.\n\nBut with a full-sized tablecloth taking up to two years to make and now selling for up to 4,000 euros ($4,500) and tourists increasingly settling for cheaper imitations, embroidery is fast becoming a dying art in this village, says shop owner Louis Papaloizou, whose own grandmother Elizabeth was reputed to be the first woman to journey abroad to sell Lefkaritiko lace.\n\nMargarita Charalambous, president of the Lefkara Embroiders\u2019 Association, agrees, saying fewer and fewer local women are learning the craft because it is no longer lucrative.\n\nIn an effort to keep the craft alive, embroiderers are updating the traditional look with different colored threads and using it to adorn fashionable handbags to entice a new clientele.\n\nBut store owner Papaloizou fears that even attempts to move with the times may not save the craft as young women from the village look elsewhere for work.\n\n\u201cWe produce lace with a great deal of difficulty because the women embroiders are getting old.

Nationalist demagogues from Viktor Orban of Hungary to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil to, yes, America\u2019s own President Trump, are heartily welcomed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu shares with this group a penchant for racist scaremongering. Following the deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue by a white supremacist, an attack inspired in part by Trump\u2019s lies about a migrant caravan approaching from Central America, Netanyahu blamed \u201cradical Islam.\u201d Trump, for his part, canceled the Iran nuclear deal at Netanyahu\u2019s urging, and has rewarded Israeli expansionism by moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, cutting aid to Palestinians and quietly endorsing a construction surge in Israel\u2019s illegal settlements. Trump finds inspiration in Israel\u2019s legalized ethnocracy, its boastful marginalization of minorities and the big wall it has built.\n\nDoes this mean the political right has hijacked the relationship between Israel and the United States?\n\nNo.\n\nIn truth, the current state of U.S.-Israeli relations is a clear continuation of a long-established practice, supported by liberals and conservatives alike. Long before authoritarian leaders began queuing up to move their embassies to Jerusalem \u2014 and even before the triumvirate of AIPAC, neoconservatives and Christian evangelicals lionized Israel\u2019s garrison state \u2014 both liberals and conservatives embraced Israeli militarism. Together they turned Israel into the single largest annual recipient of American foreign assistance in the late 20th century. Trump\u2019s willingness to support Israel regardless of its treatment of the Palestinians has simply remained true to this bipartisan pattern cemented over decades.\n\nIsrael has long held a singular position in the American political imagination, particularly when it comes to questions of war and society. That fascination stemmed from Israel\u2019s triumph over its neighbors in the June 1967 war, a victory that quadrupled the territory under its control. Americans frustrated with the fractures the Vietnam War wrought in their own society believed this victory affirmed Israel\u2019s approach to warfare and what they perceived as a rare citizen-soldier utopia.\n\nThese American champions of Israeli exceptionalism spanned the political spectrum from Richard M. Nixon and George McGovern. They idealized Israel as a country that successfully combined regimentation and freedom, striking an impeccable balance between state authority and individual liberty. They admired Israel\u2019s combination of a sophisticated military leadership and refined martial masculinities with freedom of expression during wartime.\n\nBut this vision was a fiction, one both Americans and Israelis constructed and upheld.\n\nJournalist Alfred Friendly, a former managing editor of The Washington Post who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from the 1967 war, played a key role in spreading that message. Friendly told his readers how the American observer, \u201cshattered\u201d by the strife at home, could see in Israel a society that was \u201cwhole.\u201d Sentimental admiration of the camaraderie and diversity of bearded Israeli troops marked his reporting. He basked with Israeli officers in a West Bank spring \u201cin sheer bliss\u201d and admired them as \u201ca heterogeneous fighting collective.\u201d To an Israeli press officer Friendly confided his happiness that his Pulitzer came for a story where the \u201cwhite hats licked the black ones, as should be the case in every proper Western.\u201d\n\nIn the New Republic, cartoonist Bill Mauldin drew a cartoon of relaxed Israeli soldiers riding a half-truck. The caption read, \u201cIt is definitely a citizens\u2019 army.\u201d Mauldin, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his World War II comic strip \u201cWillie and Joe,\u201d took his romanticized vision of the democratic, laid-back instincts of the American citizen-soldier and superimposed that image on 1960s Israel. Other American publications told of Israeli soldiers studying, dating, cooking and singing between battle tours and military training. Picturing the Israeli citizen-soldier as a combination of West Point graduate and flower child, most outlets gave little attention to attitudes of the newly occupied Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli progressives helped spread this message to American readers. Amnon Rubinstein, dean of law at Tel Aviv University, boasted in his New York Times column that Israelis effortlessly jumped from tank maneuvers to family holidays. Amos Elon, one of Israel\u2019s most prominent journalists, cockily told American readers that Israel, unlike America, \u201cmates solidarity with robust individualism.\u201d To combat any negative claims about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, Israel sent Palestinian-Israelis on American speaking tours to claim that the occupation was benevolent, economically beneficial and apolitical.\n\nIn the American polity, only a few activist groups such as the Black Panthers challenged this story. Even anti-Vietnam War doves like McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke with great reverence about Israel\u2019s ability to remain \u201cunited\u201d through a trying conflict. Forty-six years before Trump moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, McGovern recommended it during his campaign.\n\nConservatives and hawks tried to claim they were Israel\u2019s only defenders. Nixon resented Israel\u2019s strong ties with liberals, warning Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1970 that Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley, Jr. were Israel\u2019s true friends and that \u201cwhen the chips are down\u201d liberals \u201cwill cut and run.\u201d Nixon was wrong: although from the mid-1970s onward liberals talked more about a diplomatic compromise and expressed less excitement about Israeli militarism, they provided the country with unparalleled support without pressing Israel to curtail its expansionist policies.\n\nThe October 1973 War shattered the image of Israeli citizen-soldier utopia. While Israel rebuffed the coordinated Egyptian-Syrian surprise offensive, the shock of the attack took the gloss off Israel as a fighting society. The conflict stirred up unprecedented dissent in Israeli society. Meir resigned. Mainstream outlets in the United States still portrayed Israel sympathetically, but they cast it as a war-weary society, in need of American guidance.\n\nThat view of Israel prescribed the need for American diplomatic leadership. It also represented an American effort to reinvent their country\u2019s mission in the post-Vietnam War world in less combative tones. Liberals initially hoped to promote a comprehensive deal that would solve the Palestinian crisis. This spirit defined Jimmy Carter\u2019s initial attitude to the Camp David peace process from 1977 through 1979, but it was quickly abandoned in the face of Israeli defiance and Egyptian acquiescence.\n\nIn subsequent decades, liberals and conservatives have sometimes differed in their rhetoric about Israel, but not in their policy. Through decades of meandering peace processes, White House photo-ops, milestones and road maps, Americans remain unwilling to compel Israel to pay the territorial price required to achieve a meaningful agreement.\n\nWhile the right branded liberals as unfaithful to Israel, and by extension, weak on security matters, in reality there was little difference between liberals and conservatives on Israel. With few exceptions, Democrats and Republicans alike proved reluctant to condition American support to Israel on a settlement freeze or withdrawal, and refused to consistently back a plan that would allow viable Palestinian statehood. Unconditional bipartisan support has allowed Israeli policymakers to increase the number of Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank to over 400,000. It has played into the hands of the Israeli right as it demonstrated Israel could effectively defy international law with impunity.\n\nWhile he has shattered norms elsewhere, Trump\u2019s Israel policy is nothing more than a clearer manifestation of long-standing policy.\n\nThe sharpening of political differences during the Trump era provides an opportunity to break away from failed practice. Emergent voices in the Democratic Party challenge policymakers to present a genuine alternative on various fronts, including Israel. If and when progressives regain power, they cannot simply relapse to the pre-Trump norm. Daring to pressure Israel to end the occupation is an important step toward righting decades of wrong."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "The Latest: 18 Saudis banned from all 26 Schengen countries", "description": "Germany's foreign minister says Berlin has banned 18 Saudi nationals from entering Europe's border-free Schengen zone because they are believed to be connected to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-latest-18-saudis-banned-from-all-26-schengen-countries/2018/11/19/0ea19af8-ebeb-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:05:44Z", "content": "WASHINGTON The Latest on the slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi (all times local): 6 a.m. Germanys foreign minister says Berlin has banned 18 Saudi nationals from entering Europes border-free Schengen zone because they are believed to be connected to the k\u2026 [+1367 chars]", "fulltext": "FILE -- In this Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018 photo German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas attends a cabinet meeting as part of a two-day retreat of the German government in Potsdam, near Berlin, Germany.

(Michael Dwyer/AP)\n\nThis year, Americans appear to have elected a record 53 African Americans to the House \u2014 assuming that Republicans William Hurd of Texas and Mia Love of Utah will win their tight races, which haven\u2019t been called as of this writing. Hurd and Love would be the only two black Republicans in this wave; the 51 others are Democrats. Forty-four were reelected. Of those, four-fifths won reelection from majority-minority districts \u2014 defined here as districts where non-Hispanic whites form a minority of the voting-age population according to the 2010 Census. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past: Historically, black representatives have been elected from majority-minority districts.\n\nBut here\u2019s the big news: Eight of the nine newly elected African Americans won in districts dominated by non-Hispanic whites. Those include Colin Allred from Texas\u2019s 32nd District; Antonio Delgado from New York\u2019s 19th; Jahana Hayes from Connecticut\u2019s 5th; Steven Horsford from Nevada\u2019s 4th; Lucy McBath from Georgia\u2019s 6th; Joe Neguse from Colorado\u2019s 2nd; Ilhan Omar from Minnesota\u2019s 5th; and Lauren Underwood from Illinois\u2019s 14th. A ninth, Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts\u2019 7th District, beat an incumbent white Democrat in the primary in a district where non-Hispanic whites make up 48 percent of the voting-age population and blacks just 21 percent.\n\n[These 5 charts explain who voted how in the 2018 midterm election]\n\nHere\u2019s the background\n\nCreating majority-minority districts made an enormous difference in getting African Americans elected to the House. The 1965 Voting Rights Act forced states to create black majority districts in parts of the country where white opposition meant African Americans couldn\u2019t get elected.\n\nBut simply having the VRA on the books wasn\u2019t what made the difference. In its 1986 decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court issued guidelines clarifying when states had to draw black districts or probably lose legal challenges.\n\nAnd so it was no accident that the number of black elected representatives jumped from 25 in 1990 to 38 in 1992, just after the 1990 Census. That was the first redistricting after Thornburg.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act\u2019s protections have been vital to the election of the vast majority of African American lawmakers \u2014 not just in the 1990s, but right up until this month\u2019s election. Tom Brunell, Bernard Grofman, Lisa Handley and I found that 85 percent of African American members of the House elected in 2007 won in districts where African Americans form a majority or African Americans and Latinos together are a majority. In that latter group, high rates of non-citizenship and low Latino participation rates often mean that African Americans make up a majority of voters.\n\nWhen we looked at more recent elections, little had changed. As of 2015, 88 percent of African Americans in the U.S. House represented majority-minority districts. That has been true in state legislative elections as well. More than 95 percent of black state legislators elected in the 11 Southern states held districts like these. That was also true for more than 80 percent of black state legislators elected in non-Southern states with a population that was at least 10 percent black and thus more likely to elect African Americans than other states.\n\n[Can Florida\u2019s recount be done fairly? Maybe. Here\u2019s what makes the difference.]\n\nThe parties are increasingly divided by racial attitudes \u2014 and voters increasingly support their party\u2019s candidate, regardless of race\n\nSo it is particularly striking that all nine new black members of Congress, all Democrats, don\u2019t come from these primarily black or primarily black and Latino districts. All won in districts where non-Hispanic blacks make up less than 21 percent of the voting-age population. Except for Pressley\u2019s narrowly majority-minority district, the eight others represent seats in which non-Hispanic whites form clear majorities, on average, making up 73 percent of the eligible voters. What\u2019s more, although most black representatives hold safe Democratic districts, six of these eight newly elected representatives took seats previously held by Republicans.\n\nAll eight of these new black representatives couldn\u2019t have been elected without substantial white support. Again, Pressley is an exception; after she defeated the incumbent in the primary, she had no opposition in the general election.\n\nAnd what that suggests is that, increasingly, voters may support their party\u2019s candidates regardless of race. Consider the fact that, in his bid for the Florida governor\u2019s office, Andrew Gillum (D), who is black, received nearly identical shares of the vote across the state as did Sen. Bill Nelson (D), who is white. Even if race explains Nelson\u2019s slightly better performance in his contest, the 0.7 percent difference is not large.\n\n[VIDEO: 2018 midterm election: A night of firsts]\n\nDoes this mean that race is somehow melting away as a factor in the age of Trump?\n\nHardly. Exit polls from the 2018 U.S. House election indicate that 90 percent of African Americans voted Democratic, as did 69 percent of Latinos and 77 percent of Asian Americans. In contrast, just 44 percent of whites voted for Democrats. Scholarship shows that what you believe about racial issues and immigration is increasingly significant in determining which party you\u2019ll support.\n\n[Republicans no longer think the \u2018n-word\u2019 is unspeakable. That\u2019s a big change. (Democrats still do.)]\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we should abandon the Voting Rights Act\u2019s protections for minority groups. Even with these eight new black representatives elected from white-majority districts, 68 percent of Congress\u2019s 53 black representatives still represent majority-minority districts. Whether whites will support African Americans in a Democratic primary varies nationwide.\n\nWhat these nine new black members of Congress tell us is that black nominees who capture their party\u2019s nomination may now be able to win even in tough districts. Of course, they may lose when the tide turns against their party, but that\u2019s true for all politicians.\n\nDavid Lublin (@theseventhstate) is a professor of government in the School of Public Affairs at American University, and author most recently of \u201cMinority Rules: Electoral Systems, Decentralization and Ethnoregional Parties\u201d (Oxford University Press, 2014)."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Alex Smith wasn't carrying the Redskins.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe emotion of losing Alex Smith \u2014 to such a gruesome injury, at such a pivotal time \u2014 took over the reaction Sunday afternoon. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s human. In the moment, and with the eerie coincidence that Joe Theismann broke his leg exactly 33 years ago to the day, it just felt like generations of curses had conspired to redefine misfortune.\n\nIt was impossible to avoid getting caught up in the heartbreak. You had to feel for Smith, who is already a beloved teammate and trusted leader in his first season as the Washington Redskins' quarterback. You had to feel for the team, which ultimately might lose a division title to a rash of injuries. You had to feel for yourself because, just when it seemed safe to invest a little faith in this team, something devastating happened. Oh, it felt hopeless in the moment.\n\nIt may be too soon for the mood to shift, but with a Thanksgiving matchup against Dallas looming 10 seconds from now, the mind needs to transition. If you can look at this in a more calculated manner, here\u2019s the conclusion: The season didn\u2019t end because Smith broke his leg. Washington\u2019s playoff hopes didn\u2019t die with one horrific play. Without question, the mission became more difficult for a team already lacking dimensions on offense. But it\u2019s also true that the team has scrounged up success this season without stellar play from Smith.\n\n[Redskins\u2019 comeback falls short in 23-21 loss to Texans, after Alex Smith is lost for season]\n\nIt has been a year of minimized quarterback dependence for Washington. Of the 11 starting quarterbacks who have winning records this season, Smith ranked last in passing yards (2,180) and in passer rating (85.7). He is lauded as a winner, and as someone who follows the team closely I will agree that there is something about Smith beyond statistics \u2014 the way he relates to people, the steady and confident manner in which he communicates, his willingness to do whatever helps his team \u2014 that influences success. But the cold numbers also say Smith has been the least productive and efficient of all the winning quarterbacks this season. Delve into why, and we\u2019re back to a familiar argument: The supporting cast lacks quality weapons to help Smith put up numbers.\n\nThe larger point is that, in this year of minimized quarterback dependence, it\u2019s an overreaction to panic and suggest the season is over all because the minimized quarterback has gone down. It\u2019s logical to think the Redskins (6-4) have too many injuries to keep it together. It\u2019s fine to wonder whether the team can survive if Colt McCoy manages to be less productive and efficient than Smith. But, \u201cQB gone, team done\u201d is too flimsy a conclusion to make.\n\nWashington won without Smith carrying it, and now that McCoy is the starter, the directive will remain the same. There\u2019s no stepping up for a Redskins quarterback this season, not in the traditional sense. It\u2019s more like stepping to the side. McCoy, who is much more of a gunslinger and prone to commit more turnovers, has to play a simple game.\n\n[As Colt McCoy takes over as starting QB, he tells Redskins, \u2018You\u2019re in good hands with me\u2019]\n\nMcCoy doesn\u2019t have to imitate Tom Brady or Drew Brees for the next six weeks because the Washington offense isn\u2019t designed to have a Brady or Brees. McCoy has to manage the game and while many deride Smith for being a game manager, there\u2019s an art to it. Coach Jay Gruden has a ball-control offense that limits turnovers. The philosophy won\u2019t change with McCoy. Gruden wants to establish the run. He\u2019ll want to use McCoy\u2019s mobility from time to time. And he needs McCoy to make a few plays in the passing game without increasing risk.\n\nThe challenge is that McCoy must remain steady for at least six games. If he had to do this for three or four games, I\u2019d consider it a no-brainer. But he has to hold the offense together for a long stretch. That\u2019s a long time to try to be invisible. He\u2019s capable, however.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good quarterback,\u201d Houston defensive end J.J. Watt said of McCoy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a massive drop-off there.\u201d\n\nAt the end of a long and jarring Sunday afternoon, McCoy stood in a quiet locker room and offered some simple, confident words to his teammates: \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands with me.\u201d That\u2019s all they needed to hear, apparently. During interviews, several players repeated McCoy\u2019s words as fact.\n\n\u201cI know we are in good hands,\u201d linebacker Mason Foster insisted.\n\nDuring the 23-21 loss to Houston on Sunday, McCoy had some good moments. He completed 6 of 12 passes for 54 yards. He rushed for 35 yards on five carries. Most importantly, he helped Washington rally from a 17-7 deficit and eventually take a 21-20 lead. It was the first time this season that the team had experienced a lead change in a game. Washington had either jumped ahead and stayed ahead, or it had fallen behind and fallen apart.\n\nMcCoy understands the system better than Smith because he has been with Gruden for five seasons. He is likely to be more ambitious and attempt to make bigger plays. But in pursuit of more, Washington can\u2019t become a turnover machine. McCoy likes to hold onto the football, and he has a history of taking a lot of sacks. Those aren\u2019t good traits for a team that values ball security. He has to protect the football. If he does, Washington might be able to continue to grind through games.\n\nMcCoy has thrown 23 passes since 2014. He has waited a long while to get another opportunity. Somehow, he has to shake off the rust and ramp up the dependability. Even without great production, Smith helped Washington with his patience and willingness to make the smart play, even if it looked ugly.\n\n\u201cI think, most importantly, I\u2019m more mature,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI played my first three years in the league as a young guy, and sometimes that can be challenging, and it certainly was for me. But I think I\u2019ve grown up. I\u2019ve grown up a lot. I feel comfortable in this system and how we execute our offense. I\u2019m very well coached, so I think I\u2019m just going to try to go out there and compete and make good decisions and let the calls fall as they may.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of Smith in McCoy\u2019s temperament, actually. The team will miss the person more than his numbers. McCoy might even be able to exceed Smith\u2019s level of productivity right away, but it won\u2019t matter if he commits more turnovers.\n\nThis is a job for a savvy quarterback, not an aspiring savior.

(Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post)\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, President Trump warned of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of murderous thugs and potential terrorists pouring across the southern border. He called for ending birthright citizenship. He demonized House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as dangerous and destructive. He promised to cut taxes on the middle class.\n\nBut in the nearly two weeks since the elections, Trump has abruptly changed tune \u2014 ditching the messages that advisers now acknowledge were crafted in a Hail Mary play to excite his base and stave off Republican losses.\n\nGone from the president\u2019s talking points are dire threats about the caravan of Central American migrants that he had described as imminent and life-threatening, or the executive order he promised to sign ending the constitutional right to citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants, or the phantom 10 percent middle-class tax cut that he said would pass easily.\n\nNow that Democrats have seized the House majority, the president has added to his repertoire happy talk about cutting deals with Pelosi, who is in line to become speaker. He pledged his support last week for bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation. And he is telling advisers that he wants an infrastructure package soon \u2014 and that he thinks Democrats will go along with one.\n\nTrump is fixated anew on the Russia probe, huddling with his lawyers to prepare written testimony for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and pecking out all-caps tirades on Twitter. \u201cA TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\u201d he wrote Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s shift in rhetoric and policy priorities is striking enough that this period of his presidency could be divided in two parts: Before and after Nov. 6.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of effective rhetoric is to adapt to changing situations, and he is adapting,\u201d said Martin J. Medhurst, a professor of rhetoric at Baylor University. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it in a not terribly artful way, but he is adapting. . . . Governing awaits.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Full Trumpism\u2019: The president\u2019s apocalyptic attacks reach a new level of falsity]\n\nIn the wake of the election, Trump boasted in calls with outgoing House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and advisers that he believed his performance on the campaign trail helped Republicans \u2014 even though voters in suburbs across the country voted for Democrats in a repudiation of Trump.\n\nThe president also told his advisers that he wants to strike a quick deal with Pelosi and that working with the Democrats could help keep their investigations of his conduct and his administration\u2019s at bay, according to people familiar with the conversations. Trump also has been telling advisers that voters like the word \u201cbipartisan.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant, said the president is talking a lot privately about a bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\n\n\nTrump participates in an Hindu Diwali ceremony at the White House last week. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cA divided government presents challenges and opportunities,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think he\u2019s pretty excited about what we can do, about the dealmaking.\u201d\n\nTrump has proved over the years to be a shape-shifter when it is expedient, changing priorities or reversing his policy positions altogether to adapt to the political winds. Current and former advisers say the president believes his support among his base is so strong that he has cover to make deals as he sees fit, including with Democrats, even if it gives some of his aides pause.\n\nMost presidents turn from campaign mode to governing mode, dialing down some of their partisan rhetoric in the interest of accomplishing things in office. But Trump\u2019s shift has been unusually clear-cut, in part because his talk on the campaign trail was so hyperbolic and often unmoored from reality.\n\nThe centerpiece of Trump\u2019s closing message to voters was the caravan, even though it was made up mostly of unarmed families fleeing violence in their homelands, seeking asylum and traveling by foot hundreds of miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump beat his drum about the migrants on Twitter, at his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies and in a blitz of media interviews. He deployed thousands of U.S. troops to the border region to prepare for what he termed an \u201cinvasion.\u201d And his political team released an advertisement that major television networks deemed too racist to air, featuring a Latino undocumented immigrant convicted of killing two police officers.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you better vote Republican,\u201d Trump said at a rally five days before the election in Columbia, Mo.\n\n[Trump ratchets up racially divisive messages in a bid to rally support in the midterms]\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers and allies acknowledge that the president\u2019s focus on the caravan was a campaign messaging tool. And since the election, he has largely stopped sounding the alarm \u2014 although he tweeted over the weekend about the caravan and urged the migrants to \u201cGo home!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican politicians have always thinly veiled their tactics and come up with reasons why they are changing directions or switching positions, and with Trump, there is no subtlety, and there is no thin veil,\u201d said one former White House official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cIt\u2019s raw power politics. It\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m doing this because it\u2019s election time, and I know it will generate energy for my base, and now the election\u2019s over, so I\u2019m shifting in x, y and z way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf his recent public utterances are any indication, Trump seems to have lost interest in the caravan compared with the run-up to the election \u2014 even though troops remain stationed at the border, where they were visited last week by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Though Trump\u2019s advisers say illegal immigration remains top of mind for the president, he does not see a political benefit at the moment in talking about it.\n\nRetired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey said, \u201cIt was without question a political stunt for the midterm elections. There was no \u2014 zero \u2014 national security issue at stake.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s campaign-trail talk about birthright citizenship, the White House is not actively pursuing the executive order the president said he would sign, according to two White House officials \u2014 although they predicted Trump would raise the issue again eventually.\n\nThese days, Trump is focused on the realigning power structure in Washington. He has signaled a new willingness to work with Democrats, whose leadership he described on the campaign trail in apocalyptic terms.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have become too extreme, and they\u2019ve become, frankly, too dangerous to govern. They\u2019ve gone wacko!\u201d Trump said at a raucous October rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, a line he repeated elsewhere on the stump. Again and again, he demonized Pelosi by name, as well as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who is poised to chair the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nBut the day after the election, Trump heaped praise on Pelosi and said he hoped to negotiate deals with the Democrats on infrastructure, health care and trade.\n\n\u201cThe election\u2019s over,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow everybody is in love.\u201d\n\nDuring his trip to California on Saturday, Trump praised the state\u2019s outgoing governor, Jerry Brown, and governor-elect, Gavin Newsom \u2014 both Democrats and outspoken critics of the president \u2014 for their leadership amid devastating wildfires.\n\nMarc Short, Trump\u2019s former White House legislative affairs director, said there is \u201can opportunity to get a significant amount done,\u201d including legislation on infrastructure spending and prescription drug pricing.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, the president\u2019s policies line up more with Democrats,\u201d Short said. \u201cThe president is always more receptive to the Democrat infrastructure plan. He had doubts about plans that his own White House produced. If Democrats can put together a plan, there are some people who say Republicans in the Senate wouldn\u2019t support it. I just don\u2019t think that is true.\u201d\n\nLast Wednesday, Trump threw his support behind criminal justice legislation that would loosen some mandatory minimum sentencing laws, which has been a priority for his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, as well as powerful Senate Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAs Trump officially endorsed the First Step Act at a White House event, he said, \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows that true bipartisanship is possible.\u201d\n\nThe next day, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Trump that the bill was unlikely to pass before the end of this calendar year, according to White House officials. Trump pushed McConnell to pass it soon, citing the bill\u2019s popularity, but the Senate leader calculated that there was not enough time on the schedule to debate it."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": "Sean Sullivan", "title": "\u2018He\u2019s evolving\u2019: Once a sunny conservative, Rubio goes all-in on Trumpism", "description": "The days since the Nov. 6 midterms have cemented the Florida senator\u2019s status as a critic turned defender of the president.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-evolving-once-a-sunny-conservative-rubio-goes-all-in-on-trumpism/2018/11/18/16b62e4c-e9e9-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bTc4hKgTg3STMLfROnNglPq2P1g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B4FOGPHLQII6RFWUBUR7FKVNBE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T11:00:00Z", "content": "TALLAHASSEE Just four years ago, Marco Rubio was gearing up to run for president with an inclusive and sunny message designed to capture the imagination of a modernizing Republican Party and maybe even the country.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduces Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis on the final day of campaigning in the midterm elections in Orlando. DeSantis won the race after a recount. (Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)\n\nJust four years ago, Marco Rubio was gearing up to run for president with an inclusive and sunny message designed to capture the imagination of a modernizing Republican Party \u2014 and maybe even the country.\n\nThose days, and that candidate, are long gone.\n\nLike many Republicans, the second-term Florida senator has sounded more and more like President Trump since the 2016 election \u2014 striking a notably darker and foreboding tone while adopting some of Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn political tactics and controversial positions.\n\nSince the Nov. 6 midterm elections, Rubio has stood on the front lines of the partisan war here in Florida over his state\u2019s recount, storming social media with criticism of Democrats and seizing on incomplete information to raise doubts about the intentions of elections officials. He also penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed declaring that \u201cTrump Is Right About Nationalism,\u201d embracing a term fraught with racial and historical baggage, though he argued it is not about ethnicity.\n\n\u201cI do think he\u2019s evolving,\u201d said Brian Ballard, a Rubio associate and Republican donor in Florida. \u201cI have noticed his tweets are much more in-your-face.\u201d\n\nHis latest transformation has revived criticism among some Republicans that Rubio is a politician without a core \u2014 a shape-shifter who has bounced from tea party insurgent to sunny moderate to Trump acolyte with little compunction.\n\n\n\nRubio greets President Trump with Hialeah, Fla., Mayor Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, left, and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R) in Miami in April. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\n\u201cRubio is a survivor who constantly reassesses the political environment,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a donor to Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), who sealed his victory in the Senate race Sunday when Sen. Bill Nelson (D) conceded defeat at the conclusion of a manual recount.\n\nRubio has been at the center of other moments when the GOP reset itself. He won his Senate seat in 2010, after defeating an establishment Republican in the tea party wave. Then in 2013, he shifted to a moderate posture by helping lead a failed push to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. He has since distanced himself from that compromise while adopting a harsher posture on border issues.\n\nNearing the halfway point of Trump\u2019s first term, other prominent Republicans have undergone a similar metamorphosis. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who once called Trump \u201ca race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d on CNN, has been become one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd departing United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who warned of deadly consequences in 2016 if Trump did not change his rhetoric, said Trump should not be blamed in the aftermath of the mass killing at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nRubio is an ambitious politician in the nation\u2019s largest swing state, where Trump and his allies have now had success in two straight elections. Former congressman Ron DeSantis (R), whose political ascent has stemmed largely from his enthusiastic support of the president, won the governor\u2019s race after a machine recount of ballots. In the Senate race, Trump encouraged Scott to run.\n\n\n\nRubio and Trump square off in a presidential debate in 2016 in Detroit. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nRubio\u2019s office declined to make him available for an interview, but people close to him offered several possible explanations for his current approach: He will not be on the ballot until 2022 and feels liberated to speak his mind; he feels that he needs to channel the message of his 2010 campaign more aggressively; and he is looking to stay relevant in a party in which Trump has won widespread support.\n\nHis relationship with Trump has improved since they were bitter rivals in the 2016 presidential primary, and they found common cause in the Florida recount. Trump took to Twitter to accuse Democrats of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election and made baseless allegations of voter fraud. Rubio jumped on board with similar arguments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in this sealed box found this morning by #BrowardSheriff. But this dysfunction in #BrowardElections is not acceptable,\u201d he tweeted four days after the election, with a photo of a crate labeled \u201cprovisional ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe box contained supplies, the county supervisor of elections said. \u201cMaybe this box found this morning has office supplies in it. But if it contains just a single vote, it should have been handled in accordance with the law, NO MATTER WHO IT WAS A VOTE FOR,\u201d Rubio tweeted later.\n\nDavid Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida, expressed concerns about the tactics Rubio, Trump and Scott have used to stoke suspicion about the electoral proceedings. \u201cI think it reflects that the party has moved to listen to darker angels not better angels,\u201d said Jolly, who recently became an independent.\n\nThree days after his tweets about the box in Broward County, Rubio used a football analogy to describe lawsuits Democrats had filed. \u201cImagine if NFL team was trailing 24-22 but in final seconds hits a 3 pt kick to win. Then AFTER game lawyers for losing team get a judge to order rules changed so that last second field goals are only 1 point,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWell that\u2019s how democrat lawyers plan to steal #Florida election.\u201d\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez, a Republican, said, \u201cHe obviously has learned that it\u2019s been effective for the president to tweet. . . . I guess imitation is the best form of flattery.\u201d\n\nAlex Conant, a former top Rubio aide, said Rubio ran his own Twitter account before he ran for president and always intended to take it back.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always believed that social media only works if it\u2019s authentic and that people can tell when a staffer takes over a politician\u2019s Twitter handle,\u201d Conant said. \u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing on Twitter is the real Rubio.\u201d\n\nRubio ran a highly scripted, tightly choreographed campaign for president \u2014 a strategy that was used against him to devastating effect. In a televised debate, GOP rival Chris Christie lambasted him for repeating an oddly phrased talking point four times during a debate \u2014 \u201clet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u201d \u2014 a moment that branded him as robotic in front of a national audience.\n\nThe Florida senator also found little success with his aspirational campaign theme. Efforts to cast himself \u2014 a child of Cuban migrants with blue-collar jobs \u2014 as the embodiment of the American Dream and a youthful voice for a new generation were drowned out by Trump\u2019s darker pitch.\n\nAfter trying to sidestep Trump, Rubio finally engaged him late in the campaign, calling him a \u201ccon man\u201d and lobbing personal attacks he later said he regretted and were embarrassing to his daughters. As it became clear his campaign was on its last legs, Rubio said it was \u201cgetting harder every day\u201d to commit to supporting the GOP nominee. Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly and devastatingly referred to him as \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship shifted after Trump became president. They worked together on a new Cuba policy. Rubio found common ground with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, on family leave. Donald Trump Jr. frequently retweeted the senator during the recount.\n\nAnother shift is Rubio\u2019s suddenly warmer relationship with Scott following past tensions between their camps, which flared up earlier this year. After the election, Rubio jumped at the chance to get involved on Scott\u2019s behalf, joining a call with reporters hosted by the Scott campaign. Asked whether Scott should use his powers as governor to remove Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, a controversial Democrat, Rubio replied, \u201cI certainly think that once this is all done, she\u2019s certainly a candidate for removal.\u201d Snipes resigned Sunday.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhether that will happen while Gov. Scott\u2019s in office or not, obviously that\u2019s not my determination to make.\u201d A Scott lawyer quickly followed up by adding that the governor was not considering removing her.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a 180,\u201d said Eberhart, the Scott donor. \u201cThere was a lot more distance between them a year ago.\u201d\n\nRubio has broken with Trump on some occasions, but there have been limits to his willingness to stray.\n\nAt the start of Trump\u2019s presidency, Rubio expressed reservations about his pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Ultimately, however, he voted for Tillerson.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Rubio emerged as one of the most vocal Republican critics of Trump\u2019s policies on China.\n\nBut even his opposition to the president on that issue served as an acknowledgment of how Trump had defined the terms of political combat. In May, Rubio used a twist on a Trumpian turn of phrase to attract attention to his critique.\n\n\u201cThis is #NotWinning,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBeth Reinhard in Lauderhill, Fla., contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Policeman accused of killing 3 at party in East Timor", "description": "Scores of people have demonstrated in East Timor's capital to protest the killing of three people at a party, allegedly by a drunken policeman", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/policeman-accused-of-killing-3-at-party-in-east-timor/2018/11/19/c2177c94-ebe9-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:56:26Z", "content": "DILI, East Timor Scores of people have demonstrated in East Timors capital to protest the killing of three people at a party, allegedly by a drunken policeman.

(AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus)\n\nIT'S ALMOST THANKSGIVING: Which raises the question \u2014 will President Trump finally visit U.S. troops deployed to a combat zone? It's been two years since Trump took office, and he has yet to make a trip to Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq.\n\nHistorically, presidential trips to visit U.S. troops in combat zones have been \u201ca bipartisan practice going back to World War II.\u201d Bush 41 and Bush 43 both paid visits to troops overseas during the holiday.\n\nPress coverage: At the time, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN the surprise trip by W. to Baghdad on Nov. 27, 2003 for Thanksgiving dinner was \u201ca perfectly executed plan\u201d that would be \u201cone of the major moments in his biography.\u201d In addition to signaling respect, gratitude and \u201ca gesture of genuine concern,\u201d a visit from the president to an active war zone would be likely to garner similarly positive press coverage.\n\nAt the time, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN the surprise trip by W. to Baghdad on Nov. 27, 2003 for Thanksgiving dinner was \u201ca perfectly executed plan\u201d that would be \u201cone of the major moments in his biography.\u201d In addition to signaling respect, gratitude and \u201ca gesture of genuine concern,\u201d a visit from the president to an active war zone would be likely to garner similarly positive press coverage. Last year, Trump retreated to Mar-a-Lago, the \u201cWinter White House,\u201d where he fired off boastful tweets and video-chatted with troops stationed all around the world. He then went to hand out sandwiches at a Coast Guard station nearby.\n\nTrump retreated to Mar-a-Lago, the \u201cWinter White House,\u201d where he fired off boastful tweets and video-chatted with troops stationed all around the world. He then went to hand out sandwiches at a Coast Guard station nearby. Meanwhile, Vice President Pence could be found at Naval Air Station Meridian in Mississippi where he spent Thanksgiving with his son Michael (a Marine aviator in training). Pence made a surprise visit to Afghanistan in December of 2017.\n\nWhy? Earlier in October during an interview with the Associated Press, this is what Trump had to say about not yet visiting a military base in a combat zone:\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, I will do that at some point, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly necessary. I\u2019ve been very busy with everything that\u2019s taking place here. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country . . . I\u2019m doing a lot of things. But it\u2019s something I\u2019d do. And do gladly. Nobody has been better at the military. Hey, I just got them a pay raise. I haven\u2019t had a pay raise in 11 years . . . I just got them new equipment. They have stuff that was so old that the grandfathers used to fly it. I have done more for the military than any president in many, many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I will do that at some point, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overly necessary.

I just got them new equipment. They have stuff that was so old that the grandfathers used to fly it. I have done more for the military than any president in many, many years.\u201d No validation: The New York Times reported last week that \u201cone reason [Trump] has not visited troops in war zones, according to his aides, is that he does not really want American troops there in the first place. To visit, they said, would validate mission he does not truly believe in.\u201d\n\nDirectly: Fox News's Chris Wallace asked the president head on yesterday: Why hasn't Trump visited U.S. troops serving in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years he's been in office?\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, I think you will see that happen. There are things that are being planned. We don\u2019t want to talk about it because of \u2014 obviously because of security reasons and everything else. But there are things that are planned. As you know, I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened . . . I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s been more with the military than I have, as a president . . . I\u2019ve had an unbelievable busy schedule and I will be doing it. On top of which you have these phony witch hunts. On top of which \u2014 I mean, we\u2019ve just been very busy. But I will be doing that.\u201d\n\nSouthern border: An easy enough trip for the president to pull off would visiting troops at the Southern border, which Trump deployed to protect against the caravan of Central Americans he dubbed an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen did visit troops there, however.\n\nStill: A Corpus Christi Caller-Times columnist penned an op-ed arguing troops deployed along the border deserve \u201ca thank you from Trump and a straight explanation of why they are spending the holiday away from their loved ones.\u201d\n\nA Corpus Christi Caller-Times columnist penned an op-ed arguing troops deployed along the border deserve \u201ca thank you from Trump and a straight explanation of why they are spending the holiday away from their loved ones.\u201d Reminder: 5,800 troops have been deployed along the southern border to defend against the migrant caravan, which began arriving a few days ago in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\n5,800 troops have been deployed along the southern border to defend against the migrant caravan, which began arriving a few days ago in Tijuana, Mexico. The White House did not respond to Power Up's request for comment regarding Trump's plans for Thanksgiving, and when he intends to visit troops. (Although, security measures would largely prohibit the White House from commenting on that anyway.)\n\nIt's not just Thanksgiving: Trump also just skipped a trip during his recent visit to France to the cemetery where 2,000 American soldiers killed during the Battle of Belleau Wood during World War I are buried. And he also opted out of a visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day (Trump told Wallace on Sunday he should have \u201cin retrospect\u201d made the trip, a 3-mile drive from the White House.)\n\n'My military': The NYT points out while Trump has \u201cembraced the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as 'my military' and 'my generals' and has posted on Twitter that under his leadership, [he] has not fully grasped the role of the troops he commands, nor the responsibility that he has to lead them and protect them from politics,\u201d according to top Defense Department officials.\n\nThe NYT points out while Trump has \u201cembraced the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as 'my military' and 'my generals' and has posted on Twitter that under his leadership, [he] has not fully grasped the role of the troops he commands, nor the responsibility that he has to lead them and protect them from politics,\u201d according to top Defense Department officials.

Flournoy, a former [Obama] undersecretary of defense who turned down a chance at the No. 2 job at the department under Mr. Trump. \u201cBut I think a lot of military people are deeply disturbed by the degree of partisanship and division.\u201d\n\nTo add insult to injury: Trump also went after retired Admiral William H. McRaven yesterday on Fox. He said the four-star admiral battling chronic lymphocytic leukemia should have caught \u201cOsama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\u201d He also called him a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer.\u201d The Post confirmed a statement McRaven gave to CNN saying he didn't back anyone during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTakeaway: Trump's approval ratings among the troops are slipping. A poll conducted by the Military Times last month showed that the president's \u201capproval rating among active-duty military personnel has slipped over the last two years, leaving today\u2019s troops evenly split over whether they\u2019re happy with the commander in chief\u2019s job performance\u201d.\n\nThanksgiving surprise? Trump said he \u201cvery easily\u201d answered written questions from special counsel Robert Mueller and someone close to the investigation said they could be turned over before the holiday, per colleagues Carol D. Leonnig and Josh Dawsey.\n\nUp now: Support for Trump among troops is slipping, and the armed forces are now evenly divided over whether they approve of his presidency.

A 19-year-old cross-country runner for Canisius College in Buffalo, the sophomore looked down in horror. She was getting disavowed by her mother for being a lesbian.\n\nHer mother had found photos on social media of Scheck with the woman she is dating and was apoplectic. Scheck had not come out to her parents, as she feared they wouldn\u2019t accept her sexual orientation, according to the Griffin, the Canisius student newspaper. As first reported by the LGBT sports website Outsports, Scheck was allegedly faced with an ultimatum from her family: Leave school, give up her partial scholarship and return home to Webster, N.Y., to go through therapy for her sexual orientation, or she would be cut out from their lives for good.\n\nWhen she indicated to her parents that she was staying at Canisius and had no interest in therapy, her father drove 85 miles to drop off her belongings: clothing, stuffed animals, trophies and even her birth certificate. He reportedly dumped her things in her car and proceeded to remove the license plates from her vehicle. The family had already removed her from their car insurance plan, according to Outsports.\n\n\u201cWell, I am done with you,\u201d Scheck\u2019s mom texted her daughter, the Buffalo News reported. \u201cAs of right now, declare yourself independent.

Me too.\u201d\n\nWhen a roommate launched a GoFundMe campaign this month to raise money for Scheck to eat, live and buy books for the semester, the fundraiser generated tens of thousands of dollars in days. As of early Monday, the campaign, which had an original goal of $5,000, had raised more than $58,000 since Nov. 7.\n\nBut the 19-year-old was faced with another ultimatum last week. This time, it was from the NCAA: Give back the online donations or keep the money and lose her eligibility for college athletics. She felt she had no choice but to give up her eligibility.\n\nOn Friday, the NCAA, which has long fought against active student-athletes receiving any outside financial contributions, relented, with a rare reversal in its position: Not only could Scheck keep the donations, but she could also maintain her eligibility.\n\nEmily Scheck can retain her eligibility and continue to receive GoFundMe donations that assist her with living and educational expenses. pic.twitter.com/jut5EjPLnU \u2014 Inside the NCAA (@InsidetheNCAA) November 16, 2018\n\nThe weeks that followed her family\u2019s actions were rough. Unable to buy books, she had to borrow them from friends to study. Without license plates, her friends had to figure out where she could park without getting towed. And figuring out how she\u2019d eat was a daily struggle.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even get groceries, initially,\u201d she told the News. \u201cI was just really relying on my roommates and my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nShe told her coaches of the situation, Outsports reported, but months went by without a firm plan for how Scheck was going to find housing and money for food to survive. That\u2019s when Grace Hausladen, one of her roommates and teammates, launched a GoFundMe campaign in hopes of getting financial support for her friend. Hausladen knew there was some recent precedent for successful campaigns based on college athletes in difficult life situations. She pointed to the head injury suffered by Tennessee State football player Christion Abercrombie in September, and the NCAA later approving one of the GoFundMe accounts set up for his medical fees, the Griffin reported.\n\n\u201cShe was kicked out of her home for being herself,\u201d Hausladen wrote. \u201cNo one deserves to have their home and siblings taken away from them for being their true selves.

(Facebook)\n\nThe success of the campaign got the attention of the NCAA and Canisius, which led to the choice of either giving back the money or losing her eligibility. It was a choice also given to Hausladen, the creator of the GoFundMe. By last week, Scheck\u2019s story had been shared across social media, with people both encouraging her to remain positive and pressuring the NCAA and school to rule in her favor. The public support apparently paid off.\n\n\u201cCanisius and the NCAA will continue to work together in support of Emily,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cShe is a member of the Canisius family and we will to do whatever we can to assist her.\u201d\n\nEven with the ruling that Scheck is allowed to keep the funding, the runner\u2019s relationship with her family remains strained.\n\n\u201cAs long as I stay in Buffalo and I don\u2019t come home, they\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m still on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nHer father, Timothy, told the News that there is more to the story than his daughter is publicly sharing, and that the family accepts her coming out.

Wickremesinghe has said he still has the support of a majority in Parliament.\n\nM.A. Sumanthiran, another lawmaker opposed to Rajapaksa, said Monday\u2019s motion was presented by a group of 122 lawmakers. He said it is a \u201ctoken of the powers the Parliament can exercise when the group claiming to be the government does not have the majority in Parliament and refuses to bow to a no vote.\u201d\n\nThe motion was presented a day after a meeting among political party leaders failed to reach a breakthrough to resolve the crisis.\n\nBoth Rajapaksa and Sirisena have refused to accept the results of the no-confidence motions, saying proper procedures were not followed.\n\nRajapaksa has said the vote should not have been done by voice. He also insisted the speaker had no authority to remove him and said he is continuing in his role as prime minister. Lawmakers opposed to Rajapaksa have said his government is illegal.\n\nParliament turned violent when the no-confidence motions were taken up last week, with rival lawmakers exchanging blows. On Friday, lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chairs and chili powder mixed with water to try to block the proceedings.\n\nRajapaksa is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.

They also said they suspect Magnitsky\u2019s death in prison was a poisoning and said they have a \u201ctheory\u201d Browder is behind the poisoning. (Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 Russian prosecutors announced new criminal charges against U.S.-born Kremlin foe Bill Browder on Monday, days before a Russian police officer could become president of Interpol in a move that some Moscow critics fear might politicize the law enforcement agency.\n\nBrowder and other opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin have complained that Russia has tried to use Interpol against them. If a Russian is elected as its new president, it could encourage Moscow to intensify attempts to hunt down its critics abroad.\n\nThe new charges leveled against Browder accuse him of forming a criminal group to embezzle funds in Russia. They also alleged that he could be behind the death of his employee, Sergei Magnitsky, in a Russian prison.\n\nMagnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who alleged he had uncovered $230 million in tax fraud by Russian officials, died in 2009 while in pre-trial detention. A Russian presidential commission concluded he had been beaten and denied medical care, and two prison doctors were charged with negligence leading to his death; one was acquitted and the other went free because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nBrowder mounted an international campaign to bring Magnitsky\u2019s killers to justice, and in 2012, the U.S. Congress passed the Magnitsky Act that imposed travel and financial sanctions on top Russian officials, including prosecutors. Several other countries have since adopted similar legislation.\n\nBrowder, who had owned a major investment fund in Russia before he was barred entry to the country, was convicted in absentia in Russia on charges of tax evasion and funneling money overseas in both 2013 and again last year, and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nOn Monday, Mikhail Alexandrov of the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office told reporters that they have opened a criminal case into the poisoning of three people described as associates of Browder, saying it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Magnitsky was poisoned as well with the same military-grade substance.\n\nBrowder has blamed Russian prison officials for Magnitsky\u2019s death and dismissed the new charges against him as a sham. He told The Associated Press that he has no relation to the three men named by the prosecutors and described the accusations of poisoning as an attempt to discredit his campaign for justice for Magnitsky.\n\nPutin\u2019s \u201creaction is so absurd that it only helps our campaign and our cause,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian prosecutors said they decided to pursue the new charges against Browder after reviewing evidence submitted by Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and members of his father\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and who lobbied for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act. That meeting at Trump Tower occurred in June 2016 after the younger Trump was told by an intermediary that she represented the Russian government and was offering Moscow\u2019s help defeating Hillary Clinton. Emails later released by Trump Jr. show that she had been described as a \u201cRussian government attorney.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the new charges against Browder comes as the Netherlands is preparing to host diplomats from all European Union member states to discuss a pan-EU Magnitsky Act.\n\nBut the charges also come two days before Interpol\u2019s general assembly, meeting in Dubai, is expected to elect its new president, and one of the front-runners is Alexander Prokopchuk, who holds the rank of general in the Interior Ministry, which runs the police force. The officer had headed Interpol\u2019s Russian bureau before taking the job of Interpol\u2019s vice president in 2016.\n\nPutin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters Monday that the Kremlin is \u201crooting for the Russian candidate and we would like the Russian candidate to win this election.\u201d\n\nInterpol works as a clearinghouse for national police services that are hunting down suspects outside their borders, issuing \u201cred notices,\u201d or alerts that identify a person wanted by another country.\n\nWhile its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, the organization has faced criticism that governments have abused the \u201cred notice\u201d system to go after political enemies and dissidents.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice\u2019s compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nBrowder noted the timing of the announcement of the new charges against him and the Interpol election, tweeting: \u201cOn the eve of Interpol deciding whether a Russian official should be president of Interpol, the Russian prosecutor\u2019s office holds a huge press conference about me and how they will chase me down anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nAt the news conference, prosecutors said they will be placing Browder on Interpol\u2019s wanted list and they expect its cooperation.\n\nRussia has previously tried to get Browder placed on the wanted list, but the body has rejected the efforts, viewing his prosecution as politically motivated. He was briefly detained in Spain in May but released after police found that the arrest warrant for him was no longer valid.\n\nBrowder said Prokopchuk\u2019s possible appointment \u201cputs the organization in a grave danger of being fully discredited.\u201d\n\nOther Kremlin critics also have raised alarm about the possible politicization of Interpol.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has faced a flurry of detentions and criminal charges, tweeted Monday that his associates \u201chave suffered abuse\u201d from Interpol officials who were complying with Russian warrants to persecute Kremlin opponents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that a president from Russia will help to reduce such violations,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nSimilar concerns surfaced when the previous Interpol president, Meng Hongwei, was named because he was a senior security official in the Chinese government. China has also been accused of trying to use Interpol for political ends. Meng is now detained in China as part of a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials.\n\nAsked about the upcoming vote at Interpol in connection with the Browder case, Prosecutor General\u2019s Office spokesman Alexander Kurennoy told reporters that Moscow views the organization as \u201ctrusted partners\u201d and expressed hope that \u201cthe procedures will be followed in a regular manner\u201d when it submits an arrest warrant for Browder.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump\u2019s visit in the closing weeks to a district near Erie was seen by Democrats as a key boost for Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who won reelection over a moderate Democratic challenger. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAs the final votes from the midterm elections rolled in last week, it became clear that President Trump\u2019s near-constant campaign presence helped transform the American political map \u2014 effectively erasing lighter shades of red and blue.\n\nThe Trump effect now sets the stage for an intensely tribal 2020 showdown over his reelection, with a smaller and heavily rural Republican Party facing off against a growing Democratic coalition of suburban and urban residents in higher-income states.\n\nThis dynamic will play out as Trump inevitably remains the dominant issue in nearly every facet of American politics, at once electrifying and polarizing, and constantly needling his friends and foes to react to his unpredictable moves and blistering Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cTrump just overwhelms and takes all of the oxygen out of the room, and it\u2019s all focused on him,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a critic of the president who declined to run for reelection.\n\n\u201cRepublican primary voters, that subset of a subset, that\u2019s Trump\u2019s party,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019ll continue to be like this and be exaggerated in 2020 because they\u2019ll draw even more turnout on the other side.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s influence over the midterms was apparent almost immediately after he took over the electoral spotlight within the final month with a barrage of rallies laced with anti-immigrant rhetoric and falsehoods. Voters who had been absent all cycle suddenly tuned in with interest.\n\n[Trump ratchets up racially divisive messages in a bid to rally support in the midterms]\n\nRepublicans in rural parts of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee were newly excited about the election, according to Democratic polling in those races, increasingly favorable toward the president and cheered by the recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. In suburban, wealthier parts of the country such as Northern Virginia, the opposite was happening, as moderates recoiled.\n\n\u201cSame president, same message,\u201d said Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who was working for candidates in rural and suburban areas. \u201cHe sort of polarized the choices.\u201d\n\nStrategists from both parties say the president, in effect, erected a wall that broke the blue wave, allowing Republicans to hold on to key House seats and defeat Democratic Senate incumbents in conservative Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. The same strategy, however, empowered Democrats to win decisive victories in formerly Republican suburbs in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, California and otherwise reliably red Texas.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do those stops, we would definitely not have control of the Senate,\u201d Trump boasted in an interview last week with the Daily Caller, a conservative website. \u201cNobody has ever had a greater impact.\u201d\n\nTrump emerged in firm control of a Republican Party with an expanded majority in the U.S. Senate and a viable path to reelection, if he can hold on to his past support in Florida and the industrial Midwestern states that nonetheless elected Democrats statewide this year.\n\nBut that is little consolation for the parts of his party that were sacrificed in the process.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult to try to make a case \u2014 particularly to suburban, college-educated women who were so upset with the president \u2014 to vote for me when they felt there needed to be a greater check on his power,\u201d said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), who lost his suburban Denver district by more than 11 points after winning by eight points in 2016.\n\n[The GOP\u2019s deficit with suburban women starts at the White House]\n\nWhat was bad for Republicans in tony professional neighborhoods was good for the party in more rural parts of the country. Trump\u2019s visit in the closing weeks to a district near Erie, Pa., for example, was seen by Democrats as a key boost for Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who won reelection over a moderate Democratic challenger.\n\n\u201cWhat was made clear by this election is that Trump\u2019s supporters in places like this are going to continue to support him because they feel they have been left behind,\u201d said Tony Coppola, who managed Ron DiNicola\u2019s losing campaign in that district.\n\nAssessing the on-the-ground impact of Trump\u2019s personal appearances is difficult.\n\nTwo 11th-hour rallies in conservative bastions of southwest Florida and the Panhandle appear to have helped pull Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis and Sen.-elect Rick Scott across the finish line. But appearances in West Virginia and Montana were not enough to topple the Democratic incumbents in those heavily pro-Trump states.\n\nAnd political strategists in both parties say Trump\u2019s rhetoric, particularly concerning the refu\u00adgee caravan, contributed to GOP defeats in Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThese limits are likely to constrain the party going forward.\n\n\u201cThe states where we saw the most success with the rallies were states where he won by 20 points or 30 points or 40 points,\u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) who oversaw the GOP\u2019s Senate effort this cycle and is expected to face a difficult reelection race in 2020.\n\nOne clear example of the dynamic came in rural Kentucky, where Democrat Amy McGrath, a well-funded former Marine pilot, tried to run beyond her party\u2019s national brand among voters, in part by opening 19 field offices in the district.\n\nAt a rally there in October, Trump criticized her, calling McGrath an \u201cextreme liberal, chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters \u2014 that\u2019s a real beauty \u2014 and the angry Democrat mob\u201d \u2014 even though McGrath had defeated another candidate favored by the Democratic Party in the primary.\n\nThe final internal McGrath campaign poll showed Trump\u2019s approval increasing in the district over the course of October, along with the share of the electorate who considered the confirmation of Kavanaugh important. On Election Day, McGrath\u2019s Republican opponent, Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr, posted better numbers in the rural southeastern parts of the state than McGrath\u2019s team had expected, Yang said.\n\nThat rural turnout matched by Democratic enthusiasm in cities and suburbs drove nationwide voting to the highest levels for midterm elections since 1914, before women were guaranteed a right to vote under the 19th Amendment, according to Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who studies historical voting patterns.\n\n\u201cThe major story is that Trump has clearly created an engaged electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I look forward to what is going to happen in 2020, unless conditions change, we are probably looking at one of the highest-turnout elections in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n[Turnout was high for a midterm and even rivaled a presidential election]\n\nWhile Trump was able to galvanize his base, Trump\u2019s effect on his opponents was even more pronounced nationally. A voter file analysis by the left-leaning firm Catalist shows that the same anti-Trump enthusiasm that led to a massive Democratic fundraising advantage and strong candidate recruitment, also showed up at the polls, with the overall share of nonwhite voters rising about three points this cycle compared with 2014.\n\nNetwork exit polls gathered from CNN found shifts in how key parts of the electorate voted compared with 2016. Nearly 6 in 10 white, college-educated women voted for a Democratic House candidate, an eight-point increase from the 51 percent that supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. Young people also moved, with 67 percent of voters under age 30 supporting a Democrat in the House, compared with 55 percent who supported Clinton.\n\nJoel Benenson, the pollster for both of President Barack Obama\u2019s national campaigns, said the election results call to mind the old political maxim that a politician\u2019s greatest strength can also be a weakness, with a backlash growing against the very attributes that allowed Trump to win in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou have to realize that Trump may be punching himself out,\u201d Benenson said.\n\nThere were regional shifts, as well, that could affect the 2020 landscape. Republicans performed much worse in states along the southwest border and in western states such as Montana and Colorado.\n\n\u201cIn the places we lost, he remains enormously popular. But there are fewer of those places now,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).\n\nIn Colorado, a historic number of voters unaffiliated with either of the main political parties turned in ballots. Of that group, which was larger than the number of Republican or Democratic voters, the overwhelming majority voted Democratic, according to a post-election poll by Magellan Strategies, a Republican firm.\n\nFewer than 1 in 4 unaffiliated voters in the state said they expected to support Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nIn Georgia, the diverging energies of voters showed up in the contrast between statewide results and the fortunes of suburban Republicans in Congress. Rep. Karen Handel (R) lost the suburban seat she had won in a special election in 2017. Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux is seeking a recount in her race against Rep. Rob Woodall (R), who won by less than 0.5 percent in his district outside Atlanta. Two years earlier, he had won by 20 points. At the same time, Republican Brian Kemp won the gubernatorial race behind strong support from the state\u2019s rural areas.\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Trump ally, defended the president and said the Democrats deserve more credit for how they ran campaigns, including in Georgia, where Handel was defeated in the Atlanta suburbs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Republicans did a good enough job of telling America what the reality really is,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cHealth care was a bigger issue in the suburbs than President Trump.\u201d\n\nAmong many congressional Republicans, the election aftermath brought a bleak and rattled aura as they grappled with the loss of the House majority and the seemingly unmovable presence of Trump in their political lives and fortunes.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), who served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee this year, offered only a few vague statements when asked whether Trump was a boost or burden for his party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not focused on looking backward, I\u2019m looking forward,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump will lift the GOP in the suburbs in the run-up to the 2020 elections, Stivers demurred again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president, and I think he\u2019s going to be the president,\u201d he said.\n\nStivers was then asked whether he was implying that the answer to the question \u201cis not \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d he said with a slight chuckle as he quickly walked away."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Anti-vaccination stronghold in NC hit with state's worst chickenpox outbreak in 2 decades - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Anti-vaccination stronghold in NC hit with state's worst chickenpox outbreak in 2 decades Washington Post Chickenpox has taken hold of a school in North Carolina where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines.

(iStock) (Mixmike/iStock)\n\nChickenpox has taken hold of a school in North Carolina where many families claim religious exemption from vaccines.\n\nCases of chickenpox have been multiplying at the Asheville Waldorf School, which serves children from nursery school to sixth grade in Asheville, N.C. About a dozen infections grew to 28 at the beginning of the month. By Friday, there were 36, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\nThe outbreak ranks as the state\u2019s worst since the chickenpox vaccine became available more than 20 years ago. Since then, the two-dose course has succeeded in limiting the highly contagious disease that once affected 90 percent of Americans \u2014 a public health breakthrough.\n\nThe school is a symbol of the small but strong movement against the most effective means of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The percentage of children under 2 years old who haven\u2019t received any vaccinations has quadrupled since 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLike the Disneyland measles outbreak in 2015, the flare-up demonstrates the real-life consequences of a shadowy debate fueled by junk science and fomented by the same sort of Twitter bots and trolls that spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election. And it shows how a seemingly fringe view can gain currency in a place like Asheville, a funky, year-round resort town nestled between the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\u201cThe school follows immunization requirements put in place by the state board of education, but also recognizes that a parent\u2019s decision to immunize their children happens before they enter school,\u201d the school explained in a statement to Blue Ridge Public Radio.\n\nJennifer Mullendore, the medical director of Buncombe County, N.C., was unambiguous: \u201cWe want to be clear: Vaccination is the best protection from chickenpox.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we see high numbers of unimmunized children and adults, we know that an illness like chickenpox can spread easily throughout the community \u2014 into our playgrounds, grocery stores, and sports teams,\u201d she said in a news release.\n\nBut not all parents seemed to grasp the gravity of the outbreak. Nor does everyone see the rationale behind vaccines, which some believe \u2014 contrary to scientific evidence \u2014 cause more severe health issues than they\u2019re meant to cure. The claim of an autism risk, though it has been debunked, has remained a rallying cry of the anti-vaccine movement.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with chickenpox?\u201d one city resident, Amy Gordon, told the Citizen-Times.\n\nChickenpox is serious, warns the CDC, \u201ceven life-threatening, especially in babies, adolescents, adults, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.\u201d\n\nA person can spread the disease one to two days before the rash appears, increasing the risk of broad transmission of the virus before it is detected.\n\nThat was before a two-dose vaccination program was introduced in the United States in 1995.\n\nThe virus used to crop up in about 4 million cases annually in the United States, causing more than 10,000 hospitalizations and between 100 and 150 deaths. Children were especially susceptible, as schools seemed to incubate the blisterlike rash, which appears first on the stomach, back and face and can extend over the entire surface of the body, creating as many as 500 itchy blisters.\n\nThe vaccine, which the CDC says is about 90 percent effective, hasn\u2019t eliminated the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. But since the regimen became commercially available, it has reduced the number of cases, as well as their severity. A 14-year prospective study published in Pediatrics in 2013 found that the incidence of infection was nine- to 10-times lower than in the pre-vaccine era.\n\nStill, the vaccine\u2019s clearly documented merits remain unconvincing to some. Asheville Waldorf has one of the highest religious vaccination exemption rates in the state, according to data maintained by the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe private school has a higher rate of exemption on religious grounds than all but two other North Carolina schools, the Citizen-Times reported. During the 2017-18 school year, 19 of 28 kindergartners were exempt from at least one vaccine required by the state. Of the school\u2019s 152 students, 110 had not received the chickenpox vaccine, the newspaper reported.\n\nNorth Carolina requires all students in the state to receive certain immunizations. Among the vaccines required for kindergarten-aged children are two doses for chickenpox, two for measles and two for mumps. Seventh graders must again submit to immunization.\n\nBut the state also permits exemptions based on the advice of a physician \u2014 as well as on religious grounds.\n\n\u201cIf the bona fide religious beliefs of an adult or the parent, guardian or person in loco parentis of a child are contrary to the immunization requirements contained in this Part, the adult or the child shall be exempt from the requirements,\u201d state statute allows.\n\nRecent efforts to tighten the rules have foundered. In 2015, state legislators withdrew a bill that would have all but eliminated the religious exemption after their efforts were met with strident protest. Protesters picketed the state\u2019s General Assembly in Raleigh, warning of \u201cMedical Terrorism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the county\u2019s medical director has been exhorting residents to immunize their children. \u201cWhat happens when we lack community immunity? Measles is what happens,\u201d Mullendore this fall told commissioners of the county, which had the highest rate of religious exemptions last year.\n\nThe friction between medical experts and the residents in their care is not unique to Buncombe County, where the parents of 5.7 percent of kindergartners claimed a religious exemption, or even to North Carolina, where the rate was 1.2 percent.\n\nForty-seven states allow religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. CDC data shows that the median percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from one or more required vaccine was highest in Oregon.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nWhite House tells Acosta his press pass will be suspended again when order expires, CNN says\n\nA look at Trump\u2019s \u2018A-plus\u2019 weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure\u2019 Calif., and Adam \u2018Schitt\u2019\n\nNCAA relents: Lesbian college athlete, disowned by parents, can get outside help"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "A look at Trump's 'A-plus' weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure' Calif., and Adam 'Schitt' - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post A look at Trump's 'A-plus' weekend: Finnish leaf-raking, 'Pleasure' Calif., and Adam 'Schitt' Washington Post Asked how he would grade his presidency during a Sunday morning interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, President Trump offered onl\u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/19/look-trumps-a-plus-weekend-finnish-leaf-raking-pleasure-calif-adam-schitt/", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Crb8IPWUM9nMAzhgrl_5hA5ec5c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6JAAQ5HLXMI6RC2HXUEXL7LBTE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:33:43Z", "content": "Asked how he would grade his presidency during a Sunday morning interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, President Trump offered only the smallest amount of hesitation before giving himself top marks.

Can I go higher than that?\u201d\n\nOthers might disagree with his self-assessment. This weekend, Trump managed to insult a venerated military veteran, mangled the name of a wildfire-scarred town that he had just left, confused the president of Finland by making strange comments about leaf raking and, like a grade-schooler, attempted to taunt a critic in Congress with a naughty play on his name. All in just 48 hours.\n\nThe weekend kicked off with Trump\u2019s bizarre comments about raking leaves. Touring California communities that have been decimated by the deadliest fires in the state\u2019s history, Trump told reporters on Saturday that he had recently been talking to the president of Finland. \u201cHe called it a forest nation,\u201d Trump said, referring to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, \u201cand they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don\u2019t have any problem.\"\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Avi Selk pointed out, Trump had made similar remarks on Friday before his California trip, telling Fox News Sunday: \u201cI was watching the firemen the other day, and they were raking areas. They were raking areas! They\u2019re raking trees, little trees like this \u2014 nut trees, little bushes, that you could see are totally dry. Weeds! And they\u2019re raking them. They\u2019re on fire.\u201d\n\nThe remarks provoked a fair amount of head-scratching, as Finland\u2019s forestry-management practices are not ordinarily considered germane to the issue of wildfire suppression in the arid West. Niinisto was no less baffled: While he had discussed forest management with Trump, he told the Associated Press, leaf raking had not entered the conversation. Meanwhile, bemused Finns clarified that they didn\u2019t actually spend their spare time raking up leaves in the nation\u2019s forests, and responded with a hashtag: #MakeAmericaRakeAgain. Some posted humorous photos of their rakes.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Rick Noack reported, experts believe there may be \u201ctoo few\u201d fires in Finland, which maintains one of the world\u2019s most successful wildfire strategies thanks to controlled burns of the forest floors.\n\n[Why Finland is so good at handling forest fires. Hint: it\u2019s not because of raking.]\n\nIn California, Trump seemed unsure of the name of the place he traveled across the country to visit. Trump twice referred to Paradise, Calif., which has seen some of the worst devastation from the fires, as \u201cPleasure\u201d during a Saturday news conference.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re watching from New York or you are watching from Washington, D.C., you don\u2019t really see the gravity of it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAs big as they look on the tube, you don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on until you come here. And what we saw at Pleasure, what a name right now. But we just saw, we just left Pleasure \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cParadise,\u201d interjected a slew of officials.\n\n\u201cParadise,\u201d Trump confirmed, then moved on.\n\nThe error, some critics argued, demonstrated a lack of interest in the natural disaster. \u201cHe does not have the decency to even know the name of the town,\u201d said one tweet that was shared over 4,500 times.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump visits a neighborhood hit by the Woolsey Fire on Nov. 17 in Malibu, Calif. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThat was Saturday. On Sunday, Trump went from confused to contentious. During the same Fox News interview in which he gave himself an A-plus as president, he went after retired admiral William H. McRaven, dismissing the former Navy SEAL as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer.\u201d He also suggested that McRaven didn\u2019t work hard enough to catch Osama bin Laden.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d Trump said of McRaven, who led the 2011 operation that killed bin Laden. \u201cYou know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan, in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer, but living in Pakistan right next to the military academy. Everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\"\n\nMcRaven had previously criticized Trump in an op-ed in The Post, writing that Trump\u2019s actions had \u201cembarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\u201d He responded to the president\u2019s attacks on Sunday by clarifying that he had not backed any candidate in the 2016 election and saying that he had been a fan of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both of the presidents he served under.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments second-guessing the timing of the raid at bin Laden\u2019s compound, wrote The Post\u2019s Paul Sonne and Philip Rucker, \u201crisked alienating parts of the military community.\u201d To make matters worse, they came just days after Trump skipped a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of World War I because of rain and then failed to visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day.\n\n\u201cI should have done that,\u201d he told Wallace in a rare moment of self-second-guessing after the host pressed him. \u201cI was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling, as you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably, you know, in retrospect I should have, and I did last year,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night, and I had just left, literally, the American cemetery in Paris, and I really probably assumed that was fine, and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things.\u201d\n\nFinally, capping off the weekend, Trump blasted out a Sunday afternoon tweet mocking Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who had appeared on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d and criticized the appointment of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d Trump wrote. (Special counsels do not require Senate approval.)\n\nThe White House has not clarified whether the misspelling of Schiff\u2019s last name was deliberate. \u201cThe office of first lady Melania Trump, who has championed anti-cyberbullying efforts through her Be Best initiative, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment,\u201d noted Politico.\n\nCommentators weren\u2019t sure if they were looking at a typo or an insult. \u201cThat awkward moment when the President refers to a member of Congress as \u2018Adam Schitt\u2019 and no one can figure out if it\u2019s because the President is horrible or just illiterate,\u201d snarked Bill Palmer of the liberal Palmer Report.\n\nJust after the president talked about the need for \"decorum\" in the White House, he calls a member of Congress \"Adam Schitt.\" \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) November 18, 2018\n\nIf Trump was trying to turn Schiff\u2019s last name into a derogatory nickname, he wouldn\u2019t be the first person to do so. Before the president\u2019s tweet, Trump supporters have repeatedly referred to the congressman, who is expected to be the next chair of the House Intelligence Committee, as \u201cAdam Schitt\u201d on Twitter, with the first instance dating to Dec. 12, 2016.\n\n\u201cWow, Mr. President, that\u2019s a good one,\u201d Schiff fired back. \u201cWas that like your answers to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, or did you write this one yourself?\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nWhite House tells Acosta his press pass will be suspended again when order expires, CNN says\n\nAnti-vaccination stronghold in N.C. hit with state\u2019s worst chickenpox outbreak in 2 decades\n\nNCAA relents: Lesbian college athlete, disowned by parents, can get outside help"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Turkish coast guard rescues 44 migrants stuck on island", "description": "Turkey's coast guard says it rescued 44 migrants stuck on an island after they attempted the crossing to Greece.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/turkish-coast-guard-rescues-44-migrants-stuck-on-island/2018/11/19/d820150c-ebdd-11e8-8b47-bd0975fd6199_story.html", "urlToImage": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:31:09Z", "content": "ISTANBUL Turkeys coast guard said Monday it rescued 44 migrants stuck on an island after they attempted the crossing to Greece.

Netanyahu says he will take over temporarily as defense minister as early elections still loom. (Ariel Schalit/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday survived a political showdown that had threatened to bring down his coalition and trigger early elections.\n\nNetanyahu managed to persuade Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Home Party, to drop a threat to bolt the coalition. That left his government with a thin parliamentary majority and appeared to give the prime minister at least a few more months in office.\n\nWhile Netanyahu can declare victory, the big winner of the crisis appears to be Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. Over the past week, Hamas has exposed major divisions in Israel over Gaza policy that could bring about the collapse of the governing coalition at any time.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look:\n\nCONFLICT IN GAZA\n\nIsrael and Hamas are bitter enemies who have fought three wars since the militant group seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Israel and Egypt have maintained a tight blockade on Gaza to weaken Hamas, devastating the territory\u2019s already fragile economy.\n\nSince late March, Hamas has been leading mass demonstrations along Gaza\u2019s perimeter fence in a bid to break the blockade. More than 170 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed in the weekly demonstrations. But in recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had made progress toward an unofficial cease-fire that would ease the blockade in exchange for quieting the demonstrations.\n\nThat progress was upset last week when a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza set off two days of heavy fighting in which Palestinian militant groups fired some 460 projectiles, including an anti-tank missile that struck a bus, into Israel, while the Israeli air force struck dozens of targets in Gaza.\n\nIn all, 14 Palestinians, including 12 militants, were killed, while a Palestinian laborer working in Israel was killed by a Gaza rocket.\n\n___\n\nCRISIS IN ISRAEL\n\nJust as the sides were on the brink of another war, Egyptian mediators forged a truce to end the fighting. That set off a political crisis in Israel.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had favored a much tougher response, resigned in protest. Bennett, who also wanted tougher action, said he would resign if he was not given the defense portfolio.\n\nNetanyahu on Sunday rejected Bennett\u2019s ultimatum and took over the Defense Ministry, seeming to set the stage for his coalition to collapse. But in a last-minute about-face, Bennett backed down Monday and said he would give Netanyahu a chance to deal with Israel\u2019s security challenges more firmly.\n\n___\n\nNETANYAHU\u2019S CALCULATIONS\n\nAs opposition leader a decade ago, Netanyahu vowed to take a tougher line against Hamas than his predecessor, Ehud Olmert. But since taking office in early 2009, Netanyahu has concluded that toppling Hamas would require a lengthy military operation that would cost many lives.\n\nReluctant to pay such a price, he instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nKeeping Gaza quiet benefits Netanyahu on several levels. Working-class border towns in southern Israel are considered strongholds of his ruling Likud Party. Netanyahu does not want an election at a time when his base is angry over the cease-fire.\n\nNetanyahu also has long argued that Israel has more serious security concerns on its northern front \u2014 where Iranian forces are active in neighboring Syria and Hezbollah has amassed an arsenal of well over 100,000 rockets and missiles in Lebanon.\n\nYechiel Leiter, a former chief of staff for Netanyahu, said countering Iran is the \u201challmark\u201d of the prime minister\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cGaza is not an existential threat,\u201d said Leiter, who is now a senior fellow at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think tank. \u201cIran is the overarching agenda playing behind the scenes.\u201d That was why Netanyahu did not go \u201cfull throttle\u201d against Hamas, he said.\n\n___\n\nDIVISION INSTEAD OF CONCESSIONS\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda.\n\nHamas seized control of Gaza from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007, leaving President Mahmoud Abbas only governing parts of the West Bank.\n\nBy allowing Hamas to survive, Netanyahu is deepening the territorial and political split between the West Bank and Gaza. With the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and solidify Israeli control over the territory.\n\nAbbas fears Israel and the U.S. are collaborating on a peace plan that would cement this division, falling short of his demand for an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the West Bank and Gaza under his control.\n\n___\n\nHAMAS HOLDS THE CARDS\n\nHamas has been riding high since the cease-fire. Suffering minimal casualties, it has enjoyed a boost in popularity with the Gaza public and is now working with Egyptian mediators toward expanding the cease-fire to ease the blockade. Any lift in the economy will deepen the group\u2019s rule over Gaza.\n\nIn addition, Hamas showed that while it may not be able to defeat the Israeli military, it can disrupt life throughout southern Israel and put heavy pressure on Netanyahu.\n\nAnother barrage of rockets would almost certainly cause Netanyahu\u2019s coalition to collapse or force him into a war that he doesn\u2019t want. That should give Hamas additional leverage as the cease-fire talks proceed.\n\nReuven Hazan, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said Hamas has emerged as key factor in the next Israeli election campaign. \u201cPeople in Gaza will be able to decide what issue we focus on, how much we focus on it, and whether the government is going to be looked upon favorably or not,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nA DELICATE BALANCING ACT\n\nNetanyahu will have to proceed with caution. If cease-fire talks move forward and he makes concessions to Hamas, he could face a backlash from Bennett, who can bring down the coalition and force new elections at any time.\n\nAnother coalition partner, the centrist Kulanu Party, last week urged Netanyahu to dissolve the government and hold early elections.\n\nIts leader, Moshe Kahlon, has not issued any ultimatums. But the two men are scheduled to meet later in the week, meaning Netanyahu is not out of the woods yet.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Those in the crowd furiously make wagers with each other as the battle rages.\n\nThe Muay Thai \u2014 or Thai kickboxing \u2014 competitors are as young as 8 years old.\n\nBut the tragic death of 13-year-old Anucha Tasako after being knocked out in a match earlier this month has brought into focus whether youngsters should be taking and giving such brutal punishment in the name of sports.\n\nAnucha, who fought an incredible 174 bouts in a career that started at age 8, died of a brain hemorrhage two days after his Nov. 10 fight.\n\nHardcore Muay Thai fans say his death was a fluke. They say that the referee did not stop the fight soon enough and that a doctor was not on hand, flouting the usual procedures.\n\nBut even before Anucha\u2019s death, moves were afoot to regulate the sport. Thai lawmakers recently tabled legislation to bar children under 12 from competitive boxing.\n\nLast month, a five-year study by Dr. Witaya Sungkarat of Bangkok\u2019s Ramathibodi Hospital was published that compared brain development between young boxers and children not involved with the sport.\n\nHe said the study clearly shows that boxing causes irreparable damage to a young child\u2019s developing brain, and the longer each young boxer had been fighting, the worse his condition became.\n\nThe sport\u2019s defenders says outsiders just don\u2019t understand that Muay Thai is an integral part of Thai culture. Beginning to fight at a tender age puts the youngsters on the path to a successful professional career, with the opportunity to lift their poor families up the ladder of economic success, they say.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They have to start building larger arenas in this country, right? Something is happening.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, at a campaign rally in Lebanon, Ohio, Oct. 12, 2018\n\n\u201cThe crowds at my Rallies are far bigger than they have ever been before, including the 2016 election. Never an empty seat in these large venues, many thousands of people watching screens outside. Enthusiasm & Spirit is through the roof. SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING - WATCH!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in a tweet, Oct. 15, 2018\n\n\u201cThere have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics. You\u2019ve never had crowds like this for midterm elections. There\u2019s never been crowds like this.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, at a campaign rally in Macon, Ga., Nov. 4, 2018\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd sizes, as you have probably figured out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in remarks at the White House, Oct. 23, 2018\n\nTrump has been inflating the size of his crowds since his early days as a candidate. His presidency began with a surreal national debate over how many people attended his inauguration.\n\nAnd this year, at midterm campaign rallies across the country, the president\u2019s crowd-size boasts became a big bugaboo for fact-checkers. There\u2019s no question Trump can draw supporters by the thousands, but his pumped-up numbers are so extravagant most of the time that they have little or no basis in fact.\n\nFor example, Trump claimed 50,000 people were outside a rally in Houston because they couldn\u2019t get in, but the city\u2019s police chief said the number was much lower: 3,000. In Cleveland, Trump claimed \u201cthousands\u201d of people were outside because the venue was packed. But Twitter users at the event posted evidence that Trump didn\u2019t fill the venue and that only a handful of people were milling around in the parking lot.\n\nIn Tampa, Trump claimed thousands of people who couldn\u2019t get in were watching outside on a \u201ctremendous movie screen\u201d \u2014 that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery how Trump comes up with these estimates and details about his rallies. His campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. But in almost every instance, the president\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up or are contradicted by reporters or local officials.\n\nWe reconstructed as much as we could and compared Trump\u2019s estimates of his crowd sizes this year with information from local media, law enforcement or attendees posting photos and videos on Twitter. Trump has held 44 rallies this year, but we focused only on 19 for which he gave some kind of estimate of the crowd size.\n\n\u201cThank you for that incredible support and, by the way, you want to see a lot of people \u2014 go outside. We could have filled this place up, probably five or six times.\u201d (Rally in Washington Township, Mich., April 28)\n\nTrump held this event at Total Sports Park, which was packed with an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people. So the president\u2019s claim here is that 25,000 to 36,000 people may have been rallying outside.\n\nAccording to a local news report, approximately 30,000 people were expected to attend this Trump rally. But we couldn\u2019t find evidence that this prediction turned out to be accurate. Local news reports estimated only that \u201cthousands\u201d attended. Photos taken by local media and video from CNN suggest that the crowd outside the event was much smaller than 25,000. A Twitter user inside the venue for the rally estimated that there were \u201cat least twice as many\u201d people watching outside on a big screen. It\u2019s unclear how he landed on that number, but if it\u2019s accurate, it would represent fewer than half the people Trump estimated.\n\nWithout any hard evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim, it\u2019s a bit absurd to imagine 30,000 people or so squinting at a Jumbotron while the president addressed a much smaller crowd of 5,000 to 6,000 inside the venue.\n\n\u201cYou know we have an event. I hear we have 12,000 people there. They have 12,000 seats. We have 12,000 people.\u201d (Rally in Nashville, May 29)\n\nLocal officials estimated attendance at 5,500.\n\n\u201cIn my last speech, it\u2019s in Minnesota, great place, unbelievable crowd. It seated 9,000, and they had 15,000 or 20,000 people outside couldn\u2019t get in. It was incredible.\u201d (Rally in Duluth, Minn., June 20)\n\nThis rally was held at Amsoil Arena, which can seat more than 9,000. According to a local news report, an arena official said 8,372 people attended Trump\u2019s rally and many others were turned away at the door. There\u2019s nothing to indicate they hung around outside.\n\n\u201cThis place is packed. The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in. They\u2019re having a hard time. They can\u2019t get in. It\u2019s full. You know, we had the chance for a 24,000-seat arena. \u2026 Twenty-four thousand seats. No, we would have filled it up very easily.\u201d (Rally in Fargo, N.D., June 27)\n\nThis venue, Scheels Arena, seats up to 6,000. Trump suggested with no evidence that three times as many people were outside.\n\nIt appears that 20,000 people signed up for tickets to this Trump rally, but that doesn\u2019t mean 20,000 people were outside. About 300 to 400 people outside were protesters, according to a local news report. That report also said Trump supporters who couldn\u2019t get into the rally were told by the Secret Service and local officials to \u201cdisperse\u201d and go watch it on TV. \u201cMany sat outside the arena watching Trump speak on their phones,\u201d the West Fargo Pioneer reported.\n\n\u201cAnd outside, you probably know what\u2019s going on. There are thousands and thousands of people. And we\u2019ve decided from now on, we\u2019re going to put up screens and loudspeakers so people can stay around. Because this happens all the time. I said to my people, why didn\u2019t you get a larger arena?\u201d (Rally in Great Falls, Mont., July 5)\n\n\u201cThousands and thousands\u201d appears to be a huge stretch. The county sheriff estimated that 8,000 people had lined up for this rally, according to a local news report. The Four Seasons Arena holds 6,600, and Cascade County, which owns the venue, estimated attendance of more than 6,500.\n\nAssuming everyone who was turned away lingered outside the rally, that rounds out to 1,500 at most, not \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d (Another possibility: Trump couldn\u2019t fill this arena, because the county estimated the crowd size as slightly below the venue\u2019s capacity.)\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, outside, if you want to go, we set up, for the first time, a tremendous movie screen, because we have thousands and thousands of people outside that couldn\u2019t get in.\u201d (Rally in Tampa, July 31)\n\nKudos to the Tampa Bay Times for running down this false claim in real time. The newspaper reported that \u201chundreds\u201d of people were outside this Trump rally, not \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d And some of them were protesters. And there was no \u201ctremendous movie screen\u201d anywhere in sight.\n\nTrump said people watched his rally on TVs outside the Fairgrounds. They didn't. https://t.co/LPSS0jX0dN \u2014 Tampa Bay Times (@TB_Times) August 1, 2018\n\n\u201cBut are they going to talk about the thousands and thousands of people inside of this arena and outside of the arena, where we put screens? No.\u201d (Rally in Evansville, Ind., Aug. 30)\n\nA capacity crowd of nearly 11,000 filled the Ford Center for Trump\u2019s rally. There were an estimated 1,000 protesters outside, plus \u201ca small group of Trump supporters,\u201d according to the Courier and Press. No sign of screens.\n\n\u201cOutside, you have thousands and thousands of people. \u2026 You think you\u2019re a lot of people? How about doubling or tripling it outside? And Josh [Hawley] said that \u2014 Josh said that. And we put big screens outside because this is happening all over the country. We put big, beautiful screens \u2014 so to all of the people outside, you\u2019re not as good in real estate as the people inside, but we\u2019ll get you next time.\u201d (Rally in Springfield, Mo., Sept. 21)\n\n\u201cAnd in Missouri, they had \u2014 you saw it \u2014 45,000 people outside.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 1)\n\n\u201cHey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena, 44,000 people.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 4)\n\n\u201cI mean, we had in Missouri 45,000 people that couldn\u2019t get into a 10,000-seat arena because it was packed.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 20)\n\nThis venue, JQH Arena, holds 11,000. There\u2019s no evidence that people hovered around if they couldn\u2019t get in or that TV screens were mounted outside.\n\nJosh Hawley, the Republican candidate with whom Trump was campaigning that day, said 20,000 people had been turned away. There\u2019s no evidence for this claim, either, but the Trump campaign appears to have gotten 20,000 people to register for tickets online. (That doesn\u2019t mean they all showed up, or that those who couldn\u2019t get in lingered outside the venue.)\n\nWe have no clue how 20,000 in Hawley\u2019s estimation became 45,000 in Trump\u2019s. In any case, both numbers seem to be seriously inflated.\n\nA police spokeswoman told the News-Leader that 12,000 people showed up. That suggests 1,000 people were turned away if the venue was at capacity. A city official told the newspaper that 2,000 people were turned away.\n\n\u201cFor context, Trump\u2019s claim that 44,000 people were outside the Springfield rally would mean a crowd that\u2019s equivalent to more than a quarter of Springfield\u2019s total population. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 167,000 live in the city of Springfield,\u201d the News-Leader reported in a fact check of Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAnd I always tell you, it\u2019s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we\u2019d have about 200 people standing right there.\u201d (Rally in Wheeling, W.Va., Sept. 29)\n\nThis venue, WesBanco Arena, holds 5,600. There\u2019s no evidence there were 10,000 people outside. Local news reports mentioned long lines of Trump supporters waiting to enter the venue, as well as \u201cdozens of peaceful protesters \u2026 lining the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why outside right now \u2014 I hope they haven\u2019t left \u2014 we put big screens out there for them. But you have close to 20,000 people standing outside.\u201d (Rally in Johnson City, Tenn., Oct. 1)\n\nFreedom Hall, where Trump held this rally, holds 8,000 to 8,500. The director of the center told the Johnson City Press that 6,500 people were allowed in, 1,000 were sent into an overflow room with large screens, and between 1,500 and 2,000 were outside watching large screens.\n\nThat\u2019s 18,000 to 18,500 fewer people outside than Trump claimed.\n\n\u201cThousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always.\u201d (Rally in Rochester, Minn., Oct. 4)\n\nA capacity crowd of nearly 10,000 filled this venue, \u201cwith 1,000 to 2,000 more watching on giant screens outside, according to city officials,\u201d the Star-Tribune reported. Also, \u201chundreds marched nearby in protest of Trump\u2019s visit.\u201d This was a convention center, not, as Trump claimed, a stadium.\n\n\u201cIn Erie, Pennsylvania, the other night with 25,000 people outside of a 12,000-seat arena. It\u2019s been amazing.\u201d (Interview in Lebanon, Ohio, Oct. 12)\n\nPolice estimated 3,000 people outside a 9,000-seat venue in Erie on Oct. 10, according to the Times-News.\n\n\u201cYou know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens.\u201d (Rally in Richmond, Ky., Oct. 13)\n\nThis event drew an estimated 6,100 inside the venue and a \u201clarge crowd\u201d in the parking lot. A photo posted on Twitter by a local news reporter shows this crowd facing a movie screen.\n\nBut there\u2019s no indication this crowd was bigger than 1,000 or 2,000 people at most. In addition, \u201chundreds\u201d of people outside were there to protest Trump, according to the Herald-Leader. The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson was at this event and noted that most people who were in line and turned away at the door decided to leave rather than stand outside in 47-degree weather.\n\nWhen the doors closed for President Trump\u2019s rally tonight in Eastern Kentucky, a few thousand people were still in line and couldn\u2019t get in. Most have left \u2014 it\u2019s 47 degrees! \u2014 but this group is staying to watch on a video screen outside. pic.twitter.com/NTCsYNAFnu \u2014 Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) October 13, 2018\n\n\u201cFifty thousand people outside. Who we love. And we put big screens out for them. Let\u2019s wave to them. Wave!\u201d (Rally in Houston, Oct. 22)\n\n\u201cWe have \u2014 the other night in Houston, the Houston Rockets, the arena, packed, set a new record. Outside, tens of thousands of people, 109,000 people \u2014 109,000 people wanted to come.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 26)\n\n\u201cWe had over 100,000 people that wanted to come. We had 22,000 people in the arena. We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena.\u201d (Trump remarks, Nov. 2)\n\nAccording to the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, 18,000 to 19,000 were in the venue for Trump\u2019s rally and 3,000 watched on a big screen outside.\n\n\u201cThe arena seats 18,000. Many hundreds of seats were empty, including all of the boxes on both tiers of the mezzanine,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nRally going smoothly. 18 - 19 thousand inside @ToyotaCenter for rally. @houstonpolice airship providing overwatch, approximate about 3,000 folks outside enjoying rally. Thank you all participants & protestors for your peaceful & orderly participation. #RelationalPolicing pic.twitter.com/LDGnetxdwZ \u2014 Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) October 22, 2018\n\nSo, according to the paper, the president didn\u2019t fill the venue, and according to the police, the crowd outside was a paltry 6 percent of Trump\u2019s grandiose estimate of 50,000.\n\nTotal attendance inside and outside the venue appears to have been roughly 20,000, representing fewer than half the people who attended a concert in Austin with Willie Nelson and Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. (That event did draw more than 50,000 attendees, according to the Dallas Morning News.)\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign claimed 109,000 people registered for tickets to this Houston rally. Again, though, this is not a measure of the actual crowd size. Anyone could go online and register for two free tickets.\n\n\u201cAnd when we start changing around our lives and changing around our schedules and telling thousands and thousands \u2014 look at this group of people and outside. And I hate to say it, but outside you have a group that\u2019s almost as big or just as big trying to get in. So you got the better location, but \u2026 but they have a better movie screen, okay? And they\u2019re great.\u201d (Rally in Murphysboro, Ill., Oct. 27)\n\nThis rally \u2014 which Trump held on the same day as a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue \u2014 took place in an airport hangar that holds 600 people at capacity, according to a local media report. (If Trump really expected \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d to show up, he might have picked a bigger location.)\n\nA local CBS affiliate reported that 4,000 people were inside, while an overflow crowd was outside the hangar. A Republican state lawmaker from Illinois was quoted as saying that 8,500 people in total went through metal detectors. That uncorroborated claim seems to support Trump\u2019s line that \u201ca group almost as big\u201d as the 4,000 attendees inside the hangar was outside.\n\nAt this event, the Daily Herald reported a remarkable detail about the video programming outside Trump\u2019s rallies: \u201cA video played on two big screens outside the hangar that told people if they spied anyone in the crowd not supporting Trump, they should surround that person, hold up their placards and chant \u2018Trump Trump Trump\u2019 until that person is removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is such a big group.

Trump says he filled airport hangars \u2014 not one but two! \u2014 during a rally with Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nBut there was only one hangar. The crowd at this event was divided in three: the people inside, the people just outside the open hangar, and a third group watching a TV screen on a different part of the premises, sandwiched between the airport and a corporate office.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign estimated that 10,000 people attended in total, and the Bibb County Sheriff\u2019s Office estimated 12,500 inside and nearly 6,000 outside, according to a fact-check by WMAZ. The overflow crowd sandwiched between the airport and the corporate office numbered in the \u201chundreds,\u201d according to Atlanta magazine.\n\nThe most generous tally, 18,500, is a far cry from the 55,000 Trump claimed.\n\n\u201cShould we let them in or not?

At nine such rallies this year, the president\u2019s estimates came to 352,600 people combined. Our review of official counts and news reports shows the number was much lower: 100,972.\n\nThat means Trump multiplied his crowd sizes by a factor of 3.5, at minimum. Of course, this doesn\u2019t take into account all the times he made wild assertions about his crowd sizes without giving hard numbers.\n\nThese claims deserve Four Pinocchios.

Never an empty seat in these large venues, many thousands of people watching screens outside. Enthusiasm & Spirit is through the roof. SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING - WATCH!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in a tweet, Oct. 15, 2018\n\n\u201cThere have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics. You\u2019ve never had crowds like this for midterm elections. There\u2019s never been crowds like this.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, at a campaign rally in Macon, Ga., Nov. 4, 2018\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd sizes, as you have probably figured out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, in remarks at the White House, Oct. 23, 2018\n\nTrump has been inflating the size of his crowds since his early days as a candidate. His presidency began with a surreal national debate over how many people attended his inauguration.\n\nAnd this year, at midterm campaign rallies across the country, the president\u2019s crowd-size boasts became a big bugaboo for fact-checkers. There\u2019s no question Trump can draw supporters by the thousands, but his pumped-up numbers are so extravagant most of the time that they have little or no basis in fact.\n\nFor example, Trump claimed 50,000 people were outside a rally in Houston because they couldn\u2019t get in, but the city\u2019s police chief said the number was much lower: 3,000. In Cleveland, Trump claimed \u201cthousands\u201d of people were outside because the venue was packed. But Twitter users at the event posted evidence that Trump didn\u2019t fill the venue and that only a handful of people were milling around in the parking lot.\n\nIn Tampa, Trump claimed thousands of people who couldn\u2019t get in were watching outside on a \u201ctremendous movie screen\u201d \u2014 that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery how Trump comes up with these estimates and details about his rallies. His campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. But in almost every instance, the president\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up or are contradicted by reporters or local officials.\n\nWe reconstructed as much as we could and compared Trump\u2019s estimates of his crowd sizes this year with information from local media, law enforcement or attendees posting photos and videos on Twitter. Trump has held 44 rallies this year, but we focused only on 19 for which he gave some kind of estimate of the crowd size.\n\n\u201cThank you for that incredible support and, by the way, you want to see a lot of people \u2014 go outside. We could have filled this place up, probably five or six times.\u201d (Rally in Washington Township, Mich., April 28)\n\nTrump held this event at Total Sports Park, which was packed with an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 people. So the president\u2019s claim here is that 25,000 to 36,000 people may have been rallying outside.\n\nAccording to a local news report, approximately 30,000 people were expected to attend this Trump rally. But we couldn\u2019t find evidence that this prediction turned out to be accurate. Local news reports estimated only that \u201cthousands\u201d attended. Photos taken by local media and video from CNN suggest that the crowd outside the event was much smaller than 25,000. A Twitter user inside the venue for the rally estimated that there were \u201cat least twice as many\u201d people watching outside on a big screen. It\u2019s unclear how he landed on that number, but if it\u2019s accurate, it would represent fewer than half the people Trump estimated.\n\nWithout any hard evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim, it\u2019s a bit absurd to imagine 30,000 people or so squinting at a Jumbotron while the president addressed a much smaller crowd of 5,000 to 6,000 inside the venue.\n\n\u201cYou know we have an event. I hear we have 12,000 people there. They have 12,000 seats. We have 12,000 people.\u201d (Rally in Nashville, May 29)\n\nLocal officials estimated attendance at 5,500.\n\n\u201cIn my last speech, it\u2019s in Minnesota, great place, unbelievable crowd. It seated 9,000, and they had 15,000 or 20,000 people outside couldn\u2019t get in. It was incredible.\u201d (Rally in Duluth, Minn., June 20)\n\nThis rally was held at Amsoil Arena, which can seat more than 9,000. According to a local news report, an arena official said 8,372 people attended Trump\u2019s rally and many others were turned away at the door. There\u2019s nothing to indicate they hung around outside.\n\n\u201cThis place is packed. The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in. They\u2019re having a hard time. They can\u2019t get in. It\u2019s full. You know, we had the chance for a 24,000-seat arena. \u2026 Twenty-four thousand seats. No, we would have filled it up very easily.\u201d (Rally in Fargo, N.D., June 27)\n\nThis venue, Scheels Arena, seats up to 6,000. Trump suggested with no evidence that three times as many people were outside.\n\nIt appears that 20,000 people signed up for tickets to this Trump rally, but that doesn\u2019t mean 20,000 people were outside. About 300 to 400 people outside were protesters, according to a local news report. That report also said Trump supporters who couldn\u2019t get into the rally were told by the Secret Service and local officials to \u201cdisperse\u201d and go watch it on TV. \u201cMany sat outside the arena watching Trump speak on their phones,\u201d the West Fargo Pioneer reported.\n\n\u201cAnd outside, you probably know what\u2019s going on. There are thousands and thousands of people. And we\u2019ve decided from now on, we\u2019re going to put up screens and loudspeakers so people can stay around. Because this happens all the time. I said to my people, why didn\u2019t you get a larger arena?\u201d (Rally in Great Falls, Mont., July 5)\n\n\u201cThousands and thousands\u201d appears to be a huge stretch. The county sheriff estimated that 8,000 people had lined up for this rally, according to a local news report. The Four Seasons Arena holds 6,600, and Cascade County, which owns the venue, estimated attendance of more than 6,500.\n\nAssuming everyone who was turned away lingered outside the rally, that rounds out to 1,500 at most, not \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d (Another possibility: Trump couldn\u2019t fill this arena, because the county estimated the crowd size as slightly below the venue\u2019s capacity.)\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, outside, if you want to go, we set up, for the first time, a tremendous movie screen, because we have thousands and thousands of people outside that couldn\u2019t get in.\u201d (Rally in Tampa, July 31)\n\nKudos to the Tampa Bay Times for running down this false claim in real time. The newspaper reported that \u201chundreds\u201d of people were outside this Trump rally, not \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d And some of them were protesters. And there was no \u201ctremendous movie screen\u201d anywhere in sight.\n\nTrump said people watched his rally on TVs outside the Fairgrounds. They didn't. https://t.co/LPSS0jX0dN \u2014 Tampa Bay Times (@TB_Times) August 1, 2018\n\n\u201cBut are they going to talk about the thousands and thousands of people inside of this arena and outside of the arena, where we put screens? No.\u201d (Rally in Evansville, Ind., Aug. 30)\n\nA capacity crowd of nearly 11,000 filled the Ford Center for Trump\u2019s rally. There were an estimated 1,000 protesters outside, plus \u201ca small group of Trump supporters,\u201d according to the Courier and Press. No sign of screens.\n\n\u201cOutside, you have thousands and thousands of people. \u2026 You think you\u2019re a lot of people? How about doubling or tripling it outside? And Josh [Hawley] said that \u2014 Josh said that. And we put big screens outside because this is happening all over the country. We put big, beautiful screens \u2014 so to all of the people outside, you\u2019re not as good in real estate as the people inside, but we\u2019ll get you next time.\u201d (Rally in Springfield, Mo., Sept. 21)\n\n\u201cAnd in Missouri, they had \u2014 you saw it \u2014 45,000 people outside.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 1)\n\n\u201cHey, Missouri. They had 44,000 people outside of a big arena, 44,000 people.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 4)\n\n\u201cI mean, we had in Missouri 45,000 people that couldn\u2019t get into a 10,000-seat arena because it was packed.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 20)\n\nThis venue, JQH Arena, holds 11,000. There\u2019s no evidence that people hovered around if they couldn\u2019t get in or that TV screens were mounted outside.\n\nJosh Hawley, the Republican candidate with whom Trump was campaigning that day, said 20,000 people had been turned away. There\u2019s no evidence for this claim, either, but the Trump campaign appears to have gotten 20,000 people to register for tickets online. (That doesn\u2019t mean they all showed up, or that those who couldn\u2019t get in lingered outside the venue.)\n\nWe have no clue how 20,000 in Hawley\u2019s estimation became 45,000 in Trump\u2019s. In any case, both numbers seem to be seriously inflated.\n\nA police spokeswoman told the News-Leader that 12,000 people showed up. That suggests 1,000 people were turned away if the venue was at capacity. A city official told the newspaper that 2,000 people were turned away.\n\n\u201cFor context, Trump\u2019s claim that 44,000 people were outside the Springfield rally would mean a crowd that\u2019s equivalent to more than a quarter of Springfield\u2019s total population. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 167,000 live in the city of Springfield,\u201d the News-Leader reported in a fact check of Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cAnd I always tell you, it\u2019s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we\u2019d have about 200 people standing right there.\u201d (Rally in Wheeling, W.Va., Sept. 29)\n\nThis venue, WesBanco Arena, holds 5,600. There\u2019s no evidence there were 10,000 people outside. Local news reports mentioned long lines of Trump supporters waiting to enter the venue, as well as \u201cdozens of peaceful protesters \u2026 lining the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why outside right now \u2014 I hope they haven\u2019t left \u2014 we put big screens out there for them. But you have close to 20,000 people standing outside.\u201d (Rally in Johnson City, Tenn., Oct. 1)\n\nFreedom Hall, where Trump held this rally, holds 8,000 to 8,500. The director of the center told the Johnson City Press that 6,500 people were allowed in, 1,000 were sent into an overflow room with large screens, and between 1,500 and 2,000 were outside watching large screens.\n\nThat\u2019s 18,000 to 18,500 fewer people outside than Trump claimed.\n\n\u201cThousands of people in a room next door, thousands and thousands of people outside trying to get in, this big stadium is packed, always.\u201d (Rally in Rochester, Minn., Oct. 4)\n\nA capacity crowd of nearly 10,000 filled this venue, \u201cwith 1,000 to 2,000 more watching on giant screens outside, according to city officials,\u201d the Star-Tribune reported. Also, \u201chundreds marched nearby in protest of Trump\u2019s visit.\u201d This was a convention center, not, as Trump claimed, a stadium.\n\n\u201cIn Erie, Pennsylvania, the other night with 25,000 people outside of a 12,000-seat arena. It\u2019s been amazing.\u201d (Interview in Lebanon, Ohio, Oct. 12)\n\nPolice estimated 3,000 people outside a 9,000-seat venue in Erie on Oct. 10, according to the Times-News.\n\n\u201cYou know, outside, you have 25,000, 35,000, some crazy number of people, and we set up movie screens. We set up beautiful movie screens.\u201d (Rally in Richmond, Ky., Oct. 13)\n\nThis event drew an estimated 6,100 inside the venue and a \u201clarge crowd\u201d in the parking lot. A photo posted on Twitter by a local news reporter shows this crowd facing a movie screen.\n\nBut there\u2019s no indication this crowd was bigger than 1,000 or 2,000 people at most. In addition, \u201chundreds\u201d of people outside were there to protest Trump, according to the Herald-Leader. The Washington Post\u2019s Jenna Johnson was at this event and noted that most people who were in line and turned away at the door decided to leave rather than stand outside in 47-degree weather.\n\nWhen the doors closed for President Trump\u2019s rally tonight in Eastern Kentucky, a few thousand people were still in line and couldn\u2019t get in. Most have left \u2014 it\u2019s 47 degrees! \u2014 but this group is staying to watch on a video screen outside. pic.twitter.com/NTCsYNAFnu \u2014 Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) October 13, 2018\n\n\u201cFifty thousand people outside. Who we love. And we put big screens out for them. Let\u2019s wave to them. Wave!\u201d (Rally in Houston, Oct. 22)\n\n\u201cWe have \u2014 the other night in Houston, the Houston Rockets, the arena, packed, set a new record. Outside, tens of thousands of people, 109,000 people \u2014 109,000 people wanted to come.\u201d (Trump remarks, Oct. 26)\n\n\u201cWe had over 100,000 people that wanted to come. We had 22,000 people in the arena. We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena.\u201d (Trump remarks, Nov. 2)\n\nAccording to the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, 18,000 to 19,000 were in the venue for Trump\u2019s rally and 3,000 watched on a big screen outside.\n\n\u201cThe arena seats 18,000. Many hundreds of seats were empty, including all of the boxes on both tiers of the mezzanine,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nRally going smoothly. 18 - 19 thousand inside @ToyotaCenter for rally. @houstonpolice airship providing overwatch, approximate about 3,000 folks outside enjoying rally. Thank you all participants & protestors for your peaceful & orderly participation. #RelationalPolicing pic.twitter.com/LDGnetxdwZ \u2014 Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) October 22, 2018\n\nSo, according to the paper, the president didn\u2019t fill the venue, and according to the police, the crowd outside was a paltry 6 percent of Trump\u2019s grandiose estimate of 50,000.\n\nTotal attendance inside and outside the venue appears to have been roughly 20,000, representing fewer than half the people who attended a concert in Austin with Willie Nelson and Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke. (That event did draw more than 50,000 attendees, according to the Dallas Morning News.)\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign claimed 109,000 people registered for tickets to this Houston rally. Again, though, this is not a measure of the actual crowd size. Anyone could go online and register for two free tickets.\n\n\u201cAnd when we start changing around our lives and changing around our schedules and telling thousands and thousands \u2014 look at this group of people and outside. And I hate to say it, but outside you have a group that\u2019s almost as big or just as big trying to get in. So you got the better location, but \u2026 but they have a better movie screen, okay? And they\u2019re great.\u201d (Rally in Murphysboro, Ill., Oct. 27)\n\nThis rally \u2014 which Trump held on the same day as a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue \u2014 took place in an airport hangar that holds 600 people at capacity, according to a local media report. (If Trump really expected \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d to show up, he might have picked a bigger location.)\n\nA local CBS affiliate reported that 4,000 people were inside, while an overflow crowd was outside the hangar. A Republican state lawmaker from Illinois was quoted as saying that 8,500 people in total went through metal detectors. That uncorroborated claim seems to support Trump\u2019s line that \u201ca group almost as big\u201d as the 4,000 attendees inside the hangar was outside.\n\nAt this event, the Daily Herald reported a remarkable detail about the video programming outside Trump\u2019s rallies: \u201cA video played on two big screens outside the hangar that told people if they spied anyone in the crowd not supporting Trump, they should surround that person, hold up their placards and chant \u2018Trump Trump Trump\u2019 until that person is removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is such a big group.

Trump says he filled airport hangars \u2014 not one but two! \u2014 during a rally with Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nBut there was only one hangar. The crowd at this event was divided in three: the people inside, the people just outside the open hangar, and a third group watching a TV screen on a different part of the premises, sandwiched between the airport and a corporate office.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign estimated that 10,000 people attended in total, and the Bibb County Sheriff\u2019s Office estimated 12,500 inside and nearly 6,000 outside, according to a fact-check by WMAZ.

A senior leader from Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels says that for the sake of peace efforts the group will halt rocket fire into Saudi Arabia, its larger northern neighbor who is leading a U.S.-backed Arab coalition to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government. (Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nSANAA, Yemen \u2014 Yemen\u2019s Shiite rebels said Monday that they will halt rocket fire into Saudi Arabia for the sake of peace efforts, answering a key Saudi demand in the latest push to stop the civil war in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nBut the rebels also said they had fired a ballistic missile into Saudi Arabia overnight in response to an attempted border incursion and a Saudi airstrike, and that they reserved the right to respond to attacks.\n\nFor the past three years, a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition has been waging war against the Iran-aligned rebels, known as Houthis, to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government. The rebels say they have long been excluded from that government and aim to rectify historic grievances.\n\nRebel leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi announced in a statement that the rebels had ordered the cessation of rocket and drone attacks on the Saudis and forces loyal to the United Arab Emirates, a leading coalition member, at the request of U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts in order to achieve peace,\u201d al-Houthi said. He mentioned the rockets specifically as part of a longer statement in which he blamed the United States for being the main driver behind \u201cthe aggression\u201d against Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis swept down from northern Yemen in 2014 and captured the capital, Sanaa, with the help of forces loyal to longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been forced from power by an Arab Spring-inspired popular uprising. Saleh was killed in internal fighting between the Houthis and their allies last year.\n\nThe government fled Sanaa in early 2015, and Saudi Arabia, citing fears that its nemesis Iran was trying to make inroads on the Arabian Peninsula, began launching airstrikes against the rebels in March of that year.\n\nRiyadh formed a coalition of Sunni Arab states, including the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, and launched ground assaults on several fronts but failed to take the capital. After major setbacks, including the death of some elite officers, it outsourced the ground fighting to local troops, including a group trained by the UAE in the south.\n\nTens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the war, and two-thirds of Yemen\u2019s 27 million people rely on aid. More than 8 million are at risk of starvation in what has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster.\n\nThe latest Saudi-led offensive, which began in the summer, has been focused on capturing the key rebel-held port city of Hodeida, through which almost all of Yemen\u2019s food and desperately needed humanitarian aid flows.\n\nA U.N. draft resolution circulated by Britain on Monday urges the warring parties to relaunch peace talks and take urgent steps to address the humanitarian crisis. It also calls for an immediate cease-fire around Hodeida.\n\nGriffiths, the U.N. envoy, announced on Friday that both sides had agreed to attend talks in Sweden \u201csoon\u201d aimed at ending the conflict. The internationally backed government said Monday that it would attend, but also insisted the Houthis do so \u201cunconditionally.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman, in an annual policy speech Monday, called Yemen a \u201cpriority\u201d and said he supports a U.N.-sponsored political solution to end the war. But he also railed against the Houthis, saying Saudi Arabia was supporting the Yemeni people against the \u201caggression of Iranian-backed militias.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has long demanded the rebels withdraw from all major cities they have taken, which the Houthis refuse to do.\n\nIt was not immediately clear to what extent the Houthi move to stop missile fire into the kingdom would halt the overall violence. While the guns have gone silent inside central Hodeida, fighting continues on its outskirts and elsewhere in the country, and several previous peace initiatives have failed.\n\nInternational outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October focused attention on the war in Yemen, leading the U.S. to scale back its support for the coalition and call for a cease-fire by the end of this month.\n\nBut the U.S. call for a truce was immediately followed by a renewed coalition onslaught on Hodeida, with dozens of fighters and civilians killed on both sides. A week later, the stalemate resumed, with the Houthis still firmly dug in on the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\n___\n\nRohan reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Edith M.

Hot blasts of pyroclastic material pushed down canyons on the slopes, while a column of ash rose nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) above sea level and drifted toward Guatemala City to the east.\n\nHundreds of families heeded the call of disaster coordination authorities to evacuate 10 communities, piling into yellow school buses for trips to shelters. The national disaster commission said 3,925 people had been evacuated by early Monday.\n\nThe Volcano of Fire is one of the most active in Central America and an eruption in June killed 194 people. Another 234 are officially missing, although organizations supporting the communities have insisted there are thousands of missing persons.\n\nIt spewed more ash and hot rock in October, prompting warnings for the nearby communities.\n\nThe biggest danger from the volcano are lahars, a mixture of ash, rock, mud and debris, that can bury entire towns. However, by Monday, there had been no reports of such flows reaching populated areas, though authorities were taking no chances; they were harshly criticized for not calling for evacuations earlier in June.\n\nFour shelters have been set up for evacuees. Dora Caal, 26, and five members of her family took refuge under a nylon tent at a sports stadium in the nearby town of Escuintla.\n\n\u201cLast night we heard the volcano roar, you could see fire, we couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Caal, whose town of El Rodeo was largely evacuated.\n\n\u201cAt dawn we said we\u2019d better get out, we were afraid,\u201d Caal said as the sun beat down fiercely at the improvised shelter.

They closed it and we can\u2019t work there anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nEnma Hernandez, 42, left her home in El Rodeo to evacuate, but her 20-year-old son stayed behind to protect the family home from looters. In fact, many men stayed behind in the town; there were mainly women and children at the shelter.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Snipes acknowledged over the weekend her office had misplaced more than 2,000 ballots included in the original count.\n\nAs The Post reported, Broward election officials also missed a key deadline for the recount by two minutes, meaning the Florida secretary of state rejected the county\u2019s machine-based tally.\n\nSnipes was originally appointed as the county\u2019s top election official by then-Gov.

Unless the judge extends that 14-day order, it will expire at the end of the month.\n\nIn light of the White House\u2019s unexpected action, the network\u2019s lawyer requested an expedited schedule which would allow the judge to enter a more lasting preliminary injunction against the White House. The renewed confrontation represents an unusual escalation in the court battle between Trump, on the one hand, and CNN and Acosta, both regular targets of the president\u2019s wrath for reporting on his administration.\n\nIn the letter, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Bill Shine, assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications, told Acosta that his behavior at a Nov. 7 news conference \u201cviolated the basic standards governing [news conferences], and is, in our preliminary judgment, sufficient factual basis to revoke your hard pass.\"\n\nPresident Trump, the letter makes clear, \u201cis aware of this preliminary decision and concurs.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, lawyers for CNN and Acosta asked U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, to schedule an emergency hearing next week given the White House has made clear it intends to continue barring Acosta as soon as Kelly\u2019s order expires.\n\nKelly\u2019s decision to issue the 14-day temporary restraining order Friday while he considers the merits of the case was grounded mostly in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process guarantee. Kelly said the White House has an obligation to afford due process to Acosta before it can revoke or suspend his access, and found that the White House\u2019s decision-making process in this case was \u201cso shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me . . . who made the decision.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s motion characterized the letter from Sanders and Shine as an \u201cattempt to provide retroactive due process.\u201d Ted Boutrous, an attorney for CNN, told Justice Department lawyers in an email that he found the White House\u2019s letter to be a \u201cdisappointing response to the court\u2019s decision and our attempts to resolve the matter amicably.\u201d\n\n[Read the CNN, Acosta emergency motion.]\n\n\u201cMore fundamentally, though,\u201d he wrote in the email, \u201cit is further evidence of your clients\u2019 animus towards Mr. Acosta based on his work as CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent.\u201d\n\nSanders and Shine gave Acosta the opportunity to contest its \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d to again suspend his press pass by 5 p.m. Sunday. In a response from lawyers, Acosta contested the decision, saying that despite the White House\u2019s previous admission that there are no actual written rules for journalists participating in press conferences, Acosta is now being punished \u201cbased on a retroactive application of unwritten \u2018practices\u2019 among journalists covering the White House.\u201d\n\nThis application \u201cof vague, unarticulated standards to a journalist\u2019s access to the White House is not only different from your original explanations, but it is the same sort of due process violation that led the district court to issue a temporary restraining order against you on Friday.\"\n\nThe action was telegraphed Friday by press secretary Sarah Sanders, who said that the White House would only \u201ctemporarily reinstate\u201d Acosta\u2019s credentials in response to a court decision in his favor. Appearing on Fox News with her father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), who was substituting for Sean Hannity, she later said that \u201cwe\u2019ve laid out in a letter to CNN and their team what we think were some of the missteps that their reporter made at the press conference on November 7th.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Brian Stelter of \u201cReliable Sources\u201d said in his newsletter Sunday that \u201cWhite House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.\u201d\n\nTrump said Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re setting up a certain standard, which is what the court is requesting,\u201d but no particular new rules have been publicly issued. On that day, after the court\u2019s order was issued, Sanders said the White House would \u201cdevelop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cThese actions threaten all journalists and news organizations. Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.\u201d\n\nCNN and Acosta, the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent, sued the White House and Sanders last week after they suspended his press credentials following Acosta\u2019s minor altercation with a White House intern, who tried to take a microphone out of his hands as he questioned the president.\n\nSanders accused Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman\u201d when explaining why Acosta\u2019s pass had been suspended, but Kelly found that this allegation was \u201clikely untrue.\u201d\n\nIn defending the White House\u2019s decision to suspend Acosta\u2019s press pass, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was not an infringement on the First Amendment because CNN had plenty of other White House reporters who are \u201cmore than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN\u2019s behalf,\u201d and Acosta could still \u201cpractice his profession and report on the White House\u201d \u2014 just not at the White House.\n\nKelly agreed that access to the White House grounds is not a First Amendment right. But he also found that a reporter\u2019s \u201cFirst Amendment liberty interest in a White House press pass\u201d is also protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due-process guarantees, as The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple previously reported. In other words, the White House can\u2019t just revoke a reporter\u2019s press pass for no good reason.\n\nIn deciding whether barring Acosta amounted to \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d a standard for granting temporary restraining orders, Kelly pointed to the case of journalist Robert Sherrill, who fought the White House\u2019s denial of his press pass in 1977 and also won the right to due process and a restoration of his pass (though he never actually reapplied for it).\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment interests as recognized in Sherrill were not vested merely in publications or agencies; they were liberties of the individual journalists themselves,\u201d Kelly said, as excerpted by Wemple. \u201cFor that reason, that CNN may still send another journalist or journalists to the White House does not make the harm to Mr. Acosta any less irreparable . . . It\u2019s a harm that cannot be remedied in retrospect . . .

(Bill Feig/Associated Press)\n\nWhen the Saints, already up by 31 points in the fourth quarter Sunday against the Eagles, threw for a 37-yard touchdown on a fourth-down play, more than a few Philadelphia fans and other observers felt that New Orleans was rudely running up the score.\n\nEagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who was burned by Saints running back Alvin Kamara on the play, appeared to be of like mind when he flashed his middle finger toward the opposing sideline after the touchdown. Following his team\u2019s 48-7 loss, Jenkins acknowledged that his gesture was aimed at New Orleans Coach Sean Payton, but claimed that he has nothing but \u201crespect\u201d for his former squad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a competitor. I love Sean to death, and I know what type of guy and coach he is,\u201d the 30-year-old Jenkins, who played for Payton\u2019s Saints from 2009 to 2013, told NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cSo that was more so personal between me and him, but we talked after the game. It\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt that after a certain point, the Saints should have \u201cbacked off,\u201d Jenkins replied, \u201cNo, I know Sean, he\u2019s one of those people that they\u2019re going to go for it, and I understood that. I was just more so upset that it was on me.\n\n\"I know what kind of team they are, they\u2019re well-coached.

He\u2019s a tremendous player, and I hate that he got out of here.\"\n\nOf letting Jenkins go in free agency, the coach said, \u201cThat was probably as big a mistake as we\u2019ve made here in 13 years.\u201d Payton added, \u201cHe\u2019s made up of all the right things, and he\u2019s a tremendous competitor.\u201d\n\nThere was some sentiment, at least online as the fourth quarter unfolded, that Payton might have wanted to go for the jugular to prove a point. Having been stunningly ousted by the Vikings on a last-second touchdown in January\u2019s playoffs, the Saints watched Minnesota put up little resistance the following week against Philadelphia in the NFC championship game, and New Orleans players have been outspoken in their conviction that they would have beaten the Eagles.\n\nReferring to the many injuries suffered this season by Eagles defensive backs, Philadelphia sports columnist Les Bowen tweeted, \u201cSure Sean, leave Brees in and see how many long bombs he can throw against the practice squad DBs. I\u2019m sure nothing bad will happen and no one will remember this, for when your team maybe isn\u2019t as good \u2026\u201d\n\nThere was also plenty of pushback online to such gripes, with Joe Dubin, a sports anchor at Nashville\u2019s WSMV, saying on Twitter, \u201cThose complaining about the Saints running the score up, please hush. You don\u2019t want a team running up the score on you, it\u2019s simple \u2026 stop them. I\u2019d go for 100 every game.\u201d\n\nPayton explained after the game that the decision to call that fourth-down play was informed by field position, with the Saints not wanting to risk a long field goal try that might be blocked. He also claimed that, with most of the fourth quarter left to go at that point, he was wary of Philadelphia\u2019s ability to potentially stage a comeback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have thoughts about what you want to do when there are still 15 minutes in the game,\u201d Payton said.\n\nWith the rout, the Saints improved to 9-1 and continued to make their case as favorites to replace the Eagles as NFL champions. Meanwhile, Philadelphia fell to the brink of playoff elimination at 4-6, leaving star tight end Zach Ertz to tell reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix internal problems before we look elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Being] winners of the Super Bowl last year doesn\u2019t win you a god---- game this year,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cSo when you look at what we\u2019ve done all year, our record is reflective of how we\u2019ve played.

Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nSaudi authorities have spent almost two months obfuscating what happened to slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All the while, the White House has played along, seeking to tamp down the outrage over Khashoggi\u2019s murder at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and shield Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince linked to Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nAfter first denying any hand in Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, Riyadh eventually admitted to presiding over his death in what the Saudis said was a botched operation carried out by \u201crogue\u201d agents. Last week, a Saudi prosecutor announced charges against 11 participants in the plot against Khashoggi, five of whom could face the death penalty. The prosecutor, as well as other prominent Saudi officials, emphasized that the crown prince had nothing to do with the crime.\n\nBut that claim took a sharp blow over the weekend, when The Washington Post revealed that the CIA has concluded Mohammed himself ordered Khashoggi\u2019s assassination.\n\n\u201cThe CIA\u2019s assessment, in which officials have said they have high confidence, is the most definitive to date linking Mohammed to the operation and complicates the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to preserve its relationship with a close ally,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cA team of 15 Saudi agents flew to Istanbul on government aircraft in October and killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate, where he had gone to pick up documents that he needed for his planned marriage to a Turkish woman.\u201d\n\nThe CIA says with high confidence that MBS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n\n\nTrump: \u201cWill anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know?\u201d pic.twitter.com/nybc2zUoRa \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) November 18, 2018\n\nAs a European intelligence official told the Guardian, the CIA\u2019s analysis is \u201chighly damaging to the kingdom\u2019s official narrative.\u201d The agency believes it is unlikely such an operation would have been carried out without the knowledge of MBS, as the crown prince is often called. Scrutiny of audio recordings from inside the consulate in Istanbul as well as intercepted phone calls by Saudi officials \u2014 including at least one between a member of the hit squad and a close aide to the crown prince \u2014 further cemented their conclusion.\n\nPublicly, both the White House and the State Department distanced themselves from the revelations. \u201cRecent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate,\u201d said Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cThere remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. The State Department will continue to seek all relevant facts.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, White House national security adviser John Bolton insisted that the intelligence he had seen did not implicate MBS. Trump, when pressed by reporters again Saturday, said little information had been \u201cassessed\u201d and that his administration would make its position clear on Tuesday. As my colleagues at The Post\u2019s editorial page argued, part of Trump\u2019s reticence may be due to his congenital unwillingness to admit that he was wrong \u2014 in this case, in placing such a big bet on MBS as a staunch U.S. ally.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where everyone basically knows what happened,\u201d said a Trump adviser who spoke to my colleagues on the condition of anonymity, indicating that Trump privately seemed to also believe that the crown prince was behind the murder.\n\n\u201cFor more than a month, Trump has struggled to balance his interest in maintaining strong relations with the Saudi government with growing pressure in Congress and around the world to punish the Saudi regime,\u201d noted my colleagues. \u201cTrump has told aides that he wants Mohammed to stay in power and that he sees the Saudis as the best strategic check on Iran and as a vital source of oil. Mohammed has a close relationship with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who helps to lead the administration\u2019s Middle East strategy.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has publicly come to the defense of the crown prince, who shares Netanyahu\u2019s antipathy toward Iran and reportedly harbors great admiration for Israel\u2019s economic success. In Trump, both the Saudis and Israelis have found an American leader eager to endorse their visions for the Middle East.\n\nMohammed\u2019s reckless behavior was already the subject of widespread scrutiny. Critics place blame on him for both the ruinous war in Yemen and a sweeping purge of rivals within the royal family and the Saudi business elite. But the death of Khashoggi, a Virginia resident with many influential friends in Washington, has focused attention on how the administration\u2019s own policies have further enabled that recklessness.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump shakes hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House in March. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nTrump\u2019s evasive messaging gave the Saudis room to brush off the latest allegations. \u201cThe claims in this purported assessment are false,\u201d Fatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told my colleagues. \u201cWe have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, though, it\u2019s a different story. Lawmakers from both parties are preparing to raise the pressure on Riyadh.\n\n\u201cIf he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,\u201d Sen. Lindsay O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday, referring to MBS. \u201cThey are an important ally, but when it comes to the crown prince, he is irrational, he is unhinged, and I think he has done a lot of damage to the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and I have no intention of working with him ever again.\u201d\n\nBut no matter the negative press, MBS is likely to ride out the storm. Just ask the CIA. \u201cThe general agreement is that he is likely to survive,\u201d said a U.S. official who briefed my colleagues. Mohammed\u2019s role as the future Saudi king, the official added, is \u201ctaken for granted.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

That\u2019s not a woman thing, though. It\u2019s just a her thing. I would have that issue with anyone who had her baggage, that same difficult-to-pin-down sense that something about her was fundamentally tainted.\n\nBut it is just this one woman in particular. And can I say how glad I am that we are at a point when we are able to judge women on their merits, as people, and find them inexplicably, inevitably wanting, as people? But definitely all women do not do this. There are plenty of women who do not make my teeth go on edge in the way this one lady does. My mother, for instance. My daughter, for another instance.

Not me \u2014 I was born ready! I was given birth to by a woman. So it\u2019s clear where I stand.\n\nThat is why I am so frustrated with the specific women who keep being put forward.

I want someone who is not tainted by polarizing choices in the past, but who also has experience, who is knowledgeable but doesn\u2019t sound like she is lecturing, someone vibrant but not green, someone dignified but not dowdy, passionate but not a yeller, precise but not mechanical, someone lacking in off-putting ambition but capable of asking for what she wants, not accompanied but not alone, in a day but not in a month or a year, when the moon is neither waxing nor waning, carrying a sieve full of water and a hen\u2019s tooth. Easy!\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so worried about our current slate of choices. A woman, sure, but \u2014 Kamala Harris? Elizabeth Warren? Kirsten Gillibrand? There are specific problems with each of them, entirely personal to each of them, all insurmountable. We need someone fresh. Someone without baggage. Joe Biden, maybe. But female!

(David Banks/Associated Press)\n\nTen games into their season, the Minnesota Vikings look nothing like a Super Bowl team. The huge contract that they handed to quarterback Kirk Cousins in free agency during the offseason has not been money well spent.\n\nCousins threw two interceptions Sunday night in Chicago, one of which was returned for a key fourth-quarter touchdown in the Vikings\u2019 25-20 loss to the Bears, which dropped Minnesota\u2019s record to 5-4-1.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about Cousins. He actually has put up good numbers this season. And the Vikings\u2019 biggest issue Sunday night was their inability to block Bears defensive standouts Khalil Mack and Akiem Hicks, not the play of Cousins.\n\nBut it\u2019s a bottom-line business. And the bottom line for Cousins and the Vikings is that they reached the NFC championship game last season with Case Keenum at quarterback, then said their farewell to him by signing Cousins to a fully guaranteed three-year, $84 million contract. The only way for the signing to be a success is for Cousins, a 4,000-yard passer in each of the previous three seasons for the Washington Redskins, to take the Vikings to the Super Bowl.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that\u2019s going to happen. The Vikings right now are not in the class of the New Orleans Saints and the Los Angeles Rams, the NFC\u2019s top teams. They can\u2019t even keep pace with the Bears in the NFC North. Chicago upped its record to 7-3 with the win.\n\n\u201cI thought Kirk Cousins would outplay [Bears quarterback] Mitch Trubisky,\u201d former NFL coach Tony Dungy said at halftime on the NBC telecast Sunday night. \u201cThat has not been the case.\u201d\n\nCousins spoke during the week about the need to avoid committing turnovers against a Chicago defense so adept at forcing them. He did not heed his own words.\n\nHe threw an ugly interception in the final seconds of the first half. While under pressure, Cousins sailed a pass high over the head of tight end Kyle Rudolph and directly into the hands of Bears safety Adrian Amos at the Chicago 8-yard line.\n\nThen in the fourth quarter, the Vikings trailed 14-6 when they got the ball at their 11-yard line with a little more than 8:30 to play. Cousins\u2019s pass toward wide receiver Laquon Treadwell was intercepted by Bears safety Eddie Jackson, who sprinted to the end zone. The Bears added a two-point conversion and pushed their advantage to 22-6.\n\nThe Vikings managed to make things interesting from there, all the way until an onside kick recovered by the Bears to seal the outcome in the final minute. Cousins piled up some passing yardage late. He threw touchdown passes in the final five minutes to wide receivers Aldrick Robinson and Stefon Diggs and ended with 262 yards on 30-for-46 passing.\n\nThat\u2019s not terrible. But, in truth, Cousins\u2019s biggest flaws were on display. He couldn\u2019t get out of the way of the pass rush. And when crunchtime arrived, he committed an ill-timed gaffe.\n\nThe Vikings\u2019 season isn\u2019t over. Even if they can\u2019t overtake the Bears in the division race, they have a chance at an NFC wild-card spot. But this is a season in which much more was expected. Sneaking into the postseason isn\u2019t enough. Even winning a playoff game or two and reaching the NFC championship game isn\u2019t enough.\n\nCousins was signed to be the final piece of a Super Bowl puzzle. It does not appear he will be that. To whom $84 million is given, much is expected. Cousins is finding that out.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nNFL Week 11: Bears top Vikings; Raiders, Broncos win on last-second kicks; Saints drub Eagles\n\nLamar Jackson runs Ravens back into the playoff race, and maybe Joe Flacco out of a job\n\nAlex Smith will miss rest of season after breaking leg in loss to Texans\n\nWeek 12 waiver wire moves: A dual-threat QB and pass-catching RB are quite enticing"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misdirection on Calif fires, climate - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misdirection on Calif fires, climate Washington Post WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is going too far in assigning most of the blame for California's devastating wildfires on the state's forest management.

Neither is true.\n\nCapping the weekend, the president also misspelled the name of a Democratic lawmaker in an unfortunate way and did not correct himself.\n\nA look at his recent statements, compared with the facts:\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\n\nTRUMP, speaking about the role of forest management in stemming wildfires: \u201cI was with the president of Finland and he said, \u2018We have a much different_we\u2019re a forest nation.\u2019 He called it a forest nation, and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d \u2014 remarks Saturday in Paradise, California.\n\nTHE FACTS: Finland apparently is not raking that many leaves.\n\nPresident Sauli Niinisto said in an interview published Sunday in the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that he told Trump during a brief meeting in Paris on Nov. 11 that \u201cFinland is a country covered by forests but we also have a good surveillance system and network\u201d in case of wildfires.\n\nNiinisto said he told Trump \u201cwe take care of our forests,\u201d but he couldn\u2019t recall mentioning anything on raking.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on the role of climate change: \u201cMaybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management...You need forest management. It has to be. I\u2019m not saying that in a negative way, a positive \u2014 I\u2019m just saying the facts.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d \u2014 tweet on Nov. 10.\n\nTHE FACTS: Both nature and humans share responsibility for the state\u2019s devastating wildfires, but fire scientists say the forest management is not the main contributor.\n\nNature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel. That\u2019s not to say California is blameless: Urban development encroaching on wildlands also is a factor. But about 19 million or 57 percent of California\u2019s 33 million acres of forests are managed or owned by the federal government, according to the University of California.\n\nThe wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas is the single deadliest such blaze in California history.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, has burned through shrubland, not forest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about forest management,\u201d said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \u201cThese aren\u2019t forests.\u201d\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan\u2019s environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \u201cis much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\u201d\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled from 30 years ago.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires.\n\n___\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe picked up two seats in the Senate. We went from 51-49 to 53-47.\u201d \u2014 remarks Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not so. He\u2019s presuming Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith will defeat Democrat Mike Espy in a runoff election Nov. 27. If Espy wins, Republicans will have picked up only one seat and have a 52-48 edge. It\u2019ll be 53-47 if she wins.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIA INVESTIGATION\n\nTRUMP: \u201cSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\u201d \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The correct name of the Democratic lawmaker is Adam Schiff.\n\nMueller\u2019s appointment to lead the investigation into 2016 election interference and possible ties between Moscow and Trump\u2019s campaign was not put to the Senate because special counsels are appointed by the Justice Department. His appointment is not in legal dispute.\n\nCritics contend Trump illegally sidestepped procedure by appointing Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who\u2019s been confirmed by the Senate.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on special counsel Robert Mueller and his team conducting the Russia investigation: \u201cThese are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years.\u201d \u2014tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Mueller, a longtime Republican, was chosen to lead the FBI by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001. Democratic President Barack Obama kept him in the job, and Mueller left in September 2013 after six years under Obama.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP, on his decision not to visit Arlington National Cemetery last week to commemorate Veterans Day: \u201cIn retrospect, I should have, and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris, and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state \u2014 doing other things.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: While Trump has visited Arlington National Cemetery twice during his presidency on Memorial Day, he did not do so last year on Veterans Day. He was in Asia at the time.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIn June, I proudly signed into law the most significant VA reform in half a century, called Veterans Choice. ... Now if a veteran cannot get the treatment they need from the VA in a timely manner, they can see a private doctor. They don\u2019t have to wait 12 days or 20 days. ... There is no more waiting on lines.\u201d \u2014 remarks at veterans\u2019 event Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He continues to spread a misleading claim about veterans now receiving immediate medical care because of his improvements. In fact, the care provided under the Veterans Choice program is not as instantaneous as Trump suggests nor will it necessarily be the biggest overhaul at the Department of Veterans Affairs in decades.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the private-sector Choice program, which was first approved in 2014 during the Obama administration after a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The current Choice program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment \u2014 not \u201c12 days or 20 days.\u201d But many are waiting much longer than the program prescribes.\n\nHow much Choice will be expanded under his law will depend on yet-to-be-completed regulations that will determine eligibility for veterans as well as available money for the program. The VA has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put money for VA or other domestic programs at risk of shortfalls next year.\n\nThe program\u2019s success will also depend on an overhaul of the VA\u2019s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, expected to take up to 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the current Choice program isn\u2019t always timely. A report released this year by the Government Accountability Office found that despite the Choice program\u2019s guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 days to 64 days.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cVeteran unemployment has reached its lowest level in nearly 21 years, and it\u2019s going to be better.\u201d \u2014 remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The veterans\u2019 unemployment rate fell to 2.9 percent in October, the latest data available, but that is still higher than the 2.7 percent rate reached in October 2017, also under Trump. That was the lowest joblessness rate for veterans in nearly 17 years.\n\nVeterans\u2019 unemployment has fallen mostly for the same reasons that joblessness has dropped generally: strong hiring and steady economic growth for the past eight years.\n\nIn May 2000, veterans\u2019 unemployment dropped to a low of 2.3 percent, and he hasn\u2019t reached that.\n\nIn any event, it\u2019s impossible for Trump to claim an achievement not seen in 21 years on veterans\u2019 unemployment. The data on joblessness for vets only go back 18 years, to 2000.\n\n___\n\nNATO\n\nTRUMP: \u201cEmmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d \u2014 tweet on Nov. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: Macron never suggested assembling a European army to stand against the United States, its steadfast military ally. Instead, he joined German Chancellor Angela Merkel in proposing a continental army that would give Europe more responsibility for its own security, supplementing NATO. Trump has repeatedly pushed NATO members to spend more on their own military capabilities to relieve pressure on the U.S. to protect Europe. A European army would be aimed at doing that, though in theory outside the NATO umbrella.\n\nMacron said in a radio interview before Trump\u2019s arrival in France that Europe should be able to defend itself more than it now can, without only relying on the United States.\n\nAt another point in the interview, Macron discussed hacking and other cyberthreats and asserted that on that front, France must protect itself from China, Russia and even the United States. His concern about U.S. hackers had nothing to do with military threats or forces.\n\nTrump misrepresented Macron\u2019s position on the matter before they met and again after they discussed it.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, on a judge\u2019s order that CNN reporter Jim Acosta be allowed back into the White House: \u201cToday, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\u201d \u2014 statement Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The court made no such determination. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly issued a ruling of a \u201climited nature\u201d that restored Acosta\u2019s credentials temporarily while a CNN lawsuit against the Trump administration proceeds. Kelly essentially found support for CNN\u2019s claim under the Fifth Amendment that Acosta hadn\u2019t received sufficient notice or explanation before his credentials were pulled. As a result, the judge didn\u2019t get to the First Amendment issues in the case.\n\n___\n\nTRADE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cOn Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\u201d \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Yes, U.S. wine is desired in France.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s been in the wine business, is wrong about France applying tariffs. The European Union does.\n\nHe\u2019s right about a disparity in wine duties.\n\nTariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors. A bottle of white American wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the EU carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents (just over 11 U.S. cents). A bottle of white wine from the EU exported to the United States has a customs duty of 5 U.S. cents.\n\nThe gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14.5 percent.\n\nBulk wines are another story. The U.S. tariff is double the EU one, a break for American producers because bulk wine represents 25 percent of the volume of U.S. wine coming into the EU, according to the French wine exporter federation.\n\nThe value of wine imported by France has jumped 200 percent over a decade. Meantime Americans are the top consumers of French wine exports.\n\n___\n\nVOTER ID\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID ...The only thing you don\u2019t is if you\u2019re a voter of the United States.\u201d \u2014 interview Wednesday with The Daily Caller.\n\nTHE FACTS: He is meaning to say that shoppers use a photo ID to make purchases, so it should not be a burden to show a photo ID for voting. But as shoppers know, no photo is required to purchase a box of cereal or other items at a grocery store when using cash or to make routine purchases with credit or debit cards.\n\nIdentifications are required to purchase limited items such as alcohol, cigarettes or cold medicine and in rapidly declining situations in which a customer opts to pay with a personal check.\n\nAccording to the National Grocers Association\u2019s most recent data, the use of checks as a percentage of total transactions dropped from 33 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in 2015, due in part to the popularity of debit cards, which use PIN codes. The group\u2019s members are independent food retailers, family-owned or privately held, both large and small.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jessica Gresko, Darlene Superville, Christopher Rugaber and Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

On Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, Gillum ended his hard-fought campaign, just hours before counties must turn in their official results following days of recounting ballots. (Steve Cannon, Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 This was the year Florida\u2019s Democrats spoke ambitiously of ending their 20-year journey in political exile in this battleground state. Instead, election results after a tense and bruising recount showed Republicans coming out on top for governor and even picking up a U.S. Senate seat.\n\nAfter a recount dragged on for nearly two weeks, top Democratic candidates in the state came agonizingly close but fell short of their avowed goal.\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum conceded Saturday, followed by three-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson a day later. More than 8 million voters weighed in \u2014 a far higher turnout than in past midterm elections \u2014 but the result was the same for Democrats.\n\nWhen official returns were posted Sunday, Republican Gov. Rick Scott led Nelson in the Senate race by slightly more than 10,000 votes. Republican Ron DeSantis edged Gillum, Florida\u2019s first African-American nominee for governor, by more than 32,000 votes. State officials will certify the official results Tuesday.\n\nThe close of nearly two weeks of high political drama in the presidential swing state likely spelled the end of the political career of the 76-year-old Nelson. First elected to Congress 40 years ago, Nelson had been a Democratic survivor in an era when Republicans swept to power in Florida in the \u201890s. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000 and seeking a fourth term.\n\n\u201cIt has been a rewarding journey as well as a very humbling experience,\u201d Nelson said in a videotaped statement . \u201cI was not victorious in this race but I still wish to strongly re-affirm the cause for which we fought: A public office is a public trust.\u201d\n\nThe political journey, however, appears to still be unfolding for Gillum, who ran on a liberal platform that included expanding Medicaid and raising taxes to spend more on education \u2014 both potential hard sells in the GOP-controlled Legislature.\n\nIn his concession video , Gillum told supporters to \u201cstay tuned\u201d about his next move.\n\n\u201cAlthough nobody wanted to be governor more than me that this was not just about an election cycle,\u201d said the 39-year-old Tallahassee mayor. \u201cThis was about creating the type of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government, in our state, and in our communities. We know that this fight continues.\u201d\n\nNow, ahead of the 2020 presidential election, it will be Republicans again in firm control in Florida. A Scott victory means Florida will now have two Republican senates while padding the chamber\u2019s Republican majority.\n\nNelson, a Florida native with a distinct twang, fought a hard and acrimonious race against Scott, a multimillionaire businessman and relative newcomer who jumped into politics eight years ago and was urged to run this time by President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd it was the third time Scott barely edged a Democratic opponent.\n\n\u201cNow the campaign truly is behind us, and that\u2019s where we need to leave it,\u201d Scott said in a statement after official results were posted. \u201cWe must do what Americans have always done: come together for the good of our state and our country. My focus will not be on looking backward, but on doing exactly what I ran on: making Washington work.\u201d\n\nTrump congratulated Scott on Twitter: \u201cFrom day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!\u201d\n\nWhile Scott and Nelson disagreed on such key issues as gun control, health care and the environment, their campaign focused primarily on attacking each other\u2019s character and competence.\n\nScott bashed his rival as ineffective and out-of-touch in TV ads paid for by more than $60 million of the Republican\u2019s own money.\n\nNelson branded Scott as a Trump follower who used the governor\u2019s office to pad his wealth.\n\nNelson and his allies also ran ads that questioned Scott\u2019s ethics, pointing to his ouster years ago as chief executive of health care giant Columbia/HCA amid a federal fraud investigation. Scott was never charged with any wrongdoing, though the health care conglomerate paid a then-record $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud.\n\nNelson was seen as a moderate who rarely made waves or earned much national exposure as he largely devoted himself to Florida-specific issues. One of his more notable moments came when he flew on Space Shuttle Columbia while serving in Congress.\n\nHis only other election loss came in 1990 in a Democratic primary for governor \u2014 to the eventual winner Lawton Chiles.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, said he would miss working with Nelson.\n\n\u201cI knew Bill Nelson not just as a Democratic senator, but also as a man of genuine faith, integrity and character,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cA man who served our country with a dignity that is increasingly rare in our modern politics.\u201d\n\nAfter it became clear the Senate race would head to a legally required recount, Nelson and Democrats filed several lawsuits that challenged everything from Scott\u2019s authority over the state\u2019s election division to deadlines for mail-in ballots.\n\nRepublicans also raised questions about how some South Florida election officials were counting the ballots.\n\nThe South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported late Sunday that one of those officials, Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, had presented a resignation letter to step down in January. The report cited an attorney who works as counsel to the Broward elections office, Burnadette Norris-Weeks. Snipes couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We stayed married for three years before I cried uncle and filed for divorce, with his agreement that it was the right thing to do. While it was painful at first, we have wound up more or less friends again, and share a social circle.\n\nHe is getting married again in four weeks, and I'm invited to the wedding. First marriage for the new bride. I've been perusing their wedding website and, maybe this is my glass of wine talking, but I'm having a hard time with all the quotes and hashtags that reference \"forever.\" She is so happy they will be together \"forever.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I hope their marriage works out, but that language seems ridiculous considering he has been married before, believing it would be \"forever,\" and it wasn't. This is leading me to rethink attending their wedding \u2014 I'm afraid I might scoff my way through the ceiling. Any ideas to reshape my thinking?\n\n\u2014 Feeling Discarded\n\nFeeling Discarded: Oh, but it\u2019s so easy \u2014 you guys thought it was forever, but you were \u201cimagination-lacking, codependent and afraid to let go\u201d (now there\u2019s a sign to have tastefully lettered and mounted over my sink), and this time the couple is mature and clear-eyed and in loooove enough for a lifetime.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nBut do you really want to live in a world where hope never triumphs over experience?\n\nAnd/or where a bride-to-be hashtags, #hopingitsticks?\n\nI don\u2019t. But if you do, or if you don\u2019t but you\u2019re not feeling it, and/or if you present even the slightest scoff risk, then maybe it\u2019s time to back out. Doing so four weeks out is not the most polite move ever, but it beats the day before, and it beats eye-rolling the bride.\n\nRe: Scoffing: She and her ex \"have wound up more or less friends again,\" but the letter suggests \"less\" is winning out. Skipping the wedding seems like a mercy.\n\n\u2014 Merciful\n\nRe: Ex's Wedding: Don't go. I have a few friends who have attended the wedding of an ex and it always turned out to be a bad idea. Not necessarily because they did something dramatic and embarrassing there, but because my friends came away feeling like crap. The nature of a wedding is just not designed to leave an ex feeling good about attending.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nRe: Wedding: I'm getting married soon. Three of my four bridesmaids are my fiance's exes. Last weekend I was my best friend's maid of honor. My date was my fiance, her ex-boyfriend. They're good friends.

(Vincent Yu/Associated Press)\n\nHONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong protest leaders who went on trial Monday for spearheading pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 said their prosecution threatens the future of civil rights in the territory, where fears have grown of Beijing\u2019s growing influence.\n\n\u201cWhat is on trial is not just the nine of us. What is on trial also is the high degree of autonomy and the rule of law that all Hong Kong people are entitled to,\u201d said defendant and University of Hong Kong law professor Benny Tai at a news conference following the first day of the trial.\n\nTai, along with another professor and a pastor, were leaders of the \u201cOccupy Central\u201d campaign to press for free elections of Hong Kong\u2019s top leader. They are charged with conspiracy to commit a public disturbance and incitement to commit public nuisance.\n\nProtesters in what was also known as the umbrella movement laid siege to the government headquarters and paralyzed Hong Kong\u2019s financial district for 79 days but failed to win any concessions. Thousands staked out encampments on major thoroughfares. Several hundred were arrested.\n\nThe other defendants \u2014 two current and one former lawmaker, two student leaders and a political activist \u2014 face charges of incitement to commit a public nuisance. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years.\n\n\u201cAll of us pleaded not guilty because we believe the charges are unreasonable, unconstitutional and unprecedented,\u201d said Chan Kin-man, a sociology professor who is described by prosecutors as Tai\u2019s co-conspirator.\n\nThe defendants pumped their fists in the air and chanted \u201cShame to political prosecution!\u201d before entering the West Kowloon courthouse. They were joined by more than 100 supporters, some raising the yellow umbrellas that came to represent the movement because demonstrators used them to defend themselves from police attacks.\n\nThree university students prosecuted in 2016 for their leadership roles in the protests received community service. But Hong Kong judges have since faced mounting pressure from Beijing to hand down heavier sentences to deter future protests.\n\nSome in the semi-autonomous Chinese city fear that central government meddling will erode judiciary independence, a bedrock value that undergirds the city\u2019s standing as a global business capital.\n\nThe former British colony was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement in which China promised it could retain its own laws, economic system and civil rights for 50 years.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s ruling Communist Party under authoritarian President Xi Jinping appears to be growing impatient with efforts by Hong Kong activists to promote greater democracy. The Hong Kong government recently banned a local political party that advocated the territory\u2019s independence from Beijing.\n\nRanging in age from 30 to 74, the nine defendants span generations of Hong Kong citizens who have been agitating for full democracy.

Not surprisingly, it led to more than a few Austin Powers-related, \u201cWho throws a shoe, honestly?\u201d references, as well as other humorous reactions.\n\nAs ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks pointed out, that \u201ccould be one expensive shoe.\u201d He noted that NBA players who have recently tossed items into the stands, including Kyrie Irving (ball), Austin Rivers (seat cushion) and Stephen Curry (mouthpiece) were all fined $25,000 by the league.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Richardson said after the game.\n\nBy getting sent to the locker room with 6:31 left in the contest, Richardson wasn\u2019t around to watch James put the finishing touches on a masterpiece. The Lakers forward, who led the Heat to four straight appearances in the NBA Finals and two titles from 2011 to 2014, scored 51 points in his team\u2019s 113-97 win.\n\nJames is coming off four seasons with the Cavaliers, for whom he began his career, and he went 0-4 against the Heat in that second stint while sitting out a few games versus Miami. On Sunday, he not only got the win in his first try as a Laker, he became just the third NBA player to score 50 points with three different franchises.\n\nThe 40th overall pick in the 2015 draft, Richardson has developed into a player so prized by the Heat that the team reportedly balked at including him in a possible trade for Jimmy Butler. Entering the game against the Lakers, he was averaging 20.6 points per game and shooting .452 from three-point range on the season.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press)\n\nCARSON, Calif. \u2014 Philip Rivers\u2019 arm was already in motion when he realized Von Miller had read him like a book again. The Broncos\u2019 superstar linebacker was about to jump another screen route for his second interception.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 quarterback couldn\u2019t stop his final throw with 1:58 to play. He only managed to guide it into the ground for a clock-stopping incompletion on third down.\n\nRivers left the field enormously frustrated. The Chargers (7-3) were about to feel a whole lot worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to pull the ball back and take a sack or find a way to complete it,\u201d Rivers said. \u201c(But) we shouldn\u2019t have been in that situation. It should have been about 33-7 at that point.\u201d\n\nRivers\u2019 incompletion meant Denver got 111 seconds to make its final drive, instead of only 70 seconds or so if Rivers had simply knelt down while the Broncos were out of timeouts.\n\nThe Broncos made every last second count, hitting a field goal as time expired for a 23-22 victory that ended the Chargers\u2019 six-game winning streak in crushing fashion.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one where, you know, (Rivers) probably should have just ate it,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nInstead, the Chargers got a cold slap of reality when their impressive roll through the middle of the season ended in gut-wrenching fashion. The Bolts had multiple opportunities to put away the Broncos while outgaining them 479-325 and keeping the ball for nearly 38 minutes, but LA was undone by turnovers, penalties, mental errors, a replay review, a fake punt and just about any other mistake you can conjure under the California sun.\n\n\u201cWhen you make some errors we made today in critical moments, you open yourselves up to get beat, and that\u2019s what happened today,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe had every opportunity to close it out, and we just didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\n\nAfter spending the previous five weeks on the road, the Chargers lost at home for only the second time in nine games since Oct. 1, 2017. Lynn saw plenty of blame to be distributed throughout his roster after his team\u2019s first loss anywhere since Sept. 23.\n\nA fairly disciplined team committed a whopping 14 penalties for 120 yards. They ranged from the bizarre \u2014 Keenan Allen getting an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after his TD reception for trying on a championship belt held by a fan in the end zone stands \u2014 to the tired monotony of ordinary discipline lapses, including seven penalties in the first quarter alone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Lynn said after the Chargers racked up the most penalties of his 26-game tenure. \u201cThose are things that we\u2019ve stayed away from: penalties and turnovers. They showed up today, and for whatever reason, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll figure it out, though.\u201d\n\nFor the second straight week, the Chargers\u2019 special-teamers were fooled by a fake punt \u2014 and Denver scored its first touchdown on the next snap in the second quarter. Mike Badgley also missed the Chargers\u2019 NFL-worst seventh extra point.\n\nRivers passed for 401 yards with two touchdowns, but the veteran also had multiple interceptions for the first time since a loss at Kansas City last December.\n\nThe Chargers were up 19-7 and driving in Broncos territory late in the third quarter when Miller jumped a screen and returned his interception 42 yards , setting up a Denver TD just three plays later.\n\nAfter the teams traded the lead early in the fourth quarter, the Chargers thought they had forced a game-deciding turnover twice \u2014 only to see a fumble turned into an incomplete pass by video review, followed by an interception that was wiped out by a defensive holding penalty with 4:40 to play.\n\nEven after all of that, Los Angeles still needed just one score, one big play \u2014 even three yards and a cloud of dust.\n\nOn their final drive, the Bolts had a second-and-3 play near midfield with 2:39 to play, needing only a first down to wrap it up. But after Denver\u2019s final timeout, running back Melvin Gordon simply went the wrong way on a running play, and Rivers was forced to take a sack before the two-minute warning.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no excuses for it,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s the down to go get it to win the game. You just can\u2019t make that mistake, and I did today. ... It\u2019s just puzzling and just frustrating. We know we could have won this game. We should have won this game, and everybody in this locker room knows that. We fell short.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 The United States closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the busiest border crossing with Mexico to install new security barriers on Monday, a day after hundreds of Tijuana residents protested against the presence of thousands of Central American migrants.\n\nThe U.S. also closed one of two pedestrian crossings at the San Ysidro crossing in a move apparently aimed at preventing any mass rush of migrants across the border.\n\nThe installation of movable, wire-topped barriers threatens to complicate life for Mexicans using San Ysidro, where about 110,000 people enter the U.S. every day in 40,000 vehicles.\n\nLong lines backed up in Tijuana, where many people have to cross the border to work on the U.S. side.\n\nSuch inconveniences prompted by the arrival of the migrant caravan may have played a role in Sunday\u2019s protests, when about 400 Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \u201cOut! Out!\u201d referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road \u2014 and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana\u2019s main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nSome Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \u201cinvasion.\u201d And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them in Tijuana,\u201d protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don\u2019t have criminal records.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don\u2019t represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: \u201cChildhood has no borders.\u201d\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \u201cWe want them to return to Honduras,\u201d said Rivera.\n\nThe migrants\u2019 expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants\u2019 arrival an \u201cavalanche\u201d that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city\u2019s privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \u201cWe are fleeing violence,\u201d said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \u201cHow can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S.\n\nEdwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \u201cthe U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\u201d\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \u201cCatch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Julie Watson contributed to this story from Tijuana and Marcos Aleman contributed from San Salvador.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It\u2019s not the broken bones that register or the incredible pain that\u2019s arriving or the surgery that\u2019s coming or the months of rehabilitation that may or may not return you to a reasonable facsimile of the player you were an instant before the injury. Instead, the physical injury evokes a deep emotional empathy.\n\n\u201cAlex has had a great career, obviously, without a doubt. But when you have an injury like that, it\u2019s more heartbreaking than it is physical,\u201d Washington Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said Sunday after his dignified, universally respected veteran quarterback was lost for the season in a 23-21 defeat to Houston. \u201cJust breaks your heart because this is what he loves to do, loves to lead this team, loves to be with the guys, and now the season is over and he has a long way back. It\u2019s just hard to watch that happen to any athlete.\u201d\n\n[Alex Smith will miss the rest of the year after breaking his leg against the Texans]\n\nSmith\u2019s career, it\u2019s logical to assume, must now be resurrected, not merely resumed next year. The rest of us measure our skills and careers, our dreams and ambitions, in decades. NFL players measure them in those precious years. The disastrous injury that makes many of us turn away makes them turn inward. Their response is akin to someone dying or being in mortal danger because their athletic career, which resides at the center for so many of them, is in grave danger.\n\n\u201cYou say your prayers [for Smith] and get ready for the next play,\u201d center Chase Roullier said.\n\nFootball is different. You can get badly hurt in almost any game. But to those who have played all the sports, football is simply different; the action is so fast and violent, you simply cannot control what will happen to your body in the next instant, from any direction. You have to disregard your body to play at all. Vince Lombardi called the mental state to play the game properly \u201creckless abandon.\u201d In other words, play as if you\u2019re using somebody else\u2019s body.\n\nAs exhilarating as that can be, the dark side comes in a blink. A blitzing cornerback Kareem Jackson hits you first, knocking you back, then perhaps the most violent and feared player in the entire NFL, 285-pound J.J. Watt, a mammoth with sprinter\u2019s speed, plows into you an instant later \u2014 his body against your head, driving and twisting you as everybody falls in a random spinning tangle. When it\u2019s over, everybody looks around and most pick themselves up off the turf \u2014 except one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all gutted for Alex,\u201d said Watt, who came to midfield with the entire Houston defense to join the Redskins as Smith sat on a cart, his leg in an inflatable immobilizer, to rub his head, pat his back, bump his knuckles or mutter a word. \u201cYou know the risks going into it, but you never want to see anybody hurt, especially out for the year. I absolutely feel terrible for him. It sucks. It\u2019s the worst part of the game.\u201d\n\nAmong those at midfield was Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. \u201cYou never know when that play is going to happen,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood. We are battling out there, but at the end of the day we all support each other. . . . I just wanted to pay him respect.\u201d\n\nRoullier did not look at his quarterback\u2019s leg. \u201cI just saw him begin to move upward and then fall straight back,\u201d Roullier said. \u201cWhen we get to that in the [game] film, we\u2019ll speed past it \u2014 watching it hurts yourself. Horrible to see. Speed past that.\u201d\n\nMillions of fans have seen similar stomach-turning famous plays that can barely be watched, two of them to other Redskins quarterbacks \u2014 Joe Theismann 33 years ago to the day and Robert Griffin III in the playoffs six years ago. Theismann never played again after an injury that broke the same two bones as Smith. Griffin tore up his knee so badly that his leg collapsed under him. He hasn\u2019t been the same player since.\n\n[Exactly 33 years since his own gruesome injury, Joe Theismann \u2018just so upset\u2019 for Alex Smith]\n\nAs expected and as is proper, the Redskins all predicted a near-inevitable return by Smith, even though they cannot have any clue, nor can they use Smith\u2019s history of recovering from career-threatening injuries to be a predictor. They\u2019re bonded by the athlete\u2019s approach to injury \u2014 measured in the time, effort and pain needed to rehabilitate it. Never recover, like Theismann? That\u2019s not on the menu, even for a financially protected player such as Smith who wisely negotiated a contract extension with the Redskins as a condition of his trade from Kansas City last season that guarantees him $71 million if he never plays another snap. His salary and cap hit would linger if he never returns.\n\n\u201cIn my heart, the compassion is there,\u201d said tight end Vernon Davis, whose relationship with Smith goes back to their playing days in San Francisco. \u201cI played with him so long, he\u2019s like a brother. To see him go down and suffer is like, \u2018Why not me?\u2019 Maybe I should suffer and let him continue to go out there and do his job and help this team win.\u201d\n\nTo most of us, saying \u201cmy leg for his\u201d sounds incomprehensible. Don\u2019t discount it. The higher the risk, the tighter the bonds.\n\n\u201cI know how much work he\u2019s put in,\u201d Davis said. \u201cStarting from San Francisco, going to Kansas City, he\u2019s worked extremely hard. He\u2019s resilient. He\u2019s the most resilient person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nThe football damage to Washington from this injury probably will fall along the line from \u201clarge\u201d to \u201cenormous.\u201d Smith was supposed to be the Redskins\u2019 starter for several years, at least, and the man who would make fans forget the departure of Kirk Cousins for Minnesota. Now Smith\u2019s future, especially since mobility and throwing on the move are essential to him, is under a cloud.\n\nWashington has a solid backup in Colt McCoy, 32, who knows Gruden\u2019s offense inside out and has a 27-23 ratio of touchdown passes to interceptions in his career. But \u201cgood backup\u201d is a relative term. McCoy is a spunky gunslinger type, capable of big plays and hot games but, over time, more likely to outweigh those moments with big mistakes and limits of talent. McCoy has not started a game in six of the past seven seasons. His career record as a starter is 7-18.\n\nAnd everybody loves him. \u201cI\u2019m a big firm believer in Colt McCoy\u2019s talent. . . . This is the opportunity of a lifetime for him. I know he would like it in different circumstances,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nIt\u2019s conceivable that, short term, McCoy can be a viable replacement for Smith simply because the starter has been so ordinary this season, largely because the Redskins have ordinary skill players, plus three injured starting linemen.\n\n\u201cColt is the strongest competitor I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Roullier said. \u201cEven when he\u2019s out there leading the scout team, it\u2019s like a Super Bowl every single day for him.\u201d\n\nWashington, team and town, will try to rally around McCoy because he has earned the chance, sports really do have Cinder-fella stories and the Redskins, still a respectable 6-4, may make the playoffs if they can simply find a way to scrap to a 9-7 record with the help of manageable games coming up such as those against the Giants and Jaguars.\n\nThose thoughts are for the future. This is a day that will be remembered for the third-quarter scene of both the Redskins and Texans gathering around one of the NFL\u2019s most respected overachieving players who led the league in quarterback rating last season. They surrounded him in a bonded silence of dangerous men who perfect their ability to do dangerous things but who, in that moment, all felt \u201cgutted\u201d or \u201cheartbroken\u201d for the one member of their brotherhood who could not get off the ground.\n\nThough he could not stand, Alex Smith stood for them all.\n\nFor more by Thomas Boswell, visit washingtonpost.com/boswell."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Jackson carries 27 times, lifts Ravens past Bengals 24-21 - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Jackson carries 27 times, lifts Ravens past Bengals 24-21 Washington Post BALTIMORE \u2014 In the days leading up to his first NFL start, Lamar Jackson experienced a stomach ache and insomnia.

(Nick Wass/Associated Press)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 In the days leading up to his first NFL start, Lamar Jackson experienced a stomach ache and insomnia.\n\nWhen the rookie quarterback finally got on the field, Jackson inflicted a whole lot of pain on the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nJackson juked and sprinted for 117 yards, Gus Edwards ran for 115 and the Baltimore Ravens ground out a 24-21 victory Sunday to end a three-game losing streak.\n\nFlashing the moves that enabled him to win the 2016 Heisman Trophy at Louisville, Jackson zipped in and out of the pocket for 27 carries. Though the Ravens (5-5) relied heavily on the run, Jackson also completed 13 of 19 passes for 150 yards with an interception.\n\n\u201cWe came out with a win, so it was pretty good, I guess,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI had butterflies before the first tackle, but after the first tackle, it was game on.\u201d\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco did not practice all week and was inactive with a right hip injury. That created an opening for Jackson, the 32nd overall pick in the NFL draft.\n\nBut Jackson missed practice Thursday with a stomach ailment that led to a trip to the hospital, where he was treated and released. Then, sleep eluded him Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI think I stayed up all night,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI was ready to play last night.\u201d\n\nBefore Sunday, Jackson occasionally took snaps in running situations and replaced Flacco in the fourth quarter of two blowouts. Having to carry the load by himself, Jackson responded with a solid performance in a game the Ravens had to win.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty, wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was us,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cIt was the Ravens, and we won the football game.\u201d\n\nDown 21-13 in the second half, Baltimore rallied to hand the sinking Bengals (5-5) their fourth loss in five games.\n\nEdwards, an undrafted rookie free agent, scored on an 11-yard run and barreled in for the conversion late in the third quarter. Jackson then directed a 55-yard drive that ended with a field goal by Justin Tucker with 8:12 remaining.\n\n\u201cMy teammates had my backs, and I had theirs,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nCincinnati\u2019s Randy Bullock missed a potential tying 52-yard field goal with 3:59 left, and Andy Dalton\u2019s fourth-down pass from the Baltimore 37 with 1:42 to go was knocked away by Marlon Humphrey.\n\n\u201cI definitely thought we were going to go down there, we were going to score and win the game,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nThis was a tough defeat for the Bengals, who were soaring at 4-1 in October but now stand at .500 for the first time after letting Jackson run rampant.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to get him stopped enough,\u201d said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, who fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday after the unit allowed 500 yards in three straight games, an NFL record in the Super Bowl era. Lewis took control of the defense, which was better this time around despite allowing 265 yards rushing.\n\n\u201cI thought they played hard,\u201d Lewis said of his defense. \u201cI thought they played better and did a good job on assignments.\u201d\n\nJackson ran 10 times for 64 yards and five first downs , Alex Collins scored on a 7-yard run to cap the opening drive, and the Ravens took a 13-7 halftime lead when Tucker drilled a 56-yard field goal.\n\nIt all came apart for Baltimore in the third quarter. Jackson threw his first NFL interception , a pick by Shawn Williams, whose 22-yard return set up a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Matt Lengel for a 14-13 lead.\n\nOn the next series, Jackson was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 from the Baltimore 45. Dalton turned the gamble into a touchdown, hitting John Ross on the right side of the end zone for a 22-yard score.\n\nBut the Ravens rallied.\n\nKEEP \u2018EM GUESSING\n\nThough Jackson lacks experience, he certainly knows how to keep a defense guessing. More than Flacco, anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like two different offenses,\u201d Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict said. \u201cWith Joe Flacco, he just stands back there and isn\u2019t very mobile but throws the ball hard. This guy (Jackson) is very unpredictable.\u201d\n\nBut can he win a game with his arm?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how well he throws the ball,\u201d Burfict said. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nROOKIE QBS\n\nThis is the first season in NFL history in which five rookie quarterbacks selected in the first round of the same draft have started at least one game.

Griffin lined up as a receiver in the second quarter but did not touch the ball.\n\nREADY AND RESTED\n\nThe Ravens improved to 9-2 after a bye under Harbaugh, and they\u2019re 14-3 since 2002 following an extra week off.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBengals: WR A.J.

The international tribunal to judge the criminal responsibility of former Khmer Rouge leaders for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians opened its session Friday to deliver its verdicts on charges of genocide and other crimes. (Mark Peters/Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Cambodia has reiterated it intends to end the work of the U.N.-backed tribunal that last week convicted the last two surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng said the tribunal\u2019s work had been completed and there would not be any additional prosecutions for acts that led to the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people in the 1970s. The only other person convicted was the regime\u2019s prisons chief.\n\nHe cited the terms under which the tribunal, staffed jointly by Cambodian and international prosecutors and judges, had been established, limiting its targets to senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime that was in power from 1975 to 1979. The rules also allow prosecuting those most responsible for carrying out atrocities.\n\nSar Kheng spoke Saturday at a government ceremony in the northern province of Oddar Meanchey and his remarks were reported Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal convicted and gave life sentences to Nuon Chea, 92, the main Khmer Rouge ideologist and right-hand man to its late leader Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 87, who was the regime\u2019s head of state. The sentences were merged with the life sentences they were already serving after an earlier conviction for crimes against humanity.\n\nIn nine years of hearings and at a cost exceeding $300 million, the tribunal has convicted only one other defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nCases of four more suspects, middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, had already been processed for prosecution but have been scuttled or stalled. Without the cooperation of the Cambodian members of the tribunal, no cases can go forward.\n\nLong-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly declared there would be no more prosecutions, claiming they could cause unrest. Hun Sen himself was a midlevel commander with the Khmer Rouge before defecting while the group was still in power, and several senior members of his ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party share similar backgrounds. He helped cement his political control by making alliances with other former Khmer Rouge commanders.\n\nIn his remarks, Sar Kheng sought to reassure former Khmer Rouge members that they would not face prosecution.\n\n\u201cBecause there are some former Khmer Rouge officers living in this area, I would like to clarify that there will be no more investigations taking place (against lower-ranking Khmer Rouge members), so you don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d said Sar Kheng, who is also interior minister.\n\nHe acknowledged that even without more prosecutions, the tribunal still had to hear the appeals expected to be lodged by Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, but aside from that task, its work was finished.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

William H. McRaven, amid other recent remarks and decisions that have fanned controversy in the ranks and among some who served.\n\nIn an interview with Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Trump went after McRaven, the retired Navy SEAL and Special Operations commander who oversaw the killing of Osama bin Laden and the capture of Saddam Hussein during his 37 years in the U.S. military.\n\nTrump derided McRaven as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer\u201d before suggesting that the four-star admiral, who recently left his post as chancellor of the University of Texas amid a battle with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, should have caught bin Laden faster.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know, living \u2014 think of this \u2014 living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan, in what I guess they considered a nice mansion, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve seen nicer. But living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\u201d\n\nThe comments escalated a war of words that began last year when McRaven called Trump\u2019s description of the news media as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d the greatest threat to American democracy he had ever seen.\n\n\n\nRetired Adm. William H. McRaven (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThis past summer, McRaven went to bat for John Brennan, defending the former CIA director as a man of integrity in an article in The Washington Post, after Trump revoked Brennan\u2019s security clearance.\n\nIn a rare moment of political candor, McRaven wrote that Trump, instead of putting others above himself and setting an example as president, had \u201cembarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement initially released to CNN and confirmed by The Post, McRaven said he didn\u2019t back Clinton or anyone else in the 2016 presidential election and was a fan of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, both of whom he worked for while in uniform.\n\n\u201cI admire all presidents, regardless of their political party, who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the nation together in challenging times,\u201d McRaven said.\n\nFormer CIA deputy director Michael Morell pointed out on Twitter that McRaven\u2019s forces had nothing to do with locating bin Laden. Morell said it was the CIA that did the \u201cfinding\u201d and McRaven\u2019s forces that did the \u201cgetting,\u201d moving out within days of receiving the order.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks about McRaven came amid broader questions about Trump\u2019s relationship with military matters.\n\nDuring a recent trip to France, the president did not attend a ceremony commemorating the centenary of the armistice ending World War I because of rain, with the White House saying his helicopter couldn\u2019t fly in the inclement weather and a motorcade would have caused too much traffic. Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended the ceremony at a U.S. military cemetery.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t visit Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day this year because he was traveling home from France and didn\u2019t go to the ceremony or hold any public events to honor U.S. veterans on the Monday holiday.\n\nTrump admitted he should have gone to Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day.\n\n\u201cI should have done that,\u201d Trump told Wallace. \u201cI was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling, as you know.\u201d\n\nTrump recently has signaled discontent with the top retired generals serving in his administration, raising questions about whether he is souring on the military brass in his orbit. Earlier this year, he derided Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as \u201csort of a Democrat.\u201d In Sunday\u2019s interview, he said that there are things Kelly does that he doesn\u2019t like and that at some point he will move on from the chief of staff position.\n\nThe comments followed the president\u2019s decision to thrust the American military into the center of a political maelstrom ahead of the midterm elections by sending thousands of troops to the border with Mexico in what critics labeled a political stunt to fire up anti-immigrant sentiment among his base.\n\nTrump said the move was a necessary measure to help U.S. Customs and Border Protection prepare for the \u201cinvasion\u201d of thousands of migrants who he said, without evidence, included \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d and \u201cbad people.\u201d\n\nAhead of the election, Trump said he was sending as many as 10,000 to 15,000 troops to the border, but the military said last week that the number of active-duty troops deployed in fact had peaked at about 5,900. An additional 2,000 members of the National Guard have been there since April.\n\nAlthough Mattis defended the deployment as necessary support for the Department of Homeland Security and good training for troops, other members of the military community took offense at what they saw as a wasteful politicization of the armed forces.\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion that soldiers would shoot migrants who threw rocks at them prompted retired Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to tag the mission as wasteful, while clarifying that men and women in uniform wouldn\u2019t use disproportionate force.\n\nTrump, who attended New York Military Academy but avoided serving in the Vietnam War through draft deferments, also answered questions Sunday about why he hadn\u2019t visited American troops serving in combat zones in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI think you will see that happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere are things that are being planned.\u201d\n\nBut former and current administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, didn\u2019t recall hearing about the possibility of Trump visiting troops in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria during his first year and a half in office. An attempt to visit the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in late 2017 was scuttled by bad weather.\n\nTrump has also been a vocal advocate of withdrawing from the conflicts where American troops are deployed abroad, but Mattis and other national security officials have persuaded him to stay the course in Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhen Wallace pointed out during Sunday\u2019s interview that Trump hadn\u2019t visited troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, the president was quick to note that he opposed the war in Iraq, although it\u2019s unclear if he ever voiced that opposition before the 2003 invasion.\n\n\u201cBut this is about the soldiers, sir,\u201d Wallace said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Trump replied. He promised to make a visit despite his \u201cunbelievably busy schedule . . . on top of which you have these phony witch hunts.\u201d\n\nMonetary support for the military has long been at the heart of Trump\u2019s political messaging.\n\nWhen former first lady Michelle Obama said in a newly released book that she couldn\u2019t forgive Trump for loud and reckless innuendos about her husband\u2019s birthplace that endangered her family, Trump quickly shot back that he couldn\u2019t forgive his immediate predecessor for \u201cwhat he did to our military.\u201d\n\nYears of budget caps damaged the American military\u2019s preparedness, according to the Pentagon, which says the consistent funding during the first two years of the Trump administration has helped assuage problems with training, maintenance, personnel and equipment.\n\nIn August, Trump signed a $716 billion defense bill, including a $639 billion baseline budget that was the nation\u2019s largest in adjusted terms since World War II, a 2.6 percent pay raise for troops and critical investments in equipment maintenance. The overall defense budget, which includes active operations, was higher in the Bush and Obama years during the surge in Iraq.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the Trump administration has signaled that budgetary largesse for the military that characterized the president\u2019s first two years in office is unlikely to continue.\n\nAfter the federal deficit jumped by 17 percent in part in response to last year\u2019s Republican-led tax cut, Trump ordered government agencies to slash their budgets for the coming year by about 5 percent, which would amount to a roughly $33 billion reduction for the military."}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "North Carolina man's body found in Mexican canyons - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post North Carolina man's body found in Mexican canyons Washington Post The governor of a northern Mexico state where a North Carolina man was slain last month said the alleged perpetrator will pay dearly for the crime.

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged the existence of an audio recording of journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul but said he has not listened to what he called the \u201csuffering tape\u201d and dismissed a growing clamor among lawmakers for Saudi Arabia to face more serious consequences for the killing.\n\nBased in part on the tape and other intercepted communications, the CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered last month\u2019s killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi leaders and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post.\n\nBut Trump maintained in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the crown prince had told him \u201cmaybe five different times\u201d and \u201cas recently as a few days ago\u201d that he had nothing to do with the killing. Aides have said Trump has been looking for ways to avoid pinning the blame on Mohammed, a close ally who plays a central role in Trump\u2019s Middle East policy.\n\nThat goal has been complicated by shifting, contradictory stories from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and the emergence of evidence pointing to Mohammed, including the recording, which was provided by Turkey and captures Khashoggi being killed by a Saudi hit team moments after entering the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\n\u201cWe have the tape. I don\u2019t want to hear the tape. No reason for me to hear the tape,\u201d Trump said in the Fox interview, which was recorded Friday and aired Sunday. He described it as \u201ca suffering tape\u201d and told Fox host Chris Wallace, \u201cI know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it . . . . It was very violent, very vicious and terrible.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump demurred when Wallace asked about Mohammed\u2019s role in the killing and whether the crown prince may have been lying to Trump about his lack of involvement.\n\n\u201cWell, will anybody really know?\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But, at the same time, we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department announced last week that it was imposing sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals it said were involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nThe interview marks another instance of Trump openly casting doubt on the conclusions of American intelligence agencies. At a July summit in Helsinki with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, Trump appeared to side with the Russian leader over U.S. intelligence officials on the matter of Moscow\u2019s interference in U.S. elections. Trump further muddied his stance in later comments on the issue.\n\nIn the case of Khashoggi, the CIA concluded after examining multiple sources of intelligence that Mohammed ordered the assassination. The intelligence included a phone call in which the prince\u2019s brother, Khalid bin Salman, urged Khashoggi to visit the consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents he needed for his impending marriage to a Turkish woman. Khalid, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, assured Khashoggi that he would be safe, people familiar with the matter told The Post last week.\n\nThe Saudi government has acknowledged communications between Khashoggi and Khalid but said they never discussed \u201canything related to going to Turkey.\u201d\n\nSince the killing, the Saudis have offered multiple explanations for what happened at the consulate. Last week, the Saudi public prosecutor blamed the operation on a rogue band of operatives who were sent to Istanbul to return Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia. The prosecutor announced charges against 11 alleged participants and said he would seek the death penalty against five of them.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials have said repeatedly that they were determined to get to the bottom of the matter and attribute responsibility even to the highest levels of the Saudi government, but the administration has been waiting to see whom the Saudis themselves would hold responsible.\n\nTrump said Saturday that he had been briefed by CIA Director Gina Haspel about the agency\u2019s assessment of the killing and that a \u201cvery full report\u201d on \u201cwho caused it, and who did it\u201d would be delivered Tuesday. It was unclear whether such a report exists and what it might say.\n\nThe sanctions the Treasury Department announced last week against the 17 Saudis were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which empowers the United States to target human rights abusers abroad. The sanctions freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit Americans from dealing with the 17.\n\nKey U.S. lawmakers have said the sanctions do not go far enough. On Sunday, several Republican senators demanded accountability at the highest levels of the Saudi leadership.\n\nIn an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) took perhaps the hardest line, calling the crown prince \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cunhinged.\u201d Graham said it was \u201cimpossible for me to believe\u201d that Mohammed knew nothing about the plot to kill Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cIf he is going to be the face and the voice of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,\u201d Graham said, adding: \u201cFrom the legislative branch side, we\u2019re going to do as much as we can, as hard as we can, to send a signal to the world.\u201d\n\nSens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) echoed that view. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Flake, a frequent Trump critic who is retiring in January, said \u201cit looks more and more like the truth is that the crown prince was involved, that he likely ordered it.\u201d\n\nPaul noted on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that U.S. intelligence indicates Khalid called Khashoggi at his brother\u2019s direction. \u201cI think the evidence is overwhelming that the crown prince was involved,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe need to punish who ordered this \u2014 who\u2019s in charge.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also ramped up their calls for Trump to take a stronger stance. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who will be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee in the next Congress, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the president \u201cneeds to listen to what our intelligence community has to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe danger to the U.S. is if we act too precipitously and the House of Saud should fall, that would be completely destabilizing of the region, and we don\u2019t know what would follow,\u201d Schiff said. But he added that it is \u201cvitally important\u201d that the Trump administration \u201cnot allow itself to become part of any Saudi coverup.\u201d\n\nAt the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, where he was speaking as part of a bipartisan Senate delegation, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Saturday that Saudi statements about the case were a \u201crepeated set of lies.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi was a Virginia resident, and Kaine said that he has met with some of the journalist\u2019s children. \u201cThere has to be accountability for this,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it will involve some fundamental reevaluation of U.S.-Saudi relations.\u201d\n\nWith frustration mounting, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation Thursday that would impose tougher sanctions on Saudi Arabia, including a blanket embargo on the sale of arms to Riyadh for offensive purposes and a ban on U.S. refueling of Saudi planes engaged in Yemen\u2019s brutal civil war.\n\nKaine said some form of legislation was \u201clikely to be taken up after Thanksgiving on the floor of the Senate,\u201d but a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment.\n\nIn a separate appearance at the Halifax forum, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked what effect a freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia would have on U.S. military operations and objectives in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has been an important partner for regional security in the past, and I expect it will be in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir cooperation, their interoperability, in my judgment, is a good thing.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Dunford noted that the United States has a number of allies in the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East. \u201cWorking forward,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will listen carefully to whatever the policy is in light of recent events.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Halifax.

They\u2019re expected to go with Lamar Jackson over Robert Griffin III against the Bengals, according to multiple reports.\n\nGriffin has only played in five games, all with the Browns, since the end of the 2014 season. Jackson was a first-round draft pick last spring, Baltimore\u2019s choice with the 32nd pick. Flacco, who is not expected to require surgery, is officially listed as doubtful.\n\nEagles face must-win vs. Saints: The Saints came stunningly close to advancing to the NFC championship game last January, so it\u2019s no surprise that good things were expected of them this year.\n\nAlthough there was the season-opening, 48-40 stumble against Tampa Bay, the Saints have been crushing anyone and everyone in their path. They take an 8-1 record into the game against the Eagles and their offense has scored 51 and 45 points over the last two weeks for a total of 96 points that are the most over two games in the team\u2019s history.\n\nThey\u2019re also clicking on defense and had their best game of the season last week, holding the Bengals to 14 points. The defense has kept big plays to a minimum and the secondary is improving, with Eli Apple adjusting to his new team and Marshon Lattimore playing well.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Drew Brees.\n\nDrew Brees isn't under pressure often, but still delivers when he is. pic.twitter.com/iHkW3EoZuB \u2014 Pro Football Focus (@PFF) November 13, 2018\n\nLook for the Saints to wear white uniforms because Coach Sean Payton lost a golf bet to Eagles Coach Doug Pederson last summer. \u201cWe wanted to liven up the match, and we decided to bet and we chose jersey colors,\u201d Pederson said (via Golfweek). \u201cThree holes into it, ended up beating him, and that was it.\u201d\n\nLotsa Luck: Is it the spiced raccoon cheeks? The flattened snake strips? The squirrel oil? Actually, Andrew Luck\u2019s resurgence is partly the offensive line, partly Coach Frank Reich, partly the improved running game and more than partly his own restored health. The early days of the season, when everyone worried about the Colts quarterback\u2019s surgically repaired shoulder, are gone and Luck has passed for three touchdowns in six consecutive games. That\u2019s the fourth longest streak since 1950 and according to NFL Research trails only Tom Brady (10 games), Peyton Manning (eight) and Dan Marino (seven). And Luck hasn\u2019t been sacked in four games, a streak that is the fifth-longest in NFL history. This week, though, Luck faces the Titans, who are second in the AFC South at 5-4 and have the NFL\u2019s top scoring defense (giving up only 16.8 points per game).\n\nIt\u2019s go or go-home time: Here, in one tweet, is why week really, really matters.\n\nRecent history says teams looking for a Super Bowl run should start now.\n\n\n\nIn the previous 3 seasons the teams to play in the Super Bowl went a combined 34-7 from Week 11-17. \u2014 Evan Kaplan (@EpKap) November 18, 2018\n\n\n\nTop story lines\n\nCoach Condi?

It is a good feeling to have in the locker room and you see some growth. You see the improvement.\u201d\n\nWhat the Giants (3-7) are doing is making plays and finishing. The running game has picked up and it\u2019s opened up the passing game, and the defense is forcing turnovers. The group intercepted four passes in sending the Bucs (3-7) to their fourth straight loss with linebacker Alec Ogletree returning one 15 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cI just know that we\u2019re playing better and I just love to see these guys in here after the game with smiles on their faces,\u201d said receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who caught an 8-yard touchdown pass. \u201cWe just put it all together, so it\u2019s always a lot more fun when you win.\u201d\n\nPlaying in the NFC East also helps increase the belief the Giants are not dead.\n\nWashington, which fell to Houston and lost quarterback Alex Smith for the season to a broken leg, leads the division with a 6-4 record. No other team has a winning record.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, there are a lot of things we\u2019ve got to get better at, but if we can just keep battling and fighting, who knows?\u201d coach Pat Shurmur said. \u201cThat would be a fun thing for everybody to write about.\u201d\n\nThe Giants never trailed as Manning found a wide-open Barkley on a 6-yard TD pass on the opening series, and the No. 2 overall pick in the draft scored from 5 yards out on the second possession to give New York the lead for good.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finishing games and we\u2019re finishing drives, and that\u2019s what we weren\u2019t doing in the first half of the season,\u201d Barkley said of his first winning streak as a pro.\n\nTampa Bay made things interesting after Jameis Winston replaced a turnover-plagued Ryan Fitzpatrick in the third quarter and led four touchdown drives. The last score came on a 41-yard pass to Mike Evans with 2:22 to play and got the Bucs within 38-35.\n\nThe Bucs got the ball back at their 20 with 23 seconds to play, but B.W. Webb intercepted Winston\u2019s long throw down the sideline to ice the win.\n\nAfter Tampa Bay got within 31-28, Manning, whose only incompletion came on a short pass to Barkley late in the second quarter, connected with tight end Evan Engram on a 54-yard pass and run on the second play after the kickoff, and Barkley capped the drive with a 2-yard run with 3:52 to play.\n\nThe Winston-to-Evans TD pass closed the gap to three points again.\n\n\u201cIt hurts me when I have to see my team lose a game because I turned the ball over,\u201d Winston said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure it hurts Fitz.

We have to find a way to win.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick scored on a fourth-down 1-yard run for the Tampa Bay, which squandered a chance to score on its opening possession when Fitzpatrick was stopped on a quarterback sneak inside the Giants\u2019 5.\n\nEvans recovered a fumble in the end zone in the third quarter to start the comeback, Peyton Barber tallied from 5 yards out and Adam Humphrie s and Evans caught TD passes in the fourth quarter to get the Bucs within three points twice.\n\nWinston finished 12 of 16 for 199 yards and two touchdowns.

(Sam McNeil, File/Associated Press)\n\nPETRA, Jordan \u2014 In ancient times, Arab tribesmen dug diversion tunnels to protect their low-lying trading post of Petra against desert flash floods. More than two millennia later, an alarm system warns visitors if flood water rushes toward what has become Jordan\u2019s main tourist attraction.\n\nEarlier this month, the alarms were activated for the first time, said Hussein al-Hasanat of the Petra Development & Tourism Region Authority. Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face.\n\nHundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said.\n\nAmateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra\u2019s main draw, as guides urged them to hurry. Later, visitors were seen standing on a higher patch near the Treasury as knee-high water poured through the canyon.\n\nElsewhere in Jordan, such alarms are still missing. Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November.\n\nThe last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan\u2019s Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above a certain level.\n\nOn Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority\u2019s control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra.\n\nThe network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra.\n\nOmar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan.\n\nHe said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas.\n\n\u201cNow towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,\u201d Dajani said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nJosh Norman appeared to be outraged by a questionable officiating call in the waning moments of the Washington Redskins\u2019 23-21 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday. In the locker room after the game, that fury gave way to disbelief.\n\nThe Redskins were trailing by two points late in the fourth quarter, with the Texans were facing third-and-five at the Washington 37-yard line. After dropping back to pass, Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson scrambled for two yards to set up fourth down. The Texans would have had to decide between a long field-goal attempt or a punt with just under two minutes remaining in the game.\n\nHowever, Norman was flagged for defensive holding on the opposite side of the field, giving Houston a first down that significantly cut into the Redskins\u2019s comeback chances. Norman had his hands on receiver DeAndre Hopkins, but seemingly not enough to affect the route. There was a pull on Hopkins\u2019 jersey at the end of the play, but it was inconsequential with Watson running with the ball at the time.\n\n[Exactly 33 years since his own gruesome injury, Joe Theismann \u2018just so upset\u2019 for Alex Smith]\n\nNorman said that he believed he played perfect technique and didn\u2019t understand the call.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Norman said. \u201cYou play defense and those plays, gosh, man, you just have to shake your head. A guy like that, you try and shut them out in the second half. ... One-on-one with a phenomenal athlete like he is, all-pro, me an all-pro, and we were going after each other. Dog against dog, and we got out there and got scrappy. A guy like that is a vet, he pushes you by and you are going to hit him, slap him and release. It was perfect. [Then] the play was over and went to the other side and then I stopped and turned around and see a yellow flag. Oh, my gosh.\u201d\n\nAfter the first down, the Texans moved the ball to the Redskins\u2019 27-yard line with three Lamar Miller runs to drain the clock and force Washington to use its last two timeouts. Kicker Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn missed a 45-yard field goal attempt, leaving the Redskins with 52 seconds left on the clock and no timeouts. The final drive moved to the Houston 45-yard line and ended in a missed 63-yard field goal attempt by Dustin Hopkins.\n\nRedskins Coach Jay Gruden was brief when asked if he received an explanation of the call.\n\n\u201cI never get any of the explanations,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-washington-post", "name": "The Washington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Trending: Heaven forbid Ocasio-Cortez not look like your idea of 'struggling' - Washington Post", "description": "Washington Post Trending: Heaven forbid Ocasio-Cortez not look like your idea of 'struggling' Washington Post @IanKarmel, joking about the buzz surrounding Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after reporter Eddie Scarry tweeted a photo of the congresswoman-elect in the \u2026", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/2018/11/19/trending-heaven-forbid-ocasio-cortez-not-look-like-your-idea-struggling/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T00:17:23Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Express News Editor\n\nA few tips for ya: Don\u2019t finance-shame somebody and absolutely do not take creepy pics of women to critique them.\n\n\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., exits a Democratic Caucus meeting in the basement of the Capitol on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.
